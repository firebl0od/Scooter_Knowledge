[2024-01-27T21:28:34] Happy Giraffe: I would diy make bigger frame from this with some tracks being ran by some QS mid drive if I had the spare money
[2024-01-27T21:29:09] haku: now thats an idea! i wish it snowed where im from 😂
[2024-01-27T21:29:11] Happy Giraffe: Would even be legal because its meant for "offroad use" and cant be put into other categories and has a wide wheel
[2024-01-27T21:30:34] Happy Giraffe: Some high KV action there?🤔
[2024-01-27T21:31:50] Tommy ª: bruh
[2024-01-27T21:31:51] Tommy ª: <video_file>
[2024-01-27T21:32:04] Tommy ª: i just installed win10 for 1st time and i got this after all night updating
[2024-01-27T21:32:55] haku: oh no! is it legit windows 10? 😭
[2024-01-27T21:34:31] Tommy ª: yea i just got a lot of updates, after that explorer just resets 😭
[2024-01-27T21:34:48] Tommy ª: i cant make work the 2nd gpu
[2024-01-27T21:34:52] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-27T21:35:02] Tommy ª: that is why im still on win7
[2024-01-27T21:36:12] haku: looks like drivers but im not a pro so idk
[2024-01-27T21:37:11] haku: i want to do linux. but im clueless on computers. i hear its open source
[2024-01-27T21:57:52] haku: @Happy_Giraffe can you turn a drill press into a lathe machine. i know ive seen conversions but i think its a all in one machine
[2024-01-27T21:58:33] Jason Nelson: I would want to have a battery big enough to supply a heating source to warm the battery compartment, it's probably not practical
[2024-01-27T21:59:35] Jason Nelson: Much lower output 60v battery
[2024-01-27T22:05:31] Paolo ⁭: Why trash? It works good
[2024-01-27T22:07:00] Jason Nelson: I heard it eats aluminum
[2024-01-27T22:09:15] Jason Nelson: I think at the temperatures produced it also bakes and becomes clumps in your tire throwing of your balance
[2024-01-27T22:09:23] Jason Nelson: I have also seen this in cars that use slime
[2024-01-27T22:10:49] haku: i see. ill test it on tubed rims. i think its supposed to be only used with tubes
[2024-01-27T22:11:05] Paolo ⁭: Scrivi nel gruppo off topic, qui é solo per vesc
[2024-01-27T22:11:31] haku: ive already got a bunch of flats on 20x4 tires
[2024-01-27T22:11:45] Jason Nelson: I used milkit for a while, I don't use anything right now but armor dilloz is supposed to be top on the market. I had bad luck with them, maybe the puncture was too large
[2024-01-27T22:12:49] Jason Nelson: I don't know about slime but milkit is latex based
[2024-01-27T22:25:34] Mirono escooters: I remember It's called "armor-dilloz" Apperantly good sealant
[2024-01-27T22:27:53] cihan: But these closed ones aren't sealed at all. That's just a simple plastic cap with a thin metal plate under it, not a true sealing. Does SKF, NKT or any other quality bearing with rubber seal seal enough to prevent water leak inside? It wasn't the case with stock bearings, there was no glue like thing or anything else to seal the cap. This is exactly how mine opened when I gently forced the cap pop out. https://youtu.be/9TXwfr1ydoU?t=1m47s
[2024-01-27T22:33:03] cihan: Aside from alignment difficulty compared to cartridge bearing, cup cone bearings still seem to be advantageous yet they are very very old type of bearing.
[2024-01-27T22:41:27] Mirono escooters: Old doesn't mean bad
[2024-01-27T22:41:32] Mirono escooters: Every bearing has its purpose
[2024-01-27T23:14:21] Happy Giraffe: Chuck too shitty for that, not supported enough
[2024-01-27T23:15:24] Happy Giraffe: Old bearings lasted ages on those 1960-1970 bicycles
[2024-01-27T23:20:10] haku: coolest thing ive seen lately. a toyota tercrell converted to a pickup truck
[2024-01-27T23:20:33] haku: the thing is fast too
[2024-01-27T23:21:53] haku: love creative stuff like this. not just following the trend
[2024-01-27T23:23:46] Mirono escooters: Merika laws do be more forgiving
[2024-01-27T23:23:47] haku: there are all in one machines yea?
[2024-01-27T23:24:15] haku: its a classic vehicle plate too so no need smog checks haha
[2024-01-27T23:25:21] haku: he literally just cut the hatch and turned it into a pickup bed
[2024-01-28T00:25:50] cihan: I think main problem with cartridge is sealing, it takes water inside easily, I have no idea about name brands though. I don't know why they don't air seal it completely.
[2024-01-28T00:33:17] Mirono escooters: Impossible
[2024-01-28T00:35:48] Finn: G30 with blade and 10s5p. Topspeed arround 45kmh with 10A fieldweaking
[2024-01-28T00:36:56] Finn: <photos/photo_12541@28-01-2024_00-36-56.jpg>
[2024-01-28T00:37:09] Finn: Only 100A phase but theres more potential
[2024-01-28T00:43:26] sombre_enfant: @PaoloWu do fighter 10+ fit 11" 70h 142mm dropout
[2024-01-28T00:49:04] Finn: If my motor gets saturated even at 100A what option should i enable?
[2024-01-28T00:49:22] Finn: <photos/photo_12542@28-01-2024_00-49-22.jpg>
[2024-01-28T00:54:13] cihan: Possibly so)
[2024-01-28T00:57:03] Konstantin: U can try use hall sensors at hi speed
[2024-01-28T00:57:24] Konstantin: No switch to senrless
[2024-01-28T00:58:02] Mirono escooters: I'd love to see a air tight bearing xd
[2024-01-28T00:58:46] Mirono escooters: Try Ortega observer
[2024-01-28T01:32:21] sombre_enfant: Seems decent
[2024-01-28T01:37:00] Tommy ª: What controller?
[2024-01-28T01:46:53] Finn: Ubox
[2024-01-28T01:47:03] Finn: Yeah only. We set the amps wrong
[2024-01-28T01:47:06] Finn: Blade
[2024-01-28T01:47:32] Finn: Weirdly it automatically sets it to sensorless even i made the hall calibration
[2024-01-28T01:47:49] Rose: Hey there 丂Ɋㄥ乂, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-28T01:47:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Finn has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-28T01:48:14] Tommy ª: Casually for +100amps Ortega works great with me
[2024-01-28T01:48:17] Rose: Hey there 丂Ɋㄥ乂, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-28T01:49:05] Konstantin: <photos/photo_12543@28-01-2024_01-49-05.jpg>
[2024-01-28T01:50:34] Finn: Okay
[2024-01-28T01:50:55] Finn: Sensor mode to hall right?
[2024-01-28T01:51:01] Konstantin: Y
[2024-01-28T01:51:39] Finn: I set foc observer to mxlemming
[2024-01-28T01:52:11] Finn: Also current coupling is it relevant? And what does it change
[2024-01-28T01:52:33] Finn: <photos/photo_12544@28-01-2024_01-52-33.jpg>
[2024-01-28T02:25:23] Finn: At 150A phase easy wheelie when standing still. Crazy what 10s 5p can do😂
[2024-01-28T02:25:23] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Finn has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-28T02:40:41] sombre_enfant: Bemf
[2024-01-28T03:18:11] haku: im really considering this setup boys. need to find smaller forks. and ive talked to a chineese company that can machine stainless steel affordably.
[2024-01-28T03:25:23] haku: just add a triangle and 2 bolts here
[2024-01-28T03:26:13] francois schempers: talk to happy too ;) and you may also considere just buying monorim fork, I did a build like that with them

[2024-01-28T03:30:26] francois schempers: ahah x)
[2024-01-28T07:35:34] cihan: Maybe they make the caps in a way water flows down when rain drops hit on the caps in future. :)
[2024-01-28T07:35:42] Unknown: 👌
[2024-01-28T11:11:28] Mirono escooters: Usually mxlemming is less tolerant to saturation
[2024-01-28T11:11:37] Mirono escooters: And bemf does nothing for our scoots
[2024-01-28T11:55:40] rosheee: 130
[2024-01-28T11:59:57] Mirono escooters: Can cook a egg on That
[2024-01-28T11:59:59] rosheee: yes
[2024-01-28T12:00:07] rosheee: mirono pls tell us
[2024-01-28T12:00:17] rosheee: what can it handle?
[2024-01-28T12:04:10] Mirono escooters: I don't know? I'm not saying you are wrong I'm just saying das ist hot
[2024-01-28T12:04:31] Mirono escooters: Whatever MOSFET specifications are in datasheet 🤷😜
[2024-01-28T12:36:52] Franchesco Carofano: <video_file>
[2024-01-28T12:41:05] Franchesco Carofano: yes those are pretty
[2024-01-28T12:45:19] Face de Pin Sucé: What vesc are you running?
[2024-01-28T12:46:03] Franchesco Carofano: The truth is that they are worth it, it's like when you use a CST tire and you switch to the slick PMT ones, something completely changes.
[2024-01-28T12:46:38] Franchesco Carofano: 75200 de 200ah
[2024-01-28T12:48:08] Finn: Y splitter for 20s5p
[2024-01-28T12:48:58] Franchesco Carofano: what colors as seen
[2024-01-28T12:49:18] Mirono escooters: For series?
[2024-01-28T12:49:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Good 👍
[2024-01-28T12:51:12] Franchesco Carofano: I'm missing some things like the sq8 and the spark gaps to turn them off and on but I take them straight to the current and on a not so long straight line I managed to get 116.9, it seems to me that it's easy to get to 120km
[2024-01-28T12:51:39] Finn: Yes
[2024-01-28T12:51:40] Finn: 10awg
[2024-01-28T12:51:50] Finn: <photos/photo_12556@28-01-2024_12-51-50.jpg>
[2024-01-28T12:52:54] Mirono escooters: Awesome
[2024-01-28T12:55:50] Finn: Doing all the works for maybe dual
[2024-01-28T12:56:10] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2024-01-28T13:00:59] haku: is it possible to have 2 different windings on your scoot? like 22x3 in the back and 33x2 in the front?
[2024-01-28T13:01:13] Mirono escooters: Far from recommended/optimal
[2024-01-28T13:02:44] haku: will vescs be able to handle it properly?
[2024-01-28T13:03:02] Gabe Enzo: You're looking at a plethora of things that will go wrong
[2024-01-28T13:03:13] Gabe Enzo: most likely not they're different KV
[2024-01-28T13:04:28] haku: ive seen some folk run 75h motors in the back and 50h infront. different windings inthink
[2024-01-28T13:04:37] Mirono escooters: Btw 100* max for regular operation Above that need lower power as mos specifications
[2024-01-28T13:04:53] Mirono escooters: Well, many morons out there
[2024-01-28T13:08:16] Jan: Please just make good cooling solutions so that this question doesnt need to be answered 😬😬
[2024-01-28T13:09:38] haku: i think 100/100 vesc will be limited when it reaches a certain temp. thats what i was told by amy. 70c i think
[2024-01-28T13:11:00] haku: can anyone verify this?
[2024-01-28T13:12:48] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_12557@28-01-2024_13-12-48.jpg>

[2024-01-28T13:14:41] haku: please post this on offtopic bro
[2024-01-28T13:16:18] haku: mine went up to 70c when i did not use thermal paste. its still gets hot but its better
[2024-01-28T13:16:20] Jan: Liquid nitrogen 😬
[2024-01-28T13:16:27] Jan: Lets go hahaha
[2024-01-28T13:19:04] Franchesco Carofano: I don't have the temperature to see but I keep touching them and they stay good they don't heat up so much they stay cool I don't keep it stuck all the time I hit the accelerator hard and let it go and don't let it break today are a new test I'm walking a 60km route one way and back I will try better
[2024-01-28T13:20:14] Mirono escooters: Hopefully
[2024-01-28T13:20:29] Mirono escooters: Hey it's a wurst case scenario
[2024-01-28T13:58:24] Paolo ⁭: 1zuna said flipsky cooling is better
[2024-01-28T14:00:37] Jan: The aluboxes are legendary though
[2024-01-28T14:01:14] Jan: Impossible to warm up, never 5deg over ambient
[2024-01-28T14:11:05] Paolo ⁭: Give it to @SibClimb in track and will see ahah
[2024-01-28T14:16:52] Jan: Le Mans probably there
[2024-01-28T14:17:46] Paolo ⁭: U fit 85200 without heatsink? How you removed their shit glue?
[2024-01-28T14:55:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tube type does ,since its for tube Yellow marked is for tubeless
[2024-01-28T15:02:00] Happy Giraffe: Didnt save my tire with tube😁
[2024-01-28T15:02:54] Happy Giraffe: I like to keep mosfet under 70°c, if it goes 70+ theres some sort of error in your cooling setup or you are pulling too much from a too little esc
[2024-01-28T15:23:02] Mirono escooters: Yeah fair point You wouldn't ever need to go over 100. Let alone 130
[2024-01-28T15:23:06] Mirono escooters: Shortens lifespan
[2024-01-28T15:29:08] sombre_enfant: Hi guys Do anybody could adapt eye4 display to vesc also make the apps works im willing to pay
[2024-01-28T15:32:00] sombre_enfant: I can get them easier also they have Bluetooth
[2024-01-28T15:42:06] Mirono escooters: Yep same like Bluetooth doesn't work with Xiaomi dash
[2024-01-28T15:42:35] Mirono escooters: Temps rise quicker then speed
[2024-01-28T15:56:59] Mirono escooters: Defenitely
[2024-01-28T16:06:31] sombre_enfant: It can tho
[2024-01-28T16:09:23] Mirono escooters: No one programmed it so
[2024-01-28T16:14:05] sombre_enfant: Camilo did
[2024-01-28T16:14:39] Mirono escooters: Why doesn't anyone use?
[2024-01-28T16:15:37] sombre_enfant: Idk
[2024-01-28T16:15:58] Tommy ª: a friend is reprgramming the m365 display, they maded work the bt controller for his own app but his project is closed, so, idk imagine programming the bt module in display for use as vesc bluetooth
[2024-01-28T16:16:01] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-28T16:21:56] Mirono escooters: That was our point
[2024-01-28T16:23:59] Tommy ª: he needed to get full uart (+1wire) from the display bruh, at this point im going to find a friendly prgrammer (impossible) and make the display firmware from 0 fully oriented to vesc
[2024-01-28T16:29:13] Mirono escooters: 30 bucks if ya do
[2024-01-28T16:36:13] Franchesco Carofano: Hay le saque 119.6 cuerpo parado calculo 125 123 con postura
[2024-01-28T16:37:16] Tommy ª: 3 baterias de essential= 60km a 40
[2024-01-28T16:38:07] Tommy ª: actually im searching for a testing display only for that the 1zuna script is ok, but relies in the internal commands of the display i want more things from that
[2024-01-28T16:38:39] Franchesco Carofano: now I'm loading to try again
[2024-01-28T16:39:16] Tommy ª: ponele un cargador de hoverboard como el mio, 15 horas cargando 😂
[2024-01-28T16:40:27] Franchesco Carofano: Jajajjajajajaja
[2024-01-28T16:40:41] Franchesco Carofano: Tommy le puse uno de 5 ah allí
[2024-01-28T16:40:50] Franchesco Carofano: Quede con 78 una tirada de 30 km
[2024-01-28T16:41:07] Paolo ⁭: Only English please
[2024-01-28T16:41:37] Tommy ª: im gonna to get funa
[2024-01-28T16:41:38] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-28T16:56:10] Face de Pin Sucé: That is because you slow ❤️
[2024-01-28T16:56:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Accurate
[2024-01-28T17:00:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Weird, let me look
[2024-01-28T17:02:58] Face de Pin Sucé: now should be fixed, for VESC I did wrong with the expiracy date
[2024-01-28T17:23:18] Jan: Haha we will see
[2024-01-28T17:29:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh yeah, can't wait to see you guys on track 💥
[2024-01-28T17:34:41] Happy Giraffe: I fuck you all with my 2000w 48v
[2024-01-28T17:34:58] Happy Giraffe: Gonna test 0-40kmh today😂
[2024-01-28T17:35:39] Happy Giraffe: Btw, you guys ever thought about using the QS90 motors🤔 Might reach some insane rpm with field weakening
[2024-01-28T18:01:06] Gabe Enzo: Isnf that only 1kw
[2024-01-28T18:01:15] Gabe Enzo: 7kw burst doesn't mean anything
[2024-01-28T18:01:41] Happy Giraffe: When have wattage ratings mattered last time🌚
[2024-01-28T18:05:25] Gabe Enzo: Idk, when the manufacturer actually states it it's usually a different story.
[2024-01-28T18:06:23] Gabe Enzo: 11s8p going into the pro 2 in the coming weeks.
[2024-01-28T18:06:30] Mirono escooters: Jezus
[2024-01-28T18:06:44] puneDir: Not 20s
[2024-01-28T18:06:46] puneDir: You said 20
[2024-01-28T18:06:51] Gabe Enzo: other 9s will be external
[2024-01-28T18:06:54] Gabe Enzo: Series.
[2024-01-28T18:07:06] Gabe Enzo: balance wires routed outside
[2024-01-28T18:07:12] Happy Giraffe: Its a heavy duty IPM motor that cools better than hubs, also has reduction in gearing so less stress = less heat and more torque
[2024-01-28T18:07:14] puneDir: Shit
[2024-01-28T18:07:20] Gabe Enzo: I'll make it look good.
[2024-01-28T18:07:22] Gabe Enzo: Clean
[2024-01-28T18:07:39] puneDir: I turned 16s6p to 14s6p
[2024-01-28T18:07:44] puneDir: Going to use for zero
[2024-01-28T18:07:56] Gabe Enzo: wrong sticker
[2024-01-28T18:07:57] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2024-01-28T18:08:22] Gabe Enzo: Pro is one BMS
[2024-01-28T18:09:15] puneDir: What can i do if i have extreme anxiety in plane
[2024-01-28T18:09:46] puneDir: (i love aviation and i have pretty much knowledge about aviation but for some reason i cant control my stress level on plane)
[2024-01-28T18:10:57] Unknown: Alprazolam
[2024-01-28T18:11:49] Happy Giraffe: Do you believe in facts or feelings?
[2024-01-28T18:12:58] Happy Giraffe: If facts, then planes much safer than cars. Theres no drunks or drug addicts flying next to you and your captain propably a pilot from Star Wars Death Star mission😂
[2024-01-28T18:13:55] Unknown: He need to take it 1 hour before fly
[2024-01-28T18:14:14] Unknown: 1mg is enough
[2024-01-28T18:14:21] puneDir: Ik but
[2024-01-28T18:14:24] Happy Giraffe: Ask if a fly maiden can take you in her lap like a mommy
[2024-01-28T18:14:51] puneDir: Im actually pretty much in aviation but concerta made me have anxiety
[2024-01-28T18:15:02] puneDir: Zero
[2024-01-28T18:15:12] Unknown: Xanax is for anxiety
[2024-01-28T18:15:19] Gabe Enzo: Not a real answer lol
[2024-01-28T18:16:14] Happy Giraffe: If you know theres nothing to worry about then pretty much wasting your time with all the panicking
[2024-01-28T18:16:18] Gabe Enzo: Yeah same I had to stop using it
[2024-01-28T18:16:36] Gabe Enzo: I took a giant dose before a flight before
[2024-01-28T18:16:41] Gabe Enzo: like 4 pills
[2024-01-28T18:16:44] Happy Giraffe: Better think of something else like scooters and sinewaves😁
[2024-01-28T18:17:02] Unknown: It is very much
[2024-01-28T18:17:17] Gabe Enzo: I used to take 8mg to get faded
[2024-01-28T18:17:20] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-01-28T18:17:26] Unknown: Woww
[2024-01-28T18:17:43] Unknown: Abuse
[2024-01-28T18:18:01] Unknown: you can get drunk
[2024-01-28T18:18:10] puneDir: Drugs and alcohol is abuse
[2024-01-28T18:18:28] Gabe Enzo: Getting drunk is quite literally drug abuse lol
[2024-01-28T18:18:36] Gabe Enzo: I drink and I say that
[2024-01-28T18:18:40] Gabe Enzo: I drink like 6x a month
[2024-01-28T18:18:50] Gabe Enzo: Getting out of hand so I had to stop.
[2024-01-28T18:18:56] Unknown: Or diazepam!
[2024-01-28T18:19:37] Gabe Enzo: Then go on scoots
[2024-01-28T18:19:55] Gabe Enzo: 2022 was crazy, or 2021.
[2024-01-28T18:55:45] Finn: 72 cells in 3L??
[2024-01-28T19:00:46] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_12562@28-01-2024_19-00-46.jpg>
[2024-01-28T19:04:07] Gabe Enzo: 3.5L or 4L
[2024-01-28T19:04:21] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-01-28T19:05:22] Gabe Enzo: I can do 3L but I don't feel like folding copper and making a loose pack
[2024-01-28T19:06:36] puneDir: If you make it holderless i will beat your ass up
[2024-01-28T19:07:13] Finn: Haha
[2024-01-28T19:08:10] Finn: This g30 from @sqlx1337 has 10s currently and does wheelies so easy with the blade motor. Its unbelievable
[2024-01-28T19:12:42] Gabe Enzo: Ew, no. I'm aware.
[2024-01-28T19:13:10] Gabe Enzo: Legal as 10s as well. crazy I wonder what dual 10s with fw would do?
[2024-01-28T19:13:18] Gabe Enzo: especially with 2 blade motors
[2024-01-28T19:13:22] Finn: Yeah
[2024-01-28T19:13:24] Finn: Crazy
[2024-01-28T19:13:30] Finn: It will be 72V
[2024-01-28T19:13:53] Gabe Enzo: Id keep it at 36v it's kinda retro awesome that way 😂
[2024-01-28T19:14:34] Finn: I also will do g30 with blade
[2024-01-28T19:15:09] Gabe Enzo: Ill be building another pro 2 with a blade soon.
[2024-01-28T19:15:52] Finn: Wanna have my battery?
[2024-01-28T19:16:09] Gabe Enzo: Nah, I'm going with 20s4p MH1
[2024-01-28T19:16:09] Finn: I really want to trasg my pro2
[2024-01-28T19:16:14] Finn: Hm ok
[2024-01-28T19:29:06] Happy Giraffe: MH "vdrop" 1
[2024-01-28T19:29:32] Happy Giraffe: No space for 21700?😳
[2024-01-28T19:34:47] Gabe Enzo: No this is another scooter
[2024-01-28T19:35:02] Gabe Enzo: My 20s8p is going into my clean pro 2 frame
[2024-01-28T19:35:10] Gabe Enzo: and MH1 Going into the scratchy pro 2 frame
[2024-01-28T19:35:17] Finn: Lg mg1
[2024-01-28T19:35:31] Gabe Enzo: Yes. I'm thinking of 16s5p to combat the V drop
[2024-01-28T19:35:38] Gabe Enzo: Or even 13s6p.
[2024-01-28T19:35:42] Finn: Or 21700
[2024-01-28T19:35:56] Gabe Enzo: I have to get rid of these cells 😂
[2024-01-28T19:36:04] Gabe Enzo: I don't waste good cells
[2024-01-28T19:36:13] Finn: Sell them to nkon
[2024-01-28T19:36:14] Finn: 😂😂
[2024-01-28T19:36:23] Gabe Enzo: They do that???
[2024-01-28T19:36:28] Finn: Ask them haha
[2024-01-28T19:36:34] Finn: I mean they have reclaimed
[2024-01-28T19:37:00] Gabe Enzo: Samsung 6A 21700 could be very nice. Or LISHEN LR21700 12A.
[2024-01-28T19:37:12] Gabe Enzo: Lishen would be PLENTY for a blade
[2024-01-28T19:37:35] Gabe Enzo: 48a constant at 72v that's about 3.5kw
[2024-01-28T19:38:36] Happy Giraffe: Rather have higher voltage and longer phase amps that way aswell
[2024-01-28T19:38:55] Happy Giraffe: No need for that much batt current
[2024-01-28T19:39:41] Happy Giraffe: Would get 100A phase amps upto 50% max speed thats plenty acceleration with 72v 50A
[2024-01-28T19:40:50] Konstantin: Lishen 4.0 (3c 12a), not bad cells... 1 man use them a lot of time + last time drain more, then 3c, they still alive :))
[2024-01-28T19:42:33] Gabe Enzo: True.
[2024-01-28T19:43:17] sombre_enfant: Shitty idea
[2024-01-28T19:43:35] Gabe Enzo: Not really.
[2024-01-28T19:43:43] Gabe Enzo: Other than more wire routing.
[2024-01-28T19:43:53] Gabe Enzo: Plus, it works.
[2024-01-28T19:44:08] Mirono escooters: Sad lishen totally disrespects 21mm
[2024-01-28T19:44:17] Mirono escooters: It's at this point 22700
[2024-01-28T19:44:28] Gabe Enzo: Moli does as well 😘
[2024-01-28T19:44:35] Gabe Enzo: 215700
[2024-01-28T19:44:42] Mirono escooters: Moli and lishen are top notch disrespecters
[2024-01-28T19:44:53] Mirono escooters: LG M58t also totally out of window
[2024-01-28T19:45:00] Gabe Enzo: It's how they sneak some extra amps in there
[2024-01-28T19:45:47] Mirono escooters: Samsung 50e with wrap 21.12 Very ok, cars use no wrap LG M58t 21.6 (wtf) without wrap 21.43 (come on) almost fucked my project p42A 21.34+- with wrap Lishen 21.4 Sigh
[2024-01-28T19:46:17] Gabe Enzo: I had a dream 2 nights ago that i got invited into the LISHEN headquarters and the founder gave me a single 5ah 50a cell to take home.
[2024-01-28T19:46:26] Gabe Enzo: I have no idea but this is what my dreams are like.
[2024-01-28T19:47:02] Mirono escooters: Impressive
[2024-01-28T19:47:23] Кирилл: Agree. LR2170LA very good for the price. LR2170LH will be better for the price for power purposes
[2024-01-28T19:47:27] Konstantin: I'm using in 1 setup Samsung 50g, very happy...
[2024-01-28T19:47:50] Mirono escooters: Btw this is why it sucks to have 3DP holders, always need to make tesfit pieces, so annoying. 🤦 And you need to calculate hole size In Design
[2024-01-28T19:49:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Honestly, if you willing to pay, you better buy a SmartDisplay 😂
[2024-01-28T19:49:32] Mirono escooters: Way better
[2024-01-28T19:49:34] Mirono escooters: Support the French
[2024-01-28T19:50:38] haku: swolemander turned out good with the cheap petg
[2024-01-28T19:51:01] haku: this prints like pla.
[2024-01-28T19:51:42] haku: yes. this cheap brand fixed it
[2024-01-28T19:52:05] Happy Giraffe: Wish I had a bambu...ender cant print that fine of a detail as machine is fucked usually in one way or another😅
[2024-01-28T19:53:20] haku: bambu is good for detailed toys but for engineer prototyping ender should be fine yea?
[2024-01-28T19:54:17] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_12565@28-01-2024_19-54-17.jpg>
[2024-01-28T19:54:34] Mirono escooters: Hehe, same xD
[2024-01-28T19:54:41] Mirono escooters: Tronxy 🔥 (joke)
[2024-01-28T19:55:09] Happy Giraffe: Bambu better as its faster
[2024-01-28T19:55:35] Mirono escooters: Do you have problems with my 35mm/s belt printer?! 😡
[2024-01-28T19:55:40] Mirono escooters: He's trying his best
[2024-01-28T19:55:51] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2024-01-28T19:56:15] Happy Giraffe: For real the creality heatblock was glued inside so cant adjust it and nozzle has gap with heatbrake that leaks😅
[2024-01-28T19:56:34] Mirono escooters: Time for spider hotend
[2024-01-28T19:57:00] Happy Giraffe: Also it randomly leaves small notches on print surface that fan guard hits and knocks off🙈
[2024-01-28T19:57:20] Happy Giraffe: Cant really tune it better at settings either
[2024-01-28T19:57:42] Happy Giraffe: For simple shapes its ok but tried printing the brake disc prototype and failed
[2024-01-28T19:58:39] Happy Giraffe: This one, wont adhere to bed and still nozzle losing pressure due to leak and fanahroud kicks parts off due to unadjustable nozzle height😭
[2024-01-28T19:59:50] haku: i thought you had a klipper ender?
[2024-01-28T20:01:09] haku: that looks super fun
[2024-01-28T20:01:20] Mirono escooters: Glass time
[2024-01-28T20:01:32] Mirono escooters: Bet my tronxy print it
[2024-01-28T20:01:36] Mirono escooters: I need
[2024-01-28T20:01:38] Happy Giraffe: Professional FW Marlin
[2024-01-28T20:02:06] Happy Giraffe: PEI texture is so nice on PETG, but PLA some issues even with 70°c bed...
[2024-01-28T20:02:25] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I should just stop using PLA anyways😅
[2024-01-28T20:02:31] Mirono escooters: Glass works on both :)
[2024-01-28T20:02:43] Mirono escooters: Idk what texture can be better then a glass like mirror
[2024-01-28T20:02:56] Mirono escooters: Heh, I use pla purely for the simplicity for cosplay
[2024-01-28T20:03:16] Happy Giraffe: I wonder CF PLA vs. CF PETG
[2024-01-28T20:03:46] Mirono escooters: Cf pla? Why tf?
[2024-01-28T20:04:03] Mirono escooters: I got cf petg and normal petg I do plan some tension tests But the machine at school broke 🤦
[2024-01-28T20:04:30] Mirono escooters: But I can say it is good Since it holds up my way to heavy moped for months
[2024-01-28T20:04:56] Mirono escooters: I printed a spacer for a stand out of it, and it takes sideways and front loads (when unloading from stand) and well, doesn't even budge. :)
[2024-01-28T20:08:23] haku: im comparing my 2 black petg. left is Elegoo right is overture. the elegoo seems to have gloss like surface. i wonder if its mixed with pla pellets to cheapen the price.
[2024-01-28T20:08:46] Happy Giraffe: Gonna be tanky aswell
[2024-01-28T20:09:28] Happy Giraffe: PETG usually glossy for me
[2024-01-28T20:10:27] Mirono escooters: *melts with sun*
[2024-01-28T20:14:31] Happy Giraffe: Indoor parts
[2024-01-28T20:14:57] Happy Giraffe: Petg cf bit expensive at 30€ kg
[2024-01-28T20:15:33] Mirono escooters: 18€ gst3D
[2024-01-28T20:15:48] Mirono escooters: Every change he sees he is here with his Linux 😂😂
[2024-01-28T20:15:51] Happy Giraffe: I wonder what kind of glass would be best and sold 300x300 sizes🤔
[2024-01-28T20:16:11] Happy Giraffe: Maybe gotta go local window store lol
[2024-01-28T20:16:30] Mirono escooters: Store mirror? ^^
[2024-01-28T20:16:56] Happy Giraffe: Thermal paste between bed and glass🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
[2024-01-28T20:22:55] Happy Giraffe: With glass could use matrix bed leveling tho. Then would be perfect
[2024-01-28T20:25:05] Mirono escooters: I do that
[2024-01-28T20:27:17] Happy Giraffe: Seems I gotta find a piece of glass then
[2024-01-28T20:28:29] Happy Giraffe: How thick is yours?
[2024-01-28T20:29:01] Mirono escooters: Sus question
[2024-01-28T20:29:06] Mirono escooters: Idk, need measure
[2024-01-28T20:31:15] haku: this is merika boys if going to speak mexican do it in private please

[2024-01-28T20:32:55] Mirono escooters: Yee
[2024-01-28T20:33:00] Mirono escooters: Colonised
[2024-01-28T20:40:08] Paolo ⁭: Pay 5/10€ he mean

[2024-01-28T20:50:56] Mirono escooters: @Happy_Giraffe
[2024-01-28T20:52:55] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2024-01-28T20:53:26] haku: nice holders! what do you guys use to stick 2 printed petg holders together?
[2024-01-28T20:53:48] Mirono escooters: 1zuna used superglue
[2024-01-28T20:53:55] Mirono escooters: I am using threaded rod
[2024-01-28T20:54:11] haku: thats smart
[2024-01-28T20:54:42] Gabe Enzo: I'll probably be using super glue and alot of tape around the entire cell. As well as hot glue for every single cell for extra integrity
[2024-01-28T20:55:54] haku: ill prolly use epoxy.
[2024-01-28T20:56:18] haku: there are also plastic welders ive seen
[2024-01-28T20:56:30] Gabe Enzo: I saw that shit on Ali
[2024-01-28T20:56:33] Gabe Enzo: seems like cancer
[2024-01-28T20:56:36] Gabe Enzo: Literally
[2024-01-28T20:56:50] haku: if it works why not haha
[2024-01-28T21:13:55] haku: ive noticed i get some debris from the previous print even when i clean the surface on smooth pei. what can be causing this?
[2024-01-28T21:14:54] haku: that white stuff usually sticks to textured pei. but on smooth it transfers it to the print. hmm
[2024-01-28T21:27:33] Happy Giraffe: Alcohol doesnt remove?
[2024-01-28T21:28:36] haku: unfortunately not. i guess this is the thing with cheap plates and fillament
[2024-01-28T21:30:48] Happy Giraffe: Should be fine
[2024-01-28T21:50:51] Gabe Enzo: You can take it off with a plastic chisel and alcohol
[2024-01-28T21:51:09] Gabe Enzo: With metal chisel you risk taking off the glass
[2024-01-28T21:52:29] haku: its like more like residue. sanding it might take it off but that defeats the purpose of smooth finish
[2024-01-28T21:53:12] haku: that stuff usually sticks to my textured plate and doesnt transfer over
[2024-01-28T23:22:20] Gabe Enzo: It always sticks on textured plates, in those little micro holes
[2024-01-28T23:29:18] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/azz2RgaqLbA?si=BdJfUfz1VuF9Qcrr
[2024-01-28T23:30:12] haku: do it on battery holders so the metal can short it 😂
[2024-01-29T02:11:07] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: External battery for nami 💀
[2024-01-29T05:32:40] Unknown: What levers are those?
[2024-01-29T06:39:01] Happy Giraffe: Ok too much offtopic here that should go into vesc chat/offtopic
[2024-01-29T06:56:59] Happy Giraffe: Some battery porn from FB
[2024-01-29T06:58:26] haku: wow! shinny. i have the same idea too. polished copper looks so goood
[2024-01-29T07:00:41] haku: have to use clear wraps on that for sure
[2024-01-29T07:04:54] Happy Giraffe: I would start the first battery to be as simple as possible aiming for maximum reliability and durability😁
[2024-01-29T07:05:41] Happy Giraffe: Took same route with first self deaigned 3D printed parts and never failed me so Im happy😁
[2024-01-29T07:13:11] haku: i want the most complex shape and copper cuts. zigzags and soldered copper bars for + and -. 😂
[2024-01-29T07:13:43] haku: folded ten times would be also ideal
[2024-01-29T07:14:35] haku: do you know for what ebike/emoto this is for?
[2024-01-29T10:17:22] Happy Giraffe: Razor?😂
[2024-01-29T12:31:35] Franchesco Carofano: https://www.sportvibes.cl/products/root-lever-pro-set-para-magura
[2024-01-29T12:32:58] Franchesco Carofano: those are the handles I have
[2024-01-29T12:36:10] Franchesco Carofano: I've had the hc3 and the brunni but this lever is nicer, I like it more apart from having the same braking as the hc3, you can customize it to your liking

[2024-01-29T13:14:29] puneDir: Im not cocky enough to transport 210 cells with plane so its taking a bus lol
[2024-01-29T13:47:47] Gabe Enzo: why is it wrapped
[2024-01-29T13:52:07] puneDir: <photos/photo_12572@29-01-2024_13-52-07.jpg>
[2024-01-29T14:01:38] haku: my ptsd kicking in why does it have to wrapped like a dead body bro. is it not allowed?
[2024-01-29T14:03:18] puneDir: No i dont want it to get scratched
[2024-01-29T14:04:04] haku: ok. that makes sense
[2024-01-29T14:12:59] haku: @Her0DasH i tested it with clear petg and smooth plate
[2024-01-29T14:33:40] Finn: <photos/photo_12574@29-01-2024_14-33-40.jpg>
[2024-01-29T14:34:18] Finn: Why does @sqlx1337 gets an abs overcurrent when he presses full throttle?
[2024-01-29T14:34:28] Finn: Abs error shows peak amps at 200
[2024-01-29T14:34:38] Finn: <photos/photo_12575@29-01-2024_14-34-38.jpg>
[2024-01-29T14:37:18] Paolo ⁭: Put 210a abs
[2024-01-29T14:37:31] Paolo ⁭: If u have flipsky is notmal
[2024-01-29T14:38:13] Finn: Ubox 80V 100A
[2024-01-29T14:40:09] NetworkDir: You put 100A on 20s?
[2024-01-29T14:40:35] Paolo ⁭: What's the problem?
[2024-01-29T14:40:48] NetworkDir: I just ask current + temperature with this value
[2024-01-29T14:40:58] NetworkDir: Totally no problem
[2024-01-29T14:41:28] Paolo ⁭: Ah okay
[2024-01-29T14:41:43] NetworkDir: Oh it’s nice
[2024-01-29T14:47:55] Mirono escooters: Bad setup
[2024-01-29T14:48:23] Mirono escooters: @jamessoderstrom is expert
[2024-01-29T14:50:29] Mirono escooters: Pretty clear.. wow..
[2024-01-29T14:52:52] Кирилл: Not fine tuned enough. 150A working current and 200A abs error - if triggered, then it has huge current oscillating, so take more time to fine tune it until you dont have any abs errors when abs current set to 10-20% higher than max motor current.
[2024-01-29T14:56:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can remove the covers easy from the most shit Bearings, it even removes it self , coz balls damaged And since these are most shity quality what do you expect from a destroyed one And what's on the video is just good for nothing, i dont even need to wacth it Cheap = weak sealing And they will never seal again ,but this is a part of" how its made " Also read about it ,than you dont ask such and follow videos like that Change to a New I told you what gives the most protection since there is no simering on it
[2024-01-29T14:59:25] Finn: Mhm
[2024-01-29T14:59:31] Finn: No background just say bad setup
[2024-01-29T15:00:02] Mirono escooters: Wtf? I'm trying to help
[2024-01-29T15:00:06] Mirono escooters: Redo motor setup and diff observer
[2024-01-29T15:00:18] Mirono escooters: If you get abs overcurrent with that much margin, something wrong.
[2024-01-29T15:00:30] Finn: It doesnt make sense that it spikes for like 50A
[2024-01-29T15:00:40] Mirono escooters: Let James do it or try different stuff. There is too much to list
[2024-01-29T15:00:47] Mirono escooters: My msg..
[2024-01-29T15:00:58] Finn: I had the same issue but on my setup i had 200A absolute and 180Max
[2024-01-29T15:01:04] Finn: Worked fine
[2024-01-29T15:01:07] Finn: No error at all
[2024-01-29T15:01:12] Mirono escooters: This abs overcurrent stuff always comes back, and then slow abs kills it and shit xD
[2024-01-29T15:01:19] Finn: Yes
[2024-01-29T15:01:21] Mirono escooters: Proper setup
[2024-01-29T15:01:35] Mirono escooters: Anyway, wait till James awake or try new motor setup+ diff observer
[2024-01-29T15:01:35] Finn: His batteries are way better
[2024-01-29T15:01:41] Finn: Lower voltage drop etc than mine
[2024-01-29T15:01:47] Mirono escooters: Shouldn't matter
[2024-01-29T15:04:55] Finn: We did motor setup like 10 times
[2024-01-29T15:36:19] Happy Giraffe: That's cool!
[2024-01-29T16:01:32] Gabe Enzo: 8kw inside a 1.2kw? damn
[2024-01-29T16:02:48] Finn: 9kw easy
[2024-01-29T16:47:26] haku: thanks. clear petg works well with smooth plate
[2024-01-29T16:50:05] Gabe Enzo: You got the STL file for that bro?
[2024-01-29T16:50:31] Gabe Enzo: Get a bag for it
[2024-01-29T17:16:42] haku: yes. im testing it for hero. i dont have xiomi
[2024-01-29T17:16:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's on thingi
[2024-01-29T17:18:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fun is ,i dont have a xiaomi either 🤣
[2024-01-29T17:28:02] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2024-01-29T17:38:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ideal power,weight and size combo
[2024-01-29T17:57:43] sombre_enfant: Thats crazy
[2024-01-29T18:44:29] Thierry: This is interesting, how many phase amps?
[2024-01-29T19:05:55] Thierry: Was it in single motor configuration?
[2024-01-29T19:06:56] Gabe Enzo: Dual
[2024-01-29T19:07:40] Gabe Enzo: single 22x3 overheats if you're not light.
[2024-01-29T19:08:52] Thierry: I was thinking that
[2024-01-29T19:09:51] Gabe Enzo: You got temp sensors on em?
[2024-01-29T19:10:02] Thierry: I ride flipsky 75100 single motor without any temperature issue at 80A battery and 180A phase
[2024-01-29T19:10:49] Thierry: 22x3 10"
[2024-01-29T19:10:53] Gabe Enzo: How hard was it to install those.
[2024-01-29T19:11:00] Thierry: Sorry 17x4
[2024-01-29T19:11:23] Thierry: 60H 110 or 105
[2024-01-29T19:11:52] Thierry: Not so warm
[2024-01-29T19:11:52] Gabe Enzo: Damn. I need to put one on my 800w blade but I hear it's such a pain to open.
[2024-01-29T19:12:06] Gabe Enzo: You only got 80 batt amps
[2024-01-29T19:12:08] Thierry: On circuit around 110°C
[2024-01-29T19:13:21] Thierry: I'm also not that light
[2024-01-29T19:13:29] Gabe Enzo: I'm having issues putting the tube on the split rim. feels like it'll burst when I screw in the holes. I got 10x2.5 tubes on a 10x2.125 tyre maybe that's the issue
[2024-01-29T19:13:43] Gabe Enzo: Yeah basically impossible unless you change all wires to silicone
[2024-01-29T19:13:51] Gabe Enzo: Which is probably what I'll be doing.
[2024-01-29T19:55:31] Gabe Enzo: More money wasted as always
[2024-01-29T20:08:57] haku: yep gsxr go cart is a thing.
[2024-01-29T20:20:00] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-01-29T20:21:07] Gabe Enzo: Lol I made it work
[2024-01-29T20:21:08] Gabe Enzo: uhhhhh
[2024-01-29T20:22:32] Gabe Enzo: Yup I managed tho
[2024-01-29T20:22:35] Gabe Enzo: Kek
[2024-01-29T20:22:42] Gabe Enzo: Uhh, probably safe to ride. who knows?
[2024-01-29T20:25:44] Gabe Enzo: Or maybe Ill ship with batt xD
[2024-01-29T20:25:50] Gabe Enzo: Lol if you got any spares go ahead
[2024-01-29T20:25:50] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-29T21:11:56] Awyba: tire is gonna be wobbly as hell
[2024-01-29T21:12:26] haku: get an extension
[2024-01-29T21:12:50] Gabe Enzo: You're right
[2024-01-29T21:12:57] Gabe Enzo: Nah I need an brand new tube.
[2024-01-29T21:13:01] Gabe Enzo: It's bad
[2024-01-29T21:13:22] Awyba: ik because i have 800w too i just cut in the rim so that the valve fits
[2024-01-29T21:13:54] Awyba: <photos/photo_12576@29-01-2024_21-13-54.jpg>
[2024-01-29T21:15:06] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12577@29-01-2024_21-15-06.jpg>
[2024-01-29T21:15:09] Gabe Enzo: mine is like this
[2024-01-29T21:15:25] haku: good thinking. you can always get an extension valve so you wont ruin the rim though
[2024-01-29T21:15:28] Gabe Enzo: Guess I'll need to cut mine too even with the new one
[2024-01-29T21:15:38] Gabe Enzo: extension valve?
[2024-01-29T21:15:39] Gabe Enzo: what's that
[2024-01-29T21:16:41] haku: <photos/photo_12578@29-01-2024_21-16-41.jpg>
[2024-01-29T21:17:08] haku: it extends it so you can put air in
[2024-01-29T21:18:02] Awyba: paolo told me to cut it like that
[2024-01-29T21:20:30] Paolo ⁭: Yes, for most of valve are not good with many of small rim
[2024-01-29T21:20:59] Paolo ⁭: We think that is actually best mod to fit big valve
[2024-01-29T21:23:47] Gabe Enzo: oh no the extension won't save me cause this valve is totally fucked
[2024-01-29T21:26:54] haku: oh ok
[2024-01-29T21:39:43] sombre_enfant: @SibClimb what was the video setup for this ? https://youtu.be/o3etWunxhSM?si=wJotOw5HSPCTc22-
[2024-01-29T21:44:01] sombre_enfant: @Foujiwara u must know ?
[2024-01-29T21:46:14] haku: from the angle looks like go pro tied to the back.
[2024-01-29T21:46:33] haku: insta 360
[2024-01-29T21:46:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably
[2024-01-29T21:47:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Schooled them with the extra weight
[2024-01-29T21:48:14] haku: cant be a full size camera on a gimbal. 😭
[2024-01-29T21:50:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Has to be like insta
[2024-01-29T21:52:35] sombre_enfant: Yeah i know but theres many one, i might buy the 3x idk if its good for that purpose and how to hold it on my 10+
[2024-01-29T21:52:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We have a video here , basically insta was setup on the ground , after bump and cam took the video as you come to it, when above it and than as you land behind it ,owner was not to happy about the idea 🤣
[2024-01-29T21:53:23] haku: looking at how wide the angle is. my vote is insta.
[2024-01-29T21:54:21] haku: that video editing though is on point. very professional
[2024-01-29T21:57:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: After two different direction turns i can say insta ,not too much cams can do that like that,but will know for sure when he tells
[2024-01-29T22:31:12] haku: do you guys know how deep can those desktop lazer cutters/engravers cut?
[2024-01-29T22:31:54] haku: the ones sold for hobbyists
[2024-01-29T22:33:04] haku: <photos/photo_12579@29-01-2024_22-33-04.jpg>
[2024-01-29T22:38:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know
[2024-01-29T22:38:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What is your goal?
[2024-01-29T22:39:30] haku: cut .2 copper. perfect shapes
[2024-01-29T22:39:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats industrial lvl
[2024-01-29T22:40:12] haku: i see.
[2024-01-29T22:40:55] haku: i see. no affordable way
[2024-01-29T22:41:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Led laser can only engrave on some metal not even all machines or, ment to cut wood and acril
[2024-01-29T22:41:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Co laser would cut that probably but not really ment for it
[2024-01-29T22:41:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also lot more expensive and way more dangerous
[2024-01-29T22:42:02] haku: gotcha
[2024-01-29T22:42:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That you cant see by eye ,so you dont even know its running, meanwhile it makes you blind if you look by eye and not cam
[2024-01-29T22:43:07] haku: oh nice! where do you get it?
[2024-01-29T22:43:53] haku: yes ive read stories about this.
[2024-01-29T22:44:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah coz ppl go for cheap lot times
[2024-01-29T22:45:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This means they buy the machine but not all covers and cam and all whats needed
[2024-01-29T23:02:37] Gabe Enzo: It's multiple KW Lasers, even when not looking at the beam you are blinded for life.
[2024-01-29T23:02:47] Gabe Enzo: One of the reasons why energy weapons will never be a real thing
[2024-01-29T23:03:15] Gabe Enzo: Imagine shining that in a public street onto the sky Tens of thousands of people blinded in the blink of an eye
[2024-01-29T23:03:21] Gabe Enzo: No pun intended
[2024-01-29T23:03:52] haku: im willing to take that gamble. just to get beautiful bussbars 😂
[2024-01-29T23:06:00] sombre_enfant: It already exist to destruct drone
[2024-01-29T23:06:53] haku: navy has that lazer tech
[2024-01-29T23:07:05] Gabe Enzo: Wtf. How did they get around the eye burning effect
[2024-01-29T23:07:33] Gabe Enzo: this is the kinda stuff you can't Google
[2024-01-29T23:07:54] haku: death star also has it 😂
[2024-01-29T23:16:23] sombre_enfant: Its only if u look straight at it pointing on your iris but this one will only chop your head off
[2024-01-29T23:24:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah they made one , lot time ago its huge but kinda fail
[2024-01-29T23:25:41] haku: i think thats the rail gun your talking about. navy has it on thier ships. i hope they use these lazers for good things not destryoying things
[2024-01-29T23:26:09] haku: also the next gen jets wil get it
[2024-01-29T23:27:11] haku: this is why we dont have free healthcare and lots of people suffering. all the funds goes to the military
[2024-01-29T23:59:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What i talk about is one of a kind 🤔 Unsure what was it but kinda useless

[2024-01-30T00:04:12] haku: hobbyist machining is getting more popular. kinda like the early days of 3d printing
[2024-01-30T00:07:21] Paolo ⁭: Is only for engraving, not cut
[2024-01-30T00:22:08] Face de Pin Sucé: What do you mean video setup ?
[2024-01-30T00:23:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes 👌😁🫡
[2024-01-30T00:23:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes it is insta 360 x3

[2024-01-30T01:24:05] Happy Giraffe: Just get a decent pair of heavy duty scissors?😂
[2024-01-30T01:25:41] haku: i know. uniform complex shapes would be difficult though
[2024-01-30T01:26:18] haku: ill show you what i mean later. i messed around with it.
[2024-01-30T01:35:15] Happy Giraffe: Then you would drill holes and use the tiny hand saw whatever it name was. Leaf saw some call it😁
[2024-01-30T01:35:51] Happy Giraffe: Could work very well and costs 10$
[2024-01-30T01:36:35] haku: ill check it out. ty

[2024-01-30T19:19:45] Gabe Enzo: Glitter 801D coming in 2 weeks 👀
[2024-01-30T19:20:01] Gabe Enzo: and Molicel shipment 😁
[2024-01-30T19:20:14] Gabe Enzo: so stoked

[2024-01-30T20:02:21] Gabe Enzo: Can fit smaller tubes but not bigger tubes
[2024-01-30T20:02:22] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!

[2024-01-30T20:59:11] Happy Giraffe: Should use this against people who have their bike light pointed at my eyes level
[2024-01-30T21:02:24] Martin Kaktits: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/universal-flashlight-glare-shield
[2024-01-30T21:02:47] Martin Kaktits: Id think something like this should be standart
[2024-01-30T22:05:48] Happy Giraffe: Or just the German Stvzo or whatever the regulation that needs to have a proper lens on the light that won't blind😁
[2024-01-30T22:06:21] Happy Giraffe: Sadly those lights are usually bit more expensive but Lux output better as no light gets wasted on treetops
[2024-01-30T22:09:26] Martin Kaktits: Thats what my posted "roof" does. It reflects light back down on the road and even on the scoot/ bike itself a little
[2024-01-30T22:10:35] Happy Giraffe: Sadly others wont do these, I would hope our country also had a regulation that beam cut-off should be sharp
[2024-01-30T22:14:28] haku: you can always lower the beam
[2024-01-30T22:14:42] Gabe Enzo: I'm going with 13s5p MH1 and 3s6p EVE Es2 for my 800w build
[2024-01-30T22:14:58] Gabe Enzo: Only way I can hook them up for more capacity and make use of those old eve cells
[2024-01-30T22:15:29] haku: p42 is overkill?
[2024-01-30T22:15:48] Gabe Enzo: No p42 is going on the dual 22x3 80100 X 2 scooter
[2024-01-30T22:15:58] Gabe Enzo: I will have 2 scooters
[2024-01-30T22:17:22] haku: is that okay to use two different cells on a pack?
[2024-01-30T22:17:33] Gabe Enzo: Yes, if they have separate BMS'S
[2024-01-30T22:17:41] haku: i see

[2024-01-30T22:23:33] Gabe Enzo: not planning to go over 90 unless I'm racing for money
[2024-01-30T22:24:16] Happy Giraffe: 11s 90kmh...?

[2024-01-30T22:24:48] Happy Giraffe: aah you had that weird batt setup, then perfect
[2024-01-30T22:25:31] sombre_enfant: He want to do 9s external with balance lead outside, crazy shit, two 10s and llt 50-150 would been better 50€ for the two bms and not sketchy
[2024-01-30T22:25:32] Gabe Enzo: I mean 16s5p + 3s6p eve
[2024-01-30T22:25:34] Gabe Enzo: so 19s.
[2024-01-30T22:25:51] Mirono escooters: Go for 90 with a proper setup that handles it✅ Burn half of your setup and stress cells to hit 100 👎
[2024-01-30T22:26:02] Gabe Enzo: for my 800w scoot.

[2024-01-30T23:25:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pet should stick good on that
[2024-01-30T23:26:37] haku: i think its either crap fillament. or too fast printing
[2024-01-30T23:29:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Print slower pet wont mind

[2024-01-30T23:51:15] haku: bearings crying
[2024-01-31T00:02:43] Oreo huzky: Oof defo relube them I had that too and my bearings started to seize up but that was with shitty monorim motor
[2024-01-31T00:05:13] Gabe Enzo: so thats why my ebike sounds like that
[2024-01-31T00:08:48] haku: i think its bearings. i have to check.
[2024-01-31T00:11:45] haku: got it to work yay
[2024-01-31T00:13:43] haku: the fake carbon is too try hard lol
[2024-01-31T00:26:02] Yamal: With the new battery with 30/35A field weakening
[2024-01-31T00:52:13] Happy Giraffe: How bad are they sealed😳 My bike has seen hell and back. Left on heavy rainy days outside for 8hrs and rode on every weather possible
[2024-01-31T00:52:45] Happy Giraffe: Still even chinese motor manufacturers managed to use some sort of sealed bearing it seems🤔
[2024-01-31T00:52:49] haku: no idea. lol i got it from rev rides. american retailer.
[2024-01-31T00:53:52] haku: i wont replace the bearings if i can just add bearing grease. this scoot is not fast
[2024-01-31T00:55:10] Happy Giraffe: If replaced once with proper ones then I think will work in rain etc much longer. I put some grease just outside the bearing aswell so it kinda also acts as a barrier. Maybe this not recommended but I wanted to try stuff😂
[2024-01-31T00:56:16] haku: 1 more year of warranty for this. thats why im not putting vesc in it yet
[2024-01-31T00:56:41] haku: i hope they honor thier warranty if stuff breaks
[2024-01-31T00:56:59] haku: so far they are good. they replaced a charger
[2024-01-31T01:54:14] haku: @Happy_Giraffe found my drill press

[2024-01-31T10:48:53] Chris Culver: I have the Ubox 2 in my vsett 10+.
[2024-01-31T11:36:35] Gabe Enzo: Depends if you're gonna be pulling more amps?
[2024-01-31T11:58:26] Chris Culver: Well ok I'm pulling what, 50A each at front and back? With a 75100 I would'nt get an actual 100A, would I? What determines how many amps I pull?
[2024-01-31T12:07:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: More like the protective ring near it bht unsure from this far
[2024-01-31T12:08:53] Gabe Enzo: whatever you set it to.
[2024-01-31T12:09:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Simering?
[2024-01-31T12:10:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🙈🙈🙈 this even hurt
[2024-01-31T12:10:14] Gabe Enzo: 😂
[2024-01-31T12:10:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Once again you cant replace it ,closed rings closed for a reason
[2024-01-31T12:11:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All sealed the same if they have simering Or not all scooters the same
[2024-01-31T12:11:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: With the ebike probably simering and Bearings much bigger ,what takes more basically
[2024-01-31T12:12:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But front is different scenario , I really dont know why they didn't follow that
[2024-01-31T12:13:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean basically main tube in almost all front forks is bike size tube
[2024-01-31T12:14:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That ball ring was a thing 20 y old bikes🙈
[2024-01-31T12:14:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They could copy tube size unsure why they didn't go more far
[2024-01-31T12:16:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Warranty is good for nothing mostly
[2024-01-31T12:16:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like its not for moving parts like Bearings

[2024-01-31T12:23:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tbh looks like 🙈🙈🙈 Any who lives them cables like that is not too reliable tbh Also the" Paint job" kinda hurts also

[2024-01-31T13:25:17] Mirono escooters: Mmm maybe
[2024-01-31T13:37:41] Jan: Or a hammer

[2024-01-31T14:47:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Non should exist without it ,but also should use full different Bearings as well ,but that's another child shoe problem
[2024-01-31T14:48:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>

[2024-01-31T15:10:47] Tommy ª: The mine bends a bit when I put the rear wheel Ngl it looks ok
[2024-01-31T15:15:28] Gabe Enzo: WTF, the pro 2 wheel won't fit on the m365? why did I only learn this now? HAHAHA
[2024-01-31T15:15:40] Gabe Enzo: I assumed they were the same fucking wheel this entire time
[2024-01-31T15:15:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But he should grow the absolute to a number like that
[2024-01-31T15:16:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also look line i replied
[2024-01-31T15:16:39] Awyba: nope it is wider

[2024-01-31T15:17:34] Gabe Enzo: I reached 40kmh with destroyed honeycomb tyres earlier on the m365. I'm changing them to 10x2 im gonna see if I can reach 50
[2024-01-31T15:17:41] Gabe Enzo: then I might add a 3S lithium
[2024-01-31T15:18:38] Awyba: honeycomb 💀
[2024-01-31T15:19:53] Franchesco Carofano: 1500watt motor from Nami Burn-e, 60voll 40ah battery, LG 21700 cell, I will change the BMS for one of 80 or 100Ah, which controls do you recommend?

[2024-01-31T15:52:57] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2024-01-31T16:26:46] Rose: Hey there Jacob, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-31T16:28:00] Jacob: Hey ehmm i get this result when testingthe foc hall detection in vesc tools, even tho the wheel spins
[2024-01-31T16:28:04] Jacob: <photos/photo_12601@31-01-2024_16-28-04.jpg>
[2024-01-31T16:28:42] Jacob: I've probably broken one of the cables while forcing in into the heat shrink, but does this message mean its a phase cable or one of the small ones?
[2024-01-31T16:30:44] Happy Giraffe: one of the smaller hall cables, gotta be careful with them
[2024-01-31T16:31:49] Jacob: Thank you, ill look for the bad one:)
[2024-01-31T16:33:11] Happy Giraffe: easily done with multimeter or if you see it wrecked
[2024-01-31T16:51:59] Jacob: Oh how to do with multimeter? Because i cant see any damage
[2024-01-31T17:19:23] Happy Giraffe: Continuity beep mode
[2024-01-31T17:25:18] Кирилл: Something wrong with motor parameters. Must fine tune it
[2024-01-31T17:25:57] Кирилл: Set abs to 180A and go tune motor manualy, dont ON slow abs
[2024-01-31T17:26:12] Кирилл: First try to lower inductance by 20% - try
[2024-01-31T17:26:24] Кирилл: Then observer gain /2 - try
[2024-01-31T17:26:33] Кирилл: Try other pwm freqs
[2024-01-31T17:26:43] Кирилл: Observer to ortega
[2024-01-31T17:29:04] Кирилл: Your abs current have to be not higher than 20% from motor current, otherwise current oscillating is high and you have wrong motor working or shit esc with high current noises that can accidantely brick esc
[2024-01-31T17:29:23] Кирилл: Ideal is when abs fault not high than 10% from motor current
[2024-01-31T17:29:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Single spintend alupcb or such , depends what cells you use and how much A they can Provide without having issues
[2024-01-31T17:34:17] haku: no just the drill press stand to attach dremmel
[2024-01-31T17:35:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I see , you can set 250 but what observer now you are in? Also decupling bemf?
[2024-01-31T17:35:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I used ortega and mx lemmming with that Engine
[2024-01-31T17:36:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you see anything else when you print faults?
[2024-01-31T17:36:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's other good idea to look at
[2024-01-31T17:37:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But above you said battery has 100a bms
[2024-01-31T17:41:04] Happy Giraffe: I would rather 3D print guide to hand drill with a metal rod to make it straight. Honestly all this doable by hand...
[2024-01-31T17:46:53] Happy Giraffe: Usually the drills even come with a system like this to measure depth
[2024-01-31T17:51:23] Tommy ª: The ol'reliable jtd uwu
[2024-01-31T17:54:04] haku: this mini dremmel drill press has really bad reviews.
[2024-01-31T18:01:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wtf? Is that smoke from the car?
[2024-01-31T18:02:01] Tommy ª: ye, never rev up in garaje again
[2024-01-31T18:02:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Old mk2 gtd smokes less
[2024-01-31T18:02:20] Кирилл: No problem🤝
[2024-01-31T18:02:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But if well tunned you can pull a long black line on the road
[2024-01-31T18:02:49] Кирилл: Mxlemming is better, but a little harder to tune
[2024-01-31T18:03:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you know Do you smoke vids?
[2024-01-31T18:03:05] Кирилл: Ortega is enough
[2024-01-31T18:03:07] Tommy ª: this thing dont even have o2 sensor, just a diesel + turbo
[2024-01-31T18:03:30] Tommy ª: i recorded that in a public garaje, letme find it
[2024-01-31T18:03:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mk2 golf was made in the 80's

[2024-01-31T18:08:27] Happy Giraffe: Also dremel maybe cuts alu max
[2024-01-31T18:08:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also drill press for a dremmel why ,mostly they are not that powerful
[2024-01-31T18:08:56] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, even mild steel hard for those. Stainless and inox no-no
[2024-01-31T18:09:14] haku: reviews say it sucks thats why its on sale i guess.
[2024-01-31T18:09:42] haku: folks say its worth $40 max

[2024-01-31T18:12:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you use it out ,it needs the sturdyness to keep up with usuage
[2024-01-31T18:12:30] haku: yes its for small stuff like 3d prints and jewelry
[2024-01-31T18:13:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And what do you want to use it for?

[2024-02-01T00:04:14] Rose: Hey there Luigi, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-01T01:12:16] haku: i shouldve got the ams.😭
[2024-02-01T03:49:36] rosheee: Yes
[2024-02-01T03:49:57] rosheee: Bambu petg crap btw
[2024-02-01T03:55:03] haku: this is elegoo petg. works well for me only $10-12/kg
[2024-02-01T03:56:24] haku: making a 5s powertool battery with it to test. this is miros design
[2024-02-01T04:20:35] rosheee: ye
[2024-02-01T04:20:52] rosheee: we try other petg tomorrow as well
[2024-02-01T04:20:57] rosheee: but bambu always failed with 0.4mm nozzle ^'
[2024-02-01T04:21:26] rosheee: or ^^' it failed with our x1c, and some friends bambus as well
[2024-02-01T04:22:58] haku: i think @jamessoderstrom also has that issue with bambu brand. so far ive tested sunlu, elegoo and overture. elegoo is the best so far with peo/pei bed
[2024-02-01T04:32:41] haku: this stuff is the cheapest but best looking with this plate. the gloss is has a good effect on it.
[2024-02-01T04:37:24] haku: fake carbon looks really good. too bad you wont see this when welded😂
[2024-02-01T04:56:28] rosheee: I know
[2024-02-01T04:56:53] rosheee: I think its a bambu petg issue
[2024-02-01T04:58:14] rosheee: His petg also prints better at 270 degrees C than lower
[2024-02-01T05:02:50] haku: mine is adhesion issues. the first layer has to be super slow. thats the only time i had problems with filament is when i blast through the first layer on peo plate
[2024-02-01T05:03:53] haku: i will test this super manly plate. it said it should transfer the rainbow effect to the print. idk what kind of wizardry is that
[2024-02-01T05:31:54] rosheee: Alrdy dos
[2024-02-01T05:31:57] rosheee: Did
[2024-02-01T05:32:04] rosheee: Most of them
[2024-02-01T05:32:24] haku: this rainbow one too?
[2024-02-01T05:32:27] rosheee: @AJAJ1992 can say how Me low powered

[2024-02-01T06:00:52] Happy Giraffe: Damn, 260-270 I use for CF Petg
[2024-02-01T06:01:24] Happy Giraffe: If you apply and it works then yes
[2024-02-01T06:04:25] haku: see my carbon petg above 😂
[2024-02-01T06:13:50] haku: saw this on discord 😭
[2024-02-01T06:51:42] Happy Giraffe: Lmao, even my shity first gen single ubox worked for 10,000km until user error and snapped cables😅
[2024-02-01T06:51:57] Happy Giraffe: They really don't trust their product
[2024-02-01T07:29:30] Rose: Hey there yoann, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-01T07:39:29] yoann tsobanoglou: Hello all, thank you for accepting me to the group
[2024-02-01T07:41:06] yoann tsobanoglou: I am currently in my first build with vesc, gone for a second run, and trying to figure things out. I need some help and support on tuning elements am not technical on and joined the group for help and advice
[2024-02-01T08:23:53] Konstantin: Heh
[2024-02-01T08:26:32] Konstantin: <photos/photo_12617@01-02-2024_08-26-32.jpg>
[2024-02-01T09:32:41] haku: that for powertool?
[2024-02-01T09:37:55] Konstantin: Y 2* for my chainsaw ;)))
[2024-02-01T09:38:15] Konstantin: She Chinese, but cutting tree well xD

[2024-02-01T09:40:04] Happy Giraffe: Feel free to ask and we try to help
[2024-02-01T10:04:21] Gabe Enzo: Starting a project is accepting your room is gonna look like this for days
[2024-02-01T10:19:08] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12619@01-02-2024_10-19-08.jpg>
[2024-02-01T10:19:38] Gabe Enzo: this will be going in a 3d printed enclosure. I'll have leg space too as I'll mount it a tad higher. Best part is the scooter will still be able to fold
[2024-02-01T10:23:32] Gabe Enzo: Also won't be too wide so if I do crash the cells won't catch fire as the frame will take most of the hit, if not all of it.
[2024-02-01T10:35:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Petg harder to print, also go slow
[2024-02-01T12:40:45] Mirono escooters: Mine hasn't changed in years
[2024-02-01T13:27:15] yoann tsobanoglou: First question is, when loading logs into Log Analysis. I have two vesk connected together, how do I select to see one or the other? Like I do by selecting can devices. Or is the information of both vesc’s combined?
[2024-02-01T13:34:40] Happy Giraffe: I dont have my pc open now but I remember in the log data you should see two different vescs with separate mosfets if its possible
[2024-02-01T13:39:51] Finn: Fixing the mini blade. Obviously it doesnt fit into thr g30 rear
[2024-02-01T13:39:51] Finn: <photos/photo_12620@01-02-2024_13-39-51.jpg>
[2024-02-01T13:39:52] Finn: <photos/photo_12621@01-02-2024_13-39-52.jpg>
[2024-02-01T14:12:11] Mirono escooters: Washer time
[2024-02-01T14:15:42] Happy Giraffe: Where were you located? I could make you a special fit washer👍
[2024-02-01T14:16:08] Finn: Im from germany
[2024-02-01T14:16:21] Finn: I think about adding a aluminium pipe that acts as a spacer
[2024-02-01T14:23:13] Alin Ciobanu: Vsett 10+ ?
[2024-02-01T14:31:51] Finn: <photos/photo_12622@01-02-2024_14-31-51.jpg>
[2024-02-01T14:31:57] Finn: I was thinking about doing it like thos
[2024-02-01T14:36:07] Happy Giraffe: I can also lathe you stainless spacers into desired dimension😁 If you pay shipping (propably goes in a letter) and coffee money its all good👍 Even mild steel will do if we have ran out of stainless, have to check tomorrow
[2024-02-01T14:38:47] Finn: Okay nice
[2024-02-01T14:39:08] Finn: 12mm inner diameter 15mm outer diameter would work
[2024-02-01T14:42:57] Happy Giraffe: How thick?
[2024-02-01T14:43:59] Finn: So the axle is 12mm and the max outer diameter is 15mm
[2024-02-01T14:44:04] Finn: So 3mm
[2024-02-01T14:44:39] Happy Giraffe: I mean the width
[2024-02-01T14:45:17] Happy Giraffe: How much space it needs to fill up between axle and frame
[2024-02-01T14:48:40] Finn: Oh wait
[2024-02-01T14:49:05] Finn: Fixed the holes rq
[2024-02-01T14:49:47] Finn: 2x7mm
[2024-02-01T14:49:58] Finn: So on both sides 7mm
[2024-02-01T14:50:15] Happy Giraffe: So 15x7mm with 12mm hole👍
[2024-02-01T14:51:14] Finn: Yeah
[2024-02-01T15:01:27] Happy Giraffe: I try to make them tomorrow👍

[2024-02-01T15:05:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Add atleast a single washer and one of the xiaomi motor types to grab holes , Outside use original g30
[2024-02-01T15:11:15] Finn: Yeah i will
[2024-02-01T15:11:28] Finn: On the outside i use the g30 ones
[2024-02-01T15:11:38] Finn: <photos/photo_12624@01-02-2024_15-11-38.jpg>
[2024-02-01T15:12:18] Finn: @Happy_Giraffe can you make them 5mm so i can use one xiaomi torque washer for the inside?
[2024-02-01T15:12:54] Finn: <photos/photo_12625@01-02-2024_15-12-54.jpg>
[2024-02-01T15:12:54] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Finn has been muted for 2 minutes!

[2024-02-01T15:49:29] Finn: For a 40H motor it should be enough
[2024-02-01T15:50:00] Finn: Also g30 at32 with 20s will def make wheelies easily
[2024-02-01T15:50:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For try add more washers for inside ,just single one not like the xiaomi type
[2024-02-01T15:50:42] Finn: Yeah i was planning that
[2024-02-01T15:51:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's even possible to do it on factory power that's the funny part
[2024-02-01T15:51:20] Finn: Yeah then with 20s it will absolutely go fast
[2024-02-01T15:51:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So day i record my mate ,has g30 and g2 also
[2024-02-01T15:51:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He drives both with zero handlebar

[2024-02-01T17:29:47] Mirono escooters: Das calls me oil spillage I go everywhere where there is space
[2024-02-01T19:32:30] Happy Giraffe: Also if you want to have them tighter or looser fit I can make👍 Otherwise its 12mm center drill and just machining outside to spec
[2024-02-01T20:09:18] Finn: Could you make one side wider? Like the nuts on the axle?
[2024-02-01T20:10:19] Finn: <photos/photo_12627@01-02-2024_20-10-19.jpg>
[2024-02-01T20:11:17] Jason Nelson: Does anyone know the diameters of the power switches?

[2024-02-01T20:52:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda Unsure what you mean here If you have the swich you can measure that
[2024-02-01T20:52:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I also had smaller and bigger swich
[2024-02-01T21:10:21] puneDir: Some custom

[2024-02-01T21:32:21] Jason Nelson: I don't have a tape measure with me and I have a hardware store down the street
[2024-02-01T21:33:34] Jason Nelson: I believe it's the largest one available. It didn't give me an option and they just sent the switch
[2024-02-01T21:59:18] Happy Giraffe: get a vernier caliper
[2024-02-01T22:06:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think only flipsky had smaller button 🤔
[2024-02-01T22:07:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont freak out ppl with that word😅 Vernier exist in few heads only coz they never bugged with such
[2024-02-01T22:08:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you buy something like this
[2024-02-01T22:11:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like these ,note that it might be long to fit in the tube further ,so better go dedicated size or if good store ask what they would use or you buy a similar and cut the begining so it's the tube ,if you put it in main pole
[2024-02-01T22:59:59] haku: i think ali lost my bolts in the mail. its late by about a week now. is that common thing to happen?

[2024-02-02T01:52:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No idea also, i just know hím from a chat
[2024-02-02T02:21:38] Face de Pin Sucé: C700/C1000
[2024-02-02T02:24:03] haku: have you tried that on a scooter?
[2024-02-02T03:47:51] Jason Nelson: Also have one but my tools aren't on hand and my step bits were in a pouch that got stolen
[2024-02-02T03:49:16] Jason Nelson: I only have the step bit that comes with the monorim suspension and it's too small
[2024-02-02T03:51:12] Jason Nelson: I'll check with a 16mm if that doesn't work I'll have to exchange it
[2024-02-02T05:19:46] haku: bac8000 is 500 dc amps.
[2024-02-02T05:53:59] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope
[2024-02-02T06:15:00] haku: im sure thats what your scooters are running right now. lets just keep it hush hush 😁
[2024-02-02T08:55:16] Oreo huzky: Could it be possible to use Brembo brake leavers and hopetech brake calipers? https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGehns21C/
[2024-02-02T08:55:55] Tommy ª: Man the m365 is waaay more smol
[2024-02-02T10:13:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, kinda pointless Check tube diameter if both same Than should be possible
[2024-02-02T10:14:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Didn't took too long
[2024-02-02T10:15:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On a surron he showed one
[2024-02-02T10:16:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also note both beats that 700 is also more 1000
[2024-02-02T10:17:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I Thought 8000 name gives more , but i am not that familiar with asi
[2024-02-02T10:17:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But vesc has more knowledge
[2024-02-02T10:18:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But some may tell who experienced
[2024-02-02T10:41:13] yoann tsobanoglou: Hello just a quick intro: dual motor built e-scooter with dual spintend 85v250a alu vesc combined to 70H torque motors rewired to add temp sensors and 72volt 50ah battery with Samsung 50s cells.
[2024-02-02T10:41:28] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_12632@02-02-2024_10-41-28.jpg>

[2024-02-02T10:41:28] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_12634@02-02-2024_10-41-28.jpg>
[2024-02-02T10:44:01] yoann tsobanoglou: The vescs remain completely cold and don’t seem to be phased at all with the power we need, motors struggle a bit on startup and are amp needy. Fine tuning is absolutely necessary as the current curves are far from ideal. And probably need to retune rear motor or change hall sensors as we get some clunk noise on heavy startups.
[2024-02-02T10:46:00] yoann tsobanoglou: Power delivery on start is bad( close to nami stock) but becomes insane as it starts to move, from 25/30km/h and becomes uncontrollable at around 60/70km/h
[2024-02-02T10:46:57] yoann tsobanoglou: Top speed wasn’t tested as heavy wind didn’t allow rider to feel safe on scooter
[2024-02-02T10:46:57] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. yoann has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-02T10:47:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice efficiency
[2024-02-02T10:47:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why this speed differ so much?
[2024-02-02T10:48:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Clonk Sound can come by wrong setup also
[2024-02-02T10:51:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you share more around settings we maybe able to help sort it, common issue (or was) Observer was not ortega original and decupling bemf on few basic setups
[2024-02-02T10:53:22] yoann tsobanoglou: Top speed for some reason didn’t write wheel diameter on both vesc. And also for some reason even with correct diameter they do not line up with gps speed. Even in our logs speed vesc and speed gnss are completely different ( 68,49km/h on vesc speed with wheel diameter 279,4mm and gnss speed reads 100,99km/h) once tuning is done we have a friend with draggy tool to help us adjust vesc speed.
[2024-02-02T10:54:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Interesting for me
[2024-02-02T10:54:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What scooters body is this ?
[2024-02-02T10:54:47] yoann tsobanoglou: Nami
[2024-02-02T10:54:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also how big tires?
[2024-02-02T10:55:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's why it fits 10 P

[2024-02-02T10:55:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Was wondering Also 50s cell rare in my life
[2024-02-02T10:56:11] yoann tsobanoglou: This is before the case. Battery is covered with high density foam
[2024-02-02T10:57:09] yoann tsobanoglou: The cells have a lot of voltage drop, as much as the Samsung 50e
[2024-02-02T10:57:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks nice , I am not a fan of kapton full rep
[2024-02-02T10:57:38] yoann tsobanoglou: Of course they are new and temps are low
[2024-02-02T10:57:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohhh
[2024-02-02T10:58:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Didn't know that
[2024-02-02T10:58:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 25 did look nice
[2024-02-02T10:58:31] yoann tsobanoglou: Yes, I will post all data, but needs tuning so that I don’t share bad info
[2024-02-02T10:59:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hard to find best,i always end up capacity vs a and i choose that😁
[2024-02-02T11:00:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you like ,if you have question ask any time if important do it in help room
[2024-02-02T11:00:15] yoann tsobanoglou: We had planned to fill battery with electrical silicone, but lately we had bad luck with cells in batches from nkon and keep batteries accessible before making sure all is good
[2024-02-02T11:00:48] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_12636@02-02-2024_11-00-48.jpg>

[2024-02-02T11:01:13] yoann tsobanoglou: For now we wrap in liquid electric tape
[2024-02-02T11:01:22] yoann tsobanoglou: Not ideal
[2024-02-02T11:04:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh what prob there was ,so cells were bad or performed low
[2024-02-02T11:04:55] yoann tsobanoglou: Thank you, I do have a lot of questions but I want to organise my thoughts and not spam things I can find with a bit of research. Also forgot to mention spiny 2 throttle from spintend has way too much variation on voltage, can’t hold stable throttle without feeling like duty varies, this I don’t know if it’s a setting problem or does the fact it runs next to the phase wires gets freaked out.
[2024-02-02T11:05:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Never saw such
[2024-02-02T11:06:05] yoann tsobanoglou: We build a pack with molicel, 2 cells in one series died and took the whole series with it. To be fair nkon replaced the whole series without question, but still a pain in the ass
[2024-02-02T11:06:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Plotting is nice ,but i never did Just shrink tube , and make it secure position
[2024-02-02T11:07:35] yoann tsobanoglou: It was also a bit our fault for not checking resistance of each cell before
[2024-02-02T11:08:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Good ask when you ready Help is for help This is for kinda all And there is offtopic to chit chat,lets say
[2024-02-02T11:08:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I only had experience with version 1 spiny
[2024-02-02T11:09:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dev was here
[2024-02-02T11:09:04] yoann tsobanoglou: Thank you, sorry if I spammed ! First vesc build so kind of all over the place and exited
[2024-02-02T11:09:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also use shaded wires, maybe power does effect it
[2024-02-02T11:09:51] Кирилл: 3shul make new one cc1000. Up to 40s
[2024-02-02T11:10:10] Кирилл: Right to bmw ce 04 ahah
[2024-02-02T11:10:21] Кирилл: There is 40s1p also
[2024-02-02T11:10:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Superpain ,good that bigger problem didn't happen
[2024-02-02T11:11:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nah No need to say sorry You cool Keep up good work and spirit
[2024-02-02T11:12:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2024-02-02T11:13:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I like that you come up with all fancy crazy stuff time to time👌
[2024-02-02T11:14:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So GT Will be 40s?
[2024-02-02T11:14:34] Кирилл: No, bmw ce 04 is 40s stock

[2024-02-02T11:29:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you started/continued work on it?
[2024-02-02T11:30:41] Кирилл: The client wants to increase the range
[2024-02-02T11:32:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way it's nice but looks so industrial or fat unsure But i am not a bmw fan Maybe old series 1
[2024-02-02T11:33:16] Кирилл: Ye, pretty exotic
[2024-02-02T11:33:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wondering how heavy is that , i already have something what i dont like
[2024-02-02T11:33:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: See rear suspension has one shock on left side
[2024-02-02T11:34:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like some old mopeds had ,was funny when it bent and rear part was full off track
[2024-02-02T11:34:43] Кирилл: 231 kg, and max mass with rider and equipment is 410kg
[2024-02-02T11:34:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably better than that ,but for the look
[2024-02-02T11:35:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's heavy
[2024-02-02T11:35:46] Кирилл: Thats veeery heavy, but as Tesla cars, it is not felt in motion and the center of gravity is very low
[2024-02-02T11:35:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean 150 kg bike hard to stand up by your self if stander fails ,loaded impossible
[2024-02-02T11:36:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's the good part
[2024-02-02T11:36:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you know stats or who made it? I mean bmw is more like name now, inside made in lot places
[2024-02-02T11:37:49] Кирилл: Dont know the details so much, but looks like official bmws who makes motorcycles
[2024-02-02T11:38:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I still have good friend from old Enduro life He has some big ass bmw enduro, unsure what , loaded almost 400 kg with bikes His crazy doing things like visiting us in the summer
[2024-02-02T11:38:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Drives from The Netherlands to Hungary and sleeps in a hammock
[2024-02-02T11:40:49] Кирилл: Ye, I also have friends from the moto enduro life. They say that such a life is incomparable, another universe, in a good way
[2024-02-02T11:40:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mostly off there new cars inside is crazy, made by a lot different company,not even from one country
[2024-02-02T11:41:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Agreed
[2024-02-02T11:41:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way the same thing we feel with our vehicles,just they have longer history
[2024-02-02T11:43:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I remember when first awd and front drive electric moto was made and beat the shit out off fuel bikes ,if race track didn't had too much drag places they had no race for real That shit accelerate in turns on max while fuel bike brake's
[2024-02-02T11:44:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: From electronic side i like tesla ,my cousin use to repair cars like that , electric side nice ,but carpit and such falls off 😅
[2024-02-02T11:45:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont forget to show us
[2024-02-02T11:45:30] Кирилл: Tesla has very nice electronic side
[2024-02-02T11:49:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I like even Musk in a way His kinda fun, crazy and smart Not much rich ppl like him builds super cars and space shit , robots and neuro brain shit His kinda a young Rick
[2024-02-02T11:55:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks nice ,would be nice compare with ali similar Meroca ones damn good Knowledge is the same Difference this is from plastic, that is full alu Can see in daylight This more expensive,like 10$ more

[2024-02-02T12:33:34] Happy Giraffe: 5mm steel square tube😅😭 Legs only 3mm tho
[2024-02-02T14:35:51] Happy Giraffe: Magicshine👍
[2024-02-02T15:04:36] haku: make a frame out off that
[2024-02-02T15:06:27] Happy Giraffe: Too much work for the time I have now and no use😁 also would require learning so much new stuff as proper frameworking is hard af. Always can do twisted crap that snaps in half or is unstable and bad to ride😅
[2024-02-02T15:10:20] haku: proper welded steel will not snap. ive seen bomber frames survive wigh just tack welds 😂 but good point
[2024-02-02T15:14:10] Mirono escooters: Depends on the weld and steel, but yeah
[2024-02-02T15:19:42] sombre_enfant: Do anybody know rear light with brake function flash without wiring ?
[2024-02-02T15:29:43] Happy Giraffe: Yes, making straight and square frame really hard tho
[2024-02-02T15:42:21] Happy Giraffe: For your drill😂
[2024-02-02T16:18:23] Awyba: its belt driven i think thats why it sound like a space ship
[2024-02-02T16:45:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We call it closed section in our language
[2024-02-02T16:46:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Weld is nice but you understand the chemistry behind not Always good
[2024-02-02T16:48:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda nice and useless same time 🤣
[2024-02-02T17:07:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Who knows, can be generated Sound also
[2024-02-02T17:07:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some places dont let electric vehicles be soundless
[2024-02-02T17:08:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sound kinda similar to y2k
[2024-02-02T17:17:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: molecular vibration
[2024-02-02T17:18:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For more ask Sergey
[2024-02-02T17:19:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically all is coming from your batt amp , without that no phase amps exist
[2024-02-02T17:38:59] Awyba: he made a video on it so im pretty sure its because of belt drive
[2024-02-02T18:07:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically there is no easy answer to your question Let's say in field weakening is torque optimization vs back emf phase advance Less torque more speed if you dont run out of voltage In field weakening there is a circular limit And you can turn this limit off And by that you get a new voltage limit And by moving the current vector phase advance It will form a" new field "what is an increased speed area and that is an ellipse, no longer a circle for the back emf it's squezed and this lowers back emf and this means you need less volts to go faster But as you lower it you lose torque As i use to say you dont get anything for free Normaly stator current is optimased for reverse contol also, so what we do is pushing to towards against optimased position of both direction and this weakens the field. I would say i hope this answers your question,but basically leads to even more🙈
[2024-02-02T18:08:26] Finn: 170A phase was enough to let the phase cable melt
[2024-02-02T18:09:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Happens and thanks
[2024-02-02T18:09:26] Finn: I mean it still works. Maybe good for g30
[2024-02-02T18:10:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also pls lets continue this in general ,way long topic with to much sides
[2024-02-02T18:10:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I could show you fully melt ones
[2024-02-02T18:11:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Better go bigger if you go beefy Always
[2024-02-02T18:11:47] Finn: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! 17,29€ | Electric Vehicle Motor Dedicated Line 8CORE Hall+Phase Wire THICKEN High Temperature RESIST Pure Copper Harness Length 1.2m https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ey7F7V7
[2024-02-02T18:12:00] Finn: Im about to replace the phase wires but i dont know which diameter to choose
[2024-02-02T18:12:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know i know Changing cable on brand new motor sounds nice 🤣 And also if you are there you can change Chinese Bearings as well
[2024-02-02T18:12:10] Finn: 😂😂
[2024-02-02T18:14:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never did a meter with a scooter with new stuff for my own, i like to build things once , not trying and than again getting it in parts
[2024-02-02T18:14:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you go ahead of common problems you avoid them
[2024-02-02T18:15:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well measure what you have now and could the hole fit more thick,or which is biggest what you make naked over that area
[2024-02-02T18:16:32] Finn: It was my second motor and i drove it not for long. But i hit 90kmh gps on it so that was it worth xD Also im rebuilding the pro2 rn with 20s4p intern and maybe blade again or 22x3
[2024-02-02T18:16:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But maybe if you tell what motor is that some of the guys can tell what is max,coz they did it earlier
[2024-02-02T18:17:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sounds like a nice plan ,if yOu already had the idea of bringing to parts than you lost nothing Now you can do all
[2024-02-02T18:45:08] haku: bmw makes mopeds. i did not know that. i thought they only did motorcycles/cars
[2024-02-02T18:47:55] haku: impressive. harley davidson also has a e moto. hopefully we see more companies adopt electric
[2024-02-02T18:57:33] haku: i tested all my petg they print pretty well. hopefully its okay to leave open spools around.
[2024-02-02T18:58:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice
[2024-02-02T18:58:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You live in a hot area
[2024-02-02T18:59:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Will try pcl filament now
[2024-02-02T18:59:14] haku: yes in the summer it gets pretty hot and dry. you can fry an egg ontop of a car baking in the sun 😂

[2024-02-02T22:27:11] Finn: ubox too
[2024-02-02T22:27:27] Gabe Enzo: It probably won't survive one more time
[2024-02-02T22:27:31] Gabe Enzo: I wouldn't ride that
[2024-02-02T22:27:37] Finn: i will shorten the motor cable
[2024-02-02T22:27:44] Finn: you wanna have the motor?
[2024-02-02T22:27:46] Finn: i sell it haha
[2024-02-02T22:28:07] Gabe Enzo: I'm tryna sell my 800w 💀
[2024-02-02T22:28:14] Finn: same
[2024-02-02T22:28:18] Finn: got one here too
[2024-02-02T22:28:26] Gabe Enzo: what's the one on yours. 1.2kw?
[2024-02-02T23:58:51] Finn: the outer wire started to heat up
[2024-02-02T23:58:58] Finn: outer insulation i mean
[2024-02-02T23:59:16] Finn: next will be g30

[2024-02-02T23:59:38] Finn: pro2 ist really the worst
[2024-02-02T23:59:45] Finn: yeah but low kv
[2024-02-02T23:59:52] Finn: everything sucks
[2024-02-03T00:00:26] Finn: battery space, Steering rod, handle bar No rear motor mount (Front really sucks when you weight below 60kg)
[2024-02-03T01:12:24] haku: after some trial and error. buying the wrong size sleeves. got the right size.

[2024-02-03T14:14:31] Happy Giraffe: I try to send your box on monday
[2024-02-03T14:26:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All depends on type of that, there is different lvls lets say
[2024-02-03T14:27:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Much cheaper than normal paint jobs ,but rare to find a nice company
[2024-02-03T14:27:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Never did such for scooters
[2024-02-03T14:28:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bomb has been planted😁
[2024-02-03T14:28:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What's that?
[2024-02-03T14:30:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is only New year Rest of the time they work 15 times more than us
[2024-02-03T14:31:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Boombox🔥
[2024-02-03T14:33:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks nice if works cool ,brush ones i dont reallly like
[2024-02-03T14:38:20] haku: here powedercoating cost a bit. like the price of a set of powdercoating wheels cost about $500. maybe for scooter frame should be less
[2024-02-03T14:39:23] haku: btw i got my bolts and my wheel can spin now.
[2024-02-03T15:01:39] Jason Nelson: I would like to understand the relationship between battery and phase amps a little better
[2024-02-03T15:01:51] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_12652@03-02-2024_15-01-51.jpg>
[2024-02-03T15:02:52] Jason Nelson: 5200w at 36v is around 145a. Is that a figure coming from my battery because the max current stated is 220a and I'm assuming that's coming off my phase current
[2024-02-03T15:03:25] Jason Nelson: Or is it the 5200/220a phase current gives you the transformed voltage?
[2024-02-03T15:46:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I love Chinese woman

[2024-02-03T15:50:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I more like wires when they face the floor
[2024-02-03T15:52:32] Happy Giraffe: Rate my bell 1-10
[2024-02-03T16:13:12] Gabe Enzo: does the job
[2024-02-03T16:16:53] Happy Giraffe: It will be very fitting for 100kmh bike
[2024-02-03T17:22:18] haku: i really dont like the look of thick phase wires. but its necessarry according to some folks
[2024-02-03T17:26:21] haku: look at the height if this on 12". lifted baby
[2024-02-03T17:29:29] haku: i might get these 11" rims if this rubs at full speed.
[2024-02-03T17:35:09] Happy Giraffe: Try bottoming out front tire, if tire contact happens at high speed you fly nicely over the bar😳
[2024-02-03T17:37:05] haku: it doesnt bottom out. what im worried about is tire expansion when at high rpms. theres a 10mm gap on the rear tire and the suspension bolt
[2024-02-03T17:37:12] Mirono escooters: Time for a dryer now
[2024-02-03T17:37:19] Mirono escooters: Petg sucks moisture up
[2024-02-03T17:37:48] haku: i live in a dryer. super dry climate exept on winter
[2024-02-03T17:57:28] haku: i have a feeling this will expand and touch.
[2024-02-03T18:22:07] Happy Giraffe: Put white marker on it and run it 80kmh in air
[2024-02-03T18:22:24] Happy Giraffe: Then you see, probably will expand less on road but still
[2024-02-03T18:23:17] haku: i still need to make the battery. i can run it on 60v
[2024-02-03T18:23:45] haku: anyways more smoke for my burnouts if it rubs 😂
[2024-02-03T18:28:00] haku: this pmt tire is special order on the website. its not available for purchase in the US that i know off. and it a wide 11". 11" is so 2021 😭
[2024-02-03T18:28:01] haku: i might get these 11" rims if this rubs at full speed.
[2024-02-03T19:19:28] Gabe Enzo: are hydraulic brakes necessary for high speeds? how do they differ?
[2024-02-03T19:20:11] haku: anyone heard of this brand brakes? https://lewistech.store/products/lh4-brake-set
[2024-02-03T19:20:44] haku: expensive but uses proper moto dot fluid
[2024-02-03T19:21:35] Mirono escooters: Yes, more pressure. Better control
[2024-02-03T19:21:57] Mirono escooters: "Auto" refill oil to compensate for slack
[2024-02-03T19:50:16] Happy Giraffe: They had some 6 or 8 piston aswell
[2024-02-03T19:50:51] haku: yes i saw that. moto brakes for ebikes/scooters
[2024-02-03T19:51:02] haku: 3mm disks too
[2024-02-03T19:51:45] haku: seems like the brembo of bike brakes

[2024-02-03T20:17:13] haku: yes. i think so too. do you know anyone that tested these?
[2024-02-03T20:17:55] haku: expensive AF too.
[2024-02-03T20:19:16] haku: seems like the levers solid aluminum.
[2024-02-03T20:23:07] haku: if it goes on clearance i will test it for the boys 😂
[2024-02-03T20:25:46] haku: <photos/photo_12660@03-02-2024_20-25-46.jpg>
[2024-02-03T20:26:20] haku: good addition to my i love china collection
[2024-02-03T20:40:30] Happy Giraffe: Almost sounds like "Monorim Original Manufacturer"
[2024-02-03T20:44:11] haku: props to them if this is not a clone if original patent.
[2024-02-03T20:45:43] Jason Nelson: I didn't use any field weakening to attain that speed. I've removed field weakening because I don't see any difference in top speed when I'm pushing 100a but I'm going to take a look into this link
[2024-02-03T20:46:45] Tommy ª: why not 72v?
[2024-02-03T20:51:22] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-02-03T21:02:00] Jason Nelson: Because I use 3 36v 21ah batteries tied in parallel
[2024-02-03T21:02:36] Jason Nelson: 30-35 mph is my desired speed which I hit with my setup
[2024-02-03T21:02:45] Jason Nelson: And I can go almost 40 miles
[2024-02-03T21:08:04] Jason Nelson: At 2:45 I believe it's saying that with foc you're less regulated by your voltage which is why I'm able to attain such high speeds on 10s
[2024-02-03T21:21:45] Jason Nelson: When I use iq measured I can only go 28mph and hit a wall, when I put it in target I can get 9mph more
[2024-02-03T21:21:46] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-03T21:41:45] francois schempers: if you're controller can handle it, you're better off putting them in serie, you will obtain the same range as Wh don't change, but you will be much more efficient since W obtained by voltage increase produce much less heat than Amp increase
[2024-02-03T21:42:54] francois schempers: and since your scooter won't struggle as much against backEMF at higher voltage, you'll have more torque at 30-35mph
[2024-02-03T21:49:11] francois schempers: <photos/photo_12661@03-02-2024_21-49-11.jpg>
[2024-02-03T21:49:49] francois schempers: here is a graph to help you understand with a good explanation
[2024-02-03T21:50:09] francois schempers: Here is what happens if you only change battery current limit: Battery consumption won’t change up till same rpm(speed) because phase current is the limit. Fast = full phase amp acceleration will continue up till higher rpm. Max power will be higher because - example, at previous max speed 60kmh voltage was 45v and phase current was limited by battery limit obviously. So by increasing battery limit we now have more room for phase amps at those same 45v (60kmh) meaning we can get to higher max speed
[2024-02-03T21:52:22] francois schempers: <photos/photo_476@30-06-2021_22-32-48.jpg>
[2024-02-03T21:54:43] francois schempers: and here is some more info on how controller work, this was ment for someone with no knowledge so its a bit simplified
[2024-02-03T21:54:43] francois schempers: so, first thing to understand, the controller is in fact a converter, it convert a constant dc voltage into 3 phases, it will draw as many Amps as it need for the required load (the torque) on the other end, your battery has a maximum load it can sustain, let me image with simpler value, an hypothetical battery is capable of delivering for example 20w, 5V at 4A, when the controller need 4A all is fine, 5V stay the same, but if lets say the controller need 8A, battery can't do 40W, next best thing is 2,5V at 8A, still 20W but with a big drop in voltage, controller doesn't care about the drop in voltage, you will just loose top speed. OK now back to reality, V voltage define the top speed achievable by the system, other parameters are to be taken into account like the Kv rating of the motor, but all in all more V = more speed A, Amperage define de torque possible, higher A = higher torque, but also higher heat generated, so there is a balance to find, because higher voltage doesn't cause necessarily more heat. too big of A and you will fry your motor, but before you fry a motor you'll certainly fry the esc, because motor can handle usually 3-4x their nominal power next value, W, witch is the output power, V x A, and is used to give an idea of the power of the system, but to really grasp the capability, you need A and V info and last, Ah wich is the capacity of the battery, how much A can a battery sustain for how much hours
[2024-02-03T21:54:43] francois schempers: so now that it's explain, a battery is composed of cells, 3.6V each, fully charged they are at around 4.1-4.2V, if your system need more voltage, you stack them in serie, and their respective voltage adds up, so 10s is 36V etc, but a cell have a maximum output discharge, usually around 5A but some specialize cells can do much more, the nominal discharge current is given is the cell datasheet
[2024-02-03T21:58:17] francois schempers: controller will decrease voltage and make higher Amps on phase, that's why phase Amps and battery Amps are not the same, at low speed, controller makes lower voltage phase with much higher Amps, and at top speed, you basically have battery voltage and thus phase Amps = battery Amps this is simplified its a bit more complex, but it's for your understanding
[2024-02-03T22:01:59] haku: @happy whats that app you showed me to convert metric to freedom units?
[2024-02-03T22:04:11] haku: nvm found it.
[2024-02-03T22:30:34] Jason Nelson: My controller is only 20s capable but they are all paralleled into the same BMS and bypassed on the load side
[2024-02-03T22:34:56] Jason Nelson: So when I'm at top speed and my output says 60a it's safe to assume it's using 60 battery amps?
[2024-02-03T22:35:09] Jason Nelson: That's what I'm understanding
[2024-02-03T22:35:13] francois schempers: yup,
[2024-02-03T22:36:08] francois schempers: your controller doesn't have any V headroom to convert into higher A so its just make phase out of V and A from battery
[2024-02-03T22:37:32] Jason Nelson: So it can create a higher voltage by converting my voltage and amps from the battery? Maybe in not understanding that correctly
[2024-02-03T22:37:45] francois schempers: higher amps
[2024-02-03T22:37:48] francois schempers: not voltage
[2024-02-03T22:37:50] Jason Nelson: Ah
[2024-02-03T22:37:57] Jason Nelson: Makes phase amps
[2024-02-03T22:38:02] Jason Nelson: I see
[2024-02-03T22:38:28] francois schempers: higher Amps with lower voltage, totalling the same amount of W the battery is capable of delivering
[2024-02-03T22:38:32] Jason Nelson: Well my 60v and 36v both max at about 5-5500w and top out the same
[2024-02-03T22:38:50] Jason Nelson: With field weakening and 60v I was able to hit 48.8
[2024-02-03T22:39:21] Jason Nelson: But no field weakening on 36v I got the same speeds as 60v no field weakening
[2024-02-03T22:39:34] francois schempers: you should have higher top speed with 60v if everything else is the same, maybe your firmware is wrong
[2024-02-03T22:39:48] Jason Nelson: Hmm
[2024-02-03T22:40:00] francois schempers: what's the full specs of both battery
[2024-02-03T22:40:32] Jason Nelson: It comes with 75_300 r2 loaded
[2024-02-03T22:41:03] francois schempers: give me the cells, S count, P count, and bms capability
[2024-02-03T22:41:37] Jason Nelson: 16s5p 50e cells BMS protected 10s18/22p(depending if I have my external battery attached) mj1 cells bypassed
[2024-02-03T22:42:14] francois schempers: what max amp did you set for both ?
[2024-02-03T22:43:09] Jason Nelson: 45 battery and maybe around 150 phase amps And 100 battery and 240/250 phase
[2024-02-03T22:44:07] Jason Nelson: Can't remember exactly what my specs are on the 60v off the top of my head but something like that
[2024-02-03T22:49:31] francois schempers: so you're 10s almost don't Vdrop thanks to the big P number but you're 16s as you can see in this graph, Vdrop quite a bit in the 10A per cell range
[2024-02-03T22:49:35] francois schempers: <photos/photo_12664@03-02-2024_22-49-35.jpg>
[2024-02-03T22:50:09] francois schempers: if you put lower amp on the 16s you'll go faster, (I know it's counterintuitive ^^)
[2024-02-03T22:53:38] francois schempers: you instantly go from 4.2 to around 3.8 in the 10A range, wich make you loose instantly 10% of your top speed just from Vdrop alone, try 30A battery on the 16s, you'll gain back that top speed before you loose to much torque
[2024-02-03T22:58:18] francois schempers: but you'll never reach the same torque as your 10s since you more than double the power it can deliver compared to the 16s, the comparison isn't fair, you have 220 cell in the 10s and 80 cells in the 16s if you had the same number of cells so 16s13p, the 16s would cruch the 10s performance at any speed
[2024-02-04T04:13:58] Jason Nelson: I just have to pay for a battery to be built
[2024-02-04T04:14:59] Jason Nelson: With my casing I have 145mm of height, I could potentially stack 21700s inside
[2024-02-04T04:15:13] Jason Nelson: Just not made of money
[2024-02-04T04:33:20] haku: gents i present to you my vesc drill project.
[2024-02-04T04:33:32] haku: <video_file>
[2024-02-04T11:37:55] Mirono escooters: Looks super
[2024-02-04T11:42:58] haku: thanks. you holders makes the look.
[2024-02-04T11:50:37] Gabe Enzo: how tf U do that
[2024-02-04T11:50:46] Gabe Enzo: I thougt copper nickel sandwich was different
[2024-02-04T11:51:40] Mirono escooters: How else??
[2024-02-04T11:52:36] haku: idk else to do it. this is my version of copper samdwich. also this is how i was taught
[2024-02-04T11:53:00] Mirono escooters: That's how it should be
[2024-02-04T11:54:19] haku: once in get it perfected all the nickel will be the same size and the copper shapes will be precise
[2024-02-04T11:55:27] Gabe Enzo: I thought it was a layer of nickel on a layer of copper
[2024-02-04T11:55:32] Gabe Enzo: Like 1:1
[2024-02-04T11:56:03] Gabe Enzo: does that little nickel square actually add more current?
[2024-02-04T11:56:09] Gabe Enzo: would make sense to do all copper then I'm new to this
[2024-02-04T11:56:29] haku: it is .15 nickel on .15 copper. my 20s will be .2 on .2
[2024-02-04T11:58:19] haku: the current wil use the least path of resistance
[2024-02-04T11:58:56] haku: <video_file>
[2024-02-04T12:06:39] Mirono escooters: ????
[2024-02-04T12:07:00] Mirono escooters: You can add a whole layer of nickel on top But 8× resistance doesn't really help
[2024-02-04T12:19:45] Chris Culver: You can't directly weld copper? Why?
[2024-02-04T12:30:07] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters
[2024-02-04T12:33:23] Mirono escooters: Only with specific welders
[2024-02-04T12:33:36] Mirono escooters: Sandwich is easiest simplest cheapest method
[2024-02-04T12:33:47] sombre_enfant: It deacrease résistance if u put whole strip
[2024-02-04T12:33:48] Mirono escooters: Kweld should be able to do with graphite welding pens. Haven't tried.
[2024-02-04T12:33:55] Mirono escooters: Useless
[2024-02-04T12:34:08] Mirono escooters: Copper resistance is 6× lower. That one nickel strip isn't doing anything
[2024-02-04T12:37:21] sombre_enfant: Still help tho
[2024-02-04T12:39:02] Mirono escooters: Barely does anything
[2024-02-04T12:39:19] Mirono escooters: It's not worth the work. A whole copper SHEET vs a strip of nickel..
[2024-02-04T12:39:27] Mirono escooters: Do the math. I bet it's under 1%
[2024-02-04T13:01:07] Happy Giraffe: How traffic feels
[2024-02-04T13:02:09] Happy Giraffe: Good for rigidity I guess but extra cost
[2024-02-04T13:08:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cant watch for some reason freezing out
[2024-02-04T13:10:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <animation>
[2024-02-04T13:10:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2024-02-04T13:11:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can find dot brakes full metal on ali even cheap ,had one just to try how shit it is and turned out nice lol
[2024-02-04T13:12:13] Gabe Enzo: anyone else getting this annoying thing?
[2024-02-04T13:12:32] Gabe Enzo: like we all know it can obviously play the video so it's just lying
[2024-02-04T13:12:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda same had no cut off version
[2024-02-04T13:13:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure in normal bike life
[2024-02-04T13:14:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you daily bike ,you dont need such If you race bike or dh you want smallest light weight shit possible
[2024-02-04T13:15:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 2 x 1piston sram stops you from 100kmh with 220mm disc
[2024-02-04T13:15:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For us maybe better
[2024-02-04T13:16:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But how big disc you need and whole huge shit will fit near the motor?
[2024-02-04T13:16:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i like that it has big oil tank
[2024-02-04T13:16:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda like a moped
[2024-02-04T13:18:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Helping hand
[2024-02-04T13:20:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I use to pull up a biker girl to my place route is 2,5 km and 250 m level difference
[2024-02-04T13:21:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably fastest in her life upways
[2024-02-04T13:21:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also is that just a sping suspension or oil?
[2024-02-04T13:23:07] puneDir: Stock zero spring
[2024-02-04T13:23:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Anyway better tye it elsewhere ,coz its not ment for sideway forces , anytime you accelerate "pulls one "
[2024-02-04T13:23:42] puneDir: Yeah lol
[2024-02-04T13:23:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Better than oil in this case
[2024-02-04T13:23:53] puneDir: It was fun
[2024-02-04T13:24:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont say to not do so
[2024-02-04T13:24:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All i say is tye to better position where you cant damage your stuff
[2024-02-04T13:24:43] puneDir: Yeye
[2024-02-04T13:25:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I use to do such as i said ,but i have a good reason
[2024-02-04T13:25:51] Mirono escooters: Literally no point
[2024-02-04T13:25:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also kinda made an attachment for this ,on a scooter i already sold 🤣
[2024-02-04T13:26:07] Mirono escooters: Same
[2024-02-04T13:26:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It was just for fun or helped a friend out?
[2024-02-04T13:27:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: After the answer ,i tell you why i did 😁
[2024-02-04T13:28:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2024-02-04T13:28:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cant leave it out sry
[2024-02-04T13:29:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <animation>
[2024-02-04T13:29:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 👆👆👆
[2024-02-04T13:42:48] Happy Giraffe: Well reinforces the thin copper?😳 If pack takes a hit
[2024-02-04T14:07:46] Gabe Enzo: > pushing 19kw > Stock surron motor
[2024-02-04T14:07:50] Gabe Enzo: <sticker>
[2024-02-04T14:21:56] Mirono escooters: Still no
[2024-02-04T14:22:22] Mirono escooters: Just making a joke of himself
[2024-02-04T14:22:37] haku: i can but i chose to this.
[2024-02-04T14:23:44] haku: <video_file>
[2024-02-04T14:26:40] haku: i did a bunch of experiments with copper welds. this methods seems to have the stongest hold.
[2024-02-04T14:29:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I agree,not thats Should hold it together , also never should take a hit 😅
[2024-02-04T14:29:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Still same video what freezes out
[2024-02-04T14:30:44] haku: weird.
[2024-02-04T14:31:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Something fucked before or when sending
[2024-02-04T14:31:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Similar happens if video didn't load and you press send
[2024-02-04T14:31:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Try re record
[2024-02-04T14:31:51] haku: i see
[2024-02-04T14:32:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If not first case , that's only way to make it work
[2024-02-04T14:33:37] haku: <video_file>
[2024-02-04T14:39:00] haku: i have 4 piston ali brakes too bad i cant get it on my scooter unless i transfer it all to the right side
[2024-02-04T14:39:48] haku: if i do that the front brake will look funky
[2024-02-04T14:40:58] haku: i will solder the + and - side with a 18awg wire 😂
[2024-02-04T14:42:30] haku: surron can hit those Kw numbers.
[2024-02-04T14:42:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-04T15:22:23] Gabe Enzo: Stock motor tho
[2024-02-04T15:23:24] Gabe Enzo: Literally impossible
[2024-02-04T15:24:00] haku: not stock motor. your right but aftermarket motors can hit 20kw
[2024-02-04T16:13:17] Happy Giraffe: QS 165 maybe made for Surron purposes. Is that your modified motor @SibClimb ?😁
[2024-02-04T16:32:33] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12668@04-02-2024_16-32-33.jpg>
[2024-02-04T16:32:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope
[2024-02-04T16:40:02] Happy Giraffe: Can you share any of the specs of it?👀
[2024-02-04T16:40:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope x)
[2024-02-04T16:40:43] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-02-04T17:11:04] francois schempers: you can find battery maker in this group that would accept to redo your existing battery, like taking the cells of you 10s22p and make a 20s11p
[2024-02-04T17:30:53] haku: is it torpe?
[2024-02-04T17:42:34] sombre_enfant: Even if it was he will gate keep
[2024-02-04T18:01:02] Happy Giraffe: Sure, I just like to tease him to say atleast something😂
[2024-02-04T18:12:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope
[2024-02-04T18:13:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes I always gate keep, because if I don't, I do all the job to buy, test something, take the risk, and then everybody can go for it without me getting any money
[2024-02-04T18:13:14] Face de Pin Sucé: I've done long time ago helping community
[2024-02-04T18:13:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Now, my point is to win races for fun, and I won't help anybody to win, only my pilots
[2024-02-04T18:14:22] Happy Giraffe: Is the new surron motor ready soon?
[2024-02-04T18:37:44] Face de Pin Sucé: it is ready, under production, waiting the end of chinese new year
[2024-02-04T18:39:29] Paolo ⁭: It's probably sotion
[2024-02-04T18:39:37] Paolo ⁭: At least looks the same
[2024-02-04T20:35:39] haku: its time
[2024-02-04T20:42:41] Mirono escooters: Sucks tho : D
[2024-02-04T20:45:49] sombre_enfant: Its stealed potted rental battery nobody want to deal with that
[2024-02-04T20:46:24] Mirono escooters: Why not
[2024-02-04T20:49:07] sombre_enfant: Alright now gatekeep time🥸
[2024-02-04T21:02:06] Yamal: <photos/photo_12669@04-02-2024_21-02-06.jpg>
[2024-02-04T21:05:41] Mirono escooters: Hate that
[2024-02-04T21:49:39] haku: @Happy_Giraffe to drill pilot holes how small does it have to be compared to the real hole?
[2024-02-04T21:59:49] Happy Giraffe: It needs to be bigger than the flat aread of the bigger drill
[2024-02-04T22:00:09] Happy Giraffe: Each drillbit has a small line at the tip that wont cut
[2024-02-04T22:01:04] haku: so a m6 hole how many pilot holes do i do?
[2024-02-04T22:09:30] Happy Giraffe: Look at the tips of drills for other sizes. If on alu or mildsteel might not even need but typically 3mm bit I would use before that
[2024-02-04T22:09:55] Happy Giraffe: Just makes it faster and nicer on the bit
[2024-02-04T22:10:10] haku: gotcha thanks
[2024-02-04T22:16:00] Happy Giraffe: Cutting fluid remember if you like to keep bits sharp and get a clean hole😁
[2024-02-04T22:16:34] haku: yep im getting proper tapping fluid.
[2024-02-04T22:17:46] Happy Giraffe: Yes, cutting spray bit different but both work
[2024-02-04T22:18:09] Happy Giraffe: Tapping grease much better on making threads tho
[2024-02-04T22:18:23] haku: oh drilling and tapping has different oils.
[2024-02-04T22:18:50] haku: i might just take this to the machine shop. i might mess this up
[2024-02-04T22:18:55] sombre_enfant: Tap is grease
[2024-02-04T22:19:09] sombre_enfant: Use the emuge grease for tap its ok
[2024-02-04T22:19:12] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but for casual use it doesnt matter. If you have something there its good enough
[2024-02-04T22:19:38] haku: gotcha. thanks fellas
[2024-02-04T22:20:00] Happy Giraffe: If you drill 40 holes in a row then might get the proper setup😅
[2024-02-04T22:20:29] sombre_enfant: On cnc we use the typical coolant, or we put an optional stop (m01) and apply grease manually in the hole and on the tap
[2024-02-04T22:21:57] Happy Giraffe: CN tapping is🥵
[2024-02-04T22:22:02] haku: once i get my new batteries i made hopefully my drill go faster
[2024-02-04T22:23:27] Happy Giraffe: Not needed, even if drilling stainless or inox the key is pressure. Otherwise drillbit will just heat up and not cut. On mildsteel or alu anything just goes through if pilot hole is there
[2024-02-04T22:28:06] haku: i was also recommended to use a roll punch set but i cant find metric. even in ali
[2024-02-04T22:28:30] haku: to get the center perfectly
[2024-02-04T22:39:23] Jacob: Hey are there any guides on how to setup the vesc esc with setup wizard in vesc tools
[2024-02-04T22:53:50] Happy Giraffe: Just any center punch will do
[2024-02-04T22:54:50] haku: but do roll punch sets exist there in metric?
[2024-02-04T22:54:58] Happy Giraffe: Mostly its needed just to set up voltage and motor/battery currents
[2024-02-04T22:55:15] haku: or metric folks dont use that?
[2024-02-04T22:55:17] Happy Giraffe: If you need help with something specific feel free to ask
[2024-02-04T22:55:46] Happy Giraffe: I use same punch for everything😂
[2024-02-04T22:56:19] Happy Giraffe: If you need it super accurate then spring loaded punch + hammer punch is best combo
[2024-02-04T22:56:56] Happy Giraffe: This also requires accutate drawing engraving with proper tools to be useful at all
[2024-02-04T23:00:29] Rose: Hey there Zz, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-04T23:14:19] haku: i have spring punches. sometimes the center can wander. in trying to drill 6 holes with precise centering
[2024-02-04T23:20:54] francois schempers: ah ! nevermind x)
[2024-02-04T23:23:36] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/mt_EAQP5k9I?si=WvNa7hlctqQio28c
[2024-02-04T23:24:34] haku: i want to achieve this kind of precision on a hand drill 😂
[2024-02-04T23:28:25] Happy Giraffe: Then if it wanders you can move the hole by punching again at slight angle
[2024-02-04T23:28:41] Happy Giraffe: But it shouldnt wander if everything used square
[2024-02-04T23:29:12] Happy Giraffe: Edited video😁
[2024-02-04T23:29:57] haku: the lighting makes it better. cant see the lines
[2024-02-04T23:30:32] Happy Giraffe: Its very hard to even hit 0.01mm accuracy and measuring it is even harder😁
[2024-02-04T23:33:58] Jacob: Thank you, will ask when i have to connect motor :)
[2024-02-05T00:22:55] cihan: Does anyone know rear wheel bearing size of ninebot f2 pro?
[2024-02-05T02:19:12] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Maybe 6003
[2024-02-05T02:52:50] cihan: Thanks, I also guess so. I wanted to make an order without hassle to dismantle 2 times since I'm actively using it. I couldn't find anywhere.
[2024-02-05T05:02:22] haku: this ali lathe has pretty good unpaid youtube reviews. good begginer tool. im looking at the 180mm×300mm. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $440.99 40%OFF | VEVOR Mini Metal Lathe Variable Speed Large Swing Range 220V 110V for Precision Counter Face Turning Driling Threading Milling https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNwlJvg
[2024-02-05T05:05:23] haku: milling custom axles and put bigger holes and put bigger phase wires would be cool
[2024-02-05T06:05:56] Happy Giraffe: I would guess this metal means the softest alu possible
[2024-02-05T06:06:34] Happy Giraffe: Harder steel lathing is a no-no with this
[2024-02-05T06:07:55] haku: dam. what would be a ballpark price for a decent lathe.
[2024-02-05T06:08:07] haku: not fancy top shelf
[2024-02-05T06:11:13] Happy Giraffe: If you have giant garage buy some used lathe so you can actually do useful stuff
[2024-02-05T06:11:36] Happy Giraffe: But then idk if house fuses enough
[2024-02-05T06:18:40] haku: just a hobbyist lathe. not professional grade stuff.
[2024-02-05T06:19:16] haku: hopefully someday lathe and cnc machines will be accesible to hobbyists
[2024-02-05T06:19:50] haku: kinda like the old days of 3d printing stuff was so expensive.
[2024-02-05T06:25:33] Happy Giraffe: Already are😁 but you gotta buy used ones or for wood
[2024-02-05T06:27:07] Happy Giraffe: 180lbs/80kg lathe quite light for steel I think
[2024-02-05T06:27:24] Happy Giraffe: @Her0DasH say something😂
[2024-02-05T06:36:12] haku: ill look up ebay listings. metal working is so hot right now all the tool prices are up 😂
[2024-02-05T06:38:44] haku: not hopping on the bandwagon. im really intrested in this
[2024-02-05T06:39:29] haku: youtube not helping by showing me clips after clips of lathing and welding
[2024-02-05T06:52:14] Mirono escooters: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EIb9WlP
[2024-02-05T06:52:41] Mirono escooters: Build in Bluetooth, switch function, settable 5/3.3v 😱
[2024-02-05T06:56:31] Happy Giraffe: I wonder how this compares to spintend 80/100
[2024-02-05T06:57:46] Happy Giraffe: If you already charge your car at home maybe your fuses are enough for small welders
[2024-02-05T06:58:09] Happy Giraffe: Or then beneficial to change them so your car also charges faster haha
[2024-02-05T06:59:05] Happy Giraffe: Welding easier as the smaller machines weigh 15-20kg instead of 2 tons
[2024-02-05T06:59:14] haku: i dont know anything about how AC current. yes i charge at home but tesla installed the charger
[2024-02-05T06:59:56] haku: yes ive seen budget welders. very good reviews.
[2024-02-05T07:00:15] haku: all in one mig/tig
[2024-02-05T07:00:48] Mirono escooters: Apperantly engineer of makerbase opened a esk8 thread and published all files accordingly. Good guy
[2024-02-05T07:03:45] puneDir: Where
[2024-02-05T07:06:08] Mirono escooters: 🤷
[2024-02-05T07:06:39] puneDir: Dont you have a link
[2024-02-05T07:07:02] haku: nice they use 6awg.
[2024-02-05T07:10:24] Happy Giraffe: Engineers🫡 Higher-ups/marketing😞😭
[2024-02-05T07:12:22] Happy Giraffe: Budget combo Im not sure if its good to pay 200$ for 2-in-1 machine vs. to pay 200$ for one feature that works best. Ive seen some video of them where they were tested and seemed all good. Have fun buying Argon bottles tho if not using stick😂
[2024-02-05T07:22:46] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I'm not sure but mostly 350w motors have 6003 and 6001 for non motor wheel
[2024-02-05T07:31:31] Happy Giraffe: Tig welding two different types of alu on a machine thats not properly tuned and teacher doesnt know how to set each parameter😂 Still works tho (Handlebar extension)
[2024-02-05T07:37:05] haku: nice!
[2024-02-05T07:38:27] haku: is welding two different aluminums or alu alloy and chinesium difficult?
[2024-02-05T07:40:05] haku: for cylindrical stuff do you use a rotary table or some sort?
[2024-02-05T07:42:47] Happy Giraffe: Rotating table would be nice, I just moved my ass
[2024-02-05T07:43:48] Happy Giraffe: But on thin alu like this tempo is so fast even with table its hard😅
[2024-02-05T11:02:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Let me read
[2024-02-05T11:07:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ok
[2024-02-05T11:14:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So about does its really hard to judge from this far ,some does what have 750w or more power can be nice. Its not for industrial stuff all time work ,but you can do projects with it, i have similar small one also ,bigger one we use is like car size machine 🤣 chucks can hold a truck rim
[2024-02-05T11:15:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically i would also say its more made for softer metals but it can do steel if you go nice , since its small you can go hardcore
[2024-02-05T11:16:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Little example, really funny that these made for a laotie 😁
[2024-02-05T11:19:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's an insert to reinforce fork top tube, originaly it was bent What you see was originaly a bigger wooden saw axle, what we reshaped With that small mill
[2024-02-05T11:20:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12672@05-02-2024_11-20-02.jpg>
[2024-02-05T11:20:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And this other ring joined this and the Other ones top
[2024-02-05T11:22:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How bent it was
[2024-02-05T11:24:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12674@05-02-2024_11-24-16.jpg>
[2024-02-05T11:25:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Whole is inside original alumínium tube what sits on top,well known from lot scooters
[2024-02-05T11:26:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In this
[2024-02-05T11:26:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So its able to do a lot ,just not super strong
[2024-02-05T11:27:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if you buy ,buy with all the gears and jaws
[2024-02-05T11:28:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Separated it's more expensive
[2024-02-05T11:28:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than you need some better cutting tools and an indicator clock 🤔 Fluids to help And there is lot to learn before you start it!!!! All these are pretty dangerous Chips flying ,rips your finger, clothes or arm in one wrong move So gloves atleast for cleaning and apply stuff in and out ,glasses ,ear protection Good clothes, cant be loose around your hands and face what is close , long hair needs to be tied down also Not to mention,its loud
[2024-02-05T11:39:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On some of these there is gear switch, its made for different purposes some has changeable ones with does usually you could do threads but never tried
[2024-02-05T11:43:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure how you make that
[2024-02-05T11:43:54] haku: gotcha. thank you. ill look more into it
[2024-02-05T11:46:27] cihan: Thanks, front wheel is non driven and 6001, I guess rear is 6003 since g30 uses 6003 but still couldn't find.
[2024-02-05T11:48:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Anyway Pls use this chat for help and not chit chat about wall of text , questions what cant be answered short and ends in lot more conversation better in general. This place is for help ,when you struggle irl With long chatting here ,help factor decreases and ppl who able to help wont pay attention and gets lost near the lot other messages. So pls
[2024-02-05T11:52:20] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-02-05T11:52:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maximum agreed and respected answer, i have enough ppl on my back

[2024-02-05T11:56:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I really wonder why they start use vcc now also
[2024-02-05T11:56:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean that shit existed in 2006 esc
[2024-02-05T11:56:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All nitro and such had key start
[2024-02-05T11:57:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's g30
[2024-02-05T11:57:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I already told the size 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-05T12:04:02] sombre_enfant: Amazing price for this better than 75200 just a bit more expensive but it has dcdc fase philter and Bluetooth, might kill spintend 85200
[2024-02-05T12:04:37] sombre_enfant: It need 380v or 480v tri phase setup
[2024-02-05T12:06:27] Konstantin: Y, need to order,,, donate 1 to me!)) Yesterday they add it to AliExpress, not only on tao bao... S8 85100 version (exists on tao tao)
[2024-02-05T12:07:39] sombre_enfant: S8 85100? Why tao bao u in china ?
[2024-02-05T12:09:41] Mirono escooters: Yep incredible
[2024-02-05T12:09:45] Mirono escooters: They solved all issues afaik
[2024-02-05T12:10:08] Mirono escooters: They found a good engineer lol
[2024-02-05T12:12:41] Konstantin: No, I'm in the center Europe;)
[2024-02-05T12:13:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just renewed all wiring of workshop zone last year, even all wires one size bigger , Love 400 v machines My drill press is like that, could work with 230v also but torque is different
[2024-02-05T12:14:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe even better stuff
[2024-02-05T12:15:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But 🤔 fan fact When you run into a garage What is only for that lathe and you need to buy even the building, coz doesnt fit out the door
[2024-02-05T12:16:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There you might need more than 3*16 A fuses ,but nowdays 25a is common also thanks to heat exchanger heat Systems
[2024-02-05T12:19:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hope some of us tests it some day
[2024-02-05T12:25:16] cihan: I wonder the same thing, I was probably too hasty for 75200.
[2024-02-05T12:25:53] Mirono escooters: Afaik yes
[2024-02-05T12:37:08] Mirono escooters: The esk8 thread
[2024-02-05T13:08:57] cihan: Is it forum.esk8.news?
[2024-02-05T13:16:02] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-02-05T13:16:11] Mirono escooters: Fb mentioned it on schematics
[2024-02-05T13:16:18] Mirono escooters: I haven't looked into it yet, no time
[2024-02-05T13:22:09] Happy Giraffe: Micrometer a must when lathing😁
[2024-02-05T13:22:24] Happy Giraffe: I tried today the 10€ Alie one and it works fantastic😂 (accurate to 0.01mm)
[2024-02-05T13:23:14] Happy Giraffe: US freedom landia 220v considered high voltage😂
[2024-02-05T13:59:50] Mirono escooters: Some are knowledged
[2024-02-05T13:59:54] Mirono escooters: I do my filtering :p
[2024-02-05T14:00:02] Mirono escooters: I'll confirm later
[2024-02-05T14:28:06] Jason Nelson: Bird batteries are unpotted
[2024-02-05T14:28:25] Jason Nelson: They are ip 67 though I believe
[2024-02-05T14:28:45] Jason Nelson: They use gaskets instead of potting
[2024-02-05T14:30:22] Jason Nelson: 277/480 is considered high voltage. 208/240 is two 120 legs which is low voltage(even though technically I believe anything under 50v is considered low voltage)
[2024-02-05T14:30:22] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-05T14:51:44] Gabe Enzo: Oh god, mirono you were right. Monorim is shit. bearings are so bad. Too many moving parts.
[2024-02-05T14:52:56] Gabe Enzo: So much dirt got in there
[2024-02-05T15:06:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2024-02-05T15:15:36] Mirono escooters: Jaj I was right again
[2024-02-05T15:15:39] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2024-02-05T16:51:46] Gabe Enzo: Hi
[2024-02-05T16:51:57] Gabe Enzo: Mind showing us the parts you used?
[2024-02-05T16:52:34] Gabe Enzo: Show us how you fit that motor on that monorim rear
[2024-02-05T16:53:35] Ion: Oh god... https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1ahv9ae/new_water_cooled_yume/
[2024-02-05T16:54:01] Ion: So they need WATERCOOLED controllers for 8Kw? What?
[2024-02-05T16:54:39] Ion: Should have spent the engineering on eliminating the need for the steering damper 😅
[2024-02-05T16:55:09] Mirono escooters: Hahahahahahaahhaha
[2024-02-05T16:55:11] Mirono escooters: For what
[2024-02-05T17:08:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can see some extra *washers" more like adapters on main axle and now its one axle, also the top side is not fully done as it looks
[2024-02-05T18:19:25] Gabe Enzo: LOL Xbox told me that it'll cost 350€ to fix the console because of a broken hdmi port
[2024-02-05T18:20:42] Gabe Enzo: I sent it off anyway, I said it's a factory defect. chance they do it for free who knows.
[2024-02-05T18:27:27] cihan: Do Xiaomi , Ninebot , Segway under 1000w scooters almost always use 6003 for rear wheel driven ones?

[2024-02-05T18:28:01] NetworkDir: 6 parts and 1 part take 8 hour
[2024-02-05T18:34:46] cihan: I won't change it now. I'll have to open, check and close if I open now. Then I'll have to open again once more to change later. So I thought someone knew that already.
[2024-02-05T18:38:05] cihan: Sorry but I don't remember I was replied with a clear answer, I should check it.
[2024-02-05T19:08:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It was in off chat , And i said in two f series I faced 6203bearings in the motor and 6001 in the single rim

[2024-02-05T20:33:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True ,but this is why facebook or any timeline needs some modifying before new gf😁

[2024-02-05T21:00:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁 Not really a monkey but true
[2024-02-05T21:01:39] haku: i was looking up orangutan titties on youtube and this popped up lol
[2024-02-05T21:01:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think if she attractive for you and has nice personality is good ,sizes dont matter
[2024-02-05T21:02:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on what you looking for A girl to keep or a bitch😅
[2024-02-05T21:03:07] Happy Giraffe: Good silicone kept my motors brand new despite all the rain and abuse
[2024-02-05T21:03:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: An old mate of mine who never wanted a wife to keep, Said something what is.. pretty interesting He said decide what you want A woman who you pay all your life or some you pay time to time 😅
[2024-02-05T21:04:57] cihan: Do you mean usual neutral silicone which cures by time and seals? I asked since removing old silicone was always painful. So I thought if it was some kind of silicone which could be removed easier.
[2024-02-05T21:05:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That red fucker on the blade , that was an overkill but worked
[2024-02-05T21:06:10] haku: this hits hard. ive been divorced. i never beat or hurt my exwife but looking back at it i wish i did.
[2024-02-05T21:06:41] haku: her lawyer turned her into a demon
[2024-02-05T21:07:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont know what you talking about, good neutral outdoor type never gets solid , why you would want to remove it ,whole concept to stay there also its a tiny layer
[2024-02-05T21:08:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Remove,use brake cleaner helps to take it off
[2024-02-05T21:09:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is better stuff but wont say to buy since expensive and you wont daily use
[2024-02-05T21:09:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mipa cleaner shortly
[2024-02-05T21:10:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pretty sad
[2024-02-05T21:10:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But basically she had stupid idea to divorce i guess so
[2024-02-05T21:11:52] cihan: I understood what you mean. So very very thin layer should be fine. In general you also renew the sealant each time you open what it seals. That's why I wanted to ask. Removing old silicone from shower completely took me like 3 hours. I used to buy some silicone cleaners but they didn't really work. I didn't try brake cleaner spray that time.
[2024-02-05T21:12:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,i cant say too much ,but i say it pisses me also
[2024-02-05T21:13:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,i Always clean housing with that , alu dont mind
[2024-02-05T21:14:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i use wd40 to help Bearings get loose and you need to wash oils before new silicone,coz wont stick
[2024-02-05T21:15:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also dont apply brake cleaner on new bearing
[2024-02-05T21:15:24] cihan: I used isopropyl alcohol for cleaning housing and old bearing too. I didn't use wd40 because I wasn't sure if I could remove it completely with isopropyl alcohol.
[2024-02-05T21:17:51] cihan: Wd40 has little greasing and degreasing things inside so I generally don't want to apply it on surfaces I want to be totally clean before greasing or applying any sealant. I'm just not sure if I'll be able to remove everything left over from wd40.
[2024-02-05T21:20:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brake cleaner,just told you
[2024-02-05T21:21:03] cihan: Do they clean without leaving residue? I recently bought a few cans to use later on.
[2024-02-05T21:21:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Other what i said is silicone remover from mipa ,car paint job preparing stuff
[2024-02-05T21:21:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How would they leave anything
[2024-02-05T21:21:58] cihan: Is it dichloromethane? I mean product from Mipa.
[2024-02-05T21:22:57] cihan: That's great if they don't leave any residue. I could use it for fan bearings too then
[2024-02-05T21:24:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12679@05-02-2024_21-24-14.jpg>
[2024-02-05T21:24:28] cihan: Thanks, I'll check it.
[2024-02-05T21:24:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bunch of other company makes such
[2024-02-05T21:25:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its for cleaning,but i use only for the silicone remove,apply on a piece of fabric
[2024-02-05T21:25:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brake cleaner much cheaper solution
[2024-02-05T21:26:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I also use to use this on xiaomi and ninebot handlebar plastic
[2024-02-05T21:26:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Most ppl never cleans it and even sticks to touch
[2024-02-05T21:27:04] cihan: The silicone cleaner I bought before was 2 usd for 200ml bottle but didn't work.
[2024-02-05T21:27:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When they get it back think its new for a while ,but only clean and gets same color back when it was new
[2024-02-05T21:27:50] cihan: It's not dichloromethane then. I just use dish soap and it was enough until now.
[2024-02-05T21:27:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure what type it was and its for cleaning x kind of "dirts"
[2024-02-05T21:29:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure what you used that for
[2024-02-05T21:29:37] cihan: Dichloromethane strips off any paint, plastic, pvc and melts it. But it's not sold pure in Europe because of regulations. Inhaling it can cause heart attack. It's also used for making decafeine coffee. In general very useful when used with caution.
[2024-02-05T21:30:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know what that is ,just telling
[2024-02-05T21:30:56] cihan: Ahh, I used it to remove paint from old iron door and then repainted it.
[2024-02-05T21:31:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nowdays all makes same with Co with coffe
[2024-02-05T21:31:49] cihan: I'm sorry, I couldn't understand this one.
[2024-02-05T21:31:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its more industrial use than personal
[2024-02-05T21:32:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Non makes coffe decaffiene with that nowdays to expensive
[2024-02-05T21:32:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Co gas is able
[2024-02-05T21:33:03] cihan: Yes, I used to buy from a laboratory chemical materials seller. It wasn't available pure as a market product.
[2024-02-05T21:33:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All.old style paint removers were changed back in time , now mostly all is shitty
[2024-02-05T21:34:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Body brand remover is good,but expensive
[2024-02-05T21:34:01] cihan: I got it. Yes, it wasn't cheap.
[2024-02-05T21:36:31] cihan: They probably want to use safer chemicals. I read about many deaths while removing old glaze from bath tub with dichloromethane. It's reasonable to ban it. Employers mostly don't care and unfortunately employees also don't care about safety and don't use the safety equipment they're given.
[2024-02-05T21:37:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, dont need to work there if they dont care
[2024-02-05T21:38:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also to remove shit like that from bath tube is stupid there is special overpaint ,if not good change it 😅
[2024-02-05T21:39:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Never saw some tried to remove that
[2024-02-05T21:39:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Where are you from ,if i can ask?
[2024-02-05T21:47:10] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/Py6Ybga7e6I?si=nQPPwRABEJOONUJb
[2024-02-05T21:50:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅🤣
[2024-02-05T21:52:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well more easy if you dont marry them , Than like a phone You go and get a new model😁
[2024-02-05T21:54:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or get a spice girl type , she probably has different personality but comes with a pocket what can or already bought new tits for her self🤣
[2024-02-05T21:54:53] cihan: Changing costs much more where craftsmanship is cheap and there's no labor class . That's the reason. I'm from Turkey. And you?
[2024-02-05T21:55:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just make sure pocket full is not from OF😏
[2024-02-05T21:56:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: OF starts with only 😀🫡rest you guys sort
[2024-02-05T21:59:34] Mirono escooters: Yet
[2024-02-05T22:00:22] cihan: It's nice to know you haven't had. I read many death news when I discovered DCM and searched about it. By the way I didn't know you were a chemist, that's nice to know.)
[2024-02-05T22:04:35] cihan: I remembered an old memory. I used to close the shaker containing 40% cyanide with my thumb to shake in high school and nothing happened. Someone else was using the closing mechanism for that bottle and I didn't want to wait for it . Chemistry teacher use to go mad.)
[2024-02-05T22:06:53] Happy Giraffe: Hhahahahha, should have been prestine condition inside. I used that scoot as a submarine lol
[2024-02-05T22:08:17] haku: isnt chloroform the stuff used for kidnapping?
[2024-02-05T22:08:28] haku: puts people to sleep
[2024-02-05T22:10:16] haku: i see. kinda like the dentist chemical
[2024-02-05T22:11:00] cihan: Real scientist :) You've tried it on yourself to observe effects.
[2024-02-05T22:21:34] haku: good thing you guys in the EU have most chemicals available. here most stuff are banned or hard to get a hold off
[2024-02-05T22:22:47] haku: even the old paint stripper formula has been banned
[2024-02-05T22:23:57] cihan: Are you in US?
[2024-02-05T22:23:59] haku: btw whats a good chemical to strip paint from aluminum
[2024-02-05T22:24:03] haku: yes
[2024-02-05T22:26:42] cihan: I only know DCM which works really well. As far as I know it's still sold in Europe inside paint strippers but ratio cannot exceed 20 or 25%. Is it totally banned in US?
[2024-02-05T22:27:24] haku: gotcha. im not too sure but they did change the formula of paint strippers in 2019 or something
[2024-02-05T22:34:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hungary

[2024-02-06T11:35:38] Mirono escooters: What electrical engineer is worthy to design a cool component if it can't be in a nice box :)
[2024-02-06T11:35:45] Mirono escooters: Like a charger , gotta make it nice
[2024-02-06T11:35:50] Mirono escooters: Heh?
[2024-02-06T11:35:59] Mirono escooters: 100% infill and it'll just take longer U got time
[2024-02-06T11:36:09] Mirono escooters: *sweats in 3 days print*
[2024-02-06T11:36:13] Gabe Enzo: That is if it won't start warping.
[2024-02-06T11:36:15] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-02-06T11:36:21] Mirono escooters: Clean bed, hot bed, no warping
[2024-02-06T11:36:29] Gabe Enzo: does bambu support ender 3 pro?
[2024-02-06T11:36:32] Gabe Enzo: I can't seem to find it
[2024-02-06T11:36:35] Mirono escooters: 3D lac if it's really a problem
[2024-02-06T11:36:36] Mirono escooters: Cura bro
[2024-02-06T11:36:39] Mirono escooters: And use brim if warp
[2024-02-06T11:37:08] Gabe Enzo: I haven't solved the issue of it not letting me use a brim as it claims the bed is too small. I'll see if I can fix that now.
[2024-02-06T11:37:21] Mirono escooters: Well if it goes out of proportions
[2024-02-06T11:37:29] Mirono escooters: Enable brim size setting And lower it
[2024-02-06T11:37:42] Gabe Enzo: It totally doesn't. but I think happy giraffe said theres an option to select bed size
[2024-02-06T11:37:46] Mirono escooters: I've got a mm off my edge on this print 😂 can't even use skirt.
[2024-02-06T11:39:12] Gabe Enzo: Does vedder know that the mac version of vesc tool is totally fucked?
[2024-02-06T11:39:29] Gabe Enzo: Not that I care anymore, I switched to windows. But it was a big trouble for me when I did use Mac
[2024-02-06T11:39:48] Gabe Enzo: It'll definitely cause major issues for future Mac users
[2024-02-06T11:48:55] Mirono escooters: Ionno
[2024-02-06T11:48:58] Mirono escooters: Who uses mac
[2024-02-06T11:52:23] haku: my reverse engineered china clone of miros design is 15%infill for budget reasons. but the real one will be 100%

[2024-02-06T12:01:07] Gabe Enzo: the ameritards are still arguing with me on Instagram about that surron. I said "yeah sure how does your surron have 19kw if your cells can't put that out" he said" lol this xyz motor handles 20kw and it's in there
[2024-02-06T12:02:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I agree
[2024-02-06T12:04:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What printer you have?
[2024-02-06T12:05:19] Gabe Enzo: i solved the issue.

[2024-02-06T12:06:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I slice with simplify there is no such thing as what machine,you just give the size and go But needs some knowledge

[2024-02-06T12:39:42] puneDir: Not so cold not so hot
[2024-02-06T13:14:03] Unknown: Good morning guys. I need help. My bike performs well but seems like the speed is restricted. I’m looking for help to tune this bad boy to the moon. I’m running a Tronic 750 with a72v 200a rated /300 max discharge. Motor is Qs205 3.5t. I’m definitely not experiencing thermal issues. The controller stays very cool & I’ve disconnected the motor temp sensor because I had issues with the incorrect temperature readings for the kty sensor. Curious to know if anyone has a qs205 running with a vesc & getting proper temperature readings.
[2024-02-06T13:27:52] Ion: anyone here have some ebike tips or builds to share :) looking for some ideas
[2024-02-06T13:28:09] Ion: for instance, what kind of frame/bike to choose, and mid-drive or rear hub?
[2024-02-06T14:04:20] Unknown: I think I’m doing around 60-65. Ive definitely gotten 75 mph with the sabvoton 72150
[2024-02-06T14:09:14] Unknown: Don’t know how to explain it but it seems like the bike has more power but it’s capped. I been seriously researching & I’m kinda coming to the conclusion of the motor resistance being incorrect but don’t know the actual resistance of the Qs205. I know that the resistance changes which motor temperature but it’s actually not getting hot or overheating

[2024-02-06T14:33:43] francois schempers: but nice build 😁👌
[2024-02-06T15:49:36] haku: this roadrunner is cool. and the other bikes too.
[2024-02-06T16:02:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Is there field weakening?
[2024-02-06T16:04:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pictures shows yours or some what you were looking at?
[2024-02-06T17:04:36] Happy Giraffe: I have a Macbook, but running dual boot Windows aswell😂 When microsoft fucks up a mandatory update I atleast have one working computer😂
[2024-02-06T17:05:40] Happy Giraffe: Just like Denis does, posting cat images
[2024-02-06T17:06:38] Happy Giraffe: Dual suspension steel frame with wide rear dropout so you can fit a bigger motor like QS90😁
[2024-02-06T17:07:29] Happy Giraffe: If laws are not a problem then 250cc dirt bike or chinese cross bike is perfect for QS138🔥
[2024-02-06T17:08:15] Happy Giraffe: Avoid hubs and go for mid drive😁 This gonna upset the fanboys here but idc
[2024-02-06T17:22:46] Face de Pin Sucé: this is the wat
[2024-02-06T17:22:47] Face de Pin Sucé: way
[2024-02-06T17:27:18] haku: i like both but for bike conversions hub is bolt on.
[2024-02-06T17:29:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just telling that awd version and front hub version beated all fuel bikes in dirt bike world, and the why is easy
[2024-02-06T17:30:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: While mid and rear hub has to brake Front and awd dont
[2024-02-06T17:31:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Front drive was banned ,awd didn't even meet fuel bike races
[2024-02-06T17:31:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In cross lot turns on dirt and sand ,so up to usage is a point also
[2024-02-06T17:36:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But as you like Even a coin has 3 sides ,i just say lets not corner it Probably speed e moto mid drive to have stability 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-06T17:39:23] Happy Giraffe: IPM least weight, center weight as in real moto, best cooling, no unsprung mass🤔
[2024-02-06T17:40:24] haku: agree to all this. im just saying hubs are bolt on and easy to find frames for it.
[2024-02-06T17:41:37] Happy Giraffe: Im sad QS90 too wide for a bicycle and would have needed to remove cranks if mounted near bottom bracket😂
[2024-02-06T17:43:11] haku: this is what i mean. for bike conversions mid drive needs some placement and hub is bolt on if your dropouts fit. this is why its most common
[2024-02-06T17:44:29] haku: for regular day to day use and not offroading or snow riding. qs205 would be a good choice
[2024-02-06T17:49:17] Happy Giraffe: BBSHD also bolt on but then chainline issues if you dont know what you are doing😁
[2024-02-06T17:49:44] Happy Giraffe: Or the market mid drives that are horrible with chain and cassette wear, even at that low power
[2024-02-06T17:59:03] Ion: thanks for the photos, something like this looks really cool and is something I thought about
[2024-02-06T17:59:52] Ion: thats the other thing, maybe a big frame (like a mtb) would be more comfortable?
[2024-02-06T18:00:04] haku: its a roadrunner
[2024-02-06T18:00:28] Ion: and a MTB based build would have pedals, making it look more legal
[2024-02-06T18:00:46] Ion: Sadly can't consider a Sur ron or moto conversion here
[2024-02-06T18:02:15] Ion: Thing is, all full suspension MTBs are really expensive, and its difficult to make the battery look like it fits
[2024-02-06T18:02:24] haku: mtb conversion with hub might be stealthy
[2024-02-06T18:03:20] haku: theres a community of mtb converted ebikes. they have crazy cell layouts
[2024-02-06T18:03:44] Ion: Yeah its mostly those triangle batteries in the middle of the frame. Looks... eh
[2024-02-06T18:04:01] Happy Giraffe: Get a big ass DH bike. Not worthy to use a weak mtb frame
[2024-02-06T18:04:40] Happy Giraffe: And as you were in US? Might support local guys and get a Lightning Rods motor😁
[2024-02-06T18:04:50] haku: that would be optimal but hes in eu i think
[2024-02-06T18:05:00] Ion: austria, EU lol
[2024-02-06T18:05:17] Happy Giraffe: Oh Austria nvm then haha. Whats the ebike law there?
[2024-02-06T18:05:20] Ion: In the US I'd just get a sur ron with all the powah
[2024-02-06T18:05:38] Ion: 25km/h, 250W power, but throttle possible
[2024-02-06T18:06:05] haku: in us get a real moto frame and convert it to electric. put pedals and boom legal
[2024-02-06T18:06:12] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, so even BBSHD too much?🤔 Here I can have a "1000w" on throttle 25kmh with moped insurance
[2024-02-06T18:06:44] Ion: yea... but I'm not planning on following that I think :)
[2024-02-06T18:07:13] Ion: VESC and speed limit should be fine, same as on scooter, just don't get caught
[2024-02-06T18:07:34] Happy Giraffe: Maybe you could get BBSHD and do 72v on that. I have a friend helping me with mine. Currently saving money for batt etc
[2024-02-06T18:08:14] Ion: How many kw can a BBSHD handle? and how much power can bike drive train components handle?
[2024-02-06T18:08:15] Happy Giraffe: Yeah and BBSHD being popular on bicycles you can say its on 250w mode😁
[2024-02-06T18:08:48] Ion: I'd probably still do VESC tho, I heard you can run the BBSHD with external controller too
[2024-02-06T18:09:34] Happy Giraffe: Depends, on right gearing does 4kw~ and beyond at 72v but I think can push it much more. I will test it later. Being IPM motor with gearing reduction it gives constant wheelies I heard😅
[2024-02-06T18:10:32] Ion: sounds fun lol, do the internal gears keep up with so much power? also need to worry about chain and rear gears?
[2024-02-06T18:11:29] haku: rear sprocket size will change the gearing
[2024-02-06T18:12:11] Happy Giraffe: Needs metal or PEEK gear upgrade. For drivetrain single speed bicycle chain is enough. Motor has 1:21.9 reduction and if used with 42T front chainring then I heard 36T at rear is good for bicycle size tire
[2024-02-06T18:14:19] Happy Giraffe: Bottleneck will be usually the frame, regular Trek MTB wont be strong enough
[2024-02-06T18:15:13] Happy Giraffe: Thats why I got this bad boy😁
[2024-02-06T18:17:01] haku: where will you fit the mid drive?
[2024-02-06T18:25:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Usually its before the pedal depends which
[2024-02-06T18:26:45] haku: you with snowing all year long mid drive is a must
[2024-02-06T18:27:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont say you have no point,but awd still makes half the heat ,with no struggle since you have two engine's not one
[2024-02-06T18:27:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That still rear drive what slips more
[2024-02-06T18:28:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They have 4 day summer 😁
[2024-02-06T18:28:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Joking
[2024-02-06T18:29:02] haku: no snow and barely rain here. folks dont know how to drive in the rain too
[2024-02-06T18:29:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They use to say this about Norway
[2024-02-06T18:32:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah like in dropping names Nfr
[2024-02-06T18:32:53] Happy Giraffe: Mounts to bottom bracket and hangs from there
[2024-02-06T18:33:25] Happy Giraffe: Bro we have a summer too... Upto +25°c we not north pole😂
[2024-02-06T18:33:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also when one us has the fuck you money we be build similar near both and compare
[2024-02-06T18:33:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤣🤣🤣
[2024-02-06T18:34:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Santa Happy claus

[2024-02-06T18:34:55] Happy Giraffe: 72v bbshd will kick ass. Will hopefully get it up and running on next Fall before winter👍
[2024-02-06T18:35:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 👍
[2024-02-06T18:36:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I still have some nonsense in mind , Maybe better to keep it
[2024-02-06T18:39:41] Happy Giraffe: Haha, Im cool with different opinions. Nowadays snowlakes cant handle if someone thinks differently😂

[2024-02-06T18:48:27] Gabe Enzo: Holy shit. @Mirono_escooters I took some Adderall to reverse My fork on my monorim. Then I just realized now that I put it back together without reversing the forks.

[2024-02-06T18:50:20] puneDir: Im turning my zero10x to 20s
[2024-02-06T18:50:28] Gabe Enzo: Let's fucking go
[2024-02-06T18:50:38] puneDir: With stock escs but its fine
[2024-02-06T18:51:10] Gabe Enzo: You know how to mod them?
[2024-02-06T18:51:22] puneDir: Yes
[2024-02-06T18:52:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Better not add more comments,coz devil sits on my shoulder
[2024-02-06T18:53:31] Mirono escooters: Punedir speedrunning unreliable escs
[2024-02-06T19:01:49] puneDir: Theyre reliable actually
[2024-02-06T19:02:43] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2024-02-06T19:03:04] Mirono escooters: Didn't that mos die a week ago And I refuse zero 10x in shop since last scooter, for reasons :)
[2024-02-06T19:06:01] haku: how many 21700 can fit zero10x?
[2024-02-06T19:06:16] puneDir: Zero
[2024-02-06T19:07:59] haku: i want to do this with vsett 9 too i wonder if deck size is similar. its just the 8.5 wheels keeping me. not much motor options available too
[2024-02-06T19:17:16] Happy Giraffe: Damn how much money you could make by fabricating a proper scooter frame😅
[2024-02-06T19:17:38] Happy Giraffe: If frame sold at 1500€ could still be valuable purchase for ultimate builds
[2024-02-06T19:20:48] haku: idk why no one has done this yet in a manufacturing level. scooter scene is just too small no offense compared to bikes and emotos
[2024-02-06T19:21:37] haku: and brand loyalty too. it will be difficult i think to sell to the hardcore brand fans
[2024-02-06T19:24:18] haku: it be cool though to make a ultimate universal frame for enthusiasts and modders. but those guys usually stick to thier favorite brand
[2024-02-06T19:31:02] Happy Giraffe: Chinese love to produce dogshit idk why. Rich western people have no issue dropping bigger money so they could also control high-end market
[2024-02-06T19:34:30] haku: yes but scooter scene is just too small.like how many rions are there? and other high end scooters. china just dominates this market. only the racing folks and the hardcore will pay for this kind of service.
[2024-02-06T19:35:38] haku: im sure there is still a market for that. like the china laotie frame is like the universal frame kinda like the bomber frames of scooters.
[2024-02-06T19:35:54] haku: its just so badly designed
[2024-02-06T19:35:58] Happy Giraffe: If volume not high then could compete as a builder🤔 too bad making a dead square frame is tough af
[2024-02-06T19:38:10] haku: will be awsome though when scooter racing becomes mainstream.
[2024-02-06T19:40:06] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-02-06T19:40:35] Mirono escooters: I have a qs273 You need the special temp sensor Not regular
[2024-02-06T19:41:17] Happy Giraffe: The 25kmh 250w law killed it in europe, riding on modded scooter already gave me a fine of 400€ in denmark...and police dynoed it to go 30kmh lmao. I was worse criminal than a child rapist it seems
[2024-02-06T19:42:02] haku: lol the dyno blows my mind. thats crazy
[2024-02-06T19:42:31] Happy Giraffe: Did you try all the KTY options on vesc? I have Mxus 3K that works ok on the other KTY option
[2024-02-06T19:43:19] haku: here in the US its mostly ebikes and emoto modding. so few stick to scooters.
[2024-02-06T19:44:50] haku: folks here just buy a nami/dualtron or kaabo and stay with that. only modding lights and handlebars
[2024-02-06T19:45:06] Happy Giraffe: Proper ebike is pure love, too bad 6 month wait😅
[2024-02-06T19:45:22] Happy Giraffe: Light mod = speed

[2024-02-06T19:54:13] Unknown: Most are/were mine but all were modified by me
[2024-02-06T19:56:28] Happy Giraffe: Cool👍
[2024-02-06T19:58:03] Unknown: Works on kty but beta values are incorrect because the temperature rises rapidly when the motor is not even hot
[2024-02-06T20:00:50] Happy Giraffe: How rapidly?🤔 If sensor is directly at phase then its correct. If also cools down fast then its perfect. Coils conduct heat really bad to the outer shell even with ferrofluid
[2024-02-06T20:01:10] Happy Giraffe: What kind of phase currents are you using when it happens?
[2024-02-06T20:01:16] Unknown: Can you possibly share your temp settings?
[2024-02-06T20:01:54] Happy Giraffe: I have both NTC 10k and KTY, NTC much smoother sensor. Stock vesc values were good, you can trust them
[2024-02-06T20:02:15] Happy Giraffe: If it shows correct ambient after leaving motor sit for couple hours then all good
[2024-02-06T20:07:42] Unknown: It’s independent of phase current. The temperature just rises rapidly & throw motor over temperature. I kinda got it working but the temperature is definitely incorrect it stays negative but it doesn’t shut the vesc down. I just like for everything to work right. Just in case my motor is actually running hot, I’d love to know
[2024-02-06T20:09:00] Happy Giraffe: Both KTY options give that behaviour? Have you tried the NTC options if thats what you have?🤔 Whatever gives correct ambient and after that nothing random when riding
[2024-02-06T20:38:17] Happy Giraffe: This, temp sensor prevented my motor from burning. Start temp 60°c before slow start uphill that had 30cm snow...worst case for a hub but still made it even with slight throttling😅
[2024-02-06T22:04:43] Unknown: I have kty122.
[2024-02-06T22:08:21] Happy Giraffe: Send a screen recording of the vesc screen like this so we can see whats happening
[2024-02-06T22:08:58] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2024-02-06T22:22:52] Yamal: All use 6.0 firmware?
[2024-02-06T22:29:31] Ion: Same here, also paid a fine on my Vsett. I think modded G30 is great since it's not that visible + ebike is something I'm looking into
[2024-02-06T22:29:52] Ion: I wonder if the excuse "I was just pedalling" works when they see you at 50+km/h 😂
[2024-02-06T22:35:52] Konstantin: No, 5.03 6.02 6.05 ;)
[2024-02-06T22:38:34] Happy Giraffe: Better not get caught at those speeds, I choose my roads where I go faster but typically cops here dont give a damn if you are not a danger to anyone
[2024-02-06T22:42:55] Yamal: Still have 5.03
[2024-02-06T22:59:39] haku: what if you were going 50kph downhill on a kick scooter or a bike would they still pull you over?
[2024-02-06T23:08:54] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/0cNjroxaAj4?si=Th0Po0-I0vB1LkT2
[2024-02-06T23:15:43] Happy Giraffe: Propably if it has motor and they measure you🤔
[2024-02-06T23:17:06] haku: some bikes can go 50kmh downhill. like road bikes. would they get a pass. lets say if the bike has no motor but electronic shifter.
[2024-02-06T23:32:10] Happy Giraffe: I go downhill 60kmh with mtb😂 Even normal pedaling speed 30kmh or more. Can't stand traveling slowly
[2024-02-06T23:32:41] Gabe Enzo: I went 70kmh down and hit a pothole and I got raped by the seat.
[2024-02-06T23:33:31] Gabe Enzo: On a road bike
[2024-02-06T23:38:53] Happy Giraffe: 94kmh downhill record on my current one, need to hit 100kmh on flat road🤔
[2024-02-06T23:52:38] haku: do cops mess with you when you going those speeds?
[2024-02-07T00:43:24] Unknown: How do I record the screen?
[2024-02-07T00:55:02] Chris Culver: What does it mean when my Ubox is beeping and flashing when it gets power?
[2024-02-07T00:55:34] Chris Culver: 3 beeps every say...3 seconds
[2024-02-07T01:19:20] haku: <photos/photo_12712@07-02-2024_01-19-20.jpg>
[2024-02-07T01:19:26] haku: anyone use this infill pattern?
[2024-02-07T01:45:50] Ion: Yep, probably to check if the motor "helps" you ride past 25kph
[2024-02-07T01:46:24] Ion: But technically, on a normal non-electric bike, you only need to follow the speed limit. So you could go 100 legally
[2024-02-07T01:49:10] haku: crazy laws. eu wants fit citizens. no motor assisted speed lol
[2024-02-07T02:33:47] Ion: Shit is boring mostly... A sur ron would need plates, a license, insurance, and inspection. And is limited to 45kph with all of that 😂
[2024-02-07T04:08:35] haku: do you guys think that spintend 85/200 has 2 battery inputs is because they want us to use 2 qs8 connectors for least resistance? or is it meant to be soldered to one qs8?
[2024-02-07T04:10:03] haku: gotcha! it got me thinking. thanks
[2024-02-07T04:11:02] haku: qs8 only can do 100-150a i think.
[2024-02-07T05:45:30] Happy Giraffe: Use phones screen recorder or download from app store or Google play
[2024-02-07T06:00:57] Happy Giraffe: On local hobby airfield, no😁

[2024-02-07T10:36:28] @Súperpatin: Could you recommend a good controller ? , good quality and good price, I have the flipsky 75/100, it does not support all the temperature I need, for my project, this It doesn't support the amount of amperage that my motor needs, it gets hot if it stops accelerating
[2024-02-07T10:51:19] Konstantin: 100/500 trampa ;) Melt you motor xD
[2024-02-07T10:52:21] Tommy ª: how much? im using the 75100 at 120amps without issues
[2024-02-07T10:57:15] @Súperpatin: <photos/photo_12716@07-02-2024_10-57-15.jpg>
[2024-02-07T10:58:17] @Súperpatin: I'm using this one, I put 300 amps on it and it gets too hot.
[2024-02-07T11:00:09] Tommy ª: bruh you want 150kmh? 😭
[2024-02-07T11:01:11] @Súperpatin: It runs great in the air, but when I go outside it makes a lot of noise due to lack of amperage and when I give it more amps it heats up and stops.
[2024-02-07T11:03:04] @Súperpatin: No, I'm satisfied with 90 kilometers!
[2024-02-07T11:03:40] Tommy ª: man with 120 phase and 45amp battery i do over 67kmh 😭 💀💀💀💀💀v
[2024-02-07T11:04:53] @Súperpatin: and what engine do you have?
[2024-02-07T11:07:05] Tommy ª: 8 pole 40v 1500w inrunner 11t sprocket + 64 rear sprocket + 11inch wheels casually a friend with a wheel-motor style its pushing about 180 amps for reach 70kmh bruh
[2024-02-07T11:09:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Happened with me ,i was kinda racing cars In traffic, but main reason was ppl were aasholes and had to show them, so i speed up as the light turned green , after 3 corners police passed me ,one of almost half way out the window, yelling this not race track , Than went away 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-07T11:10:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Any pedal race biker does 50 by foot
[2024-02-07T11:11:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's why they go on the road , bike lane is only 30 in law
[2024-02-07T11:12:42] Happy Giraffe: Hell no, its either grid or cubic😂
[2024-02-07T11:12:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I use similar for support
[2024-02-07T11:13:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah me infill is grid
[2024-02-07T11:14:17] Happy Giraffe: Cubic best for bigger parts, creates 3D triangles inside and is strong af
[2024-02-07T11:14:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Here on bikes we have law, Pedal with 25 kmh limit is ebike Throttle or bigger speed you are a moped, so all rules are up to you what that has ,like helmet
[2024-02-07T11:16:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Will try

[2024-02-07T11:27:19] @Súperpatin: It heats up a lot and it stops on its own, stops accelerating, the temperature rises excessively

[2024-02-07T11:32:47] Tommy ª: Just thermal paste and screw it in some metallic surface I never got problems
[2024-02-07T11:32:57] Paolo ⁭: No hahaha

[2024-02-07T11:43:19] @Súperpatin: Do you have this same controller design?
[2024-02-07T11:54:15] Tommy ª: Non, I use the boxy one like in the video
[2024-02-07T12:00:28] @Súperpatin: ok, the square one is easier to cool with temperatures with thermal paste and still stuck to a surface to dissipate heat... that may be reasonable
[2024-02-07T12:04:08] Tommy ª: Hmm How you keep that cold?
[2024-02-07T12:41:56] Gabe Enzo: It's kinda cool tho
[2024-02-07T12:42:06] Gabe Enzo: Using such low voltage to go so fast.

[2024-02-07T20:19:59] haku: ill test that. i usually use grid but for toys im testing wich infill uses the least amount of filament but still be rigid
[2024-02-07T20:21:36] haku: when will that new trampa come out.
[2024-02-07T20:27:51] haku: its all good. i remember when i told this group i have a laotie. this one guy made fun of me told me i can put f1 tires on a laotie but its still doodoo. well you can always prove them wrong. yep i will polish a turd. 😂
[2024-02-07T20:28:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fix it,well
[2024-02-07T20:31:31] haku: just let your wallet do the trash talking.
[2024-02-07T20:36:51] haku: you will find folks that will help you here. dont worry buddy.
[2024-02-07T20:57:59] Chris Culver: Ok but it just does that over and over
[2024-02-07T20:58:05] Chris Culver: Wait I think I got it
[2024-02-07T21:10:57] Давно пора: hi all
[2024-02-07T21:11:17] Давно пора: where i can find single 100v100a ubox 6.05 beta?
[2024-02-07T21:38:12] haku: yea this was on the settings on the stl file. very interesting
[2024-02-07T23:01:25] Konstantin: Just don't worry, be happy, not hurry up;)
[2024-02-07T23:19:06] cihan: Desoldering type heat gun?
[2024-02-07T23:29:25] haku: try the solder sucker
[2024-02-08T00:25:16] cihan: It also works. It's better than solder wick, wick is expensive since its pure copper.
[2024-02-08T02:41:42] haku: try one of these. ive had some luck with it.
[2024-02-08T02:44:51] Unknown: Heat 2 pins and pull then do other 2 and rock it back & forth. Or heat and blow solder with compressed air.
[2024-02-08T03:43:40] haku: its a hit and miss. im not a pro at it but ive manage to get it to work.
[2024-02-08T03:43:51] haku: this one from ali
[2024-02-08T04:50:30] cihan: They're useful, metal ones have higher rating. The ones with stronger spring are probably better. Good manufacturers specify vacuum pressure too . You can buy a similar one from aliexpress or local seller.
[2024-02-08T05:41:42] haku: there is a metal one made in japan thats supposed to be the best.
[2024-02-08T07:35:27] @Súperpatin: I feel good, thank God! I thank you for your greeting, and I also apologize for the delay in responding, I am often very busy in the workshop
[2024-02-08T07:42:11] @Súperpatin: It's true! I recognize your intention and I thank you for helping me... you recommended a trap controller, thank you, that helps me a lot and speaks well of you
[2024-02-08T07:49:22] @Súperpatin: Thank you very much, I am one of those who really value their time a lot.

[2024-02-08T11:03:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Creality k1 half price now 😭😭
[2024-02-08T11:06:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What was it? Something shorting?
[2024-02-08T11:13:53] Rose: Hey there Peter, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-08T11:26:05] Happy Giraffe: Still crap😂 My Ender 3 s1 plus half price now compared what I paid for it...grrr...
[2024-02-08T11:28:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why its crap?
[2024-02-08T11:30:15] NetworkDir: Any alternative available for spacer/extender without 3d printer ☠️ ?
[2024-02-08T11:30:38] Happy Giraffe: Creality design choices and the aliepress app that shows you ads
[2024-02-08T11:31:11] Happy Giraffe: Same reasons basically why I needed to replace so many parts of my ender 3 s1 plus to make it work
[2024-02-08T11:31:33] Happy Giraffe: Sure, CNC mill😂
[2024-02-08T11:33:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For pro milled extender exists
[2024-02-08T11:33:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Slinky has one, works flawless till now🤷‍♂
[2024-02-08T11:35:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you register on vesc-project site and purchase free files you can download latest and all beta
[2024-02-08T11:43:51] Happy Giraffe: I would prefer Bambulab P1S any day
[2024-02-08T11:55:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's more like dummy proof ,not magic and overpriced
[2024-02-08T11:59:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Voron can race it
[2024-02-08T12:00:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also some not to happy with ams combo ,but didn't read whole internet
[2024-02-08T12:00:42] Happy Giraffe: AMS wastes ton of filament if change needed many time. Prusa method better but costs way too much
[2024-02-08T12:01:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah and also its advertises as just works
[2024-02-08T12:02:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: While there is still an amount of leaning needed and you can tune it for your needs , that's some time and money on wasted energy and filament 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-08T12:02:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than you even red more about it

[2024-02-08T12:30:29] Finn: its a huge jump
[2024-02-08T12:30:40] Finn: 70 to 71 is double the volume
[2024-02-08T12:40:03] Mirono escooters: Sound is exponential
[2024-02-08T12:40:06] Mirono escooters: (Sadly)
[2024-02-08T12:55:49] Finn: yes
[2024-02-08T12:57:15] Chris Culver: Not sure. I don't have it entirely figured out yet. I think I'm gonna redo all my wiring tomorrow *sigh*
[2024-02-08T13:01:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Best is to check all 👌
[2024-02-08T13:02:16] NetworkDir: 😭
[2024-02-08T13:02:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure what we see

[2024-02-08T13:03:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh than long time or that bent corner
[2024-02-08T13:04:17] NetworkDir: The magnetic pei in the middle of the print was lifted, the glue was lifted
[2024-02-08T13:04:29] NetworkDir: And ripped model
[2024-02-08T13:05:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How it was lifted? By hand or object moved?
[2024-02-08T13:06:19] NetworkDir: Magnetic base glued to bed
[2024-02-08T13:06:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never have such problem on pei

[2024-02-08T13:06:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Glue Started to come up
[2024-02-08T13:06:55] NetworkDir: I reglue and try again for print

[2024-02-08T13:07:03] NetworkDir: I hope don’t happen again
[2024-02-08T13:07:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I cleaned it well when installed mine
[2024-02-08T13:07:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hope so
[2024-02-08T13:08:20] NetworkDir: 40mm spacer is doom
[2024-02-08T13:08:23] haku: p1s is good no regrets. just the small print bed
[2024-02-08T13:09:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda all is small
[2024-02-08T13:09:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can find bigger types but yeah than different problems can come
[2024-02-08T13:11:12] haku: i think bambu will come out with a bigger one soon. i hope they make one with a belt like creality
[2024-02-08T13:12:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Belt ?
[2024-02-08T13:12:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Rail?
[2024-02-08T13:13:04] haku: yes. so you can print infinite width.
[2024-02-08T13:13:58] haku: like a conveyor belt
[2024-02-08T13:14:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohhh
[2024-02-08T13:14:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Now i get it
[2024-02-08T13:18:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure what will come up, but it will be expensive 🤣
[2024-02-08T13:18:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont think they will make belt 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-08T13:19:41] haku: yea i doubt it too.
[2024-02-08T13:21:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,if you go in hardcore,you could build a bigger, only thing is you need to find a bed solution
[2024-02-08T13:23:17] haku: im noob at printing. that be cool project someday.
[2024-02-08T13:24:14] haku: ive seen really big ones in YT that can print a whole statue 😂
[2024-02-08T13:24:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes does are builted also
[2024-02-08T13:25:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i didn't see heated build plate there
[2024-02-08T13:25:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Me either, but i am not afraid from it
[2024-02-08T13:26:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like if i would have a k1 or p1s on the way here ,i would surly modify old ender to something nice
[2024-02-08T13:29:54] haku: thats the thing with enders you can mod it like crazy. make it bigger and faster. bambu is cant do stuff like that. its like a printer for the masses. print and go
[2024-02-08T13:59:40] Finn: Damn
[2024-02-08T14:00:11] Finn: I also use glue on my p1p when printing spacer parts
[2024-02-08T14:00:12] Finn: Works great
[2024-02-08T14:01:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont have issues 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-08T14:44:28] Happy Giraffe: Only PLA doesnt seem to like sticking to textured PEI🌚
[2024-02-08T14:44:54] Happy Giraffe: Carbon fiber PETG so nice...can use 75c bed easily
[2024-02-08T14:46:57] Gabe Enzo: PLA doesn't stick to anything
[2024-02-08T14:49:33] Finn: I got a double sided pei plate and it works fine
[2024-02-08T14:53:00] Happy Giraffe: Found out the hard way when bed wasnt properly tuned with silicone spacers and custom software Mando helmet popped off mid print🙈
[2024-02-08T14:53:15] Happy Giraffe: How do you use the glue?
[2024-02-08T14:54:01] Finn: <photos/photo_12730@08-02-2024_14-54-01.jpg>
[2024-02-08T14:54:21] Finn: <photos/photo_12731@08-02-2024_14-54-21.jpg>
[2024-02-08T14:55:18] Happy Giraffe: You got smooth pei? I should try this too
[2024-02-08T15:23:44] Finn: Double sided textured pei plate
[2024-02-08T15:31:40] francois schempers: anyone selling monorim suspension for ninebot f serie ?

[2024-02-08T17:41:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On pei its easy , peo more tricky
[2024-02-08T17:43:13] Happy Giraffe: PLA didnt stick to PEI textured
[2024-02-08T17:43:46] Happy Giraffe: Nozzle was losing also a bit pressure so didnt squeeze on the plate as hard. Now waiting for service parts from alie
[2024-02-08T17:54:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You have the magnetic base also?
[2024-02-08T17:55:16] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I removed middle plate from it
[2024-02-08T17:56:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And now you see nozzle not enough close ?
[2024-02-08T17:58:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When i installed it i even had to modify z stop to be lower
[2024-02-08T17:58:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Old ass superused ender bed thingy was flat when plate was not
[2024-02-08T17:58:42] Happy Giraffe: Sure, just adhesion sucks. I will try glue next time
[2024-02-08T17:58:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: After perfect lvl was must to move z stop
[2024-02-08T17:59:14] Happy Giraffe: 0.1mm nozzle height I also used
[2024-02-08T17:59:36] Happy Giraffe: Petg wants to fall a little but Pla likes a bit squeezing
[2024-02-08T17:59:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Try bigger
[2024-02-08T18:00:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I had succes on pei with pla and petg also
[2024-02-08T18:00:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For me it works like the in the advertisement 😁
[2024-02-08T18:01:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What you mean fall a little?
[2024-02-08T18:01:40] Happy Giraffe: Larger gap between nozzle and bed
[2024-02-08T18:02:03] Happy Giraffe: Issue elsewhere than height, tried everything
[2024-02-08T18:02:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh than you have save prob like i did

[2024-02-08T18:04:19] Happy Giraffe: Nozzle leaking pressure, cant adjust nozzle against heatbrake as Ching-Chongs decided to epoxy them inside thread so unjustable...
[2024-02-08T18:09:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Read dm and show me what you mean

[2024-02-08T19:48:55] Finn: Wires to back motor are too long
[2024-02-08T19:49:04] Finn: Also it fits nicely
[2024-02-08T19:49:19] francois schempers: if you make then thick enough its not a problem, you gain battery space
[2024-02-08T19:49:32] Finn: I only want 10s3p down there
[2024-02-08T19:49:36] francois schempers: but I understand, I did the same as you ;)

[2024-02-08T20:22:52] haku: i want to do something similar like that. yours is very clean looking
[2024-02-08T20:25:08] haku: what machine makes bends like this on alu or ss? or is this milled on a solid block?
[2024-02-08T20:26:02] Jan: Easy with spintend
[2024-02-08T20:37:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you have some alu bars you can make an adapter ,while they are standing and you have another p
[2024-02-08T20:37:52] Finn: 21s?
[2024-02-08T20:42:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's bent ,with some hidraulic prizm bender

[2024-02-08T20:44:52] Finn: yes but if i want to do 4p its going up not sideways
[2024-02-08T20:46:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you like ,just telling that there is lot space still and for heat , original housing is casted shit with holes ,,but near awd less heat is made
[2024-02-08T20:48:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For sure its unknown whts was original material maybe its a cut from thick sheet like that ,but basically you can buy similar material like 1,2cm thick 5 cm wide 6m long etc
[2024-02-08T20:49:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes he knows 😁

[2024-02-08T21:06:24] Oreo huzky: Nah he fine I drove my solid tires to 85kmh a bit wobbly and a bit scary but fine if you don’t drive curves
[2024-02-08T21:09:04] Mirono escooters: Madlad on solids
[2024-02-08T21:22:22] Oreo huzky: But I was mad sketchy you could see the front tire bulging like hell when you look down and hear the tire scratching against mudguard
[2024-02-08T21:36:57] Happy Giraffe: I can send you pic tomorrow
[2024-02-08T21:37:51] francois schempers: on one wheel 😏

[2024-02-08T22:00:36] haku: does it bend stainless too?
[2024-02-08T22:00:51] haku: need to heat it up right?
[2024-02-08T22:11:22] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-02-08T22:19:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nah
[2024-02-08T22:19:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just 100 tonn hidraulic bender
[2024-02-08T22:19:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Happy's pics will tell
[2024-02-08T22:20:40] haku: no wonder you dont see alot of metal working hobbyists. the tools needed are crazy unlike wood working
[2024-02-08T22:20:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In one of my ex companies we had that ,6-8 meter long fucking huge and bent 2,5 cm steel easy like its nothing
[2024-02-08T22:20:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: While it happens it has boom sound
[2024-02-08T22:21:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cant really tell if you didn't hear before
[2024-02-08T22:21:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Up to lvl you can do but yeah after lvl maybe only for few things u need huge machines
[2024-02-08T22:23:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I said this before but this place was huge ,kinda similar what you saw in terminator 2,just less liquid metal😁
[2024-02-08T22:23:40] haku: gotcha.
[2024-02-08T22:24:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And funny or not funny
[2024-02-08T22:24:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It had similar sign like in the simpsons start x days without an accident
[2024-02-08T22:24:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,i cant say i saw more than 13 days there
[2024-02-08T22:26:37] sombre_enfant: We have that too idk the point
[2024-02-08T22:27:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You dont coz you are use to it ,lets normal ppl never see such in work
[2024-02-08T22:27:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Max days?
[2024-02-08T22:30:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I cant say over work places like that I didn't saw bad shit happening and even worse
[2024-02-08T22:31:17] sombre_enfant: It never been updated
[2024-02-08T22:31:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Even i had some stuff ,like all crane operators cant be trusted, if he dont pay attention cut your legs when he lifts or you fast like me and jump up on the sheet
[2024-02-08T22:31:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That can be even worse,or hopefully nothing to update on it
[2024-02-08T22:32:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also once i was lazy and didn't put on leg protection for flame cutter
[2024-02-08T22:33:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But hey done million times few cuts only , coz As we cut with huge plasma cutter ,leftovers can bend and cant let head hit that, so there is a hand flame cutter directly usually in the machine
[2024-02-08T22:34:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than cutting without protector ,than i see one piece of metal was blown out from table ,i start to put gun down
[2024-02-08T22:35:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It was like cigarette ash size drop on my boots ,thick work boots than felt down
[2024-02-08T22:36:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Soon as i put gun down i was yelling 🫡 fuckin 1000+ c° metal Basically funny that i had time to put gun down coz 1000 so much your body doesnt really understand for a sec such a shock
[2024-02-08T22:37:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than took boots off ,you didn't see nothing on the boots , but that shit melt half of my socks to shit
[2024-02-08T22:38:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And there is cigarette diameter lifetime deep fried meat
[2024-02-08T22:38:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅😅😅😁🤣
[2024-02-08T22:39:47] Yamal: https://youtu.be/KP2sKs-A8hc?si=alQ_xxyFszZwcmTg
[2024-02-08T22:39:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And what you think do i have flame welder cutter here? Or better question do i have this protection?🤣🤣🤣
[2024-02-08T22:40:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Your vid?
[2024-02-08T22:41:51] haku: ive had molten solder drip on my leg. it sucks haha
[2024-02-08T22:42:31] Yamal: No !
[2024-02-08T22:45:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's fun but with bigger solder iron even more fun
[2024-02-08T22:45:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In my original job we call that metal flee
[2024-02-08T22:45:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than we like or diss it?
[2024-02-08T22:45:46] haku: very similar parts to what im building. i wonder ehat winding his 70h is
[2024-02-08T22:45:53] sombre_enfant: Shouldve done 22s11p shorter phase wire and stem, maybe 75h and he could go to the race
[2024-02-08T22:45:57] Happy Giraffe: It bends all kinda stuff, I think max is like 15mm sheet
[2024-02-08T22:46:14] sombre_enfant: But he got a good frame 🤣
[2024-02-08T22:46:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Newer neck is good
[2024-02-08T22:46:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What you would say About that?
[2024-02-08T22:47:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz old is joke lvl
[2024-02-08T22:47:10] Happy Giraffe: Rarely use it as most of teachers dont know how to operate it. Hand operated bending machines there can do 1.5mm or 3mm alu so really need big machines quite rarely
[2024-02-08T22:47:51] haku: wait till you see when im done with project operation overlord
[2024-02-08T22:48:56] haku: im not trying to do 130kmh. just burnouts but when i get confident ill try
[2024-02-08T22:50:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically there is nothing wrong with the frame ,,more like the neck and front sus The rear forks he just made is like laotie has also
[2024-02-08T22:51:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not all ment to go on high speeds
[2024-02-08T23:02:01] sombre_enfant: Dualtron frame is strong no shocks good for track and you can have big custom frame
[2024-02-08T23:02:23] sombre_enfant: U replace it and put other column
[2024-02-08T23:10:29] haku: i will try and replace as much as i can😂
[2024-02-08T23:10:51] haku: most suspension bolts already hardened steel
[2024-02-08T23:26:43] haku: right now its still the wild west of scooter design. there are some good ones like g30 but big scooters not much.
[2024-02-08T23:30:34] Unknown: https://abc7ny.com/lithium-ion-batteries-e-scooter-queens-fdny/14399379/ It’s not looking good in my city right now
[2024-02-08T23:33:51] haku: i saw that
[2024-02-08T23:35:00] Unknown: Well it’s all over the tv too
[2024-02-08T23:36:36] haku: are they really cracking up in nyc or this only publicity stunt? i wonder how mainstream battery makers will handle this
[2024-02-08T23:39:24] Unknown: Definitely not a stunt. They’ve been setting up checkpoints and taking away illegal scooters @ e-bikes. Anything that weighs over 100 lbs. 35 mph speed limits for ebikes and 15 mph for scooters
[2024-02-08T23:40:14] haku: oh my! its starts in NYC everytime
[2024-02-08T23:41:53] haku: i already fortold this. i ahd a feeling its coming soon
[2024-02-08T23:42:17] francois schempers: how ?
[2024-02-08T23:47:09] haku: they have the wildest bikes there it seems. lol. group rides taking up whole roads and stuff.
[2024-02-09T00:31:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wiki wiki wild wild west
[2024-02-09T00:32:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,i would not belive your goverment even when they just ask 🤣
[2024-02-09T00:33:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🙈
[2024-02-09T00:34:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They started to tye a knot on there brain
[2024-02-09T00:34:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Any car mod ok ,mostly just rivets holding it but they play smart now
[2024-02-09T00:35:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Riveted parts would never get on the Street in the eu
[2024-02-09T00:35:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ruff riders you say ?😏
[2024-02-09T00:36:42] haku: lol. thats what it seems like. when i see videos on group rides
[2024-02-09T00:49:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Rip Dmx
[2024-02-09T01:04:08] Unknown: Yeah we be taking the city over. Bikelife is crazy here
[2024-02-09T01:06:01] haku: NYC wants less cars and now they cracking up on PEVs. i dont get it
[2024-02-09T01:21:49] Unknown: That’s what they get for voting democratic. I told them to put Trump back in
[2024-02-09T01:22:31] haku: i was gonna say! i just did not want to be political
[2024-02-09T01:30:49] Unknown: End of the day it’s all political bro so it’s all good ❤️
[2024-02-09T01:42:11] Unknown: Hope you guys enjoy this video
[2024-02-09T02:00:56] Ion: Huh? So building battery packs is illegal now?
[2024-02-09T02:01:43] Ion: I've seen really sketchy shit like soldered packs, but a properly build one should be fine? Or is it just "illegal" since they were missing some certificate
[2024-02-09T02:06:30] haku: is this scoot any good?
[2024-02-09T02:26:01] haku: for a 5yr old?
[2024-02-09T02:28:31] haku: i think US trying to do the UL certification thing. only deep pockets get to play
[2024-02-09T03:37:54] Unknown: No it’s not I’ll but it has to be done in a safe environment. Those people had barrels of lithium batteries in the shop. Filled to capacity with e-bikes e-scooters & gas bike. The store is on the first floor and numerous people live in apartments on the other floors..
[2024-02-09T03:39:23] Unknown: Bottom of the barrel bro.. if you’re cool with 14 mph 😂
[2024-02-09T03:41:34] Unknown: It’s illegal because they’re not doing things properly & safely. Basically they want all batteries to be UL certified
[2024-02-09T03:46:53] Unknown: You hit the nail on the head. They realize that there’s big money in PEV business so they’re trying to get rid of the small business. To be honest they really need to regulate because people are buying garbage PEVS & most live in high rise apartments they’re using rigged up batteries & chargers which results in fires. People are dying and some homeless,so something really needs to be done.
[2024-02-09T04:59:03] haku: anyone here used TPU filament? is it pretty difficult to print?
[2024-02-09T05:00:44] haku: it be cool to print a tpu cover gasket and some grips
[2024-02-09T05:10:52] haku: some printed crocs would be cool too
[2024-02-09T08:17:06] Happy Giraffe: It's not that hard, just need a direct drive extruder that bambu has
[2024-02-09T10:06:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bro i love nice vids but pls reduce tge size in sending options, takes lot time to dl 250 mb on my phone

[2024-02-09T10:29:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Isnt he small for it a bit? Unsure just asking
[2024-02-09T10:31:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way that's understandable
[2024-02-09T10:32:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So basically,pay to win in a way
[2024-02-09T10:33:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We use in the shop ,not hard to print

[2024-02-09T10:37:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would ban Crocs from the world 😁

[2024-02-09T16:51:20] Finn: Bro they are only rated up to 16 amps if they are standart
[2024-02-09T17:01:44] Happy Giraffe: AC vs DC🤔 Also not sure if house wire insulation burns easier
[2024-02-09T17:02:15] Finn: They do
[2024-02-09T17:02:42] Finn: Yes true but dc is constant current not impulses so the current produces much more heat
[2024-02-09T17:08:50] Happy Giraffe: Nice to buy groceries and have two 5 year olds yelling "fuck" every 10 seconds lol. Mothers nowadays🙈 My dad would have swinged me from legs upside down if I talked like that😂

[2024-02-09T17:38:44] Mirono escooters: You can perfectly build a batt without holders. If you isolate it well
[2024-02-09T17:39:03] Finn: Yeah but not with hot glue💀

[2024-02-09T22:36:27] haku: ill look around marketplace. those machines prolly really huge
[2024-02-09T22:37:04] sombre_enfant: And a panel where u can see position and put offset also check for gear should be A-B (torque ratio) lever and some other ( rpm) a tailstock and a mother screw to do metric thread

[2024-02-09T23:10:26] sombre_enfant: Yeah but thinner thats better, you should talk about extended thunder frame 👍🏾
[2024-02-09T23:10:45] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: That i dont know, i made the Design and send it to a CNC factory
[2024-02-09T23:11:20] sombre_enfant: It can be done on a milling machine too idk their process...
[2024-02-09T23:11:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: You can set 1000A if you want, but the hardware will stop to Read after 415A
[2024-02-09T23:12:17] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ok C350 yes, you can't unlock it by just incrasing the value
[2024-02-09T23:12:40] Rose: Hey there ᏗᏒᏋᏕ, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-02-09T23:16:14] sombre_enfant: Beta is shitty alway need to match everything to run it
[2024-02-09T23:16:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, that's better ;)

[2024-02-10T00:21:19] Happy Giraffe: How thick is the frame material? Mild steel?
[2024-02-10T00:31:53] haku: i thought i would be an engineer when i got a printer. i became my sons personal toy maker.
[2024-02-10T01:39:34] Martin Kaktits: Is there a way to save stats (like odometer, power usage and stuff) when turning the vesc off and on? It would be nice to know some info, specially the odometer, at the end of a long day, but I dont just keep the scoot ON all the time.
[2024-02-10T01:56:35] Martin Kaktits: Is there something latest firmware doesnt solve?
[2024-02-10T02:10:05] NetworkDir: 6.05 bugs solved?

[2024-02-10T10:14:14] puneDir: Guys
[2024-02-10T10:14:23] puneDir: What can i use to power my spotwelder
[2024-02-10T10:14:36] puneDir: My car battery seems to be dead
[2024-02-10T10:23:27] haku: charge your car battery 😁
[2024-02-10T10:25:54] puneDir: Seems like no help
[2024-02-10T10:27:46] puneDir: Im going to weld 240 cells lol
[2024-02-10T10:28:23] haku: car battery seems like a good choice to power it.
[2024-02-10T10:28:56] haku: or get lipos but i dont try to mess with that
[2024-02-10T10:29:12] puneDir: Or imma get new car battery
[2024-02-10T10:29:56] haku: borrow one preferably a truck battery
[2024-02-10T12:59:05] Mirono escooters: This is lovely
[2024-02-10T13:10:32] Chris Culver: Bruh I have an issue

[2024-02-10T13:10:52] Chris Culver: What is wrong with 107???
[2024-02-10T14:05:22] Unknown: It definitely does 98mph. I personally know. I started out in the field with the owner of that shop NYC PEV. That’s his worker talking about the scooter & Don the owner is asking the questions.. he has a 100v beast called the Rocket.
[2024-02-10T14:05:22] Unknown: <video_file>
[2024-02-10T14:05:23] Unknown: <video_file>
[2024-02-10T16:43:02] Yamal: You do 98mph with ebike or escooter ?
[2024-02-10T16:48:41] puneDir: Stock Zero esc works with 79v lol
[2024-02-10T16:52:03] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-02-10T16:56:23] sombre_enfant: Trippin
[2024-02-10T16:58:38] Paolo ⁭: No one of minimotors can do over 110
[2024-02-10T16:59:10] Paolo ⁭: So like every of dualtron owner just talking bullshit :/
[2024-02-10T17:13:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Proof or never existed
[2024-02-10T17:26:42] haku: scooter community is tiny in nyc
[2024-02-10T17:38:31] Yamal: It is very bad to generalize,
[2024-02-10T17:40:44] Paolo ⁭: I know, but almost everyone are like that. "Oh see my new scooter can reach 150!!"
[2024-02-10T17:41:13] Paolo ⁭: You check dash, it's 150, you check gps, it's 90kmh
[2024-02-10T17:42:22] Yamal: Someone who is passionate about e-scooters, who likes to prepare them with vesc and discharge batteries and who also sells motors should not talk like that... then everyone says or does what they want but I don't know... you have to be professional brother
[2024-02-10T17:44:04] Paolo ⁭: I mean everyone that say these speed with stock electronic
[2024-02-10T17:44:12] Paolo ⁭: Not everyone have dualtron
[2024-02-10T17:45:02] Paolo ⁭: If you can find me who can do 150 with minimotors electronics , then yeah It will be my bad
[2024-02-10T17:46:29] Jan: I would never do any +60mph on a dualtron, steering geometry and folding mechanism will definitely kill you at one point
[2024-02-10T17:47:11] Jan: 476mOhms??
[2024-02-10T17:47:46] Jan: Also 36mOhms?
[2024-02-10T17:59:01] Happy Giraffe: He didnt insult or anything, just 99,9% of scooter related topspeed/performance claims are fake on internet
[2024-02-10T18:03:58] Yamal: Let's see about the speed, you are right, things are measured by GPS, but I don't know, maybe he wasn't talking about a Dualtron and he was talking about an Ebike, I have 23 and 24s dualtrons close to home and none of them reached 130kmh, I think I remember, with original electronics,
[2024-02-10T18:06:07] puneDir: Am i the only one who thinks dualtrons look ugly
[2024-02-10T18:06:17] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2024-02-10T18:08:06] puneDir: Some people loves them very much
[2024-02-10T18:08:24] Gabe Enzo: Also takes less than 1.5 k Euro to make a dual Tron equivalent
[2024-02-10T18:08:30] Gabe Enzo: Better
[2024-02-10T18:08:43] Gabe Enzo: hate them big kind frames. nami excluded
[2024-02-10T18:08:54] Gabe Enzo: Zero is ok
[2024-02-10T18:09:06] puneDir: Vsett 10+ zero 10x gt2 etc looks good
[2024-02-10T18:09:48] Paolo ⁭: My goal isn't blaming people , my goal is just want to open eye at people who says dualtron / Kelly are better than vesc, because there's many blind....
[2024-02-10T18:10:40] puneDir: Is copper instead of nickel needed for 8p?
[2024-02-10T18:10:46] Yamal: Yes, it's just the ways of speaking that sometimes impact and my English is not good either, Anyway, there are many ways to say things.
[2024-02-10T18:11:25] Yamal: Is better xaomi and g30
[2024-02-10T18:12:30] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-02-10T18:12:51] Mirono escooters: Wich vesc I'd look at soldering
[2024-02-10T18:14:27] Paolo ⁭: Nami Is more unstable than dualtron
[2024-02-10T18:15:21] Jan: I would take frames developed for rental scooters
[2024-02-10T18:16:17] Face de Pin Sucé: come on, it is safe when well setted
[2024-02-10T18:16:30] puneDir: G30 is the best human made thing in the universe Theres nothing will be done better than g30 G30 was the first created thing in the universe Pyramids were maded by using the ninebot g30 Ninebot g30 is maded by the aliens 10000 years ago and theres magic on it
[2024-02-10T18:17:53] Jan: G30 has a weak rear axle
[2024-02-10T18:18:25] Happy Giraffe: Im about to order some 25mm titanium Grade5 rod to lathe a spare axle set for my old DH bike xD
[2024-02-10T18:19:34] Jan: If you do a new stem clamping mechanism then its somewhat doable, the tiny tube stem still remains, steering geometry i dont know if thats somewhat fixable, i mean its a C-Suspension. The only c-sus. that should be actually good has to be Inmotion RS
[2024-02-10T18:20:35] puneDir: Wish g30 had some good front c suspension kit
[2024-02-10T18:20:54] puneDir: And some good looking rear one
[2024-02-10T18:21:13] puneDir: And be able to fit 50h
[2024-02-10T18:21:28] Happy Giraffe: https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005006015124727.html?spm=a2g0o.home.0.0.135076dbz23ojJ&mp=1&gatewayAdapt=glo2vnm @AJAJ1992 This looks legit?
[2024-02-10T18:21:48] Happy Giraffe: 7 year old store that has good ratings
[2024-02-10T18:22:11] puneDir: Just mine some titanium bro
[2024-02-10T18:22:53] Paolo ⁭: If roads are good yes
[2024-02-10T18:23:14] haku: is it difficult to lathe titanium
[2024-02-10T18:23:17] Paolo ⁭: If you drive at Rome with g30 you fly literally to the moon
[2024-02-10T18:23:24] Mirono escooters: Pretty much
[2024-02-10T18:23:28] Jan: Make one yourself
[2024-02-10T18:23:37] Jan: Probably front you need an inverted
[2024-02-10T18:23:43] Mirono escooters: Dereza bro
[2024-02-10T18:23:47] Mirono escooters: I'm working on it atm
[2024-02-10T18:23:55] Jan: Cannot sell it though as Nami will piss at your leg with the patent
[2024-02-10T18:24:00] puneDir: My City too
[2024-02-10T18:24:05] puneDir: They dont sell it
[2024-02-10T18:24:28] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_12777@10-02-2024_18-24-28.jpg>
[2024-02-10T18:24:30] Mirono escooters: Diy
[2024-02-10T18:24:41] Paolo ⁭: I wouldn't recommend it for bad roads, you can't compare it to nami's confort or any other "big frame"
[2024-02-10T18:24:44] puneDir: You did diy dereza?
[2024-02-10T18:24:46] Happy Giraffe: Dont think so, teachers said its just another material. Hard bits should work ok. Stainless isnt soft either
[2024-02-10T18:24:50] haku: hardened 12.9 grade steel is that as tough as titanium?
[2024-02-10T18:24:50] Mirono escooters: Have a go, patented inverted suspension is bullshit
[2024-02-10T18:25:03] Mirono escooters: Goh. Hard to say
[2024-02-10T18:25:08] Mirono escooters: Totally different stuff
[2024-02-10T18:25:08] puneDir: Yes Zero feels like riding on cloud Ninebot feels more rigid but its not comfortable as zero
[2024-02-10T18:25:29] Mirono escooters: That's actually for snsc , concept is same
[2024-02-10T18:25:48] Happy Giraffe: We will see, should work like anything else. Just need to approach slower and take notes how material behaves
[2024-02-10T18:25:50] puneDir: And ninebot does much better at high speed It has much better controll
[2024-02-10T18:26:47] Jan: They really believe in it ^^
[2024-02-10T18:26:50] Jan: <photos/photo_12778@10-02-2024_18-26-50.jpg>
[2024-02-10T18:27:26] Happy Giraffe: How is it possible to patent something as generic as this?...
[2024-02-10T18:27:58] Mirono escooters: They can believe all they want
[2024-02-10T18:28:08] Mirono escooters: It's marketing
[2024-02-10T18:28:12] Mirono escooters: You can't patent that.
[2024-02-10T18:28:36] Happy Giraffe: Im getting "Monorim Original Manufacturer" vibes
[2024-02-10T18:28:41] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2024-02-10T18:28:44] Mirono escooters: C suspension doesn't help with control
[2024-02-10T18:29:07] Mirono escooters: Inverted c sus should.. be more stable then normal c Except with heavy braking. 😅
[2024-02-10T18:29:25] Jan: Two wheeler stability is quite the complex topic that hadnt reached the scooter industry. Companies making false assumption all the time
[2024-02-10T18:29:30] puneDir: Zero feels like water
[2024-02-10T18:29:34] puneDir: Ninebot feels like rock
[2024-02-10T18:30:17] Jan: No we dont want steering damper itself, we just dont want to fucking faceplant at 50kmh with some unstable shit.
[2024-02-10T18:30:26] Jan: True its super hard
[2024-02-10T18:30:31] Mirono escooters: 😅
[2024-02-10T18:30:38] Mirono escooters: Engineers
[2024-02-10T18:31:32] haku: ive nevwr tried a scooter without a suspension. but im about to find out when im finished with project operation market garden
[2024-02-10T18:31:55] Happy Giraffe: We have some machine engineers at school and they are the best people to hang around with. Know so much and always ready to tell you how things work. Engineers dont get enough credit where its due...
[2024-02-10T18:47:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Please, ride a 150+kmh dualtron geometry, without steering damper, you'll see the steering geometry is good. For the folding mechanism you can put the Sonken parts with stainless steel, never heard any broken
[2024-02-10T18:47:56] Mirono escooters: I don't see the point of folding such big scoots
[2024-02-10T18:48:23] Jan: I need to try, stance makes quite a difference.
[2024-02-10T18:49:44] Unknown: <video_file>
[2024-02-10T18:55:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For me what's not ok with it is you need to upgrade to be safe and meanwhile you buy an expensive thing 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-10T18:57:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Thunder series, no problem, maybe Ultra series yes
[2024-02-10T18:58:58] puneDir: <photos/photo_12779@10-02-2024_18-58-58.jpg>
[2024-02-10T18:59:03] puneDir: Whats this nickel is called
[2024-02-10T19:01:05] puneDir: No the shape
[2024-02-10T19:02:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Never saw a thunder pole broken
[2024-02-10T19:05:57] haku: what other upgrades on that scooter aside from the cool lights?
[2024-02-10T19:10:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But neck yes ,atleast on that vid i sent 😁
[2024-02-10T19:11:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also on some scooters they have a lock and sometimes it also holds steering dumpener ,that makes more shit than you have originaly ,makes "different force point"
[2024-02-10T19:12:25] Gabe Enzo: Is this scnc
[2024-02-10T19:12:31] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12780@10-02-2024_19-12-31.jpg>
[2024-02-10T19:12:54] Mirono escooters: Doesn't seem like it
[2024-02-10T19:13:09] Mirono escooters: Or a clone Or stolen Or a first gen snsc (just a g30)
[2024-02-10T19:14:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What do you mean under that ?
[2024-02-10T19:14:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: My wish is like the one whats on fancy car rims

[2024-02-10T19:18:23] Gabe Enzo: Id buy if first gen snsc
[2024-02-10T19:18:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What Miro already said
[2024-02-10T19:18:43] Gabe Enzo: Or stolen
[2024-02-10T19:18:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You show one dark picture
[2024-02-10T19:19:01] Gabe Enzo: I'll ask him for more

[2024-02-10T19:23:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not segway
[2024-02-10T19:23:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its some clone for sure
[2024-02-10T19:23:41] Unknown: Its stock. I haven’t rode it in years. It has magura brakes with the banjo flip. Erexx damper. Brass mod for the stem squeak. I did all this during the pandemic
[2024-02-10T19:24:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some parts surly too dark ,also where is color rings from rims if g30 and last new wd marked tire
[2024-02-10T19:24:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Should be cst
[2024-02-10T19:24:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: i think that's not filled type

[2024-02-10T19:26:34] Mirono escooters: Or clone
[2024-02-10T19:27:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Motus clone is better but not original still ,if frame is weaker what we dont know than its better not to buy
[2024-02-10T19:27:15] Mirono escooters: Easy, go look, try to use any Bluetooth apps..

[2024-02-10T19:28:36] Кирилл: Just for examples of good and bad trails
[2024-02-10T19:29:08] Кирилл: Green (and blue at gt) - positive without sag. Red - negative without sag
[2024-02-10T19:30:28] Кирилл: Inmotion rs will be a little smaller when sag and working. GT will be more positive when sag and working
[2024-02-10T19:31:39] Кирилл: Others here - will be negative trails every time with sag and working suspension - instant kill and steering wheel will try to turn around by 180° when moving forward. This behavior will be dynamic and constantly change when passing through the zero value of the trail.
[2024-02-10T19:32:05] haku: sick bro! its unfortunate you moved to ebikes. scooter community in the US getting smaller
[2024-02-10T19:40:30] haku: what about trails for kaabo/ laotie suspensions
[2024-02-10T19:40:42] haku: motorcycle styles?
[2024-02-10T19:45:05] Unknown: I have a bad back so I got tired of standing. I tried the seat on the scooters but it didn’t feel right. I’m going on a group ride with the gang today so I’ll keep you guys posted..
[2024-02-10T19:45:40] haku: be safe bro!
[2024-02-10T19:46:04] Unknown: I appreciate the love bro
[2024-02-10T19:50:46] Кирилл: Just see how individual suspension works (sags) and make same axies as i made for your own understanding its behavior. Rake axis - the vector through your steering axle (bearings) to ground. Front wheel axis - the vector perpendicular to the ground through the wheel axis down. Line between these two vectors on the ground will be your trail. With sag and suspension operation, the trail will become smaller or larger and this is a dynamic value when you moving. When sag, the offset of the front wheel will move forward or back and reduce or increase the trail. On C types when braking, the trail will decrease in the same way as on most motorcycles. But on motorcycles trail is between 95mm and 130mm long. Escooters have less ofc. Girder-type suspension, like on the GT, can be seen in the photo, works under diagonal load. The front wheel offset moves back - thereby increasing the trail. Also there is such a cool thing as on bmw gs series called telelever. Here the trail is constant and positive at all times. ✅Positive trail - the steering wheel will try to self-stabilize and independently level the equipment while moving forward, if the driver does not interfere with this and does not hold the steering wheel harder. That's how it should be. ❌Negative trail - the steering wheel will try to turn around under any conditions while moving forward. It will be hampered by a damper (if there is one) and a very strong tightening of the bearings (if they are overtightened). It shouldn't be this way.
[2024-02-10T19:54:07] Gabe Enzo: A shape that is too expensive.
[2024-02-10T19:54:11] haku: gotcha. so a good trail will fix itself in a death wobble just like motorcycles. bad ones will not. makes sense why folks use a damper
[2024-02-10T19:54:31] Gabe Enzo: Death wobble is because of a shit tyre
[2024-02-10T19:54:38] puneDir: I have to make them with scissors?
[2024-02-10T19:54:40] puneDir: Oh no
[2024-02-10T19:54:43] puneDir: 20s8p
[2024-02-10T19:54:56] Gabe Enzo: My friends kugoo g4 scooter with a bent tyre
[2024-02-10T19:54:59] Gabe Enzo: Stock
[2024-02-10T19:55:16] haku: i think its trail related. like the dude said above
[2024-02-10T19:55:16] Gabe Enzo: No
[2024-02-10T19:55:20] Gabe Enzo: Use copper
[2024-02-10T19:55:41] puneDir: Cooper doesnt have this shape too
[2024-02-10T19:56:26] puneDir: Even where can i find copper
[2024-02-10T19:56:34] haku: ali
[2024-02-10T19:56:54] puneDir: Whats it called
[2024-02-10T19:56:54] haku: or even yet buy it in bulk at alibaba haha
[2024-02-10T19:57:10] haku: copper sheet/ copper rolls
[2024-02-10T19:57:18] puneDir: I dont wanna cut myself
[2024-02-10T19:57:25] puneDir: So long job
[2024-02-10T19:57:55] Gabe Enzo: You cut it better
[2024-02-10T19:58:00] Gabe Enzo: just weld a sheet directly
[2024-02-10T19:58:01] Gabe Enzo: duhhh
[2024-02-10T19:58:24] haku: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $1.94 53%OFF | 1pcs 99.9% Pure Copper Cu Metal Sheet Foil 0.01-0.6 mm X 20-100 mm X 100-1000mm https://a.aliexpress.com/_mrtAaKw
[2024-02-10T19:58:50] Gabe Enzo: I got 5m2 of it from ali
[2024-02-10T19:58:51] Gabe Enzo: for 20€
[2024-02-10T19:58:56] haku: just dont get .2 its difficult to cut unless you have muscles in your fingers
[2024-02-10T19:58:56] Gabe Enzo: 100x5000mm
[2024-02-10T19:59:01] Gabe Enzo: 10x500cm
[2024-02-10T19:59:05] puneDir: How thick i need
[2024-02-10T19:59:11] puneDir: I can find them locally
[2024-02-10T19:59:14] Gabe Enzo: 0.1
[2024-02-10T19:59:22] puneDir: How many amps it can do
[2024-02-10T19:59:26] Gabe Enzo: Like 200
[2024-02-10T19:59:29] puneDir: What the
[2024-02-10T19:59:30] Gabe Enzo: more with copper sandwich
[2024-02-10T19:59:35] Gabe Enzo: um?
[2024-02-10T19:59:36] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-02-10T19:59:43] puneDir: Its cheaper and better
[2024-02-10T19:59:44] haku: depends on how much current your battery can push and if your welder can properly weld it
[2024-02-10T19:59:48] puneDir: Why dont everyone uses it
[2024-02-10T19:59:58] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2024-02-10T20:00:02] Gabe Enzo: But need high power welder
[2024-02-10T20:00:18] puneDir: Im going to make some diy welder
[2024-02-10T20:00:22] puneDir: Like cengizs one
[2024-02-10T20:00:27] Happy Giraffe: is a keyhole saw too brutal? Or whatever the tool name is in english
[2024-02-10T20:00:41] haku: @Mirono_escooters @jamessoderstrom would be the best to ask these questions
[2024-02-10T20:00:56] haku: i do not have knowledge like them
[2024-02-10T20:01:14] puneDir: @mrstealyogirI all i need is 0.1 mm thick one right
[2024-02-10T20:01:40] Happy Giraffe: this with a metal blade and oscillation turned off?
[2024-02-10T20:01:55] haku: never tried it. scissors would cut it just need to take it slow.
[2024-02-10T20:02:05] puneDir: Its so fucking cheap
[2024-02-10T20:02:07] puneDir: Im getting it
[2024-02-10T20:02:40] Mirono escooters: What I missed
[2024-02-10T20:03:11] haku: punedir has some question
[2024-02-10T20:03:47] puneDir: I figured it out
[2024-02-10T20:04:31] Кирилл: In the world of motorcycles, wobbling occurs if you do not monitor and adjust the suspension, incorrectly inflate the tires and the most often - due to uneven roads, in which the front wheel loses contact with the ground and then restores it with a shift in the movement trajectory relative to the rear wheel and restores it with a different angle of steering direction. This displacement creates an impulse that deflects (throws with force) the steering wheel to align the wheel. The impulse is so strong that it can tilt the steering wheel further than the center, and then a similar effect occurs, and the steering wheel continues to be thrown from side to side. In the case of a large trail, this effect is extinguished almost immediately, before it even begins. In the case of minimal, and especially negative trail values, oscillations occur until there is a fall or the speed decreases, which will help the system rushing at speed to self-stabilize and return to the trajectory. In the world of bad escooters and the lack of an engineering approach in this matter, this leads to the fact that wobbling occurs due to the imperfection of the designer’s product itself, and not the road. But road itself increases that bad experience further more. At the moment there is nothing more stable and safe than inmotion rs and segway gt (st series in future) in terms of mass availability. I declare this with full responsibility.
[2024-02-10T20:05:25] Happy Giraffe: And unsprung weight with vibration like older Harley Davidsons that had the "death wobble"
[2024-02-10T20:06:28] puneDir: I need to find some microwave transformater
[2024-02-10T20:06:39] Gabe Enzo: Lmao.
[2024-02-10T20:06:48] Tommy ª: casually im the only who checks all that? most of my friends just took the bike or x vehicle without look anything, after long always happend something
[2024-02-10T20:06:56] haku: dude no haha get a proper welder
[2024-02-10T20:06:56] Gabe Enzo: Why would it it's rated for 100
[2024-02-10T20:07:07] puneDir: Diy welder is good
[2024-02-10T20:07:16] Gabe Enzo: maybe 140 if cooled super well lol dual
[2024-02-10T20:07:21] puneDir: I have good welder but car battery is so heavy
[2024-02-10T20:07:34] puneDir: Or maybe im going to stick to nickel :/
[2024-02-10T20:10:26] haku: ive notced copper welding is alot more complicated than nickle. maybe its just me but you have to have the perfect power or you blow holes or copper doesnt weld properly.
[2024-02-10T21:34:54] haku: dam i wish i know how to fix usbc. my vape broken
[2024-02-10T21:42:00] Gabe Enzo: Easy
[2024-02-10T21:42:37] Gabe Enzo: my vape wouldn't charge
[2024-02-10T21:42:47] Gabe Enzo: turns out it denied the fast usbc
[2024-02-10T21:43:09] haku: ive opened one of these before. usbc always the first to break. also it smd soldered
[2024-02-10T21:43:23] haku: very difficult to remove
[2024-02-10T21:46:23] haku: https://youtu.be/dEMKVFbO5V0?si=1XNalJKlVKHPPITT
[2024-02-10T21:46:40] haku: propaganda or this is real?
[2024-02-10T21:59:27] Yamal: And how do you go over 130 in a dualtron and not have wobbles or anything, without a steering damper, Do you have the steering screw a little tighter than necessary? or is it just stable,,, I started with a thunder in this world and I wouldn't mind returning to it with a good preparation!
[2024-02-10T22:08:50] haku: yea i opened it before its difficult to remove with just an iron. needs that heat blower thing
[2024-02-10T22:15:23] Yamal: And Rion have a good trails? Interesting about Gt many people talking about this e-scooter👍
[2024-02-10T22:29:35] Yamal: Also Weped have a good trails..?⚡️❤️‍🔥
[2024-02-10T22:31:36] Кирилл: Later, when I have time, I can also draw vectors on these models, and you will see for yourself
[2024-02-10T22:34:15] haku: what about trail for this badboy
[2024-02-10T22:35:41] haku: is that good?
[2024-02-10T22:35:48] haku: 😂
[2024-02-10T22:36:09] Yamal: thanks mate! All this is very interesting, being able to know how each scooter works and if they have good or not so good geometry, I currently have a Nami burn e, and I know perfectly well that it is not the most stable there is, but I am happy with the machine!
[2024-02-10T22:38:11] sombre_enfant: Shitty a bit
[2024-02-10T22:38:58] haku: i really am lost in the science of this.
[2024-02-10T22:39:41] haku: maybe if i put more stickers it will fix the trail
[2024-02-10T22:41:33] haku: how about vsett 9 or 10 is that good or bad? i get some wobbles on the 9
[2024-02-10T23:07:35] Jan: No
[2024-02-10T23:07:44] sombre_enfant: Bad
[2024-02-10T23:09:06] Yamal: You finally get your gt2 or no
[2024-02-10T23:09:56] haku: how is this bad. can someone show me what the trail is on this?
[2024-02-10T23:10:41] sombre_enfant: Nope
[2024-02-10T23:10:45] haku: it seems like minimum sag
[2024-02-10T23:11:33] sombre_enfant: I stay on vsett 10 and g30 im planning up for race in-38 mostly on vsett
[2024-02-10T23:11:52] sombre_enfant: Im short on weight to but i got some fire idea
[2024-02-10T23:12:28] haku: does racing have weight classes on drivers?
[2024-02-10T23:12:41] sombre_enfant: No
[2024-02-10T23:13:07] sombre_enfant: Only and scoot and female, i might try to put a wig on
[2024-02-10T23:13:41] sombre_enfant: <animation>
[2024-02-10T23:15:09] Yamal: In France you have it very difficult my friend, a lot of level and e-scooter that look like rockets, with the best batteries, the best motors and the best electronics😁🔥
[2024-02-10T23:15:40] sombre_enfant: No because in-38 the setup aint that good
[2024-02-10T23:16:24] Yamal: For less than 38 there are not many people preparing or
[2024-02-10T23:19:20] sombre_enfant: Theres but with some 4p xiaomi and shitty huameng or banggood motor
[2024-02-11T00:45:16] Ion: very detailed description and explanation, thank you for this :) I wonder, does the G30 with the monorim front suspension behave similar to the GT here in terms of trail change
[2024-02-11T00:47:29] Ion: get 12 Fet Ubox for 300A
[2024-02-11T02:15:54] Jan: Yes the mechanics is the same but the stock monorim forks have not good enough trail
[2024-02-11T02:23:42] Ion: Yes but not negative trail, just smaller? I don't think upgraded arms are worth it on single motor, right?
[2024-02-11T02:30:24] Jan: If you dont plan to reach 90kmh+, or wanna drive one handed, its not worth it
[2024-02-11T02:40:40] Ion: Not currently 😅 would be fun tho with front drum
[2024-02-11T02:41:10] Jan: 😅 front drum at 50kmh already at the limit
[2024-02-11T02:41:35] Ion: But yea, I like how the jrev forks look with the integrated brake mounting. Would get them for dual motor
[2024-02-11T02:42:04] Ion: Monorim could also just have made the trail better... But they didn't 😅
[2024-02-11T03:05:39] Finn: <animation>
[2024-02-11T03:07:58] haku: <video_file>
[2024-02-11T03:07:58] haku: i shower in hair
[2024-02-11T03:08:07] Ion: Not even ... Like just make the forks a slightly different shape, should be basically the same cost
[2024-02-11T03:10:06] Jan: They only care about max profit least effort.
[2024-02-11T03:11:52] Finn: Dawg
[2024-02-11T03:12:49] haku: my dawg is the grand dutchy of lithuania
[2024-02-11T07:13:39] Кирилл: Smth like this with stock shock absorber
[2024-02-11T07:14:25] Кирилл: Jan and Roscheee (JREV) did smth like this (rough drawing), see the trail (green line). Also longer shock absorber will move offset of the wheel more to the back and lower. Trail will be a lot more safer, but clearance higher
[2024-02-11T07:18:54] Кирилл: Stock g30 with no suspension (the air in tires is the only one to make trail dynamic there). So jts 99.9% stays the same and safe positive. If your rear and front tire have the same pressure and your weight loads rear a little more - you will have a little more sag at rear wheel and therefore - a little longer trail
[2024-02-11T07:26:35] Кирилл: GT is inversed girder fork than monorim suspension (please dont call suspension "the monorim", the monorim is a chinese brand hah, these type of suspension are both called girder fork. So when GT suspension sags - the trail increases. Monorim girder fork works vice versa
[2024-02-11T09:03:43] Кирилл: Hello, Yamal! I found this photo on the side, it's not perfect, the perspective is a little distorted, but in general you can understand a little. As you can see, Rion's trail is very small, i.e. it is too maneuverable to control, it can be unstable and nervous at high speed p.s this green little line is a positive trail Rion Apex has rear suspension and it compresses a bit when you stay on it, sags, increasing trail a bit
[2024-02-11T09:31:08] Yamal: I suppose the The aerodynamics of the scooter play an important role in all of this as well.
[2024-02-11T09:42:29] Yamal: this one is mine, This is made so that if you go fast you will kill yourself!
[2024-02-11T09:44:52] Yamal: <photos/photo_12807@11-02-2024_09-44-52.jpg>
[2024-02-11T09:52:49] Кирилл: No. The aerodynamics of the scooter compared to your own resistance when you stand on it plays almost no role

[2024-02-11T11:21:57] Yamal: Momen tricher , the look no is “very pretty” but have vesc
[2024-02-11T11:22:49] Yamal: Maybe like blast yes , but momen other lvl
[2024-02-11T11:25:57] Yamal: Nami blast also has only one swingarm, and momen has two swingarms
[2024-02-11T11:27:05] haku: looks like davega
[2024-02-11T11:28:55] haku: also is that display plug and play. good find
[2024-02-11T11:32:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes but is very ugly
[2024-02-11T11:32:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: I was searching if some one has build a nice 3d printed case
[2024-02-11T11:32:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: Since I have printer but no skill to draw
[2024-02-11T11:33:16] haku: theres a bunch for davega. i dont know if its the same dimensions though
[2024-02-11T12:22:10] Yamal: high torque, it's fun! I want to record with the vesc tool application, the problem is that my firmware is 5.3 and the new firmware window pops up in the middle and it doesn't let me record properly...
[2024-02-11T12:24:35] Mirono escooters: Its linear so, yes
[2024-02-11T12:24:39] Mirono escooters: Inline
[2024-02-11T14:44:49] Paolo ⁭: You can still push more with cable mod
[2024-02-11T14:57:22] Yamal: what is cable mod,,?
[2024-02-11T15:07:35] Hemi Murin: Hello guys, I'll need your huge help. I'm now in the way to finish connection of dual controllers (75100) into my G30. Cam someone be so nice and write me how to connect this thing? 😀 For better visualisation I'm sending sketch with numbers..

[2024-02-11T15:24:04] Happy Giraffe: If you use ninebot dash then need to run lisp code
[2024-02-11T15:34:24] Yamal: We tried one day with the "MTPA" and we achieved greater battery discharge up to approximately 333A but we did not increase the top speed, which we found strange, with Rion it increased, we also gained a little more temperature,, In short, I have 15% field weaking 30/35A and I don't need more, the temperatures are correct for the moment, my top speed is between 120/125 kmh and extreme torque, I can't ask for more for the engines I have 22/3, It's finished! which I am happy with the machine I have,,
[2024-02-11T15:36:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also why g30 and vsett both written 🤔
[2024-02-11T16:40:11] Oreo huzky: What app and does it show gps speed?
[2024-02-11T16:40:42] Mirono escooters: Why would topspeed increase? You are at volt kv motor limit
[2024-02-11T16:40:53] Mirono escooters: Don't use mtpa on hub. Only inrunner.
[2024-02-11T16:41:24] Mirono escooters: 125kmh 😰
[2024-02-11T16:42:03] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Fishpaper/kapton
[2024-02-11T17:02:08] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: My first soldered battery without isolation between cells still works 💀
[2024-02-11T17:09:23] Gabe Enzo: Thinking of soldering mine
[2024-02-11T17:09:42] Gabe Enzo: Ya same, my 3s.
[2024-02-11T17:10:17] Gabe Enzo: Ok if done right but do it shit and it can fall apart
[2024-02-11T17:13:43] Yamal: What is “inrunner”?
[2024-02-11T17:16:28] Yamal: Xmatic

[2024-02-11T17:19:34] Paolo ⁭: Nahhh it workshop very well with me actually
[2024-02-11T17:20:11] Paolo ⁭: Also vesc does that in logs
[2024-02-11T17:26:30] Yamal: Important thing only 5,3 firmware….. but it is a very cool application for routes and it gives a lot of data such as the highest temperature of the controllers, minimum and obviously the one you have at the moment, the same with A of the controllers and the motors
[2024-02-11T17:28:30] Yamal: I want to know the watts that the scooter gives
[2024-02-11T17:30:21] Paolo ⁭: I recommend u vesc original app
[2024-02-11T17:39:13] Mirono escooters: Till it burns
[2024-02-11T17:39:32] Mirono escooters: Tis not made for it
[2024-02-11T17:39:51] Mirono escooters: A motor type where the inner part turns
[2024-02-11T17:40:13] Gabe Enzo: RC stuffs
[2024-02-11T17:40:17] Gabe Enzo: It's funny how it's just an inverted mechanisms
[2024-02-11T17:42:49] Mirono escooters: Surron
[2024-02-11T17:43:06] Mirono escooters: Or like, any commercial high power motor
[2024-02-11T17:44:56] Happy Giraffe: Basically mid drives ipm
[2024-02-11T17:45:12] Happy Giraffe: Motors that stay inside rim outrunners
[2024-02-11T17:46:33] sombre_enfant: Example What change if i use the shaft of an hub motor ? Its an inrunner now, so can use mtpa on both
[2024-02-11T17:48:13] sombre_enfant: Thanks

[2024-02-11T18:41:05] puneDir: Is this good?
[2024-02-11T18:41:22] puneDir: Cheap compared to jk
[2024-02-11T18:45:26] Happy Giraffe: Damn, Im also on a tight budget but better use best quality components on battery if you dont desire thermal runaway inside our house😅
[2024-02-11T18:45:51] Happy Giraffe: Especially without a steel box that takes the fire atleast few seconds😅
[2024-02-11T18:46:09] puneDir: Its bad or good?
[2024-02-11T18:46:17] Happy Giraffe: Thats cheap😳
[2024-02-11T18:46:39] Happy Giraffe: I would go with the most reliable and most tested/used ones
[2024-02-11T18:46:54] puneDir: Im tight on space
[2024-02-11T18:47:03] puneDir: I will get jk or this but jk is too big
[2024-02-11T18:47:14] Happy Giraffe: Spacer?
[2024-02-11T18:47:31] Happy Giraffe: Thats cool🤔
[2024-02-11T18:48:01] Happy Giraffe: 64€ for smart bms dirt cheap
[2024-02-11T18:48:51] puneDir: Im going to make 20s8p + stock escs in zero 10x with just 8mm spacer
[2024-02-11T18:49:32] puneDir: I will but firstly i have to save some money for ubox
[2024-02-11T18:49:32] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: which mosfets it uses?
[2024-02-11T18:49:51] Happy Giraffe: Just delay the project for a month and sell stock esc
[2024-02-11T18:50:03] puneDir: Hy3708p
[2024-02-11T18:50:17] puneDir: I can already sell the escs for like 5k liras but uboxs are 10k
[2024-02-11T18:50:29] Happy Giraffe: Then its just waiting game
[2024-02-11T18:51:00] Happy Giraffe: Im also waiting more for the battery and drivetrain for the bike as theres no point in running a shit setup
[2024-02-11T18:51:17] Happy Giraffe: Better do once properly than twice crap with losing money
[2024-02-11T18:51:19] puneDir: I have to get this running in 15 days
[2024-02-11T18:51:24] puneDir: Zero escs are fine
[2024-02-11T18:51:40] puneDir: Theyre better than 75100
[2024-02-11T18:51:52] puneDir: Yes but it was related to me
[2024-02-11T18:52:25] puneDir: I removed the brake sensor thingy and i pressed gas and brake in same time
[2024-02-11T18:52:53] puneDir: Locked brake + full power + not turning motor = blown mosfet
[2024-02-11T18:53:14] puneDir: Im going to put 100v 214a mosfets to it
[2024-02-11T18:53:20] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>

[2024-02-11T18:56:18] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-02-11T18:56:47] puneDir: Does jbd has active balance like jk
[2024-02-11T18:58:12] puneDir: Ok i think jk might perform better with active balancing
[2024-02-11T19:02:37] Mirono escooters: ??? Llt is very good
[2024-02-11T19:02:54] Mirono escooters: Impossible
[2024-02-11T19:03:58] puneDir: Theres some transistors instead idk
[2024-02-11T19:04:16] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: LOL
[2024-02-11T19:15:08] Happy Giraffe: Being so cheap?😳
[2024-02-11T19:17:10] Mirono escooters: Yes ...
[2024-02-11T19:17:17] Mirono escooters: LLT is market leader in BMS formats and sizes
[2024-02-11T19:17:19] Mirono escooters: One of the best
[2024-02-11T19:20:02] sombre_enfant: Llt bms is in some powertool battery
[2024-02-11T19:20:15] Happy Giraffe: Damn, you can set custom temperature limit etc?
[2024-02-11T19:21:20] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-02-11T19:21:21] Mirono escooters: Anything

[2024-02-11T19:21:54] Mirono escooters: Also they are ridiculously cute
[2024-02-11T19:22:25] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth build in, just crazy. The price is great, on sale even better.
[2024-02-11T19:22:33] Mirono escooters: I love em. Same price as non smart habaha
[2024-02-11T19:26:37] sombre_enfant: Thanks our brother james and artem to show up us this brand🤲🏾
[2024-02-11T20:05:23] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters do you have link for llt
[2024-02-11T20:06:24] Yamal: @PaoloWu How many watts are the 60 h 22/3 motors? There is always a lot of controversy, with the watts of the motors, some say that they are the same as that of the 2000-watt Wolf King GT and nothing in case you knew the fact! thank you.
[2024-02-11T20:06:55] puneDir: I really cant find it anywhere
[2024-02-11T20:07:05] Mirono escooters: Wonder why LLT -> jbd
[2024-02-11T20:07:12] Mirono escooters: It's now jbd
[2024-02-11T20:07:54] puneDir: <photos/photo_12822@11-02-2024_20-07-54.jpg>
[2024-02-11T20:08:05] Paolo ⁭: Everyone label everything they want , everyone has different calculation method of rated power
[2024-02-11T20:08:55] Paolo ⁭: But both are very similar, but I'm pretty sure the rion one has more torque
[2024-02-11T20:10:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: That's controller are nice, using Toll mos, i regret they dont have the current charging fonction of the ANT bms, and also the Soft are fucked
[2024-02-11T20:11:09] Mirono escooters: Software is very fucked, shit app
[2024-02-11T20:11:23] Mirono escooters: And yeah, but for size and price? I don't expect a soft start function
[2024-02-11T20:11:59] Mirono escooters: The price makes up for both of those problems 😅 And except if you got crazy capacitance, blowing toll with inrush very hard. 4× or so overcurrent rating Mine after months no problem, every day turn off on
[2024-02-11T20:12:24] Mirono escooters: And they are so small and cute😂 with bt build in The 30a is just cute 😆 Same price as non smart too
[2024-02-11T20:17:04] Happy Giraffe: What do you mean with soft start? Antispark?
[2024-02-11T20:18:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: They are a bit more cheap yes but not much, the point are espacially they are more compact
[2024-02-11T20:18:59] Mirono escooters: Build in
[2024-02-11T20:19:31] Mirono escooters: Saved my MP2 Limited to 20a to charge caps Otherwise it would've dumped 300a in a shorted ceramic cap, prolly arcing whole board.
[2024-02-11T20:19:38] Mirono escooters: Yes that too
[2024-02-11T20:19:42] Mirono escooters: And many diff sizes
[2024-02-11T20:19:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mainly from trails , try a t85 or such and you will know
[2024-02-11T21:15:26] sombre_enfant: What you mean by current charging function ?
[2024-02-11T21:17:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: in Ant you have Pre charge fonction, When you turn on the output on Ant it apply PWM until the voltage output at at the same than the battery voltage, and choice the current in the setting
[2024-02-11T21:18:05] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: With That, if you have small short circuit when you turn on the BMS it's detected and it dont turn on, it's super super Safe
[2024-02-11T21:34:08] haku: check this out boys. premade insulation. design by james.
[2024-02-11T21:34:29] sombre_enfant: Alright its only for testing purpose, with llt i pray first then plug
[2024-02-11T21:37:33] yoann tsobanoglou: Using first batch of spintend 85v200a and am not able to go over 300 phase amps, even if I put 320 to the value, it will replace with 300. Anyone with later versions of the vesc can check if this is true for them also?
[2024-02-11T21:39:17] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yeah, it's right, it's also dont stress the mosfet at every turn on
[2024-02-11T21:39:32] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but so yeah, for many ppl it's not so useful
[2024-02-11T21:58:15] Mirono escooters: Where's rage mechanics site??😰
[2024-02-11T21:58:45] Mirono escooters: You need no limits fw
[2024-02-11T22:05:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I asked this few days ago ,hope not down all the time
[2024-02-11T22:06:48] haku: maybe you have to pay to access?
[2024-02-11T22:08:14] haku: ive seen sites like that. bangbros for example.
[2024-02-11T22:09:09] Jan: what motor?
[2024-02-11T22:10:13] yoann tsobanoglou: I understand it’s blocked by the firmware
[2024-02-11T22:10:47] yoann tsobanoglou: Just curious to see if they changed the new ones since they call it 85v250amp now
[2024-02-11T22:11:48] rosheee: yes
[2024-02-11T22:11:52] rosheee: what motors u use?

[2024-02-11T22:12:02] rosheee: how muchb batterY?
[2024-02-11T22:12:04] rosheee: what windings?
[2024-02-11T22:12:55] yoann tsobanoglou: It’s firmware blocked, nothing to do with hardware
[2024-02-11T22:13:13] yoann tsobanoglou: 20s10p 50s cells
[2024-02-11T22:13:42] Yamal: 17/4 or 22/3?

[2024-02-11T22:14:26] rosheee: Send logfilenand settings xml pls
[2024-02-11T22:14:41] Yamal: Same my battery, but my is 40T
[2024-02-11T22:17:22] Mirono escooters: No way
[2024-02-11T22:17:48] yoann tsobanoglou: 22/3
[2024-02-11T22:18:22] yoann tsobanoglou: 17/4 come on 60h, didn’t know they also made 70h
[2024-02-11T22:19:56] yoann tsobanoglou: How is that going to answer my question? It has nothing to do with setup. I just want to know if spintend changed something on their new batch of controllers since they changed specs in their description.
[2024-02-11T22:22:06] yoann tsobanoglou: Am afraid to lose warranty since spintend is known to be finicky
[2024-02-11T22:22:17] yoann tsobanoglou: But thank you

[2024-02-11T22:29:25] rosheee: On 2 motors?
[2024-02-11T22:29:25] yoann tsobanoglou: This is where we stopped because of big voltage drop
[2024-02-11T22:29:38] yoann tsobanoglou: Of course !

[2024-02-11T22:33:16] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_12829@11-02-2024_22-33-16.jpg>
[2024-02-11T22:33:30] yoann tsobanoglou: 10/11 volts sag max
[2024-02-11T22:34:19] yoann tsobanoglou: Will send tomorrow morning as scooter is at the store
[2024-02-11T22:34:23] Yamal: You get 129,8kmh?
[2024-02-11T22:34:44] yoann tsobanoglou: This was with Fw 80a
[2024-02-11T22:34:55] yoann tsobanoglou: And starting speed was terrible
[2024-02-11T22:35:21] yoann tsobanoglou: Now I have crazy torque but end speed doesn’t go higher than 107 gps
[2024-02-11T22:36:47] Yamal: With which scooter ?
[2024-02-11T22:37:05] yoann tsobanoglou: Platform you mean?
[2024-02-11T22:37:51] yoann tsobanoglou: Nami
[2024-02-11T22:39:48] Yamal: Hey my is Nami to🔥😁‼️
[2024-02-11T22:39:54] Yamal: You have some photo
[2024-02-11T22:43:02] Yamal: <photos/photo_12830@11-02-2024_22-43-02.jpg>
[2024-02-11T22:44:27] rosheee: We no FW
[2024-02-11T22:44:48] sombre_enfant: U dont use field weakening anymore ?
[2024-02-11T22:44:55] rosheee: Nope
[2024-02-11T22:45:00] Yamal: What was your update, in your nami? motors, battery and controls
[2024-02-11T22:45:16] rosheee: With speed motors not
[2024-02-11T22:45:24] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_12831@11-02-2024_22-45-24.jpg>
[2024-02-11T22:45:38] rosheee: Motors sad then
[2024-02-11T22:45:47] rosheee: windings?
[2024-02-11T22:46:02] Jan: Speed motors easy 140kmh no FW
[2024-02-11T22:46:03] rosheee: 107kmh 80A fw?
[2024-02-11T22:46:04] sombre_enfant: What the max speed with the speex motor ? The starting speed is bad no ?
[2024-02-11T22:46:10] rosheee: Oh no
[2024-02-11T22:46:14] rosheee: XD absolute not
[2024-02-11T22:46:21] rosheee: Idk max atm
[2024-02-11T22:46:25] rosheee: Because cold
[2024-02-11T22:46:33] rosheee: And only front brake
[2024-02-11T22:46:33] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-11T22:46:34] Jan: We will see max speed
[2024-02-11T22:46:48] sombre_enfant: 0-50 0-80 0-100 how fast in second ?
[2024-02-11T22:47:08] Jan: We have to record when its warmer
[2024-02-11T22:47:13] yoann tsobanoglou: Torque motors without fw max speed for me is 110
[2024-02-11T22:47:16] Jan: Cannot measure at 8°C
[2024-02-11T22:47:24] Paolo ⁭: We reached 145 without fw
[2024-02-11T22:47:27] sombre_enfant: Record with classic 22x3 also
[2024-02-11T22:47:28] Paolo ⁭: Speed 10 inch motors
[2024-02-11T22:47:36] Jan: 60H?
[2024-02-11T22:47:36] sombre_enfant: But 21s?
[2024-02-11T22:47:39] NetworkDir: Voltage and current ?
[2024-02-11T22:47:51] sombre_enfant: Nah the 65h
[2024-02-11T22:48:07] yoann tsobanoglou: No fw
[2024-02-11T22:48:17] Paolo ⁭: Consider it like a 20s, used cells and nickel pack 😅
[2024-02-11T22:48:57] yoann tsobanoglou: Motors controlers battery
[2024-02-11T22:49:04] sombre_enfant: Yeah same as my cells, i seen they was tested at 3500-3700mah what was the tester
[2024-02-11T22:49:57] Paolo ⁭: 3700 is value for new cells and it's ok
[2024-02-11T22:50:09] Paolo ⁭: His was like 3300 3400
[2024-02-11T22:50:32] sombre_enfant: What tester ?
[2024-02-11T22:50:55] Paolo ⁭: Don't matter what tester, depends by what's the cut off voltage
[2024-02-11T22:51:06] sombre_enfant: I want to know tho
[2024-02-11T22:51:16] Paolo ⁭: Datasheet says nominal capacity is 3700 @2.5v
[2024-02-11T22:51:23] Yamal: This is now , or before ?
[2024-02-11T22:51:38] Paolo ⁭: Datasheet spec, I don't know what tester they use
[2024-02-11T22:52:22] sombre_enfant: So you didnt built it ? There was marking on it
[2024-02-11T22:52:49] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_12832@11-02-2024_22-52-49.jpg>
[2024-02-11T22:53:14] Paolo ⁭: I don't get what you want to know
[2024-02-11T22:53:28] yoann tsobanoglou: Now, once setup is finished, I will send it to paint
[2024-02-11T22:53:29] Paolo ⁭: I mean, 3700mah is nominal capacity of vtc6a
[2024-02-11T22:53:44] Yamal: Nice , heheh🔥
[2024-02-11T22:54:03] sombre_enfant: I want to know how u went up to mark on the cell i bought to you the capacity on it with a black marker
[2024-02-11T22:54:03] Paolo ⁭: You've exactly same configuration as @Guille_Chile
[2024-02-11T22:54:42] Paolo ⁭: The guy who sold me did it
[2024-02-11T22:55:53] Yamal: Wich controller you use
[2024-02-11T22:58:05] Rose: Hey there Luca, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-11T22:58:53] yoann tsobanoglou: Spintend 85v200a
[2024-02-11T22:59:35] Yamal: 70h 22/3 and 20s10p 50s cells?
[2024-02-11T23:01:02] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_12833@11-02-2024_23-01-02.jpg>
[2024-02-11T23:01:10] rosheee: XD wtf
[2024-02-11T23:01:30] yoann tsobanoglou: Yes
[2024-02-11T23:01:39] Jan: wtf
[2024-02-11T23:02:51] yoann tsobanoglou: <animation>
[2024-02-11T23:03:46] yoann tsobanoglou: <animation>
[2024-02-11T23:04:04] yoann tsobanoglou: That’s how they are installed
[2024-02-11T23:04:59] Finn: Wouldnt it make more sense if it was installed vertical?
[2024-02-11T23:05:57] yoann tsobanoglou: The fins on the bottom are vertical, the ones on top inside are horizontal because airflow from vent
[2024-02-11T23:06:12] yoann tsobanoglou: This was test fitting at cutting
[2024-02-11T23:13:36] Finn: Ooh cool
[2024-02-11T23:13:37] Finn: I see
[2024-02-11T23:13:56] Finn: Never saw airflow on a scooter xd
[2024-02-11T23:14:25] yoann tsobanoglou: This was generated with ai, fun project
[2024-02-11T23:27:59] Yamal: My controller is just like this
[2024-02-11T23:59:58] Finn: Hey does anyone know if the vsett 10+ motors got a temp sensor? I was thinking about a dual g30 build
[2024-02-12T00:03:25] haku: im not sure but i doubt it
[2024-02-12T00:04:20] Finn: Sorry i ment 10+
[2024-02-12T00:04:37] Finn: It can
[2024-02-12T00:04:43] Finn: I did it on my blade
[2024-02-12T00:04:47] Finn: Lasted 1minutr
[2024-02-12T00:04:57] Finn: Shorted to the axle😔
[2024-02-12T00:05:12] Finn: I used a very tiny wire
[2024-02-12T00:05:32] haku: its very rare for factory scooters to have temp sensors. i dont why they dont implement it
[2024-02-12T00:05:58] Finn: Money
[2024-02-12T00:06:15] Finn: Im just gonna buy some of these
[2024-02-12T00:06:51] Finn: I really want some motors with temp sensor build in
[2024-02-12T00:07:01] Finn: Also 60H would be perfect for 170A+
[2024-02-12T00:07:12] Finn: Decent torque too
[2024-02-12T00:07:26] haku: vsett 10 is 60h?
[2024-02-12T00:07:48] Finn: 50H
[2024-02-12T00:07:54] haku: i thought was 50
[2024-02-12T00:07:59] Finn: Vsett 10+ is 50H 1400w
[2024-02-12T00:08:42] haku: @jamessoderstrom do you know the size of vsett 9 motor?
[2024-02-12T00:08:49] haku: stator
[2024-02-12T00:09:08] Finn: 40H magnets
[2024-02-12T00:09:42] Finn: <photos/photo_12836@12-02-2024_00-09-42.jpg>
[2024-02-12T00:10:00] Finn: <photos/photo_12837@12-02-2024_00-10-00.jpg>
[2024-02-12T00:10:13] Finn: Pretty cheap
[2024-02-12T00:10:24] Finn: No temp sensor😭
[2024-02-12T00:24:41] Finn: Hmm i only find phase cables without temp sensor cable https://a.aliexpress.com/_EwwO43R
[2024-02-12T00:26:13] haku: im sure its pretty hard to fit a temp sensor wire. i imagine you have to remove all the cables and add a wire when putting it back in
[2024-02-12T00:27:14] Finn: I mean there exist motors with temp sensor so cables also exist
[2024-02-12T00:28:02] haku: i wanted to do this on my 50h laotie motor but the phase cables suck that its so close to the disk brake. i think its gonna rub when i add another wire
[2024-02-12T00:29:04] Finn: Fuck hall sensor imma put large phase wire only through😂
[2024-02-12T00:29:13] haku: i still want to try and put one also thicker phase cables. but ive heard its impssible
[2024-02-12T00:29:14] Jan: I really like the air duct, cool idea. You could make the right duct feed air for the other controller, then you can basically seal the floor. The ducts allow some relatively clean air flow, while with the closed bottom the radiators dont get dirty
[2024-02-12T00:30:30] haku: how did you manage to put holes on that motor?
[2024-02-12T00:30:48] Finn: Take cover off
[2024-02-12T00:31:13] haku: can you buy one pre holed?
[2024-02-12T00:31:56] Finn: I dont think so
[2024-02-12T00:31:59] Finn: Just drill them in
[2024-02-12T00:32:04] haku: also are these 70h motors known to get hot that it needs holes?
[2024-02-12T00:34:05] Finn: Idk what size the blade 10 phase wires are.
[2024-02-12T00:34:12] Finn: If i knew i could order some new ones
[2024-02-12T00:37:11] sombre_enfant: 4mm2 or 3.5
[2024-02-12T00:37:36] sombre_enfant: 33x2 in race yes
[2024-02-12T00:37:44] Finn: So 5mm2 would be very hard to fit in 😒
[2024-02-12T00:37:49] Finn: Or even 4.5
[2024-02-12T00:38:11] haku: maybe if you remove the sleeve?
[2024-02-12T00:38:35] haku: might be a dumb idea
[2024-02-12T00:40:01] haku: damn. im not racing just regular riding and burnouts. should i drill holes on mine?
[2024-02-12T00:40:26] Finn: Yeah i also thought abt that
[2024-02-12T00:40:29] haku: if im gonna drill it i want it lazer cut with heart shapes
[2024-02-12T00:40:31] Finn: But too risky
[2024-02-12T00:40:44] Finn: Maybe just sensorless
[2024-02-12T00:40:56] Finn: And then you can put in thicker wires
[2024-02-12T00:41:12] Finn: But idk if sensorless does a good job at low speeds
[2024-02-12T00:41:30] Finn: 33x2 are very high kv
[2024-02-12T00:41:31] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Finn has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-12T00:41:55] Jason Nelson: I was having an issue with a negative current applying itself when I let off the throttle before and I thought it happened while using field weakening but it turns out it does it any time I'm above 30mph. It has started to throw an overcurrent error message and I lose breaking and throttle until it resets. Here is the error message if anyone can help me motivate this issue
[2024-02-12T00:41:57] haku: my 70h is 33x2.
[2024-02-12T00:42:05] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_12838@12-02-2024_00-42-05.jpg>
[2024-02-12T00:42:15] NetworkDir: I hope zero phase cables can handle 50-60A b and 100-110A phase
[2024-02-12T00:42:23] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_12839@12-02-2024_00-42-23.jpg>
[2024-02-12T00:42:46] sombre_enfant: No
[2024-02-12T00:42:57] Yamal: If your engines don't have holes, why make them? so that it dissipates heat better? You don't need it, it's one more impediment for rainy days, etc. It has its positive side, I take them, but if I didn't take them I wouldn't make them for you.
[2024-02-12T00:43:03] sombre_enfant: U sure its not 22x3 ?
[2024-02-12T00:43:24] haku: its 33x2 high speed according to LY
[2024-02-12T00:43:42] Finn: No hall?
[2024-02-12T00:43:44] Jason Nelson: I have battery max Regen set to -15 and motor current max brake to -80
[2024-02-12T00:43:54] haku: it be cool and unique to have heart shapes on it though
[2024-02-12T00:44:07] Finn: You need more amps to reach the same torque so the motor gets hotter
[2024-02-12T00:44:11] sombre_enfant: Stop trippin
[2024-02-12T00:44:18] haku: goes well with my i love china theme
[2024-02-12T00:44:27] sombre_enfant: Theres
[2024-02-12T00:44:34] Jan: You have lower internal resistance
[2024-02-12T00:44:39] Yamal: 33/2 you might notice a bit of the crazy absence of torque, but at top speed hold on well as it has no limits, and from 50/60kmh they hit the ground running!
[2024-02-12T00:44:42] Finn: Ah the black wire?
[2024-02-12T00:44:47] Finn: What motor is that
[2024-02-12T00:45:22] sombre_enfant: Yeah it can take more amps
[2024-02-12T00:45:28] Yamal: I like to 33/2 I hope in future can do another e scooter with 75h33/2
[2024-02-12T00:45:32] haku: we will see. im planning to only use 350a bms. i really want to add more p if i cant burnouts
[2024-02-12T00:45:38] Jan: And heat less
[2024-02-12T00:46:16] sombre_enfant: I pray on your downfall for burnout
[2024-02-12T00:46:39] sombre_enfant: Not good for race tho
[2024-02-12T00:46:47] haku: thanks for the love homie
[2024-02-12T00:46:57] Jan: Depends ok track
[2024-02-12T00:47:02] sombre_enfant: True
[2024-02-12T00:47:34] Jan: If you can deliver the amps, then you also have torque
[2024-02-12T00:47:37] haku: ill be using my scooter to do burnouts till homeowner association reports me
[2024-02-12T00:48:24] sombre_enfant: U a homeowner ? Thats tuff actualy
[2024-02-12T00:48:29] Jan: But low kv cannot get high topspeed
[2024-02-12T00:48:44] Jan: FW is just afterburner
[2024-02-12T00:49:03] sombre_enfant: 22*3 do 110 no fw on 20s with good acceleration ?
[2024-02-12T00:49:05] haku: my neighbor. drifts his car in the street. ill be fine
[2024-02-12T00:49:26] Jan: Yes thats a good balance
[2024-02-12T00:49:35] Jan: You got 60H?
[2024-02-12T00:49:38] sombre_enfant: Yes lonnyo 60h
[2024-02-12T00:49:50] sombre_enfant: No vsett
[2024-02-12T00:50:03] sombre_enfant: I didnt make it out the hood yet
[2024-02-12T00:50:23] Jan: Vsett is 50H 16x4 to my knowledge
[2024-02-12T00:50:29] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-02-12T00:50:50] Jan: Then how you know this?
[2024-02-12T00:51:05] sombre_enfant: I checked the review here
[2024-02-12T00:51:20] Jan: K
[2024-02-12T00:51:23] haku: does it have a temp semsor wire?
[2024-02-12T00:53:09] sombre_enfant: If i okay on weight and the geometry is good i might buy two pair if not i change the scooter maybe a dualtron victor
[2024-02-12T00:54:02] sombre_enfant: I dont want g30 like everyone, i had 3 g30....
[2024-02-12T00:55:19] haku: just buy a cheap frame and bolt on the best parts you can put
[2024-02-12T00:55:26] sombre_enfant: No
[2024-02-12T00:55:51] haku: so boogie
[2024-02-12T00:56:36] sombre_enfant: If i do a build now its for race, for commuting i have g30 and pro2
[2024-02-12T00:57:36] Yamal: Yes 110 22/3 +- With 15% fw 124,9kmh(me..)
[2024-02-12T00:57:57] sombre_enfant: Now i gatekeep 🥸
[2024-02-12T00:58:48] Happy Giraffe: Lol, just ride first and monitor temps. Maybe holes not even needed when ferrofluided
[2024-02-12T00:59:38] sombre_enfant: Wich cnc panel u have at work ? U doing lathe or mill ? Siemens fanuc heidenhain mazatroll hurco ?
[2024-02-12T01:00:02] Happy Giraffe: Whats your field weakening switch delay set to?
[2024-02-12T01:00:29] Happy Giraffe: Still at school we have some Mazak etc
[2024-02-12T01:00:54] Happy Giraffe: Haven't done much on cn machines. Mostly on manual so far
[2024-02-12T01:01:27] sombre_enfant: Dont fool with those once u can do ez parts move on cnc
[2024-02-12T01:02:28] Happy Giraffe: Problem is the lack of cn machines at school. Too many students for too few machines, but anyway it's offtopic stuff😁
[2024-02-12T01:03:04] sombre_enfant: Clap their ass take the machine
[2024-02-12T01:12:49] Paolo ⁭: There's two version, if the axle is M14 then normally u got 3mm2 wire, if m12 then 2,5
[2024-02-12T01:13:22] Paolo ⁭: Only oldest version has 3mm2
[2024-02-12T01:22:59] haku: these holders fit without using a bigger battery box
[2024-02-12T01:26:10] haku: i can try to slice a full 20s10p to save more space but i think this is a good setup.
[2024-02-12T01:27:31] haku: scooter eta june 6. get ready france
[2024-02-12T01:38:41] Jason Nelson: I don't have field weakening active
[2024-02-12T01:39:37] Jason Nelson: Where do I find those settings?
[2024-02-12T01:39:42] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_12841@12-02-2024_01-39-42.jpg>
[2024-02-12T01:40:01] haku: printing the rest of these holders. awsome design bro.
[2024-02-12T01:41:58] haku: this filament sucks. idk why it does this. last night it was printimg fine.
[2024-02-12T01:54:42] Ion: Thanks for the explanation, I tried drawing it in paint and I get it :)
[2024-02-12T01:55:24] Ion: <photos/photo_12843@12-02-2024_01-55-24.jpg>
[2024-02-12T01:57:50] Ion: also @AJAJ1992 say if I wanted to try and make similar swingarms for the stock ninebot wheel (not motor mount), the procedure would be the same? Offset the wheel mounting further back and making sure the scooter is level + enough clearance for steering
[2024-02-12T01:58:20] Ion: Did you choose a specific angle? Or just what fits
[2024-02-12T01:58:56] haku: 100mph run
[2024-02-12T02:00:37] Ion: aww, cute doggo
[2024-02-12T02:01:39] haku: he can keep up with me 100mph
[2024-02-12T07:01:54] Happy Giraffe: Then it won't matter, I was talking about the ramp up time. If you use it, might wanna put it 500ms+ 👍 Otherwise not sure how negative overcurrent possible other than an insane ebrake values
[2024-02-12T08:58:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Just making some updates, website will be back today
[2024-02-12T09:00:05] Face de Pin Sucé: This looks like my work
[2024-02-12T09:02:40] Yamal: How is your purple escooter ..? 😁
[2024-02-12T09:03:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Beautiful 😜
[2024-02-12T09:09:34] Yamal: Soon new update or just the same ,,🔥?
[2024-02-12T09:11:25] Yamal: The c350 controller I really 350A phase ?
[2024-02-12T09:15:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2024-02-12T09:15:25] Face de Pin Sucé: The same, powerful enough
[2024-02-12T09:17:29] Yamal: <photos/photo_12844@12-02-2024_09-17-29.jpg>

[2024-02-12T09:18:08] Yamal: You can see 400A two controller battery..?
[2024-02-12T09:22:01] yoann tsobanoglou: Motors for me came like this. But scooter is intended for track and in Greece weather is hot. Building a bronco with nami parts for daily driver
[2024-02-12T09:31:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Gatekeep what?
[2024-02-12T09:31:58] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't understand the question
[2024-02-12T09:35:23] Yamal: Yeah! I mean that with the c350 mounted on your e-scooter can you see 400A continuous battery?, since one is already 200A,,
[2024-02-12T09:36:12] Yamal: of course with a high discharge battery that can deliver...
[2024-02-12T09:39:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, a little bit more than 410A
[2024-02-12T09:41:05] Yamal: Phase 800A?
[2024-02-12T09:41:46] Yamal: I ask you because you have really been able to see how they work and what they deliver...
[2024-02-12T09:49:21] Face de Pin Sucé: 700+ for now
[2024-02-12T10:52:10] Rose: Hey there Mou, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-12T11:39:12] haku: 700 phase per motor. thats crazy.

[2024-02-12T11:39:29] haku: gotcha!
[2024-02-12T12:47:22] Mr.Mou: Hello guys, is there someone who installed dual VSETT's 75100 into the G30 Max?
[2024-02-12T15:57:39] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2024-02-12T16:24:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What does that even mean vsett's? I did dual 75100 on g30 But not sure what you mean
[2024-02-12T16:26:37] Konstantin: Gg spintend. 8 fets - trash + drivers xD
[2024-02-12T16:26:37] Konstantin: <photos/photo_12846@12-02-2024_16-26-37.jpg>
[2024-02-12T16:27:27] Konstantin: Have no idea how, just ask me to test them... Motor not spinning xDDD

[2024-02-12T16:47:19] Happy Giraffe: Solder ball check😁
[2024-02-12T16:48:29] sombre_enfant: How to process ?
[2024-02-12T16:52:05] Konstantin: All part was separate: fets, cap board,alu board without fets like 1st on video, logic:: dead mcu + drivers...
[2024-02-12T16:55:24] haku: ive watched it. will you make a video on this 85200?
[2024-02-12T16:55:38] haku: great vid

[2024-02-12T17:14:02] Mr.Mou: Can you send me how you did the connection between the dash and the second controller?
[2024-02-12T17:22:46] sombre_enfant: Second controller u put the can wire, for the dash theres a whole thread and a lot of pictures here
[2024-02-12T17:38:50] Happy Giraffe: What hero said+maybe you might wanna try upgrading thermal pads (if it has those easily accessible, havent opened myself) to thermal grizzly etc.
[2024-02-12T17:39:19] Happy Giraffe: Thermal pad upgrade made thr first gen 75100 spin usable
[2024-02-12T17:49:39] Mr.Mou: Can you send me that thread please?
[2024-02-12T17:53:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nowdays i even find elsewhere

[2024-02-12T18:40:17] Konstantin: <photos/photo_12849@12-02-2024_18-40-17.jpg>
[2024-02-12T18:51:17] Mirono escooters: O o

[2024-02-12T19:13:12] Mirono escooters: Wich company ships to china for 15?
[2024-02-12T19:13:57] Paolo ⁭: postal service
[2024-02-12T19:14:12] Paolo ⁭: but i thought wasnt possible because of the weight
[2024-02-12T19:20:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He does g30 dash with 2 flipsky
[2024-02-12T19:22:15] Happy Giraffe: How thick you used?🤔
[2024-02-12T19:22:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He used that word instead of flipsky Corrected under
[2024-02-12T19:23:10] Jason Nelson: I was able to get it to stop throwing the overcurrent message in what I can only imagine it's a not ideal way. I changed oc mode from report to disabled
[2024-02-12T19:23:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on phone
[2024-02-12T19:23:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Buy s24 pro, its more than better than these solutions for it
[2024-02-12T19:24:13] Happy Giraffe: Would be interesting to have two 100w heater blocks, 1mm pad and 10mm alu block on top with thermistors to see which one transfers faster
[2024-02-12T19:25:20] Jason Nelson: Maybe you have a suggestion
[2024-02-12T19:25:46] Mirono escooters: Fuck
[2024-02-12T19:27:23] Jason Nelson: Here's the issue
[2024-02-12T19:27:57] Jason Nelson: I would be happy to oblige any more information needed
[2024-02-12T19:29:03] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_12850@12-02-2024_19-29-03.jpg>
[2024-02-12T19:29:17] Jason Nelson: And this
[2024-02-12T19:30:13] Jason Nelson: It's the only issue I currently have
[2024-02-12T19:30:41] Jason Nelson: I have mitigated my oversaturation
[2024-02-12T19:31:15] Jason Nelson: .
[2024-02-12T19:31:19] Mirono escooters: O it's back?
[2024-02-12T19:31:27] Mirono escooters: No it isn't
[2024-02-12T19:32:20] Jason Nelson: 4000w positive limit 3000w negative limit
[2024-02-12T19:32:32] Happy Giraffe: It is
[2024-02-12T19:32:43] Happy Giraffe: Now that I swiped down🌚
[2024-02-12T19:34:11] Jason Nelson: I know this isn't the best way that's why I came to the chat to try to resolve it
[2024-02-12T19:34:28] Happy Giraffe: 👍
[2024-02-12T19:34:32] Jason Nelson: I just turned it off less than a mile ago before I got home because it wouldn't stop
[2024-02-12T19:34:32] Mirono escooters: 😭
[2024-02-12T19:34:55] Happy Giraffe: EZ, just swipe it again from top-bottom then right to left
[2024-02-12T19:34:56] francois schempers: xD
[2024-02-12T19:35:28] Mirono escooters: I hope whoever invented these swipe gestures steps on a Lego piece
[2024-02-12T19:35:40] Happy Giraffe: Opening always necessary after hiding and showing again?🤔
[2024-02-12T19:37:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It looks
[2024-02-12T21:05:23] haku: has anyone tried to use rpm meters on a scooter?
[2024-02-12T21:06:11] haku: just an interesting tool and good to see if its accurate
[2024-02-12T21:07:30] haku: is vesctool rpm pretty accurate? i dont even know why i have to measure it.
[2024-02-12T21:15:09] Hemi Murin: hi, what are these convectors please? (G30 ninebot)
[2024-02-12T21:37:41] haku: what is the best glue to use for petg? superglue seems to work but its not meant for it
[2024-02-12T21:39:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically smooth bed plates need it
[2024-02-12T21:39:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pva
[2024-02-12T21:40:51] haku: i mean to stick together parts. this one says its not meant for petg
[2024-02-12T21:42:24] haku: it says in the back not to use it for Polyethylene.
[2024-02-12T21:43:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh for that
[2024-02-12T21:43:47] haku: my guess is plastic epoxy might be best. im not sure though
[2024-02-12T21:45:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://www.3dprintgorilla.com/petg-3d-prints-glue/
[2024-02-12T21:45:31] haku: ty
[2024-02-12T21:45:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You decide
[2024-02-12T21:46:33] haku: yes ill test epoxy. that never failed me before with plastics
[2024-02-12T21:46:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Epoxy is rigid
[2024-02-12T21:47:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Glues things nice but up to usage if its good or not
[2024-02-12T21:47:51] haku: gotcha. ill do some tests. ill be using it to bond battery holders
[2024-02-12T21:49:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say buy pu50 glue
[2024-02-12T21:49:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Polyurethane Glue
[2024-02-12T21:50:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I like enfi and illbruck brand the most
[2024-02-12T21:50:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's kinda permanent
[2024-02-12T21:50:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And also its a sealing stuff
[2024-02-12T21:50:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Paintable
[2024-02-12T21:50:45] haku: thats fine. ill check out home depot later. thanks
[2024-02-12T21:50:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can seal boats with that actually
[2024-02-12T21:51:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Reallly
[2024-02-12T21:51:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its industrial stuff
[2024-02-12T21:51:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont apply by hand
[2024-02-12T21:51:40] haku: is it transparent? i mean when it dries does it have a color?
[2024-02-12T21:51:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mostly grey
[2024-02-12T21:52:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Try epoxy if you have
[2024-02-12T21:53:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you mess your clothes with it ,it will never wash out ,so use with care
[2024-02-12T21:53:46] haku: i only have jb weld. i need to get plastic epoxy.
[2024-02-12T21:53:52] Finn: <photos/photo_12853@12-02-2024_21-53-52.jpg>
[2024-02-12T21:54:00] Finn: Im not sure if i can get them through the axle
[2024-02-12T21:55:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure what's that ,but you can try on a piece of left over what you would throw out
[2024-02-12T21:58:01] haku: i think you have to remove all the cables and feed it with the extra cable when putting back in. im not to sure though
[2024-02-12T21:58:26] haku: wait for vesc lords answer.
[2024-02-12T21:58:39] Finn: <photos/photo_12854@12-02-2024_21-58-39.jpg>
[2024-02-12T22:03:00] Finn: What are they called? Anyone knows that?
[2024-02-12T22:08:22] Mirono escooters: Insulation sleeves? Fibreglass?
[2024-02-12T22:09:28] haku: fireproof sleeves
[2024-02-12T22:10:33] Finn: Thanks 3m for 7€
[2024-02-12T22:12:27] Jason Nelson: I'm pretty sure slow abs limit fixes the error but also destroys my torque and top speed
[2024-02-12T22:14:19] Finn: <photos/photo_12855@12-02-2024_22-14-19.jpg>
[2024-02-12T22:15:12] Finn: Yeah
[2024-02-12T22:15:19] Finn: I hope i get the right cables😂

[2024-02-12T22:26:55] Jason Nelson: I will test
[2024-02-12T22:27:12] Finn: So theres no way to get 3mm2 into the 7mm axle hole? Damn. What about only having the hall wires insulated?
[2024-02-12T22:38:16] Jason Nelson: P100 motor with 75100 aluminum
[2024-02-12T22:38:32] Jason Nelson: The motor has fluid
[2024-02-12T22:41:01] haku: im sure that might work.
[2024-02-12T22:41:41] haku: might not be the best idea but your removing some thick sleeving
[2024-02-12T22:42:02] haku: just insulate after the hole
[2024-02-12T22:43:07] Jason Nelson: Yes hall sensor
[2024-02-12T22:43:23] Jason Nelson: So when I disable my speed goes from 33 to 22
[2024-02-12T22:44:59] Jason Nelson: None. The problem is when I release the throttle I get backfeed
[2024-02-12T22:45:48] Finn: Did you rewire your motor also?
[2024-02-12T22:45:51] Jason Nelson: It didn't saturate I just get no torque or speed
[2024-02-12T22:46:13] Jason Nelson: What application would the settings be used for?
[2024-02-12T22:46:15] Jason Nelson: Yes
[2024-02-12T22:46:33] Jason Nelson: Is field weakening better for your hardware?
[2024-02-12T22:46:47] sombre_enfant: No its Julien
[2024-02-12T22:48:00] Finn: Im just gonna order 3mm2 and insulate it with heat sleeve.
[2024-02-12T22:48:07] Jason Nelson: That is the only issue I have
[2024-02-12T22:48:54] Finn: Anyone know if sensorless works fine for low speed under 10kmh?
[2024-02-12T22:49:16] haku: what awg is 3mm2?
[2024-02-12T22:49:27] Finn: Does it saturate even at low speed?
[2024-02-12T22:49:51] Jason Nelson: The p100 motor also works great on sensorless as well
[2024-02-12T22:49:59] Jason Nelson: Saturation is because of current not speed
[2024-02-12T22:50:27] Finn: Yes but you need the same amps as on hall or not?
[2024-02-12T22:50:44] haku: i want to do something similar i have 11awg wires
[2024-02-12T22:51:59] Finn: Ah okay
[2024-02-12T22:54:32] Finn: Damn 21€+ 8€ shipping😭😭 It even has 6 hall wires for temp and 3mm2 wires
[2024-02-12T22:55:12] Finn: <photos/photo_12867@12-02-2024_22-55-12.jpg>
[2024-02-12T22:56:47] Finn: 12 awg
[2024-02-12T22:56:56] Finn: 3,3mm is 12awg
[2024-02-12T22:56:56] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Finn has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-12T23:03:06] haku: i have thick sleeving in my laotie 50h. i want to change it to 11awg too. its just the cables are too close to the disks.
[2024-02-12T23:03:06] haku: <photos/photo_12869@12-02-2024_23-03-06.jpg>
[2024-02-12T23:03:36] haku: stupid design choice
[2024-02-12T23:07:59] Finn: Shit they are very close
[2024-02-12T23:08:12] Finn: whats the axle hole diameter?
[2024-02-12T23:08:51] haku: i havent measure it.
[2024-02-12T23:09:32] Finn: Yeah looks fine
[2024-02-12T23:09:36] Finn: Maybe remove the spring
[2024-02-12T23:09:53] haku: gotcha. i wanted to add a temp sensor in the future though
[2024-02-12T23:10:06] Finn: Get a 6wire like me
[2024-02-12T23:10:11] Finn: Only 30€💀😭
[2024-02-12T23:13:48] haku: for 2 harnesses or 1?
[2024-02-12T23:27:32] Gabe Enzo: customer satisfied.
[2024-02-12T23:36:12] haku: what work did you do?
[2024-02-12T23:37:36] Gabe Enzo: tyre change.
[2024-02-12T23:38:46] haku: those xiomis are tubeless like g30?
[2024-02-12T23:40:23] haku: use a paint pen. looks like you scratched the rim 😁
[2024-02-13T00:01:04] Mirono escooters: No
[2024-02-13T06:57:09] Finn: 1

[2024-02-13T08:58:28] Mr.Mou: Hello guys, can you please let me know what does mean 2. PPM, 3. Can, 4. SWD, 6. UART2?
[2024-02-13T09:03:39] Hemi Murin: hi, what are these convectors please? (G30 ninebot)
[2024-02-13T10:22:02] Finn: <photos/photo_12872@13-02-2024_10-22-02.jpg>

[2024-02-13T12:30:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ppm uart and can are communication Ppm is for wireless remote , if not used u can use to power something what needs 5v Swd to stlink vesc if needed With can you join two contollers Uart2 for Bluetooth
[2024-02-13T12:51:13] sombre_enfant: @TherealLizardDoggo esab warrior 500i is it good for alu for da g30
[2024-02-13T13:15:11] Mr.Mou: Thanks! In case I use the stock dash of G30 Max (Red, Green, Yellow, Black wires), how will esc know the signals for throttle and brake? This is the reason why I saw in some pictures additional resistors and capacitators?
[2024-02-13T13:21:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You should see in that even with low amps in tig aka awi
[2024-02-13T13:33:17] Happy Giraffe: Kemppi❤️🔥

[2024-02-13T14:04:26] Mirono escooters: Now coat in some nice resin🥰
[2024-02-13T14:08:06] Finn: Will you polish it after the laser?
[2024-02-13T14:08:17] Finn: The contrast would be way higher
[2024-02-13T14:09:59] Yamal: Yeah ! I will sand it and give it a colorless varnish
[2024-02-13T14:10:02] haku: wood grain finish. very classy
[2024-02-13T14:18:16] Yamal: it is wooden
[2024-02-13T14:27:18] sombre_enfant: Wym ?
[2024-02-13T14:31:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brand

[2024-02-13T14:38:29] Mirono escooters: 60v 16s
[2024-02-13T14:38:33] Mirono escooters: If we talk about li ion
[2024-02-13T14:41:44] Gabe Enzo: customer wants a 4s. or 5s
[2024-02-13T14:41:55] Gabe Enzo: 6s preferable
[2024-02-13T14:42:01] Gabe Enzo: dunno what single esc can do that I think this is a 33x4
[2024-02-13T14:46:21] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12877@13-02-2024_14-46-21.jpg>

[2024-02-13T14:53:50] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-13T14:58:18] haku: what do you meam 33 x4?
[2024-02-13T15:00:06] Gabe Enzo: Any idea how I can adjust this tubeless tire
[2024-02-13T15:00:10] Gabe Enzo: idk the motor
[2024-02-13T15:01:25] sombre_enfant: Lorch v40, safro digipuls 420
[2024-02-13T15:02:06] haku: what do you mean by adjust?
[2024-02-13T15:02:37] haku: remove?
[2024-02-13T15:04:58] Gabe Enzo: No, fix it
[2024-02-13T15:05:00] Gabe Enzo: it's wobbly.
[2024-02-13T15:05:23] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-02-13T15:06:46] haku: bead it correctly
[2024-02-13T15:06:54] Gabe Enzo: what's that mean
[2024-02-13T15:07:35] haku: did you do a tire change?
[2024-02-13T15:07:54] Gabe Enzo: No
[2024-02-13T15:07:57] Gabe Enzo: his tyre is just wobbly
[2024-02-13T15:08:35] haku: bead means if the tubeless tire is seated on the lip properly
[2024-02-13T15:09:05] Gabe Enzo: How do I bead it
[2024-02-13T15:09:09] Gabe Enzo: I can't even get a
[2024-02-13T15:09:11] Gabe Enzo: tool in there
[2024-02-13T15:09:17] Gabe Enzo: I'm too frail
[2024-02-13T15:09:29] haku: check the lip if its even
[2024-02-13T15:11:25] haku: i dont really know just guessing tbh.
[2024-02-13T15:19:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is lot good ones for now
[2024-02-13T15:21:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont like does what has the airflow or you need to modify it coz two strong and worse position possible ,can make you really sick
[2024-02-13T15:22:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Esab is also oldschool,i remember when there was not this much options,so esab was everywhere,
[2024-02-13T15:24:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure what changed till i bought, but knowledge of all brands now wide ,what pushed down price But Unsure if you let some fall down will it be ok when you pickup ,esab ones sturdy ,but yeah ,who drops it down 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-13T15:27:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well it's basically not a too good tire
[2024-02-13T15:28:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No hand tools will help
[2024-02-13T15:29:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You should have proper air compressor what sends enough air really fast so it jumps in position, while middle of the tire is belted
[2024-02-13T15:33:06] Gabe Enzo: I have a compressor for a car
[2024-02-13T15:33:45] Gabe Enzo: dad uses it for his corolla 2002
[2024-02-13T15:33:54] Gabe Enzo: He bought a Tesla recently
[2024-02-13T15:33:57] Gabe Enzo: it's still not here.
[2024-02-13T15:33:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Doesnt mean its good enough
[2024-02-13T15:34:34] Gabe Enzo: Where do I go
[2024-02-13T15:34:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When its on max how much pressure is it?
[2024-02-13T15:35:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 6 not enough usually even with wide tubing
[2024-02-13T15:35:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If spiral and cigaretta wide farly not enough
[2024-02-13T15:35:21] Gabe Enzo: 50psi
[2024-02-13T15:35:25] Gabe Enzo: is max
[2024-02-13T15:35:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not enough
[2024-02-13T15:35:40] Gabe Enzo: But the tyre says 50
[2024-02-13T15:36:00] Gabe Enzo: One exploded in my face before
[2024-02-13T15:36:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bro that's 3,5 bar only
[2024-02-13T15:36:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also its not reallly about load
[2024-02-13T15:37:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its about the amount what you deliver/x time
[2024-02-13T15:37:21] Gabe Enzo: How much psi would you go for
[2024-02-13T15:37:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably will work
[2024-02-13T15:37:28] Gabe Enzo: I don't know my physics'
[2024-02-13T15:37:42] Gabe Enzo: Just so I know when to stop pumping
[2024-02-13T15:38:02] Gabe Enzo: the kugoo has no motor plugs
[2024-02-13T15:38:05] Gabe Enzo: so fuckig shit
[2024-02-13T15:38:05] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-13T15:38:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As i said its not about the end psi ,its about the delivery and mostly you need more than rated to make it jump up
[2024-02-13T15:38:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Take a rachet belt with you
[2024-02-13T15:39:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It should hold the diameter around it in the middle ,since that cant grow sides will jump in position
[2024-02-13T15:39:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If rim is good for that tire
[2024-02-13T15:39:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or🤣🤣 but you will not like this ,you can blow it on
[2024-02-13T15:40:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like on trucks
[2024-02-13T15:40:45] Gabe Enzo: Huh
[2024-02-13T15:40:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: With brake cleaner and you light it
[2024-02-13T15:40:50] Gabe Enzo: you mean It can explode
[2024-02-13T15:40:58] Gabe Enzo: Nvm
[2024-02-13T15:41:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But that's not to safe if apply tooooooo much
[2024-02-13T15:41:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Surly
[2024-02-13T15:41:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Even truck tire explodes if apply too much
[2024-02-13T15:41:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In that case they do both
[2024-02-13T15:41:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Apply air Valve and fluid and blow on
[2024-02-13T15:42:48] Gabe Enzo: This wouldn't handle 10kw will it
[2024-02-13T15:43:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on how much time
[2024-02-13T15:43:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For once surly
[2024-02-13T15:43:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than smoke🤣
[2024-02-13T15:43:50] Gabe Enzo: Only peaking a 3kw single motor
[2024-02-13T15:43:53] Gabe Enzo: 2kw
[2024-02-13T15:44:15] Gabe Enzo: I think it's a torque motor
[2024-02-13T15:45:49] sombre_enfant: Welder said lorch v40 is best for alu
[2024-02-13T15:51:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Best is to ask this Pretty much times and try it up to your eyes also ,everybody is different
[2024-02-13T16:32:10] Yamal: What type of vesc controllers do you classify as good or high-end?
[2024-02-13T16:34:40] Yamal: especially for your experience, components, etc.
[2024-02-13T16:54:58] sombre_enfant: They should discontinu it
[2024-02-13T16:56:04] sombre_enfant: It will know from the dash like it does originally
[2024-02-13T16:56:37] Mirono escooters: Makes em money
[2024-02-13T16:57:07] sombre_enfant: When they out of stock ofc

[2024-02-13T18:03:33] haku: 53 years young balls of steel racing scooters
[2024-02-13T18:49:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, he earned my respect on the end of the video for sure 😎
[2024-02-13T18:55:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nah , i would say He is ageless , Also fearing grandma and dogo than racetrack is super understandable also
[2024-02-13T18:56:43] haku: i know i cant do what they are doing. balls of steel going that fast on a scooter.
[2024-02-13T19:16:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well , good road Good tires and practice helps Non came with skill However some has more than others but you need to find it by experience and practice I also say grandma and dogs or both together can be much worse thing that anything on track Like i seen this Small Street downtown Grandma comes out to the door of the house and lets dog out on automatic leash , while dog goes to the otherside of the road, So there is wire across the road And if you dont see this coming you fall and probably pull the dog and grandma closer to eachother
[2024-02-13T19:17:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔 it can also happen that my point is different,since i was searching adrenalin all my life 😅
[2024-02-13T20:19:35] Gabe Enzo: huh
[2024-02-13T20:19:39] Gabe Enzo: wym

[2024-02-13T20:21:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need to tie it around as i said you dont want to inflate middle part ,just make sides jump in position
[2024-02-13T20:29:12] haku: try this
[2024-02-13T20:30:10] haku: if its beaded right/seated properly you dont need to though.
[2024-02-13T20:30:15] Tommy ª: bruh nobody uses a normal compressor? 💀
[2024-02-13T20:30:44] haku: someday i want one.
[2024-02-13T20:30:52] Tommy ª: make it
[2024-02-13T20:31:16] haku: what how?
[2024-02-13T20:32:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well good one better buy
[2024-02-13T20:32:51] haku: if i remember my 11 inch i had to take it to the tire shop to get it beaded properly.
[2024-02-13T20:33:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This the way but probably your rims ment for that
[2024-02-13T20:34:16] haku: i tried this on my 11 inch tire. its difficult. its easy for a 12
[2024-02-13T20:34:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like i have v shaped motor compressor,but its ment to paint , would be nice to have spiral powered
[2024-02-13T21:20:25] haku: what esc does this scooter use? kelly? https://youtu.be/_PkogocGIIc?si=gT2iijELY9x6AHe_
[2024-02-13T21:23:57] Yamal: Heavy, for have many carbon
[2024-02-13T21:24:27] haku: yea full carbon. first time ive seen that
[2024-02-13T21:25:34] Yamal: Also the dualtron X type mast does not help it much, I have followed the model since it came out, and nothing is always cool when powerful vehicles come onto the market,,
[2024-02-13T21:25:43] Yamal: But the weight…….
[2024-02-13T21:26:33] haku: i guess as of this moment this is the production scooter to beat. speed wise
[2024-02-13T21:27:26] haku: weight can always be countered by more power
[2024-02-13T21:27:36] haku: murikan way haha
[2024-02-13T21:29:05] Yamal: 63kg for carbon vs racing scooter …
[2024-02-13T21:29:58] haku: what racing scooter? can it be bought? off the shelf?
[2024-02-13T21:30:39] Yamal: They call it that right?
[2024-02-13T21:31:07] Yamal: I guess you can't only buy it from voro motors
[2024-02-13T21:31:10] haku: scooters just getting more ridiculous. no one needs tgat much speed on the street
[2024-02-13T21:32:07] Mirono escooters: Ratchet straps never worked for me G30 tire must be too thin
[2024-02-13T21:33:06] Yamal: but having it never hurts, powerful or powerful vehicles will be able to give you experiences that a normal series vehicle will never be able to.
[2024-02-13T21:33:36] haku: only thing that makes this stand out is the carbon frame. most of its parts you can get in aliexpress haha
[2024-02-13T21:37:08] haku: is it 97v or 84v? he said 97v in the video
[2024-02-13T21:40:20] Yamal: And what I was referring to before, maybe I didn't express myself well, for me any scooter can make you enjoy and have a good time, the same Xiaomi, who didn't have it, and it helps you go to work or run errands, for me Electric mobility is amazing, but powerful scooters that make numbers are on another level, nothing more
[2024-02-13T21:42:30] haku: i agree. scooters are fun but weaving thru american traffic at 70mph is crazy. i will do it in a straight airfield not in the street. if i want to go fast i want to be seated on a bike or a car. im not as ballsey as you guys
[2024-02-13T21:43:20] haku: good to know our scooters can go fast but be safe too
[2024-02-13T21:44:21] Tommy ª: you have europe
[2024-02-13T21:44:30] Tommy ª: *gets fined for go 26kmh with a m365*
[2024-02-13T21:50:04] haku: the thing about scooters too its difficult to stop right away at high speeds.
[2024-02-13T21:51:49] haku: fastest ive gone in a scooter is 86kmh/54mph. i fell ike if someone brake checks me im Fd
[2024-02-13T21:53:26] Yamal: I'm not even going at that speed in the city traffic, let's say I live in a town near the city and around this city, there are many towns more connected by secondary roads, in short gay roads and moments in which You can squeeze the machine, but I'm going to tell you one thing, going up to 100 kmh doesn't even require meters! nor time!
[2024-02-13T21:54:53] haku: here you are required to go with traffic or stay in the bike lane wich is dangerous. 45mph is the normal speed limit in my area
[2024-02-13T22:01:05] Yamal: Here you can see everything, the maximum speed they give us is not very logical, we get in the way most of the time, in the city we always drive well, respecting traffic signs, etc., outside the city without giving too much attention. note we like to squeeze the machines
[2024-02-13T22:02:32] haku: yes in country roads i would do it too. unfortunately i live in a city with alot of drunk drivers 😭
[2024-02-13T22:04:51] Yamal: You can always leave the city, I say, and look for cool, less populated areas.
[2024-02-13T22:07:06] haku: ill try that in the summer.
[2024-02-13T22:09:58] Yamal: When do you expect to finish your scooter?
[2024-02-13T22:10:17] haku: june 6
[2024-02-13T22:12:38] sombre_enfant: All that weight for 130kph...
[2024-02-13T22:12:51] Yamal: the sooner it finish, the sooner you will start putting in the miles and enjoying it
[2024-02-13T22:13:21] haku: plant your flowers now and make your wine. i am coming for some the second liberation
[2024-02-13T22:17:57] Yamal: You really have everything to ride your scooter, don't you?
[2024-02-13T22:19:10] haku: mostly yes. im still undecided on some parts. just going along day by day
[2024-02-13T22:20:07] haku: also the battery deck if i want more amps and voltage. that means i have to bolt my bigger deck
[2024-02-13T22:21:05] haku: 85200 can do 21s with regen according to some folks
[2024-02-13T22:22:46] haku: not really going for top speed. just want the power for both wheels to slip
[2024-02-13T22:26:34] Yamal: Well, bad choice with the rating of your engines.
[2024-02-13T22:29:38] haku: i can add more p if im not satisfied or get a 22x3. making my batteries right now. and rethinking everything
[2024-02-13T22:30:28] sombre_enfant: Maybe 17x4 and oil on road u will achieve it
[2024-02-13T22:32:03] haku: dude that guy with the zero 11 did it same battery and motor setup. he just has g300 vesc
[2024-02-13T22:32:40] haku: even same tires
[2024-02-13T22:33:21] Yamal: 22/3 good 17/4 - the top speed 👎
[2024-02-13T22:33:48] haku: let me find his post
[2024-02-13T22:34:03] Yamal: But 33/2 is nice to if have big battery and big controller
[2024-02-13T22:35:57] Yamal: <photos/photo_12882@13-02-2024_22-35-57.jpg>
[2024-02-13T22:38:05] haku: what tronic is that?
[2024-02-13T22:39:13] Yamal: I would assemble what you have, and then you can try the speed motors, which are amazing.
[2024-02-13T22:39:19] Yamal: Tronic 750
[2024-02-13T22:39:31] haku: nice!
[2024-02-13T22:41:23] haku: all these motors have holes. is thatthe trend in the eu
[2024-02-13T22:42:26] Yamal: Well, I would say that this trend was born with Rion
[2024-02-13T22:44:05] haku: even copper welded batteries rion did it first i think.
[2024-02-13T22:44:28] haku: too bad rion bad from what im reading
[2024-02-13T22:45:32] Yamal: kelly on a scooter, the type of closure of the mast that we see so much now, vesc on an escooter, many things
[2024-02-13T22:46:23] haku: i think rion was first to implimemt vesc too right?
[2024-02-13T22:48:24] Yamal: Let's see, there are many people who don't like it and criticize it, for me it is very respectable, everyone has their own free expression, experience and knowledge, I know that at the European level there were also problems with the logistical or production issue, in the sense They started asking to order, Rion and then many never arrived or are about to arrive,,, expensive vehicles and waiting time,, now with the Apex maybe all this will be made up for a little,
[2024-02-13T22:49:29] Yamal: Now the company has passed into the hands of Leo Pev and Gal Thompson remains more involved in Tronic system
[2024-02-13T22:51:03] haku: hopefully they can deliver. they are american yea? ive never seen one
[2024-02-13T22:51:41] Yamal: Then there is the good side: To start, Rion thinks about the aerodynamics of the vehicle* this is something very important, vehicles that we buy that come with a top speed of 80/85/100kmh and we take them at speeds above 140, at some point we could "take off" although it seems like a joke to us
[2024-02-13T22:57:45] Yamal: I'm lucky to have one close to a friend and it's just amazing! Extreme acceleration with a top speed of 130 and a weight of approximately 27 kg, it is very very fun and very physical
[2024-02-13T22:59:16] haku: maybe someday i see one and get to ride it. rion seems cool. i dont know why they getting so much heat
[2024-02-13T23:00:11] haku: also rion mostly western parts too. should get alot of praise
[2024-02-13T23:00:55] Yamal: Heat?
[2024-02-13T23:01:14] haku: bad press/ hate
[2024-02-13T23:08:21] Paolo ⁭: It was really good brand and inspiration, if wasn't they scam people
[2024-02-13T23:08:25] Yamal: I'm just saying that everyone who can try it and do a few kilometers with it, then your opinion will change. They said a long time ago that for racing it wasn't very good, there are better vehicles, I'm sure of that, but it's still a beast. of acceleration, in fact this focuses on the gross acceleration
[2024-02-13T23:08:58] Paolo ⁭: Persomally the first powerful scooter I see was rion too , and when I started the most powerful was dualtron X
[2024-02-13T23:54:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I remember rions review by some polish guy ,that time it was kinda one of the kind ,but weared similar kid shoes like others , probably heat around it, is coming from the big price while it's not that good🤷‍♂
[2024-02-13T23:57:30] haku: maybe. also US made. i hate to say it but there is alot of american made stuff haters.
[2024-02-13T23:58:38] haku: as an aliexpress connoissuer i feel that way too. very unpatriotic
[2024-02-14T00:00:37] haku: yes even for my 11 inch i couldnt get it to bead.
[2024-02-14T00:07:10] Yamal: The American brownie is the best! All countries have good things and bad things! and of course you have to keep the good ones!
[2024-02-14T00:10:21] haku: love the this country and the freedom. i wish i can afford to support its economy but china got me by the balls
[2024-02-14T00:11:25] haku: anyways sorry for bringing it up. back to rion.
[2024-02-14T00:29:55] Happy Giraffe: Right now making 100$ alie order to buy some titanium for lathing spare bike axles😅
[2024-02-14T00:49:23] Mirono escooters: Where to find brieru Esc info? @PaoloWu ?
[2024-02-14T01:42:32] cihan: The price is quite good. Are these fake? Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! 354,36TL 13%OFF | Free Shipping 5Pcs 10Pcs Japan NSK 6001ZZ 6001DDU 6001-2RS Bearing 12x28x8mm Deep Groove Ball Bearings https://a.aliexpress.com/_EHF3NTT
[2024-02-14T01:43:21] Paolo ⁭: <files/BRIESC_100 (1).pdf>
[2024-02-14T01:44:20] cihan: 2 USD for NSK 6001 ddu
[2024-02-14T01:47:54] NetworkDir: best SKF brand
[2024-02-14T01:51:36] cihan: The SKF I bought recently was made in Italy. Skf and other reputable brands manufacture in many countries. So I thought the ones made in homeland could be better quality. NSK I bought in Turkey was made in Poland. Timken made in China, Nachi made in Japan. Did you have chance to try other reputable bearing manufacturers? Is it SKF shining out among all?
[2024-02-14T01:53:06] cihan: By the way what I care most is sealing. Front wheel bearing can easily absorb rain and I ride in rain often.
[2024-02-14T01:54:27] NetworkDir: i just purchase SKF for my zero
[2024-02-14T01:54:34] NetworkDir: SKF looks best one
[2024-02-14T01:54:55] cihan: Are yours also made in Italy?
[2024-02-14T01:55:50] NetworkDir: i dont check manufacture country tomorrow i check
[2024-02-14T01:56:30] cihan: OK, thanks for information.
[2024-02-14T02:04:38] sombre_enfant: When u set abs for 2 controller at 180A phase x2 do you need abs 400A or 200A?
[2024-02-14T03:54:41] Tommy ª: <animation>
[2024-02-14T06:49:27] yoann tsobanoglou: Hello, what could cause a momentary motor cutoff without triggering vesc error?
[2024-02-14T08:22:24] yoann tsobanoglou: Would traction control trigger error?
[2024-02-14T09:46:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bearing manufacture country means not too much , In skf ,i use to see Italian and German made ,lot factories exist
[2024-02-14T09:48:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tell what and how it happened
[2024-02-14T09:50:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you are in a shitty sandy dirt road and keep playing with throttle,than such could happen, If so and you only try to get home and not play , best is to have Cruise contoll,that helps you over
[2024-02-14T09:55:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure I like good stuff , doesnt matter where its made , price matters and there can be other facts. Like one of my mates dad made American car club here ,so from young age i am use to nice muscle cars ,pretty much love i have for them and i could go own
[2024-02-14T09:58:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not fully sure what you mean here , but there is nice and not too nice patriotic behavior all around, loving your country and ringing your arms like gorilla that you are the best makes a difference 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-14T09:59:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I agree with you but not in the brownie 😁
[2024-02-14T11:54:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://youtube.com/shorts/m7GMRQl4VfY?si=5TibeLr0pa8EUcYb
[2024-02-14T11:55:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say dont try this at home
[2024-02-14T14:52:30] Mirono escooters: Jej 12kg
[2024-02-14T14:54:00] Mirono escooters: Battery cutoff?
[2024-02-14T15:17:34] Gabe Enzo: huh looks like one kg
[2024-02-14T15:29:58] yoann tsobanoglou: Log files show to vesc error
[2024-02-14T15:30:13] yoann tsobanoglou: And ant bms never triggered
[2024-02-14T15:30:40] yoann tsobanoglou: Accélération on scooter makes front wheel speen out
[2024-02-14T15:30:50] yoann tsobanoglou: And I added traction control
[2024-02-14T15:31:26] yoann tsobanoglou: I thought at first that it shut down the motor because the difference in erpm passed the limit that was set
[2024-02-14T15:31:27] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. yoann has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-14T15:44:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It looks its filament day , recieved less and petg but still
[2024-02-14T15:45:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably box under his hand has the rest
[2024-02-14T15:47:02] Mirono escooters: I got both pla and petg
[2024-02-14T15:47:07] Mirono escooters: There's a box behind :)
[2024-02-14T15:51:28] sombre_enfant: Must be that, ça dois être ça
[2024-02-14T15:52:22] yoann tsobanoglou: But I disabled traction control and it did it again
[2024-02-14T15:59:38] yoann tsobanoglou: This cut is sudden, but smoother than over voltage trigger
[2024-02-14T16:18:37] sombre_enfant: What is your setup ? Motor, battery esc ? Dual ? The amps setting
[2024-02-14T16:54:49] francois schempers: that's for me ? 😂
[2024-02-14T16:56:15] francois schempers: 3shull but you pay the price
[2024-02-14T16:56:24] Mirono escooters: Also
[2024-02-14T16:56:32] Mirono escooters: But you get petg
[2024-02-14T16:56:54] Mirono escooters: Trampa is high end/good 3shul is.. powerful.
[2024-02-14T16:57:04] Mirono escooters: That's it's main feature xD

[2024-02-14T16:57:26] francois schempers: that's all I want 😂😂
[2024-02-14T16:59:28] francois schempers: https://rage-mechanics.com/controleurs/1235-c350.html just 1000A at 30S, nothing special, 64kW controller xD
[2024-02-14T17:05:54] Mirono escooters: Ezpz
[2024-02-14T17:36:05] Yamal: More brand? - shull controller - - -?
[2024-02-14T17:37:47] francois schempers: I have only used spintend and shull, I can't backup any other brand, I'll let others complete the list
[2024-02-14T17:47:10] Yamal: Thanks ⚡️
[2024-02-14T17:53:52] Mirono escooters: Mp2 opensource Tronic Trampa 3shul Flipsky makerbase Spintend Makerx
[2024-02-14T17:56:34] sombre_enfant: Flipsky 4.1 over the top
[2024-02-14T18:06:05] Yamal: Flipsky?????
[2024-02-14T18:13:40] Mirono escooters: What's wrong?
[2024-02-14T18:51:28] Happy Giraffe: Does carbon fiber petg really conduct electricity or not?🌚
[2024-02-14T18:51:48] Happy Giraffe: Someone test with 100v dc supply pls😂
[2024-02-14T18:55:32] haku: im curious about this too
[2024-02-14T18:58:26] Mirono escooters: I can
[2024-02-14T18:58:31] Mirono escooters: Tomorrow
[2024-02-14T18:58:48] Happy Giraffe: AC too?😂
[2024-02-14T18:59:09] Happy Giraffe: I can test ac but I end up in a boom + hospital
[2024-02-14T18:59:25] Mirono escooters: If dc works, why ac?
[2024-02-14T19:01:30] Happy Giraffe: In example I have petg cf end cap/threaded nut that covers ac cable entry. If someone pulls that ac wire out when bike is connected to wall they might get a shock
[2024-02-14T19:02:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It should have some but scenario not clear
[2024-02-14T19:02:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/11/2390
[2024-02-14T19:02:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Long wall of text
[2024-02-14T19:02:47] Mirono escooters: I listed everything existing And flipsky has sum high power Thomas ran a lot of power
[2024-02-14T19:03:17] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, on those figure 8/C shape ac plugs the conductors are quite deep so that kinda helps
[2024-02-14T19:08:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://youtu.be/qAglQ8z72N4?si=fhsSyPLQEVwmLorS
[2024-02-14T19:08:40] Mirono escooters: If dc conduct, ac does too😂
[2024-02-14T19:08:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: After 15 minutes he makes the test and conducts😁
[2024-02-14T19:08:52] Mirono escooters: But I can try
[2024-02-14T19:08:55] Mirono escooters: Unprinted and printed
[2024-02-14T19:11:40] Happy Giraffe: I wonder how easily
[2024-02-14T19:12:06] Mirono escooters: ??? No difference??
[2024-02-14T19:12:43] Happy Giraffe: I mean if I grab 220v DC with hand Im mostly ok but 220V AC gonna kill me🌚
[2024-02-14T19:12:50] Mirono escooters: Actually not
[2024-02-14T19:13:03] Mirono escooters: Dc polarises your cells, way more dangerous
[2024-02-14T19:13:25] Happy Giraffe: But if you are nowhere near the other terminal?🤔
[2024-02-14T19:13:37] Mirono escooters: Ohh, like that..
[2024-02-14T19:13:45] Mirono escooters: If you got boots on , ac won't do shit either
[2024-02-14T19:14:01] Happy Giraffe: AC shocks easiest atleast as it only needs hot and then you become ground😂
[2024-02-14T19:14:05] Mirono escooters: you miss the point If CF conducts with DC Ac will too So test doesn't matter
[2024-02-14T19:14:33] Happy Giraffe: Gonna check test at home
[2024-02-14T19:14:50] Mirono escooters: Lmk
[2024-02-14T19:15:25] Happy Giraffe: Mostly interested in AC ability to jump distance with arc
[2024-02-14T19:16:23] Mirono escooters: And why can't dc do that?
[2024-02-14T19:17:44] Happy Giraffe: Im talking about this type of use, will give a good pic tomorrow of what I exactly mean
[2024-02-14T19:17:51] Mirono escooters: Ah ye
[2024-02-14T19:17:55] Mirono escooters: I'm slow
[2024-02-14T19:18:01] Mirono escooters: Why Cf end cap
[2024-02-14T19:20:07] Happy Giraffe: Was testing the material and wanted something to keep out snow and water
[2024-02-14T19:21:15] haku: what is the best way of gluing petg? its really diffucult for some glues to stick to it
[2024-02-14T19:22:44] haku: im making 2 kinds of holders. ive read people say epoxy is not good.
[2024-02-14T19:22:44] haku: <photos/photo_12885@14-02-2024_19-22-44.jpg>
[2024-02-14T19:23:04] haku: also another option is to plastic weld it with soldering iron with same petg fillament
[2024-02-14T19:24:24] Happy Giraffe: Mechanical joint or support where load goes against material and not glue
[2024-02-14T19:24:43] Happy Giraffe: My epoxies or silicones never failed on petg😳
[2024-02-14T19:25:31] Happy Giraffe: Gotta roughen the surface with something like 80 grit sandpaper and then wipe with alcohol. Then epoxy+clamps
[2024-02-14T19:26:08] Happy Giraffe: I only use epoxies that take long time to cure, I dont believe in the quick epoxies. Loctite has been a good but expensive brand

[2024-02-14T19:27:32] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_12887@14-02-2024_19-27-32.jpg>
[2024-02-14T19:27:34] haku: gotcha. ill try that. ill experiment witg different glues
[2024-02-14T19:28:08] Happy Giraffe: The threaded part glued slotted into the square hole so the square shape takes rotational force instead of glue
[2024-02-14T19:28:12] haku: batteries will be heavy though so need the plastics to fuse
[2024-02-14T19:29:54] Happy Giraffe: I would add a mechanical joint aswell. Glue might brake on impacts
[2024-02-14T19:30:47] haku: gotcha
[2024-02-14T19:34:48] Yamal: What is interesting for me is the high quality of components! and good reputation, I would love to try TRAMPA and SHULL in the future
[2024-02-14T19:37:43] Yamal: the three wise men
[2024-02-14T19:44:41] Yamal: let's say it's always in development
[2024-02-14T19:48:13] Mirono escooters: 3shul is hopefully improving
[2024-02-14T19:49:25] haku: i really want to see the new trampa. no one review it yet
[2024-02-14T19:50:42] haku: what about g300 does that make the list?
[2024-02-14T19:52:07] sombre_enfant: No
[2024-02-14T19:59:39] haku: gotcha. makes sense cause its very compact
[2024-02-14T20:02:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice words u used ,i cant even get over the idea of that🙈🤯
[2024-02-14T20:08:06] Happy Giraffe: Only two filaments conducted 1000v🤔
[2024-02-14T20:11:08] Hemi Murin: Hi, I'm going to connect two controllers but I don't have power on. what should I do?
[2024-02-14T20:12:59] sombre_enfant: Nothing
[2024-02-14T20:13:26] Hemi Murin: 5v to 5v?
[2024-02-14T20:13:48] sombre_enfant: No
[2024-02-14T20:14:04] sombre_enfant: U will do ground loop and kill everything that way
[2024-02-14T20:14:22] sombre_enfant: U dont have powerbutton then this method not for you
[2024-02-14T20:14:36] haku: so if it doesnt conduct electricity it can be used for battery holders.
[2024-02-14T20:15:18] haku: scary if it does.
[2024-02-14T20:15:42] Hemi Murin: so how can i connect two 75100?
[2024-02-14T20:19:06] sombre_enfant: Just can
[2024-02-14T20:20:09] Hemi Murin: Can L can H or all 4pin
[2024-02-14T20:20:56] sombre_enfant: U only have 2 pin if u have classic, can h l
[2024-02-14T20:21:12] Hemi Murin: Thank you ❤️
[2024-02-14T20:21:31] sombre_enfant: What is your build ?
[2024-02-14T20:23:26] Finn: 1000V is already the moment where the electrons wants to jump to a negative charged electron. Thats why there is an ark between clouds and earthground
[2024-02-14T20:23:52] Finn: For 100V systems there will happen nothing
[2024-02-14T20:23:59] Hemi Murin: G30 80A bms, two 75100. 21700x98 battery 15s 58.8V, mantis 1000w and monorim 500w
[2024-02-14T20:24:41] Finn: <photos/photo_12890@14-02-2024_20-24-41.jpg>
[2024-02-14T20:26:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure what they do or did ,but cooling mosfets over plastic 😅 sounds much more bullshit than watercooling . And fyi i have modified the end sentence 4 times to be nice 🙈
[2024-02-14T20:27:17] sombre_enfant: Ohh 15s and mantis motor😔
[2024-02-14T20:28:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That conducted in the vid on 100 v also
[2024-02-14T20:29:22] Finn: Yes but how far is the 100v potential to negative ?
[2024-02-14T20:29:22] Hemi Murin: I know. I was inspired EsnKaz before I found vesc
[2024-02-14T20:29:37] haku: i want to try carbonx abs cf
[2024-02-14T20:30:44] haku: i wonder if these filaments warp
[2024-02-14T20:32:33] haku: <photos/photo_12892@14-02-2024_20-32-33.jpg>
[2024-02-14T20:38:14] Finn: Hmm lets just wait and see how it goes😂
[2024-02-14T20:38:28] Finn: I added destilled water and a little bit of isopropanol
[2024-02-14T20:38:56] haku: what are you cleaning? flux?
[2024-02-14T20:39:26] haku: i want to learn smd soldering
[2024-02-14T20:39:39] Finn: Also flux
[2024-02-14T20:40:28] Finn: Flux is probably too aggressive
[2024-02-14T20:40:41] Happy Giraffe: Don't bother with ABS, go for Nylon
[2024-02-14T20:41:21] Happy Giraffe: Even CF PETG really tanky
[2024-02-14T20:42:06] haku: i want it to be glued easily.
[2024-02-14T20:42:31] haku: i dont have a big printer.😭
[2024-02-14T20:43:58] haku: <photos/photo_12894@14-02-2024_20-43-58.jpg>
[2024-02-14T20:44:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes ,need to print with closed machine
[2024-02-14T20:47:26] Jan: Is this the MyMaxMods guy?
[2024-02-14T20:49:14] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-02-14T20:49:31] sombre_enfant: Those guy are trippin
[2024-02-14T20:58:13] haku: what thats the same guy? good to know
[2024-02-14T21:13:38] Happy Giraffe: Then gotta change design😁
[2024-02-14T21:14:26] Happy Giraffe: Even if you make it really tight on tolerances and gently hammer mechanical links together it could be enough
[2024-02-14T21:14:41] sombre_enfant: Do lego design
[2024-02-14T21:15:15] sombre_enfant: No 2 ppl one sells crap one advise it
[2024-02-14T21:16:19] Finn: Lmaoo
[2024-02-14T21:16:22] Finn: <video_file>
[2024-02-14T21:16:30] Finn: @Bradhaku amazon sells crap😂😂
[2024-02-14T21:22:19] sombre_enfant: ?
[2024-02-14T21:22:34] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-02-14T21:22:43] Finn: Its an ultrasonic cleaner. The module has to be in contact with the metal case
[2024-02-14T21:31:51] Rose: Hey there חגי, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-14T21:37:41] Happy Giraffe: Amazon became aliexpress couple of years ago
[2024-02-14T21:56:11] Mirono escooters: I run full ipa
[2024-02-14T21:56:15] Mirono escooters: As long as doesn't go hot
[2024-02-14T21:56:29] Mirono escooters: Gst3D CF 🥰
[2024-02-14T21:57:51] Happy Giraffe: Found the source of Monorim motors
[2024-02-14T22:03:20] Finn: Yeah i return mine
[2024-02-14T22:05:24] Mirono escooters: Y
[2024-02-14T22:49:21] cihan: I've bought some bearings recently. SKF 6001 2RSH is made in Italy . SKF 6203 2Z is made in France. Timken 6001 2RS is made in China. FAG 6001 C 2HRS is made in China. NSK 6001 DDU is made in Poland. Nachi 6001 2RS and 6003 2RS are both made in Japan. They are all genuine bearings. Only Nachi still manufactures almost all its bearings in Japan. It'll take very long time but I'll also share their water resistance in future since I ride in rain often.
[2024-02-14T23:29:23] haku: thats lonnyo or surron motors
[2024-02-14T23:58:22] haku: in the name of science we testing some glues on petg boys.
[2024-02-15T00:04:07] haku: anyone tried graphics card from ali? i want to build an ali pc. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $24.31 68%OFF | SJS Video Card GeForce GT610 Display Vga Cards 2GB DDR3 64Bit Graphics Cards For NVIDIA Game PC GT 610 2GD3 HDMI DVI VGA PCI-E2 https://a.aliexpress.com/_mrEl5sE
[2024-02-15T00:42:06] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't And that's a bad old one :)
[2024-02-15T00:43:17] haku: i want to make one that can only run minecraft for my boy
[2024-02-15T00:43:39] haku: he uses my pc all the time now
[2024-02-15T00:45:10] haku: i want him to learn how to use a mouse not a controller
[2024-02-15T00:46:06] Mirono escooters: Get a old pc from marketplace tbh
[2024-02-15T00:46:10] Mirono escooters: Will outbeat any Ali pc
[2024-02-15T01:02:10] cihan: Indeed, an old pc is much easier and cheaper choice.
[2024-02-15T01:36:32] haku: does minecraft require a graphics card to run. im a pc noob. i have a dell laptop without a graphics card. i dont know if it can run minecraft
[2024-02-15T01:37:21] haku: its a 2019 dell xps
[2024-02-15T02:46:30] rosheee: yes
[2024-02-15T02:46:43] rosheee: how ur screen works then?
[2024-02-15T02:47:02] rosheee: <animation>
[2024-02-15T02:48:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-15T02:50:21] haku: your right lol
[2024-02-15T02:51:06] haku: i thought gpu is optional
[2024-02-15T03:56:09] Chris Culver: How come one side of my Ubox lights up green with an orange light... Is this normal?
[2024-02-15T04:13:11] Chris Culver: And also windows VESC tool does not detect the Ubox. Mobile iOS app does. USB no work... What the heck is going on?
[2024-02-15T04:20:22] haku: do you guys have have this in EU. way better build quality and cheaper than g2
[2024-02-15T04:20:23] haku: <photos/photo_12897@15-02-2024_04-20-23.jpg>
[2024-02-15T04:23:07] haku: g2 is $1k
[2024-02-15T06:44:24] Awyba: Does 3shul have any major problems?
[2024-02-15T09:16:27] Oreo huzky: Yes but build quality of this scoot is horrible first they have strange tire size second thing is I had a costumer repair it by himself and he forgot to put rear dropout washer that is supposed to hold the motor so it dosent spin in the dropout he put only one in and the motor completely destroyed itself and if the dropout washer has just a tiny dent it needs to be replaced and also there are about 10k screws if you want to get to the battery bay
[2024-02-15T09:21:26] Awyba: yea but i mean he forgot the washer so technically still his fault. A friend of mine has one of these and it works fine, except the throttle response is very delayed in my opinion
[2024-02-15T09:54:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: My mate also has one
[2024-02-15T10:04:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Which esc ,shows pics when leds are on ,on some they are listed ( on older atleast)
[2024-02-15T10:06:53] Oreo huzky: Yes but he only forgot one washer the other one should be enough because it’s not like this scoot has 5kw
[2024-02-15T10:08:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you connect pc doesnt show up connection is possible when program loaded? Is that cable working for sure? Once i had cable issue, with a longer cable ,in that case you saw could connect than freezed when saving , and cable was good for charging
[2024-02-15T10:11:14] Chris Culver: Cable worked previously
[2024-02-15T10:11:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not big fan of niu , earlier repaired e moped engine's, we have niu scooters here also ,would not say to buy it , Anything fails no parts And about quality I would not say too much since i ride non ,but i am unsure its compareable since zero suspension
[2024-02-15T10:13:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: With this setup reading vesc?
[2024-02-15T10:14:21] Chris Culver: Yes same computer and everything
[2024-02-15T10:15:00] Chris Culver: Now I get Usb descriptor failed

[2024-02-15T10:51:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: HMmm
[2024-02-15T11:27:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Are you sleep wrighting?😁
[2024-02-15T11:27:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Usually you are a sleep in these hours
[2024-02-15T11:40:52] Martin Kaktits: I do not believe. This is a bot pretending to be James.
[2024-02-15T11:41:42] Finn: Anyone know what the length of the g30L is? 13s should easily fit
[2024-02-15T11:45:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I was guessing after my 1am messages answered in the morning 😁 I planned to sleep but didn't happen and at 9 i had a customer here😅 (Not honest smile on da face)
[2024-02-15T11:46:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2024-02-15T11:48:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe @XAP2P can tell ,he recently talking about building an awd like that ,maybe has the frame already
[2024-02-15T11:49:21] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: No power supply... - about 5cm
[2024-02-15T11:49:55] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: g30L have same length as pro 🙂

[2024-02-15T13:02:41] Gabe Enzo: I'm thinking of scamming kugoo and saying the motor broke or the battery tbh it's a nice 16s 1.2kwh
[2024-02-15T13:02:45] Gabe Enzo: it's such a nice 2kw motor
[2024-02-15T13:02:57] Gabe Enzo: I'll say itz locked up
[2024-02-15T13:03:05] Gabe Enzo: they might send a new one @XAP2P
[2024-02-15T13:04:39] Mirono escooters: Goh, weak dcdc (fixed?) Noisy outputs Unrepairable (the highest version)
[2024-02-15T13:09:32] Mirono escooters: CPU is a shitty gpu in theory
[2024-02-15T13:17:59] Yamal: hello good morning, I wanted to ask a question about the general battery and phase discharge configuration, Let's say we want to take long routes, with speeds of (40/55kmh). without giving acceleration etc, Would we really see an increase in autonomy by lowering the download parameters in Vesc tool? If we said we were going to do the same type of route at the same speed without strong accelerations, with the configuration at maximum" and with the configuration "capped" I don't know if I can explain myself, thank you .
[2024-02-15T13:20:10] Finn: Gpu has more cores Cpu has higher clockrates
[2024-02-15T13:32:08] Mirono escooters: Both do beep boop
[2024-02-15T13:37:29] haku: thats what i thought. you can run a pc without gpu
[2024-02-15T13:38:54] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-02-15T13:39:11] Mirono escooters: You get some display Don't expect more then paint tho
[2024-02-15T13:40:02] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-02-15T13:41:47] haku: can you still stream games though?
[2024-02-15T13:44:23] haku: i see. thanks
[2024-02-15T13:44:25] Mirono escooters: Most that I've seen
[2024-02-15T13:44:38] Mirono escooters: Goh, prolly
[2024-02-15T13:45:49] haku: i guess ill have to try. just remive mine and see if ryzen 9 can run it
[2024-02-15T13:49:59] haku: gotcha. ill check it out.
[2024-02-15T13:54:36] Mirono escooters: Ye more Intel stuff
[2024-02-15T14:20:33] Hemi Murin: How i can connect G30 dash into 75100? Is it enough to connect only 4 wires into esc? Or I need to connect ConnRL and ConADC? If yes, where it is in controller?
[2024-02-15T14:20:44] Hemi Murin: <photos/photo_12905@15-02-2024_14-20-44.jpg>

[2024-02-15T14:34:05] Mirono escooters: I've got 3 xD
[2024-02-15T14:34:09] Mirono escooters: Idk for what
[2024-02-15T14:34:26] Mirono escooters: What the arduino nano do
[2024-02-15T14:34:28] Konstantin: Dou have 5.2 fw?
[2024-02-15T14:34:39] Mirono escooters: Ionno
[2024-02-15T14:35:23] Konstantin: It's curious, coz on 6.2 current scale on all 3 mode 60% fix...looks like bugs, not feature xD
[2024-02-15T14:35:41] Mirono escooters: I never used except on desk
[2024-02-15T14:35:45] Mirono escooters: Long time ago
[2024-02-15T14:35:51] Mirono escooters: Sale on Banggood Still v1
[2024-02-15T14:36:19] Mirono escooters: I wanted on My skateboard.. Only 1 uart on 4.12 vesc xD So rip
[2024-02-15T14:36:35] Mirono escooters: Prefer Bluetooth
[2024-02-15T14:38:36] Tommy ª: Actually you can still use nrf51 on newer firm?
[2024-02-15T14:40:22] Mirono escooters: Ofc?
[2024-02-15T14:50:24] puneDir: Whats the ınternal resistance of m26
[2024-02-15T15:12:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: playing mario
[2024-02-15T15:23:43] Konstantin: It's big lag on battery voltage reading, but ESC temp looks like read fine + u can connect throttle
[2024-02-15T15:24:59] Konstantin: I tell them to edit 1 code line...
[2024-02-15T15:35:22] Mirono escooters: Can we flash ourselves?
[2024-02-15T15:35:42] Mirono escooters: I like splitting ADC function Just sad I got 1 uart hahaha
[2024-02-15T15:39:15] Konstantin: Only bad fw... Need wayt, when they fix packet l
[2024-02-15T15:41:56] sombre_enfant: Not needed
[2024-02-15T15:43:06] Mirono escooters: Wonder if my v1 is any good
[2024-02-15T15:43:15] Mirono escooters: If V2 got issue haha
[2024-02-15T15:44:42] Mirono escooters: Datasheet
[2024-02-15T15:48:38] Hemi Murin: and resistor + capacitor is necessary to connect?
[2024-02-15T15:54:32] Mirono escooters: Resistor yes Capacitor debatable Doesn't hurt, but not needed
[2024-02-15T15:56:04] Hemi Murin: so resistor to pin 3 (Dash)?
[2024-02-15T15:57:03] Mirono escooters: Check the rollersplaush for a good view
[2024-02-15T15:57:12] Mirono escooters: That schematic bit chaotic

[2024-02-15T16:21:09] Izuna 生活: ESCs vaporized during ride
[2024-02-15T16:21:18] Izuna 生活: Not sure if both died but probably
[2024-02-15T16:21:23] Izuna 生活: fuck me
[2024-02-15T16:22:31] Izuna 生活: I should have epoxied this shit at the first day
[2024-02-15T16:23:46] Mirono escooters: Prolly
[2024-02-15T16:25:20] Izuna 生活: Yesterday it got wet because of the that much rain, but it was ok and I opened it up and fixed it. But because I opened it up all my sealing was gone now and now it rained AGAIN and this time a lot of water got in (probably).
[2024-02-15T16:25:25] Izuna 生活: I had no time to seal it again
[2024-02-15T16:25:29] Izuna 生活: was already late for school
[2024-02-15T16:25:36] Mirono escooters: Id hate opening it that many times
[2024-02-15T16:25:43] Mirono escooters: You need a backup scoot
[2024-02-15T16:25:43] Izuna 生活: I usually don't open it
[2024-02-15T16:25:48] Izuna 生活: I let it sit and dry
[2024-02-15T16:25:49] Izuna 生活: it's ok
[2024-02-15T16:25:51] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2024-02-15T16:25:59] puneDir: epoxy it
[2024-02-15T16:26:19] Mirono escooters: Letting it dry is like my last resort 😦
[2024-02-15T16:26:22] Izuna 生活: But this time it wasn't drying quickly enough so I had to open it and pour Isopropanol
[2024-02-15T16:26:31] Izuna 生活: but well that was my mistake
[2024-02-15T16:26:35] Izuna 生活: I should have used my legs today
[2024-02-15T16:26:41] Mirono escooters: Bro you need a backup scoot to abuse 😂😂
[2024-02-15T16:26:48] Izuna 生活: yes I know
[2024-02-15T16:26:50] puneDir: Why you dont epoxy it
[2024-02-15T16:26:50] Izuna 生活: 😭
[2024-02-15T16:26:52] Mirono escooters: Where pro2
[2024-02-15T16:27:01] Izuna 生活: pro2 started but I don't have time
[2024-02-15T16:27:04] Izuna 生活: I don't have time for shit
[2024-02-15T16:27:06] Izuna 生活: I'm too busy
[2024-02-15T16:27:08] Mirono escooters: Relatable

[2024-02-15T16:27:59] Izuna 生活: I'm hungry and tired from school
[2024-02-15T16:28:01] sombre_enfant: Better miss 1h of school than loss 200€, even job i dont know any who pay that much...
[2024-02-15T16:28:23] Izuna 生活: Yeah I should have done that... I was already late for 30min already

[2024-02-16T14:34:38] Tommy ª: actually you can find them as 4.10/3.50-4 on aliexpress but the quiality is a sh*t, they always get deformed

[2024-02-16T15:33:10] Happy Giraffe: Why do people crimp connectors for QS138 motors etc? Is soldering those that hard even when you heat them up with a lighter/flame?🤔
[2024-02-16T15:34:07] Happy Giraffe: I thought about pretinning cable with iron and connector with flame and then joining together with a flame🤔
[2024-02-16T15:34:29] Happy Giraffe: Even 100w iron should do that
[2024-02-16T16:19:57] Finn: The small one wass broken so i orderd a bigger one with heating function

[2024-02-16T16:31:35] Jacob: What do i do from here?
[2024-02-16T16:31:39] Jacob: <photos/photo_12928@16-02-2024_16-31-39.jpg>
[2024-02-16T16:38:34] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-02-16T16:38:43] Mirono escooters: And then or large outrunner or DD bike hub
[2024-02-16T16:47:01] sombre_enfant: Because crimp are better and most powerfull esc allow you to screw the phase
[2024-02-16T16:50:55] Mirono escooters: Crimp is just best, soldering only good to some point I don't see why so many insist on soldering it Some even solder crimp, wich is downright stupid (Oh and insist it's better.)
[2024-02-16T17:07:50] sombre_enfant: Solder is just to hold pressure contact in connector its not for conductivity
[2024-02-16T17:12:12] Mirono escooters: No, you should never solder it when crimped
[2024-02-16T17:12:17] Mirono escooters: And I mean not crimp, only solder Some do dat
[2024-02-16T17:14:11] Jacob: I choose the large outrunner for the 500w motor
[2024-02-16T17:14:14] Jacob: What here?
[2024-02-16T17:17:02] Jacob: <photos/photo_12929@16-02-2024_17-17-02.jpg>
[2024-02-16T17:17:02] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jacob has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-16T18:02:34] sombre_enfant: If u dont understand this panel u shouldnt use vesc at all.
[2024-02-16T18:05:46] cihan: Do you know if the new max g2 also have such sealing for bearing? It's something really simple but a deal-breaker. I don't want to have issues with front bearing with each rain. What about higher end models from Vsett and Dualtron? Do they also utilize a bearing seal?
[2024-02-16T18:07:06] sombre_enfant: Fym bearing seal on frame ? Its not a motor none have that
[2024-02-16T18:07:39] cihan: By the way how many 18650 can I fit inside g30?
[2024-02-16T18:08:29] cihan: No, not on frame. You just place the bearing inside housing and housing still has some room for the bearing seals. I'll show with a yourube video of a motorbike bearing change.
[2024-02-16T18:09:09] sombre_enfant: 130
[2024-02-16T18:10:33] cihan: You can watch this part after he places the new bearings. https://youtu.be/GMxfJ2IYUgc?t=9m7s
[2024-02-16T18:10:56] cihan: All inside the deck? 🤔 That's a lot of cells.)
[2024-02-16T18:11:43] sombre_enfant: If its motor yes nearly all of them has it.
[2024-02-16T18:12:13] Jacob: Well i dont know about the advanced box, the rest i know. And i agree with you to a degree, but i woulndt suppose there's anything wrong in trying to learn it
[2024-02-16T18:13:02] sombre_enfant: Just dont use it its only if u on a powersupply or weak bms
[2024-02-16T18:13:49] cihan: I had no problems with motor bearing since it has seals and motor is at rear wheel so it's not really effected by falling rain. But there's no motor on front and bearing can get water inside easily. I'll check it again after I change factory bearings with better ones. I wish SKF 2rsh will solve the problem. So seems like dual motor has one more advantage over single motor.
[2024-02-16T18:14:20] Jacob: Thank you! :)
[2024-02-16T18:18:28] Mirono escooters: Man is learning
[2024-02-16T18:19:49] Mirono escooters: G2 also iirc Only on motor
[2024-02-16T18:19:57] Mirono escooters: The front bearings go bad quickly 😢
[2024-02-16T18:29:30] cihan: That's sad, G30 seems to be a really solid scooter then.
[2024-02-16T18:29:45] Mirono escooters: No, g30 also has front bearing issues
[2024-02-16T18:29:50] Mirono escooters: Only motor has this extra sealer
[2024-02-16T18:29:58] cihan: Even no luck with SKF RS2H for front bearing?
[2024-02-16T18:30:05] cihan: Ahh OK.
[2024-02-16T18:30:27] cihan: Somehow I need to protect front bearing, otherwise I won't be able to ride in the rain.
[2024-02-16T18:33:24] Mirono escooters: Upgraded is ok
[2024-02-16T18:33:33] Mirono escooters: Stock not
[2024-02-16T19:17:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Let's play
[2024-02-16T19:42:05] haku: wait for me june 6.
[2024-02-16T19:57:14] Jason Nelson: He's gonna have a hell of a time sorting his control wires
[2024-02-16T20:27:51] haku: i did not know that there is a motor that uses 17x4 winding.
[2024-02-16T20:28:15] haku: that will make the wheels slip for sure
[2024-02-16T20:30:18] haku: i thought only 2 options 22x3 33x2
[2024-02-16T20:36:59] Happy Giraffe: I guess you need really good and massive crimp pliers to apply any pressure
[2024-02-16T20:40:14] Mirono escooters: Uh, hydraulic?
[2024-02-16T20:40:59] Mirono escooters: Or like 3m long pliers No seriously, vise or hydraulic I got one here, few tonne 😅 Don't put your fingers where you wouldn't put your D***
[2024-02-16T20:45:18] haku: ive seen those hydraulic crimps. very handy for big cables. i doubt its better than solder though.
[2024-02-16T20:47:29] Mirono escooters: Why do you doubt that??
[2024-02-16T20:47:45] haku: crimped connectors just seem shady
[2024-02-16T20:47:52] Mirono escooters: Direct copper to copper is best Solder has a way, way lower conductivity then copper It shouldn't be used for conducting, it is there to hold stuff together
[2024-02-16T20:48:02] Mirono escooters: Then you must explain to me why all high power wiring is crimped :)
[2024-02-16T20:48:12] Mirono escooters: Crimped wiring is always better. If done properly
[2024-02-16T20:49:03] haku: yea that makes sense. but for small connectors like small phase cables solder is still best yea?
[2024-02-16T20:49:40] Mirono escooters: Still not
[2024-02-16T20:49:50] Mirono escooters: Solder is never "better" Its the easier way
[2024-02-16T20:50:02] Mirono escooters: And for tiny connectors, it barely matters
[2024-02-16T20:50:07] haku: i see.
[2024-02-16T20:50:18] Mirono escooters: Theoretically, you should crimp bullets too😅
[2024-02-16T20:50:28] haku: how?
[2024-02-16T20:50:38] Mirono escooters: When you solder 2 wires together, the strands should all touch The solder is there to hold it together Not to conduct (Well it helps)
[2024-02-16T20:50:46] Mirono escooters: It's not possible But it should be
[2024-02-16T20:51:00] Mirono escooters: It's the reason all high power vesc is ring terminals and crimped
[2024-02-16T20:51:12] Mirono escooters: Above 150A I do not see the point Even my 20a solar is crimped 😅
[2024-02-16T20:51:53] haku: its because they are designed for surrons and ebikes wich use crimped connectors right?
[2024-02-16T20:52:03] Mirono escooters: Yes, all have
[2024-02-16T20:52:10] Mirono escooters: It's the sensible way :0
[2024-02-16T20:52:13] haku: there are no big bullets
[2024-02-16T20:52:29] Mirono escooters: For reasons
[2024-02-16T20:52:39] Mirono escooters: The surface area of contact with circle terminals is way bigger
[2024-02-16T20:52:55] Mirono escooters: Bullet only has some points of contact due to the springness needed Ring terminals have 100% contact
[2024-02-16T20:52:55] haku: technically qs8 are big bullets
[2024-02-16T20:53:09] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-02-16T20:53:11] haku: i see
[2024-02-16T20:53:21] Mirono escooters: If you don't have 4mm and u need Desolder from xt60 Been there done that
[2024-02-16T20:54:55] haku: yes ive seen high powered ebikes skip the qs8 and directly crimp and screw to esc. makes sense
[2024-02-16T20:55:37] Happy Giraffe: 60ton hydraulic press👍
[2024-02-16T20:56:35] Mirono escooters: We at school have, something big
[2024-02-16T20:56:53] Happy Giraffe: Thats why need to use maximum size cables to get most contact, or bend the strands in a grapple hook fashion so you get double thickness😁
[2024-02-16T20:57:01] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_12930@16-02-2024_20-57-01.jpg>
[2024-02-16T20:57:03] Mirono escooters: 20 ton
[2024-02-16T20:57:20] Happy Giraffe: We might have 60/100 ton
[2024-02-16T20:57:21] Finn: Gonna put my head under it
[2024-02-16T20:57:27] Mirono escooters: That's like, a extra thing
[2024-02-16T20:57:40] Mirono escooters: You wouldn't solder high power connectors, ever
[2024-02-16T20:57:56] Mirono escooters: Has anyone here ever tried to pull a crimped connector off??
[2024-02-16T20:58:02] Happy Giraffe: Gotta solder with lead then🤔
[2024-02-16T20:58:04] Finn: What kind
[2024-02-16T20:58:09] Mirono escooters: I can hang my weight on a 12awg+ crimped wire
[2024-02-16T20:58:18] Finn: Or do both
[2024-02-16T20:58:28] haku: yes.
[2024-02-16T20:58:29] Mirono escooters: I was skeptical first too But do pulltests, it's crazy
[2024-02-16T20:58:34] Finn: Crimp the cable and put solder on it
[2024-02-16T20:58:37] Mirono escooters: Good crimped ones ofcourse
[2024-02-16T20:58:55] Mirono escooters: Silver 😎
[2024-02-16T20:59:04] Mirono escooters: If we compare conductivity, silver is the example xD
[2024-02-16T21:00:10] Mirono escooters: Crimping works
[2024-02-16T21:01:25] haku: maybe with super press yea. but hand crimped idk
[2024-02-16T21:01:48] Mirono escooters: Hydraulic is hand crimped, theoretically
[2024-02-16T21:02:05] Mirono escooters: No one is hand crimping profesionally Or well, shouldn't have a license
[2024-02-16T21:02:18] Mirono escooters: Crimping doesn't work if done bad But cold solder joints neither..
[2024-02-16T21:11:46] sombre_enfant: 60x1 if u on a crazy timing
[2024-02-16T21:12:35] Mirono escooters: Prolly make 2Nm
[2024-02-16T21:19:54] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12931@16-02-2024_21-19-54.jpg>
[2024-02-16T21:25:07] Ion: Efficiency like Tesla 😁
[2024-02-16T21:48:04] Jan: You put so much pressure on it that the copper flows
[2024-02-16T21:48:23] Jan: We have a hydraulic crimp tool to make batteries
[2024-02-16T21:48:51] Jan: <photos/photo_12932@16-02-2024_21-48-51.jpg>
[2024-02-16T21:50:07] Mirono escooters: Jan confirmed 😎
[2024-02-16T21:50:29] Mirono escooters: This is the way I do it for high power too Too simple and good
[2024-02-16T21:54:59] haku: do you tin the wires with solder or just crimp?
[2024-02-16T21:55:09] Jan: Solder
[2024-02-16T21:55:38] haku: thats a strong connection then.
[2024-02-16T21:56:36] Mirono escooters: Why tin beforehand?
[2024-02-16T21:56:47] haku: thats the bms cables yea?
[2024-02-16T21:57:01] Mirono escooters: Any high power wires
[2024-02-16T21:57:14] Face de Pin Sucé: 10V sag for less than 250A...
[2024-02-16T21:58:09] haku: how much do these portable hydraulic crimpers cost?
[2024-02-16T21:58:36] haku: what is the tool called exactly?
[2024-02-16T21:59:07] haku: ive seen one they look like bolt cutters. is that thr same one?
[2024-02-16T22:00:32] Mirono escooters: A hydraulic crimper? 😅😅
[2024-02-16T22:00:42] Mirono escooters: You got a decent one for 60 bucks Well, 2y ago Idk now
[2024-02-16T22:00:46] Mirono escooters: With a bazillion bits
[2024-02-16T22:26:42] haku: i crimped jst before. its a pain but doable. some folks just solder the connection
[2024-02-16T22:27:13] haku: i know theres an automatic jst crimper but pricy
[2024-02-16T22:27:41] Mirono escooters: Crimping jst suck 😅
[2024-02-16T22:27:43] Mirono escooters: I solder em
[2024-02-16T22:28:01] Mirono escooters: My Powerwall I didn't even crimp hydraulic I realise now .... But it's at the limit of the big included clamp
[2024-02-16T22:28:04] Mirono escooters: 10awg max
[2024-02-16T22:29:41] haku: crimping custom jst just gives it a cleaner look. if your in to that organizing stuff.
[2024-02-16T22:36:08] Mirono escooters: Bweh
[2024-02-16T22:49:04] Yamal: ?
[2024-02-16T22:49:42] sombre_enfant: He means the battery is bad, did u used copper ?
[2024-02-16T22:51:07] Yamal: Not the battery is new 20s 10 p batteries from nkon 40t made with copper and nikel
[2024-02-16T22:58:59] Yamal: After dinner I want to do a speed test to see how it goes! but it usually has a drop of about 10v with peaks of 280 A
[2024-02-16T22:59:47] Yamal: <photos/photo_12933@16-02-2024_22-59-47.jpg>
[2024-02-16T23:52:10] Chris Culver: Ubox v2, why are both sides not talking to each other? I can connect to each one seperately
[2024-02-16T23:54:24] Chris Culver: Ubox v2, why are both sides not talking to each other? I can connect to each one seperately. Blah, it was just working fine last night
[2024-02-17T00:15:16] Yamal: Fly to bye‼️😁
[2024-02-17T00:59:28] Chris Culver: First ride and something is smoking... Not good
[2024-02-17T01:10:36] Chris Culver: Yes
[2024-02-17T01:11:03] Chris Culver: Not sure where, everything was kinda packed in there
[2024-02-17T01:11:33] Chris Culver: Revved it to full?
[2024-02-17T01:12:12] Finn: Damn
[2024-02-17T01:12:54] Chris Culver: I'm running 10awg wire
[2024-02-17T01:13:12] Chris Culver: Two xt90 into one qs8
[2024-02-17T01:13:47] Chris Culver: I shut it off immediately
[2024-02-17T01:13:56] Chris Culver: So I don't know if I'll be able to find
[2024-02-17T01:14:24] Chris Culver: Ubox seems to be fine...
[2024-02-17T01:14:36] Chris Culver: I'll check it out, brb
[2024-02-17T01:18:19] Chris Culver: Is it possible my hall sensor wires could have gotten hot enough to be the culprit?
[2024-02-17T01:18:31] Chris Culver: That's kinda what it looks like tbh
[2024-02-17T01:18:59] Tommy ª: how you get a wire hot with a 0.5ma signal?
[2024-02-17T01:19:23] Chris Culver: Hmmm ...
[2024-02-17T01:20:12] Chris Culver: Found it
[2024-02-17T01:20:23] Chris Culver: Front phase wire
[2024-02-17T01:20:34] Tommy ª: how many amps?
[2024-02-17T01:20:51] Chris Culver: I dunno, whatever it detected at
[2024-02-17T01:21:02] Chris Culver: K hold pls
[2024-02-17T01:26:36] Yamal: https://flashmotors.com/controllers-for-electric-scooters/
[2024-02-17T01:26:37] Yamal: Is this vesc controller ?
[2024-02-17T01:27:55] Chris Culver: <photos/photo_12934@17-02-2024_01-27-55.jpg>
[2024-02-17T01:28:06] Chris Culver: Yes
[2024-02-17T01:30:18] Chris Culver: Crazy huh
[2024-02-17T01:32:40] Chris Culver: It's connected using same size bullet connectors it comes with
[2024-02-17T01:32:42] Chris Culver: But yeah
[2024-02-17T01:33:06] Chris Culver: I mean, I thought so
[2024-02-17T01:33:16] Yamal: What escooter do you ride James?
[2024-02-17T01:33:53] Chris Culver: Should I redo my joints?
[2024-02-17T01:34:29] Yamal: Frame ?
[2024-02-17T01:34:54] Chris Culver: Wouldn't the resistance show up in detection?
[2024-02-17T01:35:23] Yamal: Other cuestion I have , you thing my battery drop 10v is a lot ? No good ?
[2024-02-17T01:36:06] Yamal: Yes

[2024-02-17T01:39:23] Yamal: In “general discussion “ I send the video from before , speed test”””
[2024-02-17T01:40:02] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2024-02-17T01:41:01] Yamal: Qs8 you mean ?
[2024-02-17T01:42:00] Chris Culver: Ok here's my solder. I know it's shitty but is it bad enough to be dangerous?
[2024-02-17T01:42:10] Chris Culver: <video_file>
[2024-02-17T01:42:22] Yamal: No very long just short positive and negative
[2024-02-17T01:42:46] Yamal: <photos/photo_12938@17-02-2024_01-42-46.jpg>
[2024-02-17T01:43:07] NetworkDir: For 100A in battery pack how much nikel strip layer needed(0.25mm one)
[2024-02-17T01:43:25] NetworkDir: I think 2-3 layers enough
[2024-02-17T01:43:51] Chris Culver: Ok. Question: if the connection at the wheel were the reason, then the damage would be closer to the wheel, yes?
[2024-02-17T01:44:16] Yamal: In fact, the black negative cables were a little too short and we lengthened them a little with bullet connectors.
[2024-02-17T01:44:18] Chris Culver: What does flux actually do?
[2024-02-17T01:45:28] Chris Culver: Yes
[2024-02-17T01:45:36] Yamal: The battery is really amazing, it doesn't heat up even in the slightest, but you know, I'm still a novice at this...
[2024-02-17T01:53:36] Yamal: It would be nice if people posted videos when they are pushing their scooters to see how those batteries and controllers work.
[2024-02-17T01:55:40] Yamal: Likewise, thank you! Let's see if good weather arrives in the northern lands! and you can enjoy the scooters
[2024-02-17T02:34:51] haku: smart
[2024-02-17T02:36:48] haku: do you have a photo of the other side when finished? the - and + did you use copper or nickle?
[2024-02-17T02:48:04] haku: https://youtu.be/Ev--nGvo7as?si=xkpbL0XeYsaNMTLz
[2024-02-17T02:52:16] haku: love these crazy projects.
[2024-02-17T03:09:42] Chris Culver: Any vids or anything showing correct technique?
[2024-02-17T03:52:40] Happy Giraffe: Make sure your solder wire has flux/resin core and that your soldering iron is atleast 40w in power. Use iron at highest power setting and temperature. Eapecially on fully metal connectors theres no plastic to melt👍 1. Clean soldering iron tip 2. Tap solder wire to tip to make it transfer heat better 3. Heat up wire from the end with iron and it will start to pull solder in when properly heated. You might have to heat the sides individually in order to completely fill wire from inside with solder. 4. Heat connector and wait patiently for it to absorb solder and melt it evenly. You always want even/smooth/settled surface. A blob thats not smooth is a sign of cold joint. 5. Lastly put both pretinned components close and using soldering iron in between the solder will melt and create a good bond. You might have to add a littlebit of solder there to keep its flux inpit and heat transfer optimal.
[2024-02-17T04:56:48] Yamal: Don’t have , this is the only photos I have …
[2024-02-17T04:57:04] haku: awsome batteries!
[2024-02-17T04:57:50] haku: im just wondering how the + - sides look.
[2024-02-17T04:59:15] Yamal: Hey why you say finish on 6 june ? 😁 Waiting for something?
[2024-02-17T05:01:42] haku: yes. liberation of france.
[2024-02-17T08:35:00] Izuna 生活: No
[2024-02-17T08:35:08] Izuna 生活: Battery is ok
[2024-02-17T08:39:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Check this ,connect one side check if you see can and what's the number ,than try the otherside I am guessing that both has same name and that make bugs
[2024-02-17T08:39:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Once i had this
[2024-02-17T08:42:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would also add he might need some holder as a helping hand in some of these situations and also that soldering and there ways how to also comes with practice
[2024-02-17T08:49:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This app is Iphone? I am not familar with it but kinda looks strange , Also i would ask Maybe its just "lag" Maybe i am wrong Is odometer counting right ,kinda counts slow for the speed 🤔 And i would also add that you can turn off motor temp sensor ,so it wont show you this negative number
[2024-02-17T08:52:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure ,i saw shitty welds on some ,not on his ,but to be honest and this is not against any owners ,just me looking on it as a metal worker basically
[2024-02-17T08:53:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12939@17-02-2024_08-53-01.jpg>
[2024-02-17T08:53:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That should be made from biggest pieces possible
[2024-02-17T08:53:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12940@17-02-2024_08-53-53.jpg>
[2024-02-17T09:00:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: never run off with a small edge like that, what is even not following the body line and the fact that they welded it on like that makes me feel ,non cares and there was nobody who checks quality of the frame like this , And if you happen to do such end for some reason since it's not structre force point welds Should be fully unseen In short....
[2024-02-17T09:05:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Things like this make me sad and angry same time , something what has a price like that, should be much better in these things
[2024-02-17T09:10:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: fun overbuild of this old frame👌 i have two frames still in this size , one has different front sus and the mini version of it also, what's just 8" tires ,but thats in never used shape
[2024-02-17T09:13:44] Yamal: Hello, I don’t know if android can use..
[2024-02-17T09:16:43] haku: is that how nami welds thier scooters? or was that owner modification?
[2024-02-17T09:17:11] Yamal: The app works very well, it is true that in the last video it shows a bit of Lag, but it uses GPS etc. Is vesc tool reliable in speed? Do you also measure it by GPS?
[2024-02-17T09:18:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That was nami
[2024-02-17T09:18:49] haku: dang
[2024-02-17T09:21:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Use to measure with different things yes ,i just say Near the speed Distance is wierd slow🤔
[2024-02-17T09:21:04] Yamal: In the future I would like to prepare more scooters and the truth is that I would like them to be less heavy
[2024-02-17T09:25:56] Yamal: I do the tests on a straight line near my house, 1.7km long, I'm going to try to do tests this weekend with vesc tool and with another app that I have to measure speed and thus make comparisons
[2024-02-17T09:26:20] Yamal: Is vesc tool reliable in speed measurement?
[2024-02-17T09:27:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Weight is always up to load and materials knowledge, so kinda the more power you have you need better frame materials to be safe and light weight ,hard task tbh. Probably to reduce weight that's why nami ended up with this good old shape ,so called lattice support, few hundred year old tech ,but works
[2024-02-17T09:28:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just if you have Correct tire size and pressure ,so you need other tools to make sure
[2024-02-17T09:30:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hope you do test in gears with this speed , kinda nice to have road like that also ,but be safe please ,if road not yours Note that other ppl exists also and dont get caught either 😅
[2024-02-17T09:32:46] Yamal: They are tests on the highway, very little traffic, so don't worry I'm going at the speed of highway 120😁
[2024-02-17T09:33:43] Yamal: The test is from incorporation "to exit" of the same 1.7km, and of course I do it when there are no cars coming, it is just a few seconds
[2024-02-17T09:36:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You know best ,i just saying to keep you on the safe side
[2024-02-17T09:36:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: HighWay nice ,here its forbidden to do such
[2024-02-17T09:38:40] Yamal: It is also prohibited here, we can only circulate through the city or towns
[2024-02-17T09:40:28] Yamal: Here the best thing is to take routes between towns, and the truth is that where I live they leave us alone, the big problems and the huge fines are in the city
[2024-02-17T09:41:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have an alternative like that,but less long , i live close to highway also and as they builted they left some build spaces where they stored machines and such , so i have a 800 m road what goes under the highway (crosses it) and road was never used afterwards,comes from nowhere and goes nowhere , just not so lovely to go there ,since only dirt road exist till you get there
[2024-02-17T09:44:23] Yamal: What Bugatti do you ride?🔥😁
[2024-02-17T09:44:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda nice playground for this ,but you need to go with the scooter, with a daily car you dont go on that dirt road ,maybe with some jeep
[2024-02-17T09:45:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For now nothing special ,since my own still in parts I have an oxo with vesc but not fully done , nothing like yours for now
[2024-02-17T09:47:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i use customer scooters for daily rides 😁
[2024-02-17T09:47:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: More than """"""enough""""" to go to the shop or such and also mandatory
[2024-02-17T09:48:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont let anything out what had main overbuild or bigger change on frame or sus what i dont test
[2024-02-17T09:48:41] Yamal: There are some inokim in northern Europe that are scary with vesc, very powerful. Let's see if I can find photos
[2024-02-17T09:50:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I probably know some of guys who made them ,me in middle of east Europe
[2024-02-17T09:51:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never really planned to make inokim suped high speed sick Neck not made for it ,also not for jumps
[2024-02-17T09:51:31] Yamal: The upgrade some is “ that bicht ““ or some like that…. No remember well
[2024-02-17T09:51:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I even know him bro
[2024-02-17T09:51:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I meen by chats
[2024-02-17T09:53:18] Yamal: From your knowledge of metal, etc., what chassis or frame do you think is good for putting a scooter at 160kmh?
[2024-02-17T09:54:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,so far what i saw naked body was gt2 ,the neck parts is made so nice as it joins the body
[2024-02-17T09:54:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Earlier @KenLawrence showed us in one of the rooms
[2024-02-17T09:57:10] Yamal: Don't see.. you all feel a true love for the g30 and ninebot family, Segway gt2, I see it a little "plastic" and with nothing to do with the stem and handlebar issue❤️‍🔥😁
[2024-02-17T09:57:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But there are so much stuff what effects everything, so in this way there is Always a lvl of pioneering, coz you step on the road where you follow nothing And you need to Correct all the child shoe's problems. And there is big differences up to a motor bike
[2024-02-17T09:58:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I only speak about how that neck was joined to body
[2024-02-17T09:59:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Child shoe's issues is up to all , To continue Doing something what goes 160 without sus and with sus what actually works is two different things
[2024-02-17T09:59:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In my point of view all scooters to small to have a working suspension
[2024-02-17T10:00:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Smallest sus what we should have is pocket or pitbike size ,what has a chance
[2024-02-17T10:00:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also tire size from 12" atleast
[2024-02-17T10:01:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Till all is small cant reallly take anything to big with higher speed
[2024-02-17T10:02:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also did you ever drive speed fuel bikes?
[2024-02-17T10:03:47] Yamal: No
[2024-02-17T10:03:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some has the feature nice ,that as you speed up handlebar hardens to turn and even that fails on some And we have nothing
[2024-02-17T10:04:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I did dh bike for 15y and after that all possible dangerous shit🤣
[2024-02-17T10:04:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like Enduro bikes ,just in the forest
[2024-02-17T10:05:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Once we even had to pick my cousin of a tree coz jump point throw him out🙈🙈 lucky nothing bad happened
[2024-02-17T10:05:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Speed bike gsxr was biggest i driven
[2024-02-17T10:06:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But not for me ,i am not a too calm type ,and better not daily have that power 😅😅
[2024-02-17T10:09:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I also could tell quad stories but i dont like too ,i have a friend with a life time injury by that ,i would say Pretty dangerous and gear doesnt matter if whole shit ends up on you , and also dont do such alone , that's worst idea
[2024-02-17T10:13:43] Yamal: Obviously I can't do anything now, it takes a lot of money to make a preparation, and I'm going to have to wait a long time, I've exhausted the letters, and we have to let time pass, wives don't handle scooters very well. and its preparations
[2024-02-17T10:15:57] Yamal: Honestly, I don't think about fuel vehicles, maybe a van to move around with the family, scooters for me are the best and the most fun
[2024-02-17T10:17:00] Yamal: What do you thing about Nami klima
[2024-02-17T10:19:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh ,i dont use any fuel machine bro

[2024-02-17T10:24:00] Yamal: Just nice powerful inokim🔥

[2024-02-17T12:51:02] Mirono escooters: The rear thing doesn't take much force anyway
[2024-02-17T13:06:56] Mirono escooters: It's not witchcraft so ye : D
[2024-02-17T13:42:02] Давно пора: Lol
[2024-02-17T13:42:31] Давно пора: I went with 170kg on top trough all europe and still punishing it on the greek roads(they are very bad) and heavy offroads wont agree with that
[2024-02-17T13:44:07] Давно пора: Geometry of inokim is perfect
[2024-02-17T13:44:28] Давно пора: Only downside no motors for upgrade

[2024-02-17T14:11:16] Mirono escooters: Inokim very cool ye, I like
[2024-02-17T14:11:30] Mirono escooters: Just dislike 1 swingarm.. Stupid idea, no real good points
[2024-02-17T14:14:32] Давно пора: Looks))))
[2024-02-17T14:21:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Can snap easy
[2024-02-17T14:21:19] Happy Giraffe: Do a diy frame, you got the skill🔥
[2024-02-17T14:21:42] Happy Giraffe: Frame from 3mm inox👀
[2024-02-17T14:22:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: More easy to snap if you sub shit on it
[2024-02-17T14:23:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2024-02-17T14:23:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤷‍♂ all you need is some idiot behavior
[2024-02-17T14:24:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, fyi you can upgrade both,to be double swings arm
[2024-02-17T14:26:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well if one has unlimited money maybe tries

[2024-02-17T14:28:52] Yamal: Yes the last one I like 😁❤️‍🔥🔥
[2024-02-17T14:29:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He makes a lot over different platforms
[2024-02-17T14:29:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you interested,maybe fb is most easy to see stuff
[2024-02-17T14:31:42] Yamal: 👍
[2024-02-17T14:33:24] Yamal: The truth is that every time I think I have it, more clearly, in the future I would like lighter scooters to come, between 30 and 37kg
[2024-02-17T14:38:16] Yamal: I'll look at it in a while👍
[2024-02-17T14:40:56] Mirono escooters: You need some proper drawings xD
[2024-02-17T14:41:03] Mirono escooters: Or ultra accoustic
[2024-02-17T14:41:07] Давно пора: Im 95kg jumping and going 90+ on it
[2024-02-17T14:41:47] Давно пора: Problems where only with older versions
[2024-02-17T14:45:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,that video not too old ,but as you can see he could not land the jump
[2024-02-17T15:18:21] Happy Giraffe: Not hard if you are in the industry already and know your stuff
[2024-02-17T15:18:52] Mirono escooters: A whole scooter frame? My ass
[2024-02-17T15:19:08] Mirono escooters: Sure the crude stuff, but not a whole good one
[2024-02-17T15:19:18] Mirono escooters: Atleast have simple drawings 😆
[2024-02-17T15:19:22] Mirono escooters: Oh and money : F
[2024-02-17T15:19:53] Happy Giraffe: Suspension hardest thing and to make it square. If you build a frame jig for it its very possible
[2024-02-17T15:20:39] Mirono escooters: Suspension is for suckas
[2024-02-17T15:46:27] Happy Giraffe: Could make space in diy scooter for 14" wheels if those motors exist. Way more torque if motor diameter bigger and more copper fill❤️
[2024-02-17T15:48:17] Mirono escooters: 14" on scoot? Bweh
[2024-02-17T15:48:18] Mirono escooters: Not for me
[2024-02-17T15:48:25] Happy Giraffe: Maybe 14" wheels could do nicely on snow if tire is rugged enough. Scooter frame much simpler than a bike so would be very nice to make a diy one if the laws wouldnt be so shitty 25kmh 1000w😅
[2024-02-17T15:48:48] Mirono escooters: Snow maybe
[2024-02-17T15:49:18] Happy Giraffe: And offroad, but yeah could only get RWD with QS90 as its already the "1000w
[2024-02-17T15:50:21] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if that motor can be pushed to 20kw as its an ipm with reduction🤔 Gets high rpm with little phase resistance, good winding cooling etc etc low startup stress
[2024-02-17T17:08:19] sombre_enfant: Anybody know real spec of teverun fighter mini motor?if its 50mm and 16x4 125mm axle it would be a good motor for g30 + its tubeless

[2024-02-17T17:22:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That you?
[2024-02-17T17:25:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As i said if money_enable ∞ I see no problem
[2024-02-17T17:25:58] Happy Giraffe: 10kg inox from a major source is like 50e :)
[2024-02-17T17:26:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont want inox frame
[2024-02-17T17:26:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its not for Francois 😁😁😁
[2024-02-17T17:27:47] Happy Giraffe: Hes Mr.Tungsten. But 2mm inox would be stronger than 4mm alu and about same weight maybe. Good quality alu tho would be nice to work on. Would result in a stiff body
[2024-02-17T17:27:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He probably wants cybertruck also ,thats inox also
[2024-02-17T17:29:05] Happy Giraffe: But you never seen a scooter with a mesh 10mm inox armor in bottom before so xd
[2024-02-17T17:29:22] Happy Giraffe: almost stops AK47
[2024-02-17T17:30:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont think it will see any ,and still bulletproof bottom doesnt make sense
[2024-02-17T17:31:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if you look around like a plain or just concert stage ,non is from inox
[2024-02-17T17:33:39] Happy Giraffe: I would use alu on most of the projects but school alu grade is soft and cheap
[2024-02-17T17:34:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably school didn't plan ,that you will build scooters there😏
[2024-02-17T17:35:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But also would make good advertisement for the school
[2024-02-17T17:35:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Happy scooter industry❤️
[2024-02-17T17:36:20] Happy Giraffe: Leadership and funding there sucks ass on so many levels, but anyway its offtopic xd
[2024-02-17T17:37:43] Happy Giraffe: now making 10x10, a 100 point mesh bed level for printer...should work
[2024-02-17T17:37:54] Happy Giraffe: poor printer having to probe 100 points
[2024-02-17T17:39:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just a bit 😁
[2024-02-17T17:55:44] Happy Giraffe: Torture😂
[2024-02-17T18:25:05] Mirono escooters: Gf
[2024-02-17T18:26:34] haku: use jb weld epoxy. think of the welding fumes in her lungs

[2024-02-17T18:59:02] haku: and your tire size
[2024-02-17T18:59:12] haku: like james said
[2024-02-17T19:02:04] Yamal: Yes !
[2024-02-17T19:02:57] Yamal: I wait a little maybe in some hour I change to the 6.02 firmware for really can share with this group and start learn about it…
[2024-02-17T19:05:58] Happy Giraffe: when magnet setting correct then you can do 60 kmh maxpeed run with a GPS software running in backround, then check maxspeed on GPS vs. Vesc and finetune tire size
[2024-02-17T19:06:22] Happy Giraffe: final setup in vesc tool pc app using vesc vs gps data and using a calculator :)
[2024-02-17T19:06:47] Yamal: 🔥
[2024-02-17T19:10:03] haku: with all due respect keep her in the kitchen. tis a mans job welding.
[2024-02-17T19:11:34] Mirono escooters: That's not really nice of you
[2024-02-17T19:12:07] haku: i just get so insicure because i dont know how to weld. sorry
[2024-02-17T19:12:13] Mirono escooters: 🙈
[2024-02-17T19:12:22] Mirono escooters: If it sticks it sticks
[2024-02-17T19:13:09] Gabe Enzo: hahahaha
[2024-02-17T19:14:55] haku: everyone can weld but me what is going on
[2024-02-17T19:54:46] Happy Giraffe: Maybe like 5 people in this whole chat that we know of😂 Others keep their skills hidden😁
[2024-02-17T19:56:49] haku: i really want to learn this skill. in the summer ill take classes or mess around with it
[2024-02-17T19:59:18] sombre_enfant: Your is too powerfull
[2024-02-17T20:02:41] haku: i mean tig/mig welding
[2024-02-17T20:16:35] haku: what is that website that you can take your stl and they can cnc your design? jbpcb was it?
[2024-02-17T20:21:16] Happy Giraffe: Some ordered 3D printed parts from these kind of companies Jlpcb, Xometry etc and the benchys looked dogshit on all of them but one😂
[2024-02-17T20:21:34] Happy Giraffe: So its a hit and miss with these providers
[2024-02-17T20:22:29] haku: i see. i told this guy to get his motor mount cncd from one of those companies. idk if he will run it with printed mounts lol.
[2024-02-17T20:25:01] haku: good design too
[2024-02-17T20:25:58] sombre_enfant: 3d is good for prototyping imagine if we had to machine everything then adjust and redo😁
[2024-02-17T20:26:55] haku: are these sotion motors really capable of 30kw?
[2024-02-17T20:28:02] Happy Giraffe: Why not just from sheet metal? 30 times cheaper
[2024-02-17T20:28:53] haku: still have to lazer cut it yea?
[2024-02-17T20:29:02] Happy Giraffe: A guy I know sells it for like 60$
[2024-02-17T20:29:30] Happy Giraffe: Why do you have to think so fancy. You can cut the sheet with a hand saw😂
[2024-02-17T20:29:47] Happy Giraffe: Easiest with a table saw tho
[2024-02-17T20:30:04] sombre_enfant: Its not clean
[2024-02-17T20:30:30] haku: not fancy. i thought thats how its done nowadays. im just guessing tbh
[2024-02-17T20:30:50] Happy Giraffe: Ofc you would make a different finish and sand the edges😅
[2024-02-17T20:32:07] Happy Giraffe: Even the cn sheet cutters are not precise enough what we have so need to do rest by hand
[2024-02-17T20:34:29] haku: https://youtu.be/VFWTKjHiQiU?si=ykY6x6FpthlweRdu
[2024-02-17T20:35:20] haku: headway cells. pretty cool
[2024-02-17T21:06:05] haku: so gay and fancy. i love it!

[2024-02-17T21:09:25] haku: how many cells per module?
[2024-02-17T21:14:17] puneDir: 60
[2024-02-17T22:18:43] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2024-02-17T22:22:08] haku: murican women.
[2024-02-17T22:25:54] haku: stay away from me. that song
[2024-02-17T22:40:34] haku: is this body type common in EU too? i dont mean to fatshame just curious
[2024-02-17T22:43:44] Happy Giraffe: Not that common, but becoming more common day by day. Our healthcare is stressed too much people people dont keep themselves in shape and the ones that are ill by bacteria/viruses/etc get delayed help...
[2024-02-17T22:44:27] Happy Giraffe: In the army I saw so many people not being able to run for a minute straight...one girl there took like 15 minutes to crawl 30 feet (10meter)
[2024-02-17T22:45:23] haku: oof. dang. US army too relax the standards. crazy
[2024-02-17T22:46:34] Happy Giraffe: People didnt have the strenght to walk 1 mile with a rifle and 5kg/10lbs backpack😂
[2024-02-17T22:46:47] Happy Giraffe: Some started to cry etc
[2024-02-17T22:48:37] Happy Giraffe: Im lucky I don't have to parent them anymore. Was a big joke, got new brigade general. Far too much of a nice chubby uncle instead of a commander with authority
[2024-02-17T22:49:30] Happy Giraffe: He wasnt stupid but too much of a sissy. Atleast ex-defence forces commander had completed Airborne paratrooper stuff in US
[2024-02-17T22:50:15] Happy Giraffe: I was shocked LBGTQ-BBQ had arrived there😂
[2024-02-17T22:50:31] haku: to be a grunt on the field there should be some standards. seriously
[2024-02-17T22:51:05] Happy Giraffe: Yes...I had the toughest role outside special forces and even that was a bit "sissy" for a regular guy🙈
[2024-02-17T22:51:22] Happy Giraffe: It was different 30years ago...men were men
[2024-02-17T22:52:11] haku: i blame the US for this crap honestly. this shouldnt be a norm
[2024-02-17T22:52:48] Happy Giraffe: Kinda global thing I guess
[2024-02-17T22:52:53] haku: even schools teach this stuff.
[2024-02-17T22:53:02] Happy Giraffe: same...
[2024-02-17T22:54:36] Happy Giraffe: For me its completely normal if a boy wants to play with dolls then let him do that and a girl to play with firetrucks but telling unstable teens that struggle with social media norms already that theres about 40 genders and Apache models will make them crazy
[2024-02-17T22:55:17] haku: exactly. let kids be kids
[2024-02-17T22:56:34] Happy Giraffe: But I gave up in army to do care about anything when we werent allowed to keep order and say that theres "shit on the floor" during cleaning service😂 Realized Im not compatible with modern world
[2024-02-17T22:56:35] haku: suicidal rates here is scary too
[2024-02-17T22:57:35] haku: ive been there been canceled too many times. i dont care anymore. my old HR knows me too well
[2024-02-17T22:58:35] Happy Giraffe: And the fact that you got so many guns there😳😅
[2024-02-17T22:59:19] Happy Giraffe: Yeah here the problem is you dont have alternarive for the LBGT BBQ. You can only vote the right wing and I would like to be somewhere in the middle...
[2024-02-17T22:59:34] haku: same haha
[2024-02-17T23:00:17] Happy Giraffe: But I only vote in Presidential election anyways so dont care anymore😂
[2024-02-17T23:00:33] haku: i know some gay folks. they dont even approve that forcing lgbtq stuff
[2024-02-17T23:00:56] haku: almost there
[2024-02-17T23:01:22] haku: lol
[2024-02-17T23:03:22] Happy Giraffe: Dont worry, just let us know when you want Finland to invade Sweden and take over?😂
[2024-02-17T23:04:02] Happy Giraffe: You can keep Kalles kaviar and Surströmming and the parades
[2024-02-17T23:08:34] haku: speaking of rainbows. this is some gangsta battery holders.
[2024-02-17T23:08:50] haku: how is that possible
[2024-02-17T23:09:36] haku: no stickers. what is the science of this. crazy
[2024-02-17T23:11:05] Gabe Enzo: Light
[2024-02-17T23:11:07] Gabe Enzo: amazing tho
[2024-02-17T23:12:17] haku: i dont understand light sometimes
[2024-02-17T23:16:35] haku: rainbows such a beautiful thing. its just the meaning behind it.

[2024-02-17T23:52:54] puneDir: But theres still this two
[2024-02-17T23:58:58] Yamal: ready for tomorrow, do a test with a full battery, Now I navigate with 6.02, everything is the same in the configuration, with this firmware it gave me the option of increasing 20A per controller (40Atotal) giving up that 15% of field weakening that it had, so I preferred to leave everything the same as I had it with that 15% activated, for a little more top speed

[2024-02-18T00:28:07] sombre_enfant: Best out there
[2024-02-18T00:30:33] haku: i hope someone makes a 85/200 spintend test comparisson
[2024-02-18T00:30:53] Mirono escooters: It should be good
[2024-02-18T00:31:23] Yamal: https://roadrunnerscooters.com/es/collections/featured-scooters/products/rx7-electric-scooter
[2024-02-18T00:31:23] Yamal: Vesc controller ?
[2024-02-18T00:31:39] NetworkDir: steering damper xD
[2024-02-18T00:32:03] haku: this one seems it has a cooling fin. how do you bolt that on?
[2024-02-18T00:32:22] Mirono escooters: Price compare when ^^
[2024-02-18T00:32:30] Mirono escooters: As normal, with a tiny thermalpad
[2024-02-18T00:32:32] Yamal: Just I see now , never see before this escooter
[2024-02-18T00:33:26] Yamal: Interesting for every escooter come out, with vesc controller , and I think maybe,,, but one more time never say..
[2024-02-18T00:40:09] Yamal: https://youtu.be/r59_Ige6ZMg?si=41Gfk_JpbZthJe4F
[2024-02-18T00:40:13] Yamal: his name sounds familiar to me!
[2024-02-18T00:40:26] sombre_enfant: No i seen review and github of original one
[2024-02-18T00:40:51] Happy Giraffe: that design is fucked. Cant even mount it with upside down because of caps and ports
[2024-02-18T00:41:35] Happy Giraffe: This is sadly what happens when you have engineers who skipped thermodynamics on physics class
[2024-02-18T00:43:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: That I don't doubt I want to see is double the performance since is double the price
[2024-02-18T00:43:31] Happy Giraffe: yes and as mount screws are on the side of heatsink??? How in the fuck are we supposed to have airflow if its blocked by esc and have 2mm gaps for it xd Do we have to build a custom intake that makes high pressure airflow there xD
[2024-02-18T00:43:57] Happy Giraffe: CNC mill a custom alu case;)
[2024-02-18T00:45:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: U think?
[2024-02-18T00:45:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: We need to try and see
[2024-02-18T00:45:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: This one all ready has bluewon it
[2024-02-18T00:46:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: Does it have phase filters?
[2024-02-18T00:46:06] Finn: Hm looks like me
[2024-02-18T00:46:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't know what this do
[2024-02-18T00:46:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: I never tried
[2024-02-18T00:48:36] Yamal: Where can we see the battery discharge in vesc tool?
[2024-02-18T00:48:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes the theory I know
[2024-02-18T00:48:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: But never saw the diference
[2024-02-18T00:49:47] Finn: Trashed that scooter
[2024-02-18T00:49:54] Yamal: We can see the motor phase A on the clock, but the battery A?
[2024-02-18T00:51:05] Yamal: the video says 1zuna.. That's a Latin music singer, right?
[2024-02-18T00:53:03] Finn: Xd
[2024-02-18T00:53:20] Finn: He reuploaded my scooter video with his ubox affiliate link😂
[2024-02-18T00:54:39] Yamal: I know 🔥🤣
[2024-02-18T00:57:48] Yamal: xiaomi 90km/h,,
[2024-02-18T00:57:58] Santiago: Hi guys, am I allowed to post here things for sale??? Vesc, motor, wheels, etc....
[2024-02-18T01:01:43] Happy Giraffe: sure go ahead
[2024-02-18T01:03:32] Yamal: ?
[2024-02-18T01:04:22] Yamal: There I will be able to see in real time what the battery discharges?
[2024-02-18T01:04:37] Yamal: 🫡
[2024-02-18T01:13:17] Finn: Theres the handlebar
[2024-02-18T01:15:04] Yamal: I am very sorry, but from my point of view it still seems a little sad to enhance a Xiaomi,
[2024-02-18T01:17:20] Yamal: sometimes I think about it, even a g30! but the thing is that the chassis does not attract me at all, I am very attracted to the idea of promoting light chassis, to be able to travel with the family and take the scooter to the trunk of the car etc and be able to enjoy it in other cities vs other countries, but I don't know...
[2024-02-18T01:22:07] haku: good to have different frames to mess with. lightwight to super heavyweight scooters.
[2024-02-18T01:22:32] haku: makes understanding scooter design more better
[2024-02-18T01:24:41] Yamal: I would have to differentiate between "light" and very light, I am now around 50kg with mine, for me 30kg would be fine
[2024-02-18T01:25:35] Santiago: Thanks!!!
[2024-02-18T01:26:23] haku: i understand now why small scooters is a community in EU. because of laws folks are forced to be creative with thier scooters
[2024-02-18T01:26:52] haku: restrictions breeds creativity
[2024-02-18T01:28:53] Yamal: very good point of view, here supposedly until 2027 we can circulate with large scooters.. although a promising European law is planned for 2026... we will see what happens...
[2024-02-18T01:29:00] haku: thats just my opinion idk if true
[2024-02-18T01:31:45] Happy Giraffe: I rode 10,000km on a modded Xiaomi Pro🔥
[2024-02-18T01:31:55] Santiago: • Ubox V2 100v 100a X2 never used since bought =240€ + shipping (negotiable) • Rage Mechanics FH60 3500w never used since bought either= 240€ + shipping (negotiable) • Spare brand new kaboo wheel with new tire 50€ + shipping Feel free to DM me for any questions, thanks.
[2024-02-18T01:32:03] Happy Giraffe: Was a 60kmh fun bit of a smol scooter
[2024-02-18T01:32:49] Happy Giraffe: Until cops decided to dyno it...luckily vesc profile on startup at 30kmh saved my ass
[2024-02-18T01:42:33] Mirono escooters: Apperantly fixed
[2024-02-18T01:42:44] Mirono escooters: Who donate me to test ^^ @Mltra u know?
[2024-02-18T01:46:56] Yamal: Dual or single motor ?
[2024-02-18T01:47:10] Mirono escooters: Thing is still alive
[2024-02-18T01:58:00] Yamal: the only thing I see attractive about him xaomi is its price on the second-hand market, let's say that you start preparing it for little money, well apart from being discreet and such, I would choose to preserve the design and appearance of the Series, I would not put suspensions, and I would put two engines that I saw from 60h, discharge battery and the electronics remain to be seen,,,
[2024-02-18T02:00:48] haku: i would do the opposite. put 1 90h do burnouts all day
[2024-02-18T02:01:36] haku: if i had the funds and the skill to fabricate i would like to do this but i havemt even finished my scoot haha
[2024-02-18T02:02:50] haku: i really like odd builds like that. something thats not suppose to belong there
[2024-02-18T02:07:46] Yamal: Let's see if you finish it soon, Do you have more scooter to use?
[2024-02-18T02:13:39] haku: using a vsett 9 right now.
[2024-02-18T02:16:32] haku: what i really want is to import an snsc frame. someday if i have the funds. i want the rigidity of it
[2024-02-18T02:18:13] haku: we dont have those here i think
[2024-02-18T02:20:32] Yamal: do you have photos of the frame
[2024-02-18T02:21:59] haku: no but its like a g30 on steroids. much beefier
[2024-02-18T02:28:33] Happy Giraffe: Single😂
[2024-02-18T02:30:16] haku: i also have this tricycle i want to put sotion motors/qsmotors someday
[2024-02-18T02:31:39] haku: i have so many groundbreaking dreams. i just need funding
[2024-02-18T02:31:47] Yamal: By the way, do you know what type of electronics the ESC scooters have?
[2024-02-18T02:32:50] haku: this a question for me?
[2024-02-18T02:33:05] Yamal: If you know yes
[2024-02-18T02:33:22] Yamal: <photos/photo_12961@18-02-2024_02-33-22.jpg>
[2024-02-18T02:33:40] haku: no idea.
[2024-02-18T02:34:04] haku: @jamessoderstrom might know
[2024-02-18T02:35:40] Happy Giraffe: Dont you have regulations in your state?
[2024-02-18T02:37:15] haku: not yet. as long as your moving with traffic wich is 45mph.
[2024-02-18T02:37:49] haku: my vsett cant even get that fast
[2024-02-18T02:39:40] Yamal: you haven't thought about preparing the vstt9?
[2024-02-18T02:40:36] haku: not really. 8.5 tires keeps me from bothering with it. maybe put a vesc
[2024-02-18T02:42:02] Yamal: <photos/photo_12962@18-02-2024_02-42-02.jpg>
[2024-02-18T02:42:10] haku: im not really intrested in it. i made a mistake buying it tbh. i shouldve forked out the extra $$ for the vsett 10
[2024-02-18T02:42:32] haku: looks UL cerified
[2024-02-18T02:49:39] Happy Giraffe: Are there cycling paths you can ride or forced to go to side of main road?
[2024-02-18T02:51:01] Happy Giraffe: The 15.5mph limit in Finland makes me crazy. I ride past that even on a normal bike🙈
[2024-02-18T02:53:30] haku: there are some bike lanes. my city not really bike friendly.
[2024-02-18T03:02:09] Paolo ⁭: Thats not the original ESC scooter with special electronics
[2024-02-18T03:02:28] Paolo ⁭: That's simply a modified numo 920r with Kelly controllers
[2024-02-18T03:02:57] haku: no way haha
[2024-02-18T03:03:12] haku: omg only in america
[2024-02-18T03:21:24] haku: im not into sneakers but i will buy this. politics aside. very cool colorway.
[2024-02-18T05:46:14] Yamal: Yes
[2024-02-18T05:47:08] Yamal: I know , is just for show the “type” scooter , this photo I have near before

[2024-02-18T10:18:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean really nice that she is helping , but Miro lets him weld to rust paint 😅🙈
[2024-02-18T10:34:01] sombre_enfant: Noh teverun fighter ten is better and cheaper if its to remove esc battery and motor...

[2024-02-18T13:19:52] Gabe Enzo: 20s4p mh1 soon. wish me luck 💀
[2024-02-18T13:21:14] Кирилл: Stock is 5.2mm² motor cable and 3.9mm² winding. Here i have 8mm² motor cable and very tight ≈5.7mm² winding
[2024-02-18T13:21:22] Happy Giraffe: Change firmware🌚
[2024-02-18T13:21:59] Happy Giraffe: Mine became working one after that. Proper 100 point bed mesh level etc. Soon switching to a glass surface.
[2024-02-18T13:24:28] Gabe Enzo: to Marvin?
[2024-02-18T13:24:47] Mirono escooters: Whoa, mine fine
[2024-02-18T13:24:51] Mirono escooters: Ender is such a good base
[2024-02-18T13:25:32] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom these two are filled, any idea why?
[2024-02-18T13:25:44] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12968@18-02-2024_13-25-44.jpg>
[2024-02-18T13:27:55] Happy Giraffe: Marlin is stock ender, I mean Marlin professional custom firmware
[2024-02-18T13:28:15] Happy Giraffe: Check stl file
[2024-02-18T13:28:30] Gabe Enzo: Probably corrupted. the Sd card I have is damaged
[2024-02-18T13:28:51] Gabe Enzo: could also the printer itself, sometimes it halts mid print and claims it's finished
[2024-02-18T13:29:42] Happy Giraffe: You have abused and raped your printer😂😭
[2024-02-18T13:30:08] Mirono escooters: ...
[2024-02-18T13:30:11] Mirono escooters: Sd card ususally
[2024-02-18T13:30:38] Gabe Enzo: I have about 14cm clearance, I think I'll just make the 20s8p as one brick and stuff it in there. with 11x3 I'll have an extra cm clearance. and change shocks. will still have space for escs and bms under the cell lol
[2024-02-18T13:30:57] Gabe Enzo: It'll look super goofy but no bag eh if possible I look for a way to install 12 inchers
[2024-02-18T13:44:04] Finn: 50mm spacer plus💀
[2024-02-18T13:44:20] Awyba: how do you want to fit 11 inch? or even 12 inch
[2024-02-18T13:45:07] Gabe Enzo: Monorim front can fit 11 inch easy. rear too with bearings
[2024-02-18T13:45:26] Gabe Enzo: Rear I will just make my own fork from the monorim front, at a slanted angle haven't decided what way yet
[2024-02-18T13:45:46] Gabe Enzo: 70 I believe have to do the math later. and I'm not printing dat shit
[2024-02-18T13:46:47] Finn: Haha
[2024-02-18T13:47:04] Finn: Looks ugly af💀
[2024-02-18T13:50:43] Happy Giraffe: 70 spacer rip ground clearance
[2024-02-18T13:59:53] Mirono escooters: O o
[2024-02-18T14:11:34] Gabe Enzo: Should be way more than enough with 11 inch. and extended shocks.
[2024-02-18T14:34:41] Mirono escooters: Check preview
[2024-02-18T16:00:00] Tommy ª: yes

[2024-02-18T16:00:57] puneDir: Theres 180 gray m26 and 60 purple
[2024-02-18T16:01:43] puneDir: I think only difference between them is shrink color
[2024-02-18T16:10:21] Jan: I think i could do this on my 20s G30 with 10ml of this to fill it up completely
[2024-02-18T16:13:09] Tommy ª: how you repair it?
[2024-02-18T16:19:42] Jan: If you have anything injected over it like silicone, that would be a huge pain, i rather not do this
[2024-02-18T16:19:58] Jan: Takes a lot of time to do cabling again when repairs need to be done
[2024-02-18T16:54:07] Awyba: sealed for eternity
[2024-02-18T16:55:12] Awyba: looks so satisfying
[2024-02-18T17:38:38] Gabe Enzo: sealed from maintenance
[2024-02-18T17:38:41] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2024-02-18T19:19:37] Gabe Enzo: If I'm off 1mm then the MH1 pack will not fit 👀💀
[2024-02-18T19:19:52] Gabe Enzo: razor edge here
[2024-02-18T19:22:42] Finn: 18650?20s?

[2024-02-18T19:57:54] sombre_enfant: Anybody did an handlebar on off button for vesc ?
[2024-02-18T20:08:17] Gabe Enzo: @jamaludin_algarnati looking sexy
[2024-02-18T20:08:28] Gabe Enzo: printing at 120, no issues.
[2024-02-18T20:09:47] Happy Giraffe: I got a key for throttle if that counts. Also did on/off in xiaomi stock pwr btn place
[2024-02-18T20:10:14] sombre_enfant: Hmm no
[2024-02-18T20:10:30] haku: is that james design?
[2024-02-18T20:11:03] Happy Giraffe: What about the button anyway?
[2024-02-18T20:11:11] Yamal: In a while I'll go out to do a speed test with the scooter, full battery, I'm going to record vesc tool to see how the numbers it reaches with the 6.02, which apparently limits less """
[2024-02-18T20:11:26] Gabe Enzo: seems to be some blobs around the circles, hope this won't make the cells fit
[2024-02-18T20:11:27] haku: james design always fly baby
[2024-02-18T20:12:40] sombre_enfant: If i ever got caught by police i turn off
[2024-02-18T20:12:40] Gabe Enzo: can probably Dremel it off.
[2024-02-18T20:12:41] haku: the filament does that.
[2024-02-18T20:12:48] Happy Giraffe: What model of tesla you gonna fit that in?

[2024-02-18T20:15:36] puneDir: <photos/photo_12976@18-02-2024_20-15-36.jpg>
[2024-02-18T20:17:12] Gabe Enzo: blood and tears
[2024-02-18T20:17:41] haku: what filament you use?
[2024-02-18T20:17:46] haku: this one doesnt do that
[2024-02-18T20:19:46] Gabe Enzo: 6 year old white PLA found in a storage container
[2024-02-18T20:19:50] Gabe Enzo: It was sealed.
[2024-02-18T20:20:28] haku: im not a 3d printing pro but its not suppose to have blobs
[2024-02-18T20:20:47] haku: just use flush cutters to trim them
[2024-02-18T20:21:04] Gabe Enzo: correction, 10.
[2024-02-18T20:21:08] Gabe Enzo: Hahahaha
[2024-02-18T20:21:54] haku: pla has no expiration date yea?
[2024-02-18T20:22:04] Gabe Enzo: If sealed with silicone balls, it shouldn't.
[2024-02-18T20:22:07] Gabe Enzo: And it was
[2024-02-18T20:24:11] haku: im not a pro but use petg. they are recommended by the battery lords
[2024-02-18T20:24:59] haku: pla will deform when batteries get hot. never seen it but im guessing
[2024-02-18T20:27:07] puneDir: Yeah
[2024-02-18T20:27:15] puneDir: But it was kinda fun
[2024-02-18T20:27:32] puneDir: This 4 batteries costed 180 euros
[2024-02-18T20:27:47] puneDir: And theyre on 50-60 cycles
[2024-02-18T20:38:59] haku: is that easy to take off?
[2024-02-18T20:39:15] Tommy ª: probably not but people loves doing that
[2024-02-18T20:40:01] Paolo ⁭: Lol Who stole that much of rental battery
[2024-02-18T20:40:11] haku: waterproofing yea but would it be good cooling wise?
[2024-02-18T20:41:01] Tommy ª: i have same question
[2024-02-18T20:44:48] puneDir: Nobody
[2024-02-18T20:44:59] puneDir: There was some brand called fenix or felix im not sure
[2024-02-18T20:45:13] puneDir: They bankrupted and new scooters went to scrap
[2024-02-18T20:45:29] puneDir: °insurence took them
[2024-02-18T20:45:55] puneDir: So someone took the batteries from there and sells them
[2024-02-18T20:45:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-18T21:01:48] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom it won't fit. but there's space for a whole extra stack on the top
[2024-02-18T21:01:51] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12978@18-02-2024_21-01-51.jpg>
[2024-02-18T21:10:00] Gabe Enzo: Jesus this shit is strong, I assumed it would just snap
[2024-02-18T21:13:40] Paolo ⁭: Hi guys someone need 18650 batteries? I got some packs for good price, 182 cells 2900mah for just 160€

[2024-02-18T21:16:07] Paolo ⁭: Bak 2900mAh
[2024-02-18T21:20:22] haku: what TPU fillament brands do you guys recommend?
[2024-02-18T21:20:46] Happy Giraffe: Tinmorry worked great on me
[2024-02-18T21:21:13] Happy Giraffe: Oh wait, I check what i have. Might have been another brand...
[2024-02-18T21:21:48] Happy Giraffe: Overture
[2024-02-18T21:21:51] haku: ive read tpu has different softness/ hardness
[2024-02-18T21:22:24] Happy Giraffe: If pla is deformed when opening scooter theres bigger issues than warped PLA😂
[2024-02-18T21:22:25] haku: we have that available here. ill try that
[2024-02-18T21:25:55] Happy Giraffe: 95A is what I used, its really hard to tell how soft it is with words. It bends easily but still stays in form somewhat. Tankiest material ever to break tho
[2024-02-18T21:28:33] haku: how about i make my own pmt tires haha
[2024-02-18T21:34:36] Yamal: We fly baby 🥳😭❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥⚡️
[2024-02-18T21:34:36] Yamal: We fly baby 🥳😭❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥⚡️

[2024-02-18T21:41:44] Martin Kaktits: <sticker>
[2024-02-18T21:43:38] haku: 387a wow
[2024-02-18T21:44:59] haku: crazy how voltage sag is with 10p 40t.
[2024-02-18T21:45:31] Jan: Feels very similar to our G30 project
[2024-02-18T21:46:13] Jan: Wasnt Rion shipped with P42a?
[2024-02-18T21:46:34] haku: yes i think.
[2024-02-18T21:52:17] Paolo ⁭: I think pmt is cheaper for the kg of material 😂
[2024-02-18T21:53:38] haku: i was just kidding but be funny though
[2024-02-18T21:54:25] Paolo ⁭: Impossible, where you saw that?
[2024-02-18T21:54:55] Paolo ⁭: Re60 also has molicel
[2024-02-18T21:55:09] haku: i would imagine tpu used for scooters would be seals and stuff
[2024-02-18T21:57:52] Paolo ⁭: I think the friend of @jamaludin_algarnati did battery pack with 50e in his rion
[2024-02-18T21:58:08] Paolo ⁭: But original comes with 5/6/7p of molicel
[2024-02-18T21:59:22] Yamal: My friend before have 6p molicel and he do new with 40t My is Nami “like Rion” everything the same but my is 10 p 40t
[2024-02-18T22:01:00] Paolo ⁭: Original rion uses Kelly or Bak controllers
[2024-02-18T22:01:10] Paolo ⁭: Tronic is new and they still never used on their scooter
[2024-02-18T22:02:29] haku: is that normal sag for 40t at 387a?
[2024-02-18T22:04:04] Paolo ⁭: Only the new apex (still nobody received) has vesc
[2024-02-18T22:04:27] Yamal: <photos/photo_12983@18-02-2024_22-04-27.jpg>
[2024-02-18T22:11:30] Happy Giraffe: 0-100kmh measurements🔥
[2024-02-18T22:11:38] Happy Giraffe: Pls test
[2024-02-18T22:13:30] Paolo ⁭: Yes but they changed immediately
[2024-02-18T22:13:54] Paolo ⁭: It does max 130 phase and heat af
[2024-02-18T22:41:24] Paolo ⁭: Weped still today uses 50E😂
[2024-02-18T22:41:58] Mirono escooters: That trail is special. Does it become normal when standing on it?
[2024-02-18T22:42:35] Mirono escooters: Weped is a sad brand
[2024-02-18T22:46:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why?
[2024-02-18T22:46:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: Not rly they want maximum range per space
[2024-02-18T22:47:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: 50e are nice on that
[2024-02-18T22:47:13] Rogerio Figueiredo: Since they have like 30p
[2024-02-18T22:47:46] Paolo ⁭: They've 6p on 240A setup
[2024-02-18T22:48:26] Yamal: The first Rions came with a Kelly 7212 and a Molicel battery, then Rion started to build Tronic 450, the first Apex came with a Tronic 250r and now all the new ones have a TronicX12, my friend really knows Rion's history in terms of electronics and battery types, I only know on top of it..
[2024-02-18T22:51:15] Yamal: there are people who have already received it
[2024-02-18T22:51:50] Happy Giraffe: 50S way better, also already at 10A 50E is max stressed for long term use😅
[2024-02-18T22:52:13] Mirono escooters: 50e does handle abuse
[2024-02-18T22:52:20] Mirono escooters: But this is stupid
[2024-02-18T22:52:48] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/MOgBu1ZLIaU?si=QVxtcEq-8FKs_Vf1
[2024-02-18T22:52:53] Mirono escooters: Stupid engineering, Stupid scooters
[2024-02-18T22:53:02] Mirono escooters: And also a shit brand
[2024-02-18T22:53:04] Happy Giraffe: Already 4.55Ah at 10A discharge😅
[2024-02-18T22:54:07] Yamal: I like man, 27-30kg / 130kmh 😁
[2024-02-18T22:55:12] Yamal: with brutal acceleration
[2024-02-18T22:57:29] Yamal: Yes! But the fat one with 100ah battery
[2024-02-18T23:04:00] Paolo ⁭: No , even the small weed
[2024-02-18T23:04:09] Paolo ⁭: Normally comes with 16s6p pack
[2024-02-18T23:04:20] Mirono escooters: Weped weed ✅
[2024-02-18T23:08:13] Yamal: There is a saying that says: "for tastes, colors" I understand that you don't like Rion or weped, I do! Just as I don't like Xiaomi or G30
[2024-02-18T23:08:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes 50e has
[2024-02-18T23:08:50] haku: i like laotie best scooter made. bang for buck

[2024-02-18T23:11:15] haku: $700 for a 60v 38ah scooter. you cant find that anywhere

[2024-02-19T00:00:25] Gabe Enzo: I'm looking at 50mm alone to have the escs on the bottom plate.
[2024-02-19T00:00:38] Gabe Enzo: You're right it's too dangerous
[2024-02-19T00:07:05] Jacob: Good evening guys, i just went on my first test drive and the screen is showing totally wrong kph and acceleration is very slow how can i fix that in vesc tool?

[2024-02-19T04:40:17] Paolo ⁭: Isn't kebab from @punedir country?
[2024-02-19T04:51:25] haku: nah its called alpastor tacos. street food in mexico. salute to these guys just opened up im the street rent free
[2024-02-19T05:26:55] haku: @PaoloWu have you seen these on a scooter? some surron folks raving about sk72ah
[2024-02-19T06:09:55] Jacob: Hey again went for a second test drive with the right wheel size, but the speedometer is till mad wrong, and motor feels a bit slow. Some of these settings i have to play with?

[2024-02-19T06:43:50] Finn: What motor do you have
[2024-02-19T06:44:16] Finn: Put motor poles to 30 and gear ratio to 1
[2024-02-19T06:44:35] Finn: You did the motor setup wrong
[2024-02-19T06:53:48] Mike: Jear👍
[2024-02-19T07:04:17] yoann tsobanoglou: For those who speak without knowing, although I dislike weped appearance which is personal taste. The Samsung 50e battery pack handles peak current like a boss. We have added ant bms on a 4 year old fs and it peaks 240a easy. Cells stay cool and estimated +10000km still charges like new. Let’s be honest this is easy a 15/20a cell
[2024-02-19T07:07:27] Yamal: I like Fs,, now rare to see
[2024-02-19T07:08:31] Yamal: fs use speed motor 33/2?
[2024-02-19T07:12:02] Yamal: By the way, if I remember correctly, your nami was being painted, let's see when it's ready and you can start testing it.
[2024-02-19T07:13:22] yoann tsobanoglou: No, they are not speed as I have more end speed with my 22/3 winding without Fw, and have crazy torque on startup.
[2024-02-19T07:14:22] yoann tsobanoglou: We are almost done with testing, few minor adjustments.
[2024-02-19T07:15:14] Yamal: but is the weped Fs yours?
[2024-02-19T07:15:32] haku: scooters are all the same ffs. its just the parts you have in it that matters.
[2024-02-19T07:16:12] yoann tsobanoglou: A friend from the riding group
[2024-02-19T07:16:39] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_12998@19-02-2024_07-16-39.jpg>
[2024-02-19T07:17:09] Yamal: Nami?
[2024-02-19T07:17:22] yoann tsobanoglou: Don’t worry about motor temp. Sensor on winding
[2024-02-19T07:17:56] yoann tsobanoglou: Yes
[2024-02-19T07:19:38] Happy Giraffe: These seem all fake sadly
[2024-02-19T07:19:41] Yamal: Big machine ! high numbers! Being a novice in this, the only thing I observe in that image and in the last ones that you passed to the group is a little too much temperature in the electronics, Mine reduces power to protect itself at 70°C
[2024-02-19T07:19:57] Happy Giraffe: "1 order"
[2024-02-19T07:20:37] yoann tsobanoglou: The good news is that battery pack seems to behave finally correctly, I think it needed a few cycles. Temps are finally rising logically and voltage drop reduced a bit, range also extended even though temps have dropped outside.
[2024-02-19T07:20:54] haku: where can you get real ones of these.
[2024-02-19T07:21:11] haku: seems like a perfect shape battery for a scooter
[2024-02-19T07:21:17] Jacob: Oh i have the monorim 500w
[2024-02-19T07:21:28] Jacob: Thank you, i'll do that!
[2024-02-19T07:21:39] Yamal: Are those 128 with fw 22/3 engine?
[2024-02-19T07:22:21] Yamal: Km/h
[2024-02-19T07:22:32] yoann tsobanoglou: 40a fw
[2024-02-19T07:22:46] haku: like you can stack 22 of these side by side
[2024-02-19T07:22:48] Yamal: I have 37A fw
[2024-02-19T07:23:55] yoann tsobanoglou: Always 5/8km different from gps speed although spintend have gps inside vesc
[2024-02-19T07:25:13] Yamal: I've been looking at those controllers, and they look very very powerful!
[2024-02-19T07:25:38] yoann tsobanoglou: Temps now stay so cool, we will see if they follow this summer
[2024-02-19T07:26:36] Yamal: My country in summer 40/42/43°C (south Spain)
[2024-02-19T07:27:40] yoann tsobanoglou: This is smooth startup and maxing throttle linearly after 55km
[2024-02-19T07:27:42] yoann tsobanoglou: Same, Greece!
[2024-02-19T07:31:14] Yamal: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
[2024-02-19T07:31:37] Yamal: I like this type videos❤️‍🔥🐍😁
[2024-02-19T07:32:13] haku: thats fast. what batteries and esc?
[2024-02-19T07:32:34] Yamal: Remember he post before
[2024-02-19T07:32:54] haku: i dont remember
[2024-02-19T07:33:10] Yamal: Your esc, battery Samsung 50s/ motor 22/3
[2024-02-19T07:33:36] yoann tsobanoglou: 70h 22/3 from @PaoloWu and spintend 85/200
[2024-02-19T07:34:02] Yamal: My is 60h man 🤣😎
[2024-02-19T07:34:08] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-02-19T07:34:08] haku: what is configuration on 50s?
[2024-02-19T07:34:58] yoann tsobanoglou: 60h is same power
[2024-02-19T07:35:21] Yamal: What is the nominal power this motor I really don’t know
[2024-02-19T07:35:42] Yamal: Some people say this,,, Other say that… really don’t know
[2024-02-19T07:35:59] Yamal: And Pablo , I ask one time , but no replay yet..
[2024-02-19T07:36:02] yoann tsobanoglou: Those are old lonnyo
[2024-02-19T07:36:20] Yamal: My rear motor is from Paolo to
[2024-02-19T07:38:31] yoann tsobanoglou: First gen? Or second ? Do you have one cable with everything in?
[2024-02-19T07:39:11] yoann tsobanoglou: Yes
[2024-02-19T07:47:47] haku: how can you tell wich generation on lonnyo motors. please educate me.
[2024-02-19T07:49:00] haku: can you please also show me a close up photo on your motors.
[2024-02-19T07:50:06] yoann tsobanoglou: For split motor, old generation has phase cables running through shaft and new through side cap
[2024-02-19T07:51:23] yoann tsobanoglou: Phase wires also smaller diameter, and prone to heat more
[2024-02-19T07:52:34] haku: what is this? 70h?
[2024-02-19T07:52:55] haku: this is on the new ones?
[2024-02-19T07:53:07] yoann tsobanoglou: No
[2024-02-19T07:53:46] haku: mine is new or old?
[2024-02-19T07:54:08] yoann tsobanoglou: New
[2024-02-19T07:54:30] haku: you have tubeless split rim too?
[2024-02-19T07:56:06] haku: i want to get a 90mm wode rim for 11 but im thinking of getting this instead because i have a 100mm.
[2024-02-19T07:56:07] haku: <files/Screenshot_20240218_163633_Chrome.jpg>
[2024-02-19T07:56:22] yoann tsobanoglou: No tubeless on old design
[2024-02-19T07:56:46] yoann tsobanoglou: And my half rim is fix to motor
[2024-02-19T07:56:57] haku: oh gotcha.
[2024-02-19T07:57:21] Yamal: Yes
[2024-02-19T07:58:06] haku: your the one that has holes on motor yea? you just drill that?
[2024-02-19T07:58:39] haku: how big are the holes of you dont mind me asking?
[2024-02-19T07:58:58] yoann tsobanoglou: No was like this
[2024-02-19T07:59:10] haku: i see. very cool
[2024-02-19T07:59:35] haku: i did not see that option unfortunately

[2024-02-19T08:01:27] Yamal: My is tubeles, very cool
[2024-02-19T08:02:09] haku: pmts are suppose to be used without inner tubes?
[2024-02-19T08:02:41] yoann tsobanoglou: Opened the motor to change phase cables and add temp sensor
[2024-02-19T08:03:18] haku: nice. the stator on the new and old gen is the same? nothing changed but phase cables?
[2024-02-19T08:04:03] Yamal: In my experience, the tubeles are the best, in the 33/2 that I had before I had some punctures, and it's not cool when you're far from home...
[2024-02-19T08:04:06] yoann tsobanoglou: Reinforce with high temp sleeves on phase wire and separated them to avoid some problems
[2024-02-19T08:04:24] yoann tsobanoglou: I don’t know.
[2024-02-19T08:04:54] haku: very nice. i see what your talking about with the phase cables. yours come out from the axle
[2024-02-19T08:05:23] yoann tsobanoglou: Yup
[2024-02-19T08:06:19] haku: does it fit perfectly on burn ie? or you have to widen the forks?
[2024-02-19T08:10:32] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_13005@19-02-2024_08-10-32.jpg>
[2024-02-19T08:10:32] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_13006@19-02-2024_08-10-32.jpg>
[2024-02-19T08:10:49] yoann tsobanoglou: Widened those two and spacers
[2024-02-19T08:11:03] haku: very nice!
[2024-02-19T08:11:08] yoann tsobanoglou: But for new gen maybe more is needed
[2024-02-19T08:11:35] haku: gotcha
[2024-02-19T08:13:16] haku: do you find the thick phase cables annoying? very difficult to bend
[2024-02-19T08:13:23] haku: mine sucks
[2024-02-19T08:16:22] yoann tsobanoglou: Heat with heat gun on low
[2024-02-19T08:16:34] yoann tsobanoglou: Have your hand to avoid damage
[2024-02-19T08:16:53] yoann tsobanoglou: When they heat up, you can handle bends
[2024-02-19T08:16:57] yoann tsobanoglou: Perfect!
[2024-02-19T08:27:11] Happy Giraffe: You see 7x price tag on US resellers
[2024-02-19T08:32:31] Mirono escooters: I've used, bigger version Goodi cells
[2024-02-19T08:32:39] Mirono escooters: Some real sellers exist
[2024-02-19T08:42:55] Happy Giraffe: Give links to proper cells or didn't happen
[2024-02-19T09:45:45] Mirono escooters: I gatekeep my supplier, sorry 🤐😵
[2024-02-19T09:45:57] Mirono escooters: Can show tests tho 😆
[2024-02-19T12:20:23] Gabe Enzo: what pack you making with those lg cells
[2024-02-19T12:32:12] puneDir: 20s7p
[2024-02-19T12:32:16] puneDir: For zero 10x
[2024-02-19T13:06:10] Gabe Enzo: With 6a Cells? Ur only looking at around 50a pushing it
[2024-02-19T13:06:38] Gabe Enzo: Those are literally mh1 cells no? that's what I'm using for 4p 800w
[2024-02-19T13:07:56] Gabe Enzo: Ah they're 10a cells. Nice 70a there without even pushing it
[2024-02-19T13:29:47] Gabe Enzo: mh1s have no issue being drawn at 10a.
[2024-02-19T13:30:00] Gabe Enzo: more
[2024-02-19T13:30:02] Gabe Enzo: idk how
[2024-02-19T13:30:11] Gabe Enzo: i drew 12.5a it didnt even shut off
[2024-02-19T13:30:15] Gabe Enzo: yes
[2024-02-19T13:30:26] Gabe Enzo: tbh they sag the same amount regardless what amps you draw them at
[2024-02-19T13:30:55] Martin Kaktits: Lol
[2024-02-19T13:48:54] puneDir: I hope they wont
[2024-02-19T14:02:19] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_13007@19-02-2024_14-02-19.jpg>
[2024-02-19T14:03:09] Happy Giraffe: At 10A load 40T gives equal runtime vs. 50E🌚 so if your normal cruising speed takes 10A per cell then 40T even better let alone P42A

[2024-02-19T14:07:28] yoann tsobanoglou: Did I say that 50e is better that molicel or 40t?
[2024-02-19T14:07:49] haku: those are the eve cells?
[2024-02-19T14:07:59] puneDir: Hot glue and fishpaper between every series
[2024-02-19T14:08:02] puneDir: Lg m26
[2024-02-19T14:09:23] Gabe Enzo: where did you get those fish paper rings from
[2024-02-19T14:09:34] Gabe Enzo: also you aren't scared of this pack falling apart no?
[2024-02-19T14:09:43] puneDir: Theyre all glued with hot glue
[2024-02-19T14:09:58] puneDir: Also i will surround it with tape
[2024-02-19T14:10:08] puneDir: Some turkish battery shop
[2024-02-19T14:10:10] Gabe Enzo: should have no issues if I do this for the 8p outside moli pack then. U always said I should like not do that haha
[2024-02-19T14:10:19] Gabe Enzo: I'm using spacers for inside tho
[2024-02-19T14:10:33] yoann tsobanoglou: I answered to those who criticised weped and numo for using this cell in their models, by saying that I’ve seen this cell used and abused, and holds perfectly fine. And 50e cells grade A can easily handle 20a compared to grade b from nkon
[2024-02-19T14:10:35] puneDir: No i mean no isolation battey
[2024-02-19T14:10:46] puneDir: This is much more safer than holders
[2024-02-19T14:16:43] yoann tsobanoglou: @Happy_Giraffe We are not talking cell wise, we use them in packs. The behaviour is quite different in our world as we don’t push them constantly to their limits like powertools would. These reviews should be used as a start reference but don’t reflect our use in realistic scenarios.
[2024-02-19T14:17:39] haku: with that chart p42 and 40t pretty similar specs
[2024-02-19T14:20:08] yoann tsobanoglou: They do have a bit of difference in voltage sag. Other than that, we haven’t seen big difference in performance.
[2024-02-19T14:23:34] haku: have you been watching esk8 battery builds? this is exactly what they do to save space
[2024-02-19T14:24:52] haku: 20s 7p will fit a zero10 with vesc inside?
[2024-02-19T14:26:48] puneDir: Fishpaper+ hot glue
[2024-02-19T14:26:56] puneDir: + leaving some air space between cells

[2024-02-19T14:35:36] Mirono escooters: Source? Grade B, nkon? What is that for BS
[2024-02-19T14:36:08] Mirono escooters: I'm not gonna tolerate misinformation 😁
[2024-02-19T14:36:46] puneDir: Why its not
[2024-02-19T14:37:09] Gabe Enzo: You should be using hot glue anyways even with spacers no
[2024-02-19T14:37:13] Gabe Enzo: Just weaker
[2024-02-19T14:37:19] Mirono escooters: Safer then holders? You Crazy?
[2024-02-19T14:37:26] Gabe Enzo: punedir stoned

[2024-02-19T15:06:45] Mirono escooters: Hotglue with spacers 😰😰😰
[2024-02-19T15:58:10] Tommy ª: i got grounded

[2024-02-19T16:26:21] Yamal: Nice👍
[2024-02-19T16:56:30] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters the package seems to be stuck in Irish customs for a week now. but the VAT is paid and it has a declaration. Pretty weird tho
[2024-02-19T16:57:05] Gabe Enzo: should be coming this week for sure
[2024-02-19T16:58:07] Mirono escooters: Happens
[2024-02-19T17:14:04] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2024-02-19T17:14:08] Gabe Enzo: so annoying dude
[2024-02-19T18:17:39] sombre_enfant: Sucé escooter part in making, will gatekeep ofc
[2024-02-19T18:19:07] Mirono escooters: Some axle extenders?
[2024-02-19T18:21:33] sombre_enfant: No, but im gatekeeping
[2024-02-19T18:22:16] sombre_enfant: Tbh ts didnt needed tailstock at all just wante to be fancy
[2024-02-19T18:24:22] haku: oooh what part papi?
[2024-02-19T18:26:31] sombre_enfant: Bro im 1/3 ur age😭
[2024-02-19T18:27:14] sombre_enfant: But i've been a machinist since 1952 no soft hands here
[2024-02-19T18:27:50] haku: i need one of those. just so expensive
[2024-02-19T18:30:28] sombre_enfant: This one is the wrost i worked on... The cmz and hurco was way better but a bit more difficult to program... Only good thing is the siemens panel Chuck and tailstock is manual no w axis no y c axis to do some milling job the chuck is as big as the turret 8tool turret cant put many center tool or you do collisions...
[2024-02-19T18:31:17] haku: i dont know what you just said but i agree. i want one from ali
[2024-02-19T18:32:15] sombre_enfant: If u have 30-40k hurco is best bang for buck but panel not as good as siemens for programming siemens as instant simulation like fanuc hurco dont
[2024-02-19T18:32:26] sombre_enfant: Nah wtf
[2024-02-19T18:32:42] sombre_enfant: If u tight get a old manual one
[2024-02-19T18:33:00] sombre_enfant: Just check the bar feed and gear
[2024-02-19T18:33:08] haku: 30-40k jeez. china has cheaper ones
[2024-02-19T18:33:47] sombre_enfant: Thats nothing actually for something u can print money 24/7 on
[2024-02-19T18:34:14] haku: this is for personal use haha. im not making aluminum dildos to sell
[2024-02-19T18:34:32] sombre_enfant: Or just get in the trade and do part as u wish out of work hours
[2024-02-19T18:35:05] sombre_enfant: Idk if its well paid in usa. Here its decent between 1600-2700
[2024-02-19T18:35:38] sombre_enfant: And theres always work and company who recruit
[2024-02-19T18:36:36] haku: i just want to play engineer in the garage. maybe someday make something cool
[2024-02-19T18:37:56] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow I try to give you some stainless TIG porn
[2024-02-19T18:38:53] sombre_enfant: https://youtube.com/@InheritanceMachining?si=LkoeQ-GLmxafKWtI Look at this guy hes goated on manual machine couldnt do all that cnc make us smooth brain...
[2024-02-19T18:39:45] sombre_enfant: Like u already a good welder ?🤣
[2024-02-19T18:51:12] haku: this already has the skills. i watch him. i still have to learn it.
[2024-02-19T18:51:54] haku: im sure china has some good reliable hobbyist ones
[2024-02-19T18:52:26] haku: china lathe better than no lathe
[2024-02-19T19:05:37] Happy Giraffe: Nope, it's porn anyway on stainless as it creates those shiny colors
[2024-02-19T19:05:58] Happy Giraffe: On mild steel it's same gray pattern
[2024-02-19T19:08:00] Gabe Enzo: My barber just said he knows people with scooters and they all need their tyres changed 😂
[2024-02-19T19:08:12] Gabe Enzo: He asked for my number so he can send it to all of his friends
[2024-02-19T19:16:51] Happy Giraffe: This is the way, once you get cash flowing can upgrade equipment for even easier change and more hourly profit when calendar fills up👍
[2024-02-19T19:17:16] Gabe Enzo: everyone here has them and doesn't know how to fix them
[2024-02-19T19:17:21] Gabe Enzo: Ireland is like escooter city
[2024-02-19T19:17:39] Gabe Enzo: it's federally illegal but the cops literally can't take them all. We won.
[2024-02-19T19:24:50] Yamal: https://youtu.be/PBndrRUgVr0?si=Ix5qCFSLJb-KlZRW
[2024-02-19T19:25:09] Yamal: Arraiving, fire 🔥
[2024-02-19T19:25:13] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-02-19T19:35:32] haku: overture petg is suppose to be a good brand but it cant keep up with fast printing. too bad i really like the matte color of this petg.
[2024-02-19T19:41:33] Happy Giraffe: Settings are off
[2024-02-19T19:41:36] Gabe Enzo: my decade old PLA is printing at 150 and stable
[2024-02-19T19:42:32] Happy Giraffe: Maybe tomorrow will try to get the glass sheet working. Now PLA seems to hate my printer🙈
[2024-02-19T19:43:34] Happy Giraffe: If you do a thicker, wider layer at high speeds then hotend and nozzle cant keep up anymore
[2024-02-19T19:43:54] Happy Giraffe: Theres those cubic millimeter guide values (mm3)
[2024-02-19T19:44:23] haku: the elegoo rapid petg $10-12 roll prints without speed change. it feels like its made for it
[2024-02-19T19:45:18] haku: maybe i had this open for 3 months haha.
[2024-02-19T19:45:27] Happy Giraffe: They have differences, if its good and cheap then you can just learn the properties of the material on that brand
[2024-02-19T19:51:42] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-02-19T19:51:52] Mirono escooters: Layer shifting goes brt
[2024-02-19T19:52:09] Gabe Enzo: idk when what's causing this
[2024-02-19T19:55:21] Happy Giraffe: Thanks for the suggestion btw, I will try it later. Seems they got same price in EU👍
[2024-02-19T19:56:46] Gabe Enzo: The nozzle also drags on the print in the middle of printing. I can hear it. weird tho cause the levelling is DEFINITELY correct
[2024-02-19T19:56:54] Gabe Enzo: I can physically hear it move on the walls
[2024-02-19T19:57:10] haku: what part is that for?
[2024-02-19T19:57:22] Gabe Enzo: 18.5mm spacer
[2024-02-19T20:03:48] Happy Giraffe: You use Cura?
[2024-02-19T20:04:38] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_13019@19-02-2024_20-04-38.jpg>
[2024-02-19T20:04:40] haku: what causes this the walls are perfect but the infill sucks
[2024-02-19T20:05:32] Happy Giraffe: See "preview" window on slicer. If I have to guess its just under-extrusion as a result of too much speed
[2024-02-19T20:05:34] Gabe Enzo: Dirty nozzle
[2024-02-19T20:06:41] haku: ill try with a different petg and see if it has similar results. i think this filament took a crap
[2024-02-19T20:07:04] Gabe Enzo: Clean the nozzle anyways, should be a thing you should be doing regularly regardless
[2024-02-19T20:07:09] Gabe Enzo: Also
[2024-02-19T20:07:14] Gabe Enzo: Remove it when it's hot
[2024-02-19T20:07:22] haku: never done that.
[2024-02-19T20:07:25] Gabe Enzo: And yes I tried taking it off when cold. LOL
[2024-02-19T20:07:31] Gabe Enzo: almost destroyed the entire machine
[2024-02-19T20:45:21] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom the nozzle is still scratching the print
[2024-02-19T20:45:29] Gabe Enzo: makes no sense physically
[2024-02-19T20:48:35] Gabe Enzo: btw my printer was literally making pyramids in the print instead of triangles
[2024-02-19T20:48:37] Gabe Enzo: so weird lol
[2024-02-19T20:49:00] Gabe Enzo: some new 3d slice with cura I suppose.
[2024-02-19T21:07:40] Mirono escooters: Simple infill pattern
[2024-02-19T21:09:40] haku: yep its the filament.
[2024-02-19T21:15:30] Gabe Enzo: Was indeed a slicer error. expected better from cura
[2024-02-19T21:16:03] Gabe Enzo: I thought my siblings bumped into the printer. they've done that before
[2024-02-19T21:26:43] Mirono escooters: U sure?
[2024-02-19T21:26:49] Mirono escooters: No slicer is making layer shifts
[2024-02-19T21:26:55] Mirono escooters: Some other factors did
[2024-02-19T21:28:25] haku: we hit it today boys 225kg.
[2024-02-19T21:30:02] Yamal: Hello, in the vesc tool clock that does not show the motor phase discharge A, would it be the A of one motor or of the 2 motors?
[2024-02-19T21:31:55] Gabe Enzo: the layer didn't shift on the other side
[2024-02-19T21:32:09] Gabe Enzo: it happened twice in the exact same spot
[2024-02-19T21:34:12] Mirono escooters: Ok didn't see that
[2024-02-19T21:34:24] Mirono escooters: Barefoot is mad
[2024-02-19T21:34:41] Mirono escooters: Altough I know you'd have to be super clumsy I'd still wear reinforced shoes
[2024-02-19T21:35:48] haku: i like it better actually. i use to wear wrestling shoes for DL.
[2024-02-19T21:36:08] Mirono escooters: Build different
[2024-02-19T21:36:33] haku: i know if i wear crocs i can still squeeze 10kgs haha
[2024-02-19T21:36:59] Gabe Enzo: other than slicing issues there's been no problems with the prints. I might even keep it running overnight.
[2024-02-19T21:37:13] Gabe Enzo: No warp issued with the brim either
[2024-02-19T21:38:08] Mirono escooters: My printers are constantly working overnight
[2024-02-19T21:38:18] Mirono escooters: We are at day 5
[2024-02-19T21:38:28] Mirono escooters: Incredible that it doesn't need to rehome once
[2024-02-19T21:39:20] Gabe Enzo: wtf are those
[2024-02-19T21:40:00] Mirono escooters: Hornet traps
[2024-02-19T21:40:15] Mirono escooters: I swear I could tell ppl its buttplugs and it would work out
[2024-02-19T21:43:55] Gabe Enzo: wait actually?
[2024-02-19T21:44:05] Mirono escooters: Dead serious
[2024-02-19T21:44:15] Gabe Enzo: how does it work
[2024-02-19T22:01:34] haku: that printer can print non stop without supervision? like a conveyor belt?
[2024-02-19T22:03:17] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-02-19T22:04:01] haku: thats pretty cool.
[2024-02-19T22:07:05] Mirono escooters: Yep, just change filament
[2024-02-19T22:07:13] Happy Giraffe: Always barefoot🔥
[2024-02-19T22:07:14] Mirono escooters: And if there's not a big oepsie, I don't monitor it
[2024-02-19T22:07:31] Mirono escooters: I just empty the traps twice a day 😅
[2024-02-19T22:07:53] Mirono escooters: I'm still impressed with it, it's a beast
[2024-02-19T22:08:35] haku: can print super long stuff. very cool
[2024-02-19T22:08:50] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom tell Ikea to hurry with my meatballs and mirror glass so I can print more complex shapes
[2024-02-19T22:09:07] Happy Giraffe: Köttbullar
[2024-02-19T22:09:57] Happy Giraffe: If mail was faster, you could send me some kanelsnegl
[2024-02-19T22:11:37] Happy Giraffe: Surströmming , Kalles sandwich paste
[2024-02-19T22:12:09] Happy Giraffe: And the blueberry tea😡
[2024-02-19T22:13:15] Happy Giraffe: Surströmming scooter = antitheft
[2024-02-19T22:15:35] Finn: Shesh
[2024-02-19T22:15:58] Finn: One way
[2024-02-19T22:18:57] Mirono escooters: Made a few swords
[2024-02-19T22:19:40] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2024-02-19T22:20:03] Mirono escooters: Mostly batts tho And this I'm boring
[2024-02-19T22:20:11] haku: thats cool dude
[2024-02-19T22:20:32] Mirono escooters: Yeah it's cool stuff. Imagination stops you
[2024-02-19T22:20:36] Mirono escooters: Oh and a boat or 2
[2024-02-19T22:20:37] Mirono escooters: Wait
[2024-02-19T22:20:56] Yamal: Thanks👍
[2024-02-19T22:21:23] haku: thats master sword yea?

[2024-02-19T22:21:52] Mirono escooters: No, from that Nintendo game

[2024-02-19T22:22:43] Mirono escooters: Ive uh, got something for boats 6 days of printing..
[2024-02-19T22:22:50] haku: crazy
[2024-02-19T22:22:51] Mirono escooters: Not a Zelda nerd, mb
[2024-02-19T22:23:14] Mirono escooters: This thing is btw very realistic, but shit stable😅 Good for decoration..
[2024-02-19T22:23:51] Mirono escooters: Oh and the motors suck Well that was my Ted talk
[2024-02-19T22:24:28] Mirono escooters: You can snatch these for like, 400 bucks sometimes Can only recommend, but for fun. And headaches Do need some mods but good build quality
[2024-02-19T22:30:20] cihan: I'm searching for front brakes for Ninebot f2 pro. Do you mean Shimano sold on AliExpress is fake?
[2024-02-19T22:32:47] cihan: Will it be enough if I leave everything else as before and just change the brake caliper and maybe add a spacer if necessary. I already have Shimano disc brake adapter for 160 to 180mm disc. So I can even change the disc with a wider one if I can find.
[2024-02-19T22:35:56] cihan: Is this still a good choice for Ninebot f2 pro? How can I know if there's enough tire clearance to install the new caliper?
[2024-02-19T22:36:57] haku: no idea. i cant recommend it because havent tried it myself
[2024-02-19T22:37:34] haku: i have it though i just need to figure out how to move the brakes to the left
[2024-02-19T22:49:28] cihan: Thanks. Do you have an idea of there is such hydraulic caliper which works by just wire but hydraulic oil is added on the caliper? So I can install just caliper and add oil and won't have to change wires and lever?
[2024-02-19T22:51:24] sombre_enfant: Better buy dual side nutt caliper,
[2024-02-19T23:00:27] Кирилл: Depends on CAN statuses
[2024-02-19T23:00:34] Happy Giraffe: There are TRP made ones but they cost same as Magura MT7
[2024-02-19T23:00:47] cihan: Thanks, I'll see them. My max speed is 32, so maybe I don't need very strong brakes however sometimes I want to brake hard when I notice a hole on the road too late when riding at night.
[2024-02-19T23:02:33] cihan: Thank you, I can better step up to Magura level if I need to pay same amount. I read only good things about Magura when I was reading bicycle tour logs.
[2024-02-19T23:04:43] haku: i figured out what caused this. user error i printed it with my transparent .08 extra fine preset. 😭
[2024-02-19T23:07:25] Happy Giraffe: If you change magura mineral oil to trickstuff mineral oil then its good
[2024-02-19T23:14:14] Yamal: I have 230A motor phase in front and 230A in rear, sometimes it gives me the feeling when I see the download in vesc tool that is little
[2024-02-19T23:50:40] Happy Giraffe: "bad material"😂🔥
[2024-02-20T00:02:31] cihan: Thank you. I consider opinion of nutt caliper with dual side nutt caliper without hydraulic. I'll search some more options. I didn't dismantle the brake yet. If I go hydraulic option, will I need a brake lever with switch activation? I don't know what's inside the brake lever but it would be nice if I can use a usual Shimano set and still activate the brake.
[2024-02-20T01:02:12] haku: wtf i snaped my file trying to destroy my print. the print did not even break wow.
[2024-02-20T01:02:47] haku: no way
[2024-02-20T01:03:23] haku: both my files trying to pry it out

[2024-02-20T07:59:34] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, would need to add filler or grind it even for cooling🤔
[2024-02-20T07:59:50] Konstantin: Like vesc6
[2024-02-20T08:00:06] Konstantin: Spin motor and it turned on.
[2024-02-20T08:00:15] Konstantin: Shutdown time works too
[2024-02-20T08:00:40] Happy Giraffe: Hahaha
[2024-02-20T08:00:41] Konstantin: 2sec time to turn on/off
[2024-02-20T08:01:32] Konstantin: See video on YouTube xD
[2024-02-20T08:02:03] Yamal: Morning ⚡️
[2024-02-20T08:29:06] cihan: Thanks. I'll check. Do you use regen with throttle to adjust the regen strength?
[2024-02-20T08:29:42] Happy Giraffe: Yes, it a throttle that works just opposite
[2024-02-20T08:30:05] Happy Giraffe: Best feature saving brake discs/pads and not heating up brakes
[2024-02-20T08:31:16] cihan: Dual motor brake should be really strong
[2024-02-20T08:33:04] haku: its cool old sample print.
[2024-02-20T09:14:39] Happy Giraffe: Depends on esc and batt ability to take in regen but yes dual regen good
[2024-02-20T10:38:11] Gabe Enzo: 4x or more with dual definitely
[2024-02-20T11:30:34] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_13033@20-02-2024_11-30-34.jpg>
[2024-02-20T11:30:56] Happy Giraffe: First TIG stainless practicing, getting colors slowly😁
[2024-02-20T11:55:27] Mirono escooters: shapes and colors
[2024-02-20T11:56:53] Finn: Nice
[2024-02-20T11:59:51] haku: very nice!
[2024-02-20T12:10:17] Gabe Enzo: Who has a g30 frame?
[2024-02-20T12:10:17] Gabe Enzo: that they don't need.
[2024-02-20T12:10:32] Gabe Enzo: and how much for it
[2024-02-20T12:22:41] Konstantin: Y need normal closed button. All magic and math only if you disconnect adc15 and gnd
[2024-02-20T12:22:59] Konstantin: It's on Russian, but I show it on YouTube
[2024-02-20T12:23:47] Konstantin: But if laptop connect, and set 10set, it didn't turn off. 1min+ idle without USB connected works good
[2024-02-20T12:24:08] Konstantin: https://youtu.be/RLEeiApRMMw?si=nSuuECzZ9j9NreBw
[2024-02-20T12:24:47] Konstantin: It's on my fw, bug stock will work too
[2024-02-20T12:26:01] cihan: What's the liquid you're pouring on it?
[2024-02-20T12:27:13] cihan: It costs 140 € :)
[2024-02-20T12:38:57] Tommy ª: idk, and its not me
[2024-02-20T12:39:09] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-02-20T12:44:24] cihan: Doesn't Nutt have an official website? I couldn't find it.
[2024-02-20T12:49:22] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_13034@20-02-2024_12-49-22.jpg>
[2024-02-20T12:49:29] Mirono escooters: Mechanical brake force setting? 😅
[2024-02-20T12:53:44] Finn: Where could i buy such a adapter?
[2024-02-20T13:00:45] Mirono escooters: Hire me for 2 redbulls to properly translate it
[2024-02-20T13:00:48] Mirono escooters: Heck, chatgpt could
[2024-02-20T13:00:52] Mirono escooters: New spintend
[2024-02-20T13:01:12] Mirono escooters: Cool it got spiny plug play But why throttle scale setting??
[2024-02-20T13:27:11] Konstantin: Can you adjust mode? Or it's all factory presets...
[2024-02-20T13:28:15] Konstantin: Disclaimer, test on fw 6.92, but flipsky l/m/h shitty display set current scale 60%...
[2024-02-20T13:28:20] Konstantin: Hahaha
[2024-02-20T13:40:03] Happy Giraffe: Yup
[2024-02-20T13:40:37] Happy Giraffe: Slowly getting there
[2024-02-20T13:48:40] Happy Giraffe: So @francois_schempers part with weld like this costs 2€/10cm of welded seam😂 (extra)
[2024-02-20T14:39:57] francois schempers: ahah fine x)
[2024-02-20T14:44:48] Happy Giraffe: This is no additional charge (google image)😂
[2024-02-20T14:49:58] francois schempers: 😂😂😂
[2024-02-20T14:57:19] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/1dk6p_UgvDo?si=LSHc4pdyQi8zNw_p
[2024-02-20T15:23:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: 700usd where? In Portugal is 1300€
[2024-02-20T15:23:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: The price is nice for laotie I have one my self but quality is a bit bad
[2024-02-20T15:44:57] Chris Culver: Laotie is shite
[2024-02-20T15:46:36] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2024-02-20T15:53:06] Mirono escooters: And how much more plastic?
[2024-02-20T15:53:58] Mirono escooters: Bang for buck good
[2024-02-20T15:59:12] Chris Culver: Where do I set up Regen? Is it "current" only or "current no reverse" with center throttle? I have no idea
[2024-02-20T16:03:19] Mirono escooters: Current no reverse brake adc2
[2024-02-20T16:10:41] francois schempers: you use more materials, a fair comparison would be against the same weight not against the same thikness
[2024-02-20T16:11:18] Mirono escooters: Yep, way more material xD
[2024-02-20T16:11:37] Mirono escooters: I mean, bending sheet metal for rigidity isn't new, like roofs, but you obv shorten it quite a bit
[2024-02-20T16:15:50] Happy Giraffe: Depends on how you count it, tight bends lenghten it😂 depends on thickness too
[2024-02-20T16:46:12] Mike: <voice_message>
[2024-02-20T16:58:53] puneDir: Hell yeah
[2024-02-20T17:01:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe halfway or something like that😁 dont make ppl old
[2024-02-20T17:02:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bus from pocket?
[2024-02-20T17:08:03] Rose: Hey there Antonio, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-20T17:13:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not to bring up things but you say A grade here and B grade is on pics While once i see 50e than box says 50s While nkon tells that S is rated 35a Other places tell 25A only Not totaly sure , why is this mixture🤷‍♂ Anyway 50e is low amp cell whats good for low speed builds,what has low amp needs 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-20T17:20:18] yoann tsobanoglou: I was talking about Samsung 50e produced in Korea used by weped, the picture was just to prove that nkon sells b grade cells because someone said I was lying. 50e is used in many hyper scooters so can I disagree with your statement?
[2024-02-20T17:23:26] Happy Giraffe: You are free to disagree👍
[2024-02-20T17:26:29] Mirono escooters: "someone said I was lying" No bro, you made it from that
[2024-02-20T17:27:57] Mirono escooters: But time to move on from cell chat
[2024-02-20T17:32:50] Mike: Haha. Yes, my phone seems to be doing what it wants again. That was on the bus
[2024-02-20T17:34:55] haku: well if your gonna build a scooter anyway buy the cheapest one
[2024-02-20T17:37:36] haku: what adc adapter is this?
[2024-02-20T17:38:09] Mirono escooters: Spintend v3
[2024-02-20T17:38:25] haku: cool
[2024-02-20T17:38:53] haku: what connectors is it
[2024-02-20T17:38:57] haku: i need it
[2024-02-20T17:39:03] Mirono escooters: Ships w it
[2024-02-20T17:43:06] haku: this is exactly how they shouldve made it. i hade to make custom jst connectors for mine
[2024-02-20T17:43:47] Mirono escooters: Yes, screw terminals were dumb. Sry to say
[2024-02-20T17:43:55] Mirono escooters: Spintend needing 3 tries to make it well
[2024-02-20T17:46:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: Don't agree
[2024-02-20T17:46:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: If you are building u are not using the stock battery so doesn't matter battery size
[2024-02-20T17:47:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: What's matter most in opinion is the chassis quality
[2024-02-20T17:47:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: Only 3?
[2024-02-20T17:47:25] yoann tsobanoglou: You said I was spewing misinformation! Own up to your words! Specially as an administrator, you should be more conservative on your phrasing. I have moved on.
[2024-02-20T17:47:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: I had one of version 2 but never used
[2024-02-20T17:47:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: To big for xiaomi
[2024-02-20T17:49:31] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2024-02-20T17:49:58] yoann tsobanoglou: The only use with their older versions is to desolder the green holders and solder connectors
[2024-02-20T17:50:00] haku: im my eyes all scooters have the same china parts. up to the builder to get better china parts 😘
[2024-02-20T17:50:52] haku: this is what i did too
[2024-02-20T17:51:55] haku: <photos/photo_13038@20-02-2024_17-51-55.jpg>
[2024-02-20T17:54:22] yoann tsobanoglou: I wish they had at least included brake lights on the vesc. Like they did on some other versions
[2024-02-20T17:57:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: That seams like a product you can sell with closed box very nice
[2024-02-20T17:58:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: Not rly laotie uses generic chasis parts not rly designed to work together
[2024-02-20T17:58:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is like a puzzle
[2024-02-20T17:58:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: Dualtron and other do parts for them selfs
[2024-02-20T17:59:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: They also broke but is mutch harder in my experience
[2024-02-20T17:59:18] haku: generic parts means disposable parts. if you crash it buy another.
[2024-02-20T17:59:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: Xiaomi scooter ninebot scooter vsett dualtron
[2024-02-20T17:59:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: Are build diferent
[2024-02-20T17:59:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: The other u have spares also
[2024-02-20T17:59:58] haku: laotie laotie aliexpress. is the best.
[2024-02-20T18:00:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: It is expensive
[2024-02-20T18:00:34] haku: i have vsett. and its shite
[2024-02-20T18:00:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_13039@20-02-2024_18-00-54.jpg>
[2024-02-20T18:01:13] haku: thats the worse frame
[2024-02-20T18:01:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: Like I said I have laotie
[2024-02-20T18:01:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ok
[2024-02-20T18:01:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: So the one you have is the good my friend
[2024-02-20T18:01:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Sorry
[2024-02-20T18:02:47] haku: this laotie frame i crashed and it never snapped

[2024-02-20T18:03:13] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have it all My friend
[2024-02-20T18:03:30] haku: my friend just fix the lights
[2024-02-20T18:04:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: They all have less quality then the other scooters I told u
[2024-02-20T18:05:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: If u like nice
[2024-02-20T18:05:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: If is better thing in the world for you nice
[2024-02-20T18:05:24] haku: i love it. laotie for life
[2024-02-20T18:06:12] haku: brand loyalty is a bish
[2024-02-20T18:06:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 50e is a low amp cell as i said before ,usage in hyper scooters would need super big P number,to not keep them in stress. Even 10p under 100A Tbh I would never use that cell in my builds , doesnt suit them at all. And my opinion on usage of does cells in hyper scooters is ..... Nonsense, even the idea is bad
[2024-02-20T18:07:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: Dependes
[2024-02-20T18:07:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Some people want hyper scooters just to say they have a hyper scooter
[2024-02-20T18:07:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: 😂 😂
[2024-02-20T18:09:50] haku: in the US hyper scooters un heard off. only ebikes and surrons show out here.
[2024-02-20T18:09:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True
[2024-02-20T18:16:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think hyper scooter word is hard to define for now , i dont see such All i see is some companies fighting to get better ,some just produces without improving just cheap, lot problems exists coz all scooters are wearing the childshoes. Years later they might do something damn good and what we will name it ? Hyper ultra super scooter fighter pro 500 special edition🤣
[2024-02-20T18:20:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But yeah we need names and advertisement and bla bla just sound or look cool ,but after some time ppl who has an eye for it renames things🤷‍♂ in my language, we use different word for clone bodies ,mostly all means shit in a way Like aovo Sad when one word suits a lot and word is ... Shit 😅🙈
[2024-02-20T18:29:00] Mirono escooters: Sry, ocd stuff
[2024-02-20T19:17:24] yoann tsobanoglou: You probably know better than weped.
[2024-02-20T19:22:11] Mirono escooters: Are you really commenting on everyone? Guy wasn't even attacking weped
[2024-02-20T19:22:21] Mirono escooters: Mostly rion people buy it with 0 knowledge
[2024-02-20T19:22:35] Mirono escooters: Rion
[2024-02-20T19:23:14] Mirono escooters: Just look out for the forks Wasn't it this one with the video where you could break it by slapping on ground
[2024-02-20T19:27:37] francois schempers: I'm gonna run mine at 12k, I'll tell you once I tested it what thermal I get
[2024-02-20T19:28:48] haku: ive never seen one lol
[2024-02-20T19:30:49] Mirono escooters: Me neither
[2024-02-20T19:31:46] sombre_enfant: Did u try your scoot yet ?
[2024-02-20T19:31:59] haku: rion is a myth.
[2024-02-20T19:32:14] Mirono escooters: 😅
[2024-02-20T19:32:46] francois schempers: I'm waiting on @Mirono_escooters for the battery and @Happy_Giraffe for custom machined piece, shouldn't be too long now
[2024-02-20T19:33:05] Mirono escooters: 😳
[2024-02-20T19:33:36] Rose: Hey there Сергей, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-20T19:37:36] Happy Giraffe: Took you 2 month to ship it, remember you are walking the whole summer without us😂
[2024-02-20T19:38:22] Gabe Enzo: SUCH GOOD PRINTS
[2024-02-20T19:38:27] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13043@20-02-2024_19-38-27.jpg>
[2024-02-20T19:38:29] francois schempers: never said it was your fault 😂
[2024-02-20T19:38:31] Happy Giraffe: I start it tomorrow but we have a weeks holiday😂
[2024-02-20T19:39:15] Happy Giraffe: You threatened me with a baguette. Btw lets go offtopic on these ones
[2024-02-20T19:40:14] Mirono escooters: : D
[2024-02-20T19:55:31] sombre_enfant: Omg battery from mirono
[2024-02-20T20:08:17] Gabe Enzo: Mirotery
[2024-02-20T20:29:07] Unknown: <video_file>
[2024-02-20T20:29:09] Unknown: Does someone has a better idea of how to attach those tubes ? (I do have a3d printed spacer maybe I'll use those thread thingis ?)
[2024-02-20T20:29:55] Gabe Enzo: If someone would make a 12-13s battery capable of like 300a then how fast would a scooter go?
[2024-02-20T20:30:21] Gabe Enzo: like 13/20 of the speed of 20s or?
[2024-02-20T20:31:24] Unknown: Showing u why the current attachment is not good too loose and can't tighten because I'll go through the tubes
[2024-02-20T20:33:50] Finn: Defined by the kv of the motor
[2024-02-20T20:34:10] Finn: You know 10s speed and 20s speed?
[2024-02-20T20:37:21] Happy Giraffe: If torque is not a limit and just voltage then it will be close to 13/20 but in real world mr. Wind and air resistance says hello
[2024-02-20T20:45:30] Gabe Enzo: 35 and 70 for the 300w motor.
[2024-02-20T20:45:54] Gabe Enzo: low voltage makes no sense then in reality
[2024-02-20T20:46:09] Gabe Enzo: 16s is kinda the lowest of highest
[2024-02-20T21:25:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,they are surly not on size🤔🤔 If you are good at editing maybe you could solve this You printed does? Are they on right size or made for something else I am thinking but i am Unsure even over multiply procces u can Correct that , What if you go and cut it with meshmixer, make join point bigger and holding point smaller, Rejoin the two and fix errors🤔 That's not to hard to try and Yt helps in usage and you only use a few tools🤔
[2024-02-20T21:34:04] Happy Giraffe: Yes and no, 10-13s sweetspot for usual motors at 20-35kmh
[2024-02-20T21:34:58] Unknown: No they came as a kit with the LEDs that obviously not for this application I think I'll get smaller bolts to make it tighter
[2024-02-20T21:35:27] Unknown: Smaller in length
[2024-02-20T21:39:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, you see from closer ,hope they help ,same time try to complian about it , unsure where you bought it ,on ali i would surly do it ,with pay me back an amount and i keep the stuff, if you present your videos amd ask fair compensation than should work
[2024-02-20T21:43:04] Unknown: It supposed to be bolted the opposite way
[2024-02-20T21:43:22] Unknown: And to a wal or som alse not scoot
[2024-02-20T21:43:43] Unknown: This can help but need to be very thin
[2024-02-20T21:43:43] Unknown: <photos/photo_13045@20-02-2024_21-43-43.jpg>
[2024-02-20T21:50:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I ment this part also to be modified in the drawing,but since you got them
[2024-02-20T22:20:19] haku: does petg have fancy colors like this?
[2024-02-20T23:15:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes it should
[2024-02-20T23:20:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13047@20-02-2024_23-20-54.jpg>
[2024-02-20T23:21:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But much more exists in pla
[2024-02-20T23:21:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But basically anything is possible in petg also
[2024-02-21T00:45:04] Happy Giraffe: Order some and then I buy from you😁
[2024-02-21T00:46:18] Happy Giraffe: Tho the "Vesc" logo will straight up tell police what components you have. Would need to grind that off. Then of course the startup animation filled with vesc logos etc so might be too risky to use😅
[2024-02-21T00:56:24] Happy Giraffe: Two keys a solution, one fires up vesc. One fires up vesc and screen😂 If that can be done
[2024-02-21T01:09:46] haku: would this display work with any vesc or trampa only?
[2024-02-21T01:16:48] haku: finally a legit display thats modern looking
[2024-02-21T01:20:16] haku: ima keep it real. not modern looking but its a display
[2024-02-21T01:21:43] Happy Giraffe: I got a switch on my throttle now haha. Im scared to wire it to vesc for now that the other one took probs water dmg. If throttle stops working I just cut cables and tie together😂
[2024-02-21T02:11:08] heimdler: I am undecided over MTB or Road fullface helmet. I'd be riding on roads all the time. Can someone share their recommendation on which type is preferred?
[2024-02-21T04:42:57] haku: @jamessoderstrom for vsett 9+ motors how much amps can it handle?
[2024-02-21T04:48:30] haku: 60v vsett 9 would be cool. battery space limits it
[2024-02-21T05:00:35] haku: once i hit a small pinecone going 30mph. it almost ended me. the tiny wheels not made for street riding
[2024-02-21T05:03:02] haku: i think for track racing vsett 9 would be ideal light weighy scooter
[2024-02-21T06:02:02] haku: first time ive seen my printer print poop wtf

[2024-02-21T11:21:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fullface what has ece rating and not dot
[2024-02-21T11:25:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you never had one ,it might be strange as it holds your head , What is important, it should never make pressure at temple area on your head.
[2024-02-21T11:32:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There are open and closed ones , depends on situation what is better , I always use an open type, but on mine all open areas has a net to block bugs. Also all time i wear a balaclava under it ,in cold times for that and when hot its more like small tight hat to avoid sweating in the helmet , (that's why you wear such under fullcaps also) Mine and probably several others has mips feature in the helmet ,whats is kinda helmet in helmet thing, if you take a hit it reduces concussion.
[2024-02-21T11:36:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i would recommend a good helmet near greater speeds , it's kinda like..... You only have one head And yeah you can be the best driver who never fails ,but in the road there are others who might .
[2024-02-21T11:37:36] Gabe Enzo: I say full face is a necessity
[2024-02-21T11:37:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ooooo and for what reason, fucked up or ?
[2024-02-21T11:38:39] Gabe Enzo: MTB helmet isn't designed for high speed crashes, only crashes with the other entity (eg a boulder) being at standstill. You will die
[2024-02-21T11:39:37] Gabe Enzo: I use an MTB helmet rn but I have nothing else and I only drive at about 25kmh so I take the gamble.
[2024-02-21T11:39:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Interesting, would be nice to see more
[2024-02-21T11:40:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way , I agree
[2024-02-21T11:42:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,my doc mate would say , atleast soft parts have some protection, coz that's how bike type made
[2024-02-21T11:43:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have funfact near all ,i have two mates like this , wearing helmets never ever had problem or accident on the road ,but both of them managed face and head injury at home🙈
[2024-02-21T12:29:44] Gabe Enzo: anyone know why some circles have less mass then others?
[2024-02-21T12:30:19] Gabe Enzo: it does the same for the brim

[2024-02-21T13:20:36] Gabe Enzo: I'll skip a class to keep an eye on it. Tomorrow I gotta start coming in full time tho. such a drag
[2024-02-21T13:22:24] Mirono escooters: Ain't worth it

[2024-02-21T13:33:32] haku: messed up print. lol
[2024-02-21T14:20:45] heimdler: Ah so I should get a fullface helmet for road then
[2024-02-21T14:21:24] heimdler: Thanks for the great input, there's several road helmet design. Of course there's the typical one, and there's the retro type
[2024-02-21T14:24:19] heimdler: <photos/photo_13051@21-02-2024_14-24-19.jpg>
[2024-02-21T14:24:48] heimdler: This said it's DOT+CCC certified whatever CCC means

[2024-02-21T14:45:48] Jan: Look in chatgpt for mosr important bike helmet crash standards
[2024-02-21T14:46:08] Jan: And google which one do fullfill. I could write any made up certifications on a helmet
[2024-02-21T14:46:36] Jan: ABC-certified, XYZ-Approved says and means absolutely nothing
[2024-02-21T14:52:13] Gabe Enzo: can't be, it's glass and levelled? I suppose it's old maybe it needs a deep clean
[2024-02-21T14:52:20] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2024-02-21T14:53:35] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): China Compulsory Certification CE but internal
[2024-02-21T15:13:48] Happy Giraffe: Then measure distance from X axis metal rail block to bed
[2024-02-21T15:14:34] Happy Giraffe: Left and right side must be very close. Measuring all straight etc is hard so take your time. Steel ruler best for this. Caliper bit hard to use but if you have digital one go for it
[2024-02-21T15:56:40] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): need ideas for a quality, compact BMS that can do 60A continuous and optionally has a way to read out voltages via wifi or bt or usb. 15s4p Cells are Samsung INR21700 50s and i wanna fit the BMS into a G30 that has two controllers in it so it needs to not take up too much space
[2024-02-21T15:57:32] Mirono escooters: Jbd 100a one, very small
[2024-02-21T16:05:47] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): sounds good I am able to find the 14s variant of it but i only see the 15s variant for lifepo, however cells are regular ones, do you happen to have a link? thanks a lot
[2024-02-21T16:14:26] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): is it that one? https://jiabaidabms.com/products/jbd-smart-bms-4-22s-8s-17s-20s-21s-100a-wireless-with-uart-rs485-board-for-lifepo4-battery-li-ion

[2024-02-21T19:25:01] Gabe Enzo: HAHAHA this little shit blows holes through copper @Bradhaku @jamessoderstrom
[2024-02-21T19:26:47] Gabe Enzo: seems it blows holes through the copper and can't get a weld nvm it works
[2024-02-21T19:43:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-21T19:43:50] haku: show a pull test
[2024-02-21T19:44:11] Gabe Enzo: It's weak. Im trying to find out why. perhaps because I'm using old dirty cells
[2024-02-21T19:44:15] Gabe Enzo: am I supposed to use flux?
[2024-02-21T19:44:37] haku: no flux
[2024-02-21T19:44:37] Gabe Enzo: Plug resistance issue
[2024-02-21T19:44:53] haku: just weld nickel over copper
[2024-02-21T19:44:59] Gabe Enzo: Seems to be blowing holes in copper but weak welds
[2024-02-21T19:45:04] Gabe Enzo: You mean copper first?
[2024-02-21T19:45:08] Gabe Enzo: or nickel on the cell first
[2024-02-21T19:45:18] Gabe Enzo: shouldn't it be fine for pure copper?
[2024-02-21T19:45:25] haku: no lol
[2024-02-21T19:45:30] Gabe Enzo: I just exploded a cell
[2024-02-21T19:45:50] Gabe Enzo: so nickel first
[2024-02-21T19:45:54] Gabe Enzo: ?
[2024-02-21T19:45:57] haku: its not gonna hold properly. ive tried that. use copper + nickel
[2024-02-21T19:46:12] Gabe Enzo: which one first on the cell first
[2024-02-21T19:46:39] haku: copper first then nickel ontop
[2024-02-21T19:46:58] Gabe Enzo: wouldn't the issue still persist. Nevermind I'll try then talk
[2024-02-21T19:47:21] haku: yep. play around with it
[2024-02-21T19:48:26] haku: when you do a pull test it should rip the copper and nickel and the welds are intact
[2024-02-21T19:49:08] haku: battery lords taught me this
[2024-02-21T19:49:29] Gabe Enzo: copper won't even stick in order to weld nickel on top.
[2024-02-21T19:49:43] Gabe Enzo: I'll play around with the power
[2024-02-21T19:52:24] Gabe Enzo: Too weak, I speculate the cell is too used up
[2024-02-21T19:53:03] Gabe Enzo: ironically the nickel stayed
[2024-02-21T19:54:40] haku: yea thats a bit weak. play around with it. took me a few months to get it right haha
[2024-02-21T19:59:16] haku: what size nickel and copper? .1?
[2024-02-21T20:03:40] haku: it should rip like this
[2024-02-21T20:04:48] Gabe Enzo: only time it welds property is when it sparks like shit
[2024-02-21T20:05:02] Gabe Enzo: I could be pushing too hard
[2024-02-21T20:05:12] Gabe Enzo: I have to close my eyes before I press the button
[2024-02-21T20:05:33] haku: no thats normal if you using nickel plated
[2024-02-21T20:05:42] Gabe Enzo: it's 99% so it's inpure

[2024-02-21T20:30:13] haku: with our glitter welders you have to get it right. too strong you will blow holes on the batteries too weak and it wont stick.
[2024-02-21T20:34:12] Gabe Enzo: getting there
[2024-02-21T20:34:17] Gabe Enzo: I'm having trouble with copper at 60-99
[2024-02-21T20:35:16] Gabe Enzo: oh ummmm lower power actually makes better welds. what?
[2024-02-21T20:35:56] haku: you put nickel yea?

[2024-02-21T20:38:57] sombre_enfant: What power ?
[2024-02-21T20:39:02] Gabe Enzo: I needed 60-70 for the copper

[2024-02-21T20:40:49] sombre_enfant: Weird i weld with way more less..
[2024-02-21T20:40:57] sombre_enfant: U use pure copper ?

[2024-02-21T21:48:49] Gabe Enzo: the name has a ring to it lmao
[2024-02-21T21:48:50] Gabe Enzo: eheli
[2024-02-21T21:48:54] haku: i dont know what in the ching chong his saying but hes charging at 60a
[2024-02-21T21:53:40] Chris Culver: What wire from the spiny2 connects to adc2 for Regen?
[2024-02-21T21:54:16] Mirono escooters: Incredible
[2024-02-21T21:54:20] Mirono escooters: Cool display
[2024-02-21T21:54:21] Chris Culver: Omg that charging...*drool*
[2024-02-21T21:54:31] Mirono escooters: And funny Chinese guy on it Bluetooth icon?
[2024-02-21T21:54:54] Mirono escooters: We got Bluetooth chargers before gta6
[2024-02-21T21:56:52] haku: crazy that this stuff is all available on china websites. cant even order it because for china only market
[2024-02-21T22:03:38] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2024-02-21T22:03:50] Mirono escooters: I'm happy with my 0-120v 0-7a adjustable
[2024-02-21T22:03:57] Mirono escooters: Tis big, but good and one for all
[2024-02-21T22:10:05] Chris Culver: Yeah that's hot
[2024-02-21T22:13:18] Mirono escooters: You redid motor setup?
[2024-02-21T22:39:32] Santiago: Hello guys, don't want to spam here but just to remind you I still have my Ubox 100v 100a V2 available for 240€. Thanks everyone.
[2024-02-21T22:50:33] sombre_enfant: Wow 50A charger
[2024-02-21T22:53:05] sombre_enfant: Your g30 is single motor ? Wich battery motor ?
[2024-02-21T22:56:49] Jan: Is there a rulebook i can look up for the france race events? @SibClimb
[2024-02-21T22:57:33] sombre_enfant: Yeah need that also heard rumor folding pole is forbiden also, but i already fixed that
[2024-02-21T23:00:15] Mirono escooters: If you set the minimum values correctly
[2024-02-21T23:06:50] Chris Culver: That sounds fast
[2024-02-21T23:08:19] Chris Culver: You can fit that battery in a g30?
[2024-02-21T23:12:09] haku: why is xiaomi shit? whats wrong with it?
[2024-02-21T23:13:00] Tommy ª: 4 series and no ninebot anymore
[2024-02-21T23:13:00] haku: ive never seen a xiaomi scooter. so just curious
[2024-02-21T23:14:05] Tommy ª: from mi 3 lite and 4 models they abandoned ninebot and another brand makes the scooters these newer models are very shitty and unhackable and trashy, you can even loose the warranty trying to change the rear tire
[2024-02-21T23:14:23] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-02-21T23:14:44] haku: oh dang i did not know that
[2024-02-21T23:15:08] haku: i thought xiaomi are like little tanks like ninebot
[2024-02-21T23:16:21] Tommy ª: the pro2 and pro3 are unbeatable also some people have problems modding it bc cheaper models (like 1s, original m365 and essential) have a smaller frame, but the pro2 are the best of all
[2024-02-21T23:18:08] sombre_enfant: What is the max speed ? U use field weakening ?
[2024-02-21T23:20:43] Jan: 117kmh on 20s
[2024-02-21T23:21:06] Jan: Massive FW
[2024-02-21T23:21:20] Jan: Dual
[2024-02-21T23:21:28] Jan: Lol this is too small for single
[2024-02-21T23:21:40] Jan: Would blow up at those numbers
[2024-02-21T23:22:20] Gabe Enzo: Lol imagine losing the warranty on your new car because you changed the tire on it
[2024-02-21T23:22:25] Gabe Enzo: absolutely criminal
[2024-02-21T23:23:02] Chris Culver: What exactly is field weakening? Is there a pdf or video on it?
[2024-02-21T23:23:36] Gabe Enzo: We could write a novel but in essence all it does is makes motor go faster bcz it loosens the magnetic field
[2024-02-21T23:23:40] Face de Pin Sucé: timeforacing.org Then go to Championnats, Règlements
[2024-02-21T23:23:59] Gabe Enzo: and puts more Amps into it
[2024-02-21T23:24:00] Gabe Enzo: too
[2024-02-21T23:24:23] Chris Culver: Is it bad for the motor? Why would someone not do it?
[2024-02-21T23:24:25] Tommy ª: its pretty hard to get out the tire bc the fender support, the most rasonable way is unscrewing the rear fender but for that you need to remove the carpet and all the screws (it opens from upside) also with 2 more hands you can push the fender down enough to remove the supports but you have the risk of broken it
[2024-02-21T23:25:29] Gabe Enzo: Because having true power is better.
[2024-02-21T23:25:37] Gabe Enzo: makes it hot
[2024-02-21T23:25:55] haku: <photos/photo_13061@21-02-2024_23-25-55.jpg>
[2024-02-21T23:25:55] haku: this is how you guys lean on scooters jeez. unfortunately i wont be able to participate due to weight problems.
[2024-02-21T23:26:20] Tommy ª: same
[2024-02-21T23:26:23] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-02-21T23:26:27] haku: or its a photo taken right before crash
[2024-02-21T23:30:03] sombre_enfant: I talk about single
[2024-02-21T23:45:04] sombre_enfant: Any chance you got handlebar on off for vesc ?
[2024-02-21T23:45:47] sombre_enfant: Thats the only thing im missing i think, wonder how the flipsky guys did the year ago
[2024-02-21T23:48:15] Finn: I got 90kmh gps on single front blade
[2024-02-21T23:49:26] sombre_enfant: Alright i wonder how it goes with 60h 22x3
[2024-02-21T23:49:52] Finn: Should get you a little bit faster
[2024-02-21T23:50:02] Finn: 90kmh was with fw on
[2024-02-22T00:03:57] Jan: Ugh just read it
[2024-02-22T00:04:46] Jan: Tbh some requirement would need adaption
[2024-02-22T00:05:29] Jan: - Fixed folding mechanism G30 #002 - Rear red light G30 #001
[2024-02-22T00:05:32] Jan: But its minor
[2024-02-22T00:05:56] Jan: But driving 800-1000km per way, without having the racing license is the bigger issue
[2024-02-22T00:05:57] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jan has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-22T00:08:57] sombre_enfant: Need to be on handlebar, also. I dont have any light at all..
[2024-02-22T00:09:40] sombre_enfant: I understood from Julien its not needed u can pay by day
[2024-02-22T00:10:07] Rose: Jan has been approved in Vesc / Scooter group! They will now be ignored by automated admin actions like locks, blocklists, and antiflood.
[2024-02-22T00:10:40] Jan: Thanks
[2024-02-22T00:11:19] sombre_enfant: Use Google lens for auto translation
[2024-02-22T00:11:38] Chris Culver: You can put the power button on the handlebar. It's a standard size
[2024-02-22T00:12:06] Chris Culver: Btw can you turn on VESC with a latching switch?
[2024-02-22T00:12:36] Chris Culver: Ubox 2
[2024-02-22T00:12:41] sombre_enfant: It works with spintend ? If u have a link ? I would like button like original not key switch may aswell have link for both
[2024-02-22T00:12:57] Chris Culver: Use the original button
[2024-02-22T00:13:08] Chris Culver: Just lengthen the wires. Durrrrr
[2024-02-22T00:13:13] sombre_enfant: I need handlebar holder
[2024-02-22T00:13:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: If you want speed why go with 13s in first place?
[2024-02-22T00:13:36] Chris Culver: Ok search Amazon 22mm button handlebar
[2024-02-22T00:15:06] sombre_enfant: U tried it ? Only 55cm wire would need atleast 1m soldering look ugly ... All my Throttle wire and hose will be outside my pole...
[2024-02-22T00:15:28] Chris Culver: That's your own fault
[2024-02-22T00:15:55] NetworkDir: This buttons very nice and high quality
[2024-02-22T00:18:19] sombre_enfant: Aight lmk how it goes, lets see if u can teardown and solder inside longer and tinner wire
[2024-02-22T00:21:23] sombre_enfant: I quickly checked all are 50cm wire is too thicc anyway
[2024-02-22T00:23:06] sombre_enfant: 30awg 5 core should do the job
[2024-02-22T00:25:10] Happy Giraffe: Could come in handy when only charging to 90%
[2024-02-22T00:26:13] Happy Giraffe: I plan to do that to make 30,000km with next battery😁 now its struggling after 12-13,000
[2024-02-22T00:45:02] Gabe Enzo: You can achieve insane speeds with low voltage lol
[2024-02-22T00:45:14] Gabe Enzo: 13s high amp setup goes faster than any 20s low amp setup
[2024-02-22T00:45:49] Gabe Enzo: I know someone who gets 80kmh with 13s
[2024-02-22T00:51:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: And 80 is high speed?
[2024-02-22T00:51:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: If you torque low voltage u can put more parallels and that is mutch faster
[2024-02-22T00:52:58] Gabe Enzo: 80 is high speed for 13s yeah LOl
[2024-02-22T00:53:17] Gabe Enzo: I had to use 20s to get 70kmh with 40a
[2024-02-22T00:53:22] Gabe Enzo: that's a good comparison here
[2024-02-22T00:54:05] Gabe Enzo: either way more voltage is better anyway, I was just chatting. More efficient in power loss too.
[2024-02-22T01:08:10] Happy Giraffe: 35E king of the hill
[2024-02-22T01:15:24] haku: i cant understand what hes saying but is the el trott racing? https://youtu.be/5DBOvpthgD4?si=TehP1QNl6LPG6QHG
[2024-02-22T01:15:56] haku: how many tracks are there?
[2024-02-22T01:16:35] Tommy ª: i got 70 with 12s and 45a, seems legit
[2024-02-22T01:16:38] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-02-22T01:20:09] haku: also what is the ideal weight for drivers?
[2024-02-22T01:21:46] Tommy ª: i never seen a chonky one on races 💀
[2024-02-22T01:23:30] haku: maybe i need to start dieting and cutting weight like my wrestling days.
[2024-02-22T01:24:19] haku: no wonder no americans in there haha
[2024-02-22T01:26:09] Tommy ª: i remember these illegal motorbikes races when i out of school they always put the most skinny guy on top, i tried one of these races with a better bike but i failed horribly 😭
[2024-02-22T01:34:26] Gabe Enzo: @Bradhaku I drank some lean
[2024-02-22T01:34:28] Gabe Enzo: so faded
[2024-02-22T01:45:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: That depends a lot on the motors you have
[2024-02-22T01:45:44] haku: best time to weld batteries. lol
[2024-02-22T06:36:34] haku: @Mirono_escooters maybe this is a better way to deal with hornets/wasps. https://youtube.com/shorts/mLE69T2_ahk?si=JT38gcTJozqen_2r
[2024-02-22T07:02:34] Izuna 生活: No flat cap design again ;/
[2024-02-22T07:09:54] Face de Pin Sucé: I only use SmartDisplay with it's button x)
[2024-02-22T07:10:52] Face de Pin Sucé: What do you mean ?
[2024-02-22T07:13:03] Happy Giraffe: Yeah and a retarded heatsink design that wont cool against a scooter frame properly
[2024-02-22T07:14:33] sombre_enfant: Yeah we should ask for spécial order flat cap and no case
[2024-02-22T08:06:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Just open it and solder longer wire inside
[2024-02-22T08:44:10] sombre_enfant: Ye

[2024-02-22T11:33:33] Chris Culver: If someone could do the graphics, I could program the sickest display for VESC. Would make a lot of money for sure....
[2024-02-22T11:38:46] Tommy ª: Just make it flat C:
[2024-02-22T11:41:47] Mirono escooters: Graphics?
[2024-02-22T11:45:22] Gabe Enzo: why tf so cheap
[2024-02-22T11:46:26] Gabe Enzo: Motors don't care what voltage you put into them. You can run a 300w at 20s low amperage and it won't get hot.
[2024-02-22T11:48:30] Tommy ª: I remember when I tried a hard disks motor with vesc at 12s Stupidly funny
[2024-02-22T11:49:46] Tommy ª: Why not? HDD at 12s 😭
[2024-02-22T11:49:46] Tommy ª: <video_file>
[2024-02-22T11:51:39] Mirono escooters: BCS goodi
[2024-02-22T11:55:42] Konstantin: U not right
[2024-02-22T11:55:55] Konstantin: Hi speed can heat motor xD
[2024-02-22T11:59:46] Gabe Enzo: Really depends, 13s at 50a vs 20s at 15a has way more speed at less wattage
[2024-02-22T12:00:07] Gabe Enzo: Also it heats up less
[2024-02-22T12:00:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Everybody that wants to race in France or Europe, please join this group : https://t.me/+cOA2WbkGYzFjZTA8
[2024-02-22T12:00:44] Jan: High KV motor have lower internal resistance
[2024-02-22T12:00:54] Jan: But need more amps
[2024-02-22T12:01:18] sombre_enfant: Whatever use between 20-22s 60-75h and u good
[2024-02-22T12:07:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: Efficency of the motors varying with diferent voltage
[2024-02-22T12:08:43] Paolo ⁭: No because the energy are regulated by controller
[2024-02-22T12:09:33] Paolo ⁭: If u have 20s and u going 30kmh , motor receive 30v for example and not whole voltage
[2024-02-22T13:11:56] Gabe Enzo: I forgot how ac motors work 😭
[2024-02-22T13:11:59] Gabe Enzo: omg
[2024-02-22T13:47:28] Gabe Enzo: can you take it out of the heatsink?
[2024-02-22T13:47:36] Gabe Enzo: just bolt the FETs onto the metal?
[2024-02-22T13:59:35] Paolo ⁭: Ac or DC motor doesn't mate😂 the input voltage of the motor made the speed, not of the controller
[2024-02-22T14:03:25] puneDir: How to calculate nickels max amperage
[2024-02-22T14:33:41] Gabe Enzo: stack nickel and hope for the best
[2024-02-22T14:33:46] Gabe Enzo: 💩
[2024-02-22T14:34:59] Mirono escooters: With basic math

[2024-02-22T14:59:32] puneDir: Isnt it too much work for just 70a
[2024-02-22T14:59:44] puneDir: Theres 7 (i welded one more)
[2024-02-22T15:00:16] puneDir: I guess
[2024-02-22T15:00:29] puneDir: How
[2024-02-22T15:00:41] puneDir: Which one is better
[2024-02-22T15:02:45] puneDir: its gonna be hard but eh i will do it if needed
[2024-02-22T15:02:49] puneDir: I want this to be good

[2024-02-22T15:09:47] Jan: I recently stabbed myself with the hot 300W soldering iron
[2024-02-22T15:11:17] Happy Giraffe: Its not fun, I was tired and distracted when I heard hissing sound. It was metal body near irons tip burning flesh from my fingers😂
[2024-02-22T15:19:17] Gabe Enzo: i soldered when I drank lean once and didn't even realize I was burning holes in my hands
[2024-02-22T15:19:26] Gabe Enzo: Insane painkiller effects
[2024-02-22T15:42:21] Happy Giraffe: Soldering while having a debuff not optimal😂

[2024-02-22T16:27:10] puneDir: 70 max
[2024-02-22T16:27:40] puneDir: Now i have to connect bms
[2024-02-22T16:27:45] puneDir: (first time doing it)
[2024-02-22T16:33:14] Gabe Enzo: With that nickel you can probably do 200-250a
[2024-02-22T16:33:15] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-02-22T16:33:21] Gabe Enzo: You could've used 2 strips
[2024-02-22T16:33:30] Gabe Enzo: did you use 5 strips Orr? 4x 1mm nickel is exactly 0.98mm copper equivalent
[2024-02-22T17:11:17] Mirono escooters: 🧢

[2024-02-22T21:23:41] Mirono escooters: Well, price cheaper, but not worth it with random colors for me
[2024-02-22T21:32:19] puneDir: I need a lot of extender

[2024-02-22T22:12:15] Izuna 生活: Im currently on foot and I went getting myself kebab and my kebab man told me to take his scooter to get home today and I was like are you sure??? and yeah I did, he picked it up on the way home of a colleague and now drives home with the scoot.
[2024-02-22T22:12:58] Izuna 生活: still speechless, thats such a nice thing to do
[2024-02-22T22:13:26] Izuna 生活: i mean, i could have just walked but that was (much) quicker and I got to eat my kebab warm
[2024-02-22T22:13:27] Izuna 生活: xd
[2024-02-22T22:15:50] Izuna 生活: im currently experimenting on taking the bus, in the morning its good, but after school you end up having to walk home.
[2024-02-22T22:17:32] Izuna 生活: nothing can compete with flexibility with scooter and I need my damn PRO2 done, but no time since I gotta finish my tripple A game assignment on the weekend 😩
[2024-02-22T22:17:56] Izuna 生活: i mean my g30 is probably working and driving if I plug it back in, but still too much rain outside.
[2024-02-22T22:20:07] Izuna 生活: in 2 weeks im "done" with school anyway, no more flexing 100kmh on school parking lot going past other students. :/
[2024-02-22T22:20:15] Gabe Enzo: My pro 2 has no water issues at all xd and I live in Irelandm
[2024-02-22T22:20:21] Gabe Enzo: hahahahaha I love doing that
[2024-02-22T22:20:44] Gabe Enzo: "what's that?' something you don't have
[2024-02-22T22:30:10] Mirono escooters: Sometimes they are so chill
[2024-02-22T22:30:41] Mirono escooters: Yo that's a sick assignment
[2024-02-22T22:30:55] Mirono escooters: Goodi
[2024-02-22T22:31:31] Izuna 生活: Yes its pretty cool but could be hard to get it done until the deadline. xd
[2024-02-22T22:35:23] Mirono escooters: Show us when done
[2024-02-22T22:35:32] Izuna 生活: no no no
[2024-02-22T22:37:16] Mirono escooters: >:(
[2024-02-22T22:51:59] Mr.Mou: And is there any way I can remotely turn on/off this esc? Or just by adding Bluetooth or turning of the BMS?
[2024-02-22T23:01:25] Happy Giraffe: Putting a key lock in throttle😁 gotta make sure you are disconnecting the 5v
[2024-02-22T23:06:29] Mr.Mou: Ok 😁 thanks
[2024-02-22T23:23:55] Happy Giraffe: Yes😁 good enough haha
[2024-02-22T23:30:21] haku: what is the difference between kebab and shawarma?

[2024-02-22T23:59:08] Happy Giraffe: Wastes ton of material, doesnt matter tho if you recycle pla
[2024-02-23T00:00:05] Mirono escooters: Oh that sticker pack
[2024-02-23T00:00:28] Mirono escooters: Bambu ams is so cool
[2024-02-23T00:00:50] Mirono escooters: The prusa one just changes whole hotend automatically or sum Mega cool, idk how it works so reliable
[2024-02-23T00:01:39] haku: yes ive read the prussa one is better with fillament.
[2024-02-23T00:01:48] Gabe Enzo: I used to have them for years. used to hang around the wrong crowd.
[2024-02-23T00:06:34] Mirono escooters: Less waste
[2024-02-23T00:06:40] Mirono escooters: Incredible how it changes whole hotend tbh
[2024-02-23T00:08:16] haku: ive seen a video of a printer with 6 extruders. inforgot the brand
[2024-02-23T00:09:04] haku: i make my sons toys.
[2024-02-23T00:09:21] Mirono escooters: Try Telling me this ain't cool

[2024-02-23T00:09:36] Mirono escooters: Always busy busy busy
[2024-02-23T00:10:02] Mirono escooters: Idk how it's so accurate nozzle lines up perfectly xD
[2024-02-23T00:10:11] Mirono escooters: Cool stuff Overengineering is cool
[2024-02-23T00:10:40] haku: its not as wasteful as bambu always purging though
[2024-02-23T00:12:14] Gabe Enzo: I dreamt of this
[2024-02-23T00:12:55] haku: when bambu AMS goes on sale i still want one.
[2024-02-23T00:29:11] Jan: Its cool but slow
[2024-02-23T00:29:32] Mirono escooters: It's a gimmick, a cool gimmick
[2024-02-23T00:58:26] haku: yep. i need a ams maybe 2 no place to put this stuff.
[2024-02-23T01:01:52] haku: my son wants to print all the pokemon 😭

[2024-02-23T09:18:28] Gabe Enzo: Guys I seem to have destroyed my cell wrap, is kapton a fine alternative?
[2024-02-23T09:22:51] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-02-23T09:24:38] Gabe Enzo: tight fit huh
[2024-02-23T09:26:45] Mr.Mou: I'll just turn off the BMS then 😁 btw, yesterday I finally tested the new setup with the flipsky and got only ~12km/h max, is there still something that needs to be changed in settings? I've got this esc from fried and idk if it's fully working 😄
[2024-02-23T09:27:32] Mr.Mou: <video_file>
[2024-02-23T09:27:51] Mr.Mou: Don't look at the mess with the wires, it's just for test run 🫣🫣
[2024-02-23T10:15:41] Awyba: likely just wrong tyre size i guess
[2024-02-23T10:16:00] Awyba: so it shows incorrect speed
[2024-02-23T10:25:18] Mr.Mou: Ok, I'll try 🙂
[2024-02-23T10:59:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on what you have ,some works with key start ,bms other solution or you buys there antispark swich
[2024-02-23T11:00:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes , that's true Basically key mod is similar, works like xiaomi, main side is powered rest doesnt
[2024-02-23T11:01:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fried means friend? I hope
[2024-02-23T11:05:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably something like that is going on ,since by the look and sound its more than that Also wierd continues sound made think wtf ,but sound exist before engine start, so i guess that came from something else
[2024-02-23T11:09:15] puneDir: <photos/photo_13084@23-02-2024_11-09-15.jpg>

[2024-02-23T11:24:05] Mr.Mou: Sound of the motor is smooth, it comes from room heating in my garage :D I'll try to make new video later today.. So the only possible issue is with the tyre size?
[2024-02-23T11:24:25] Mr.Mou: Yes, friend :D
[2024-02-23T11:28:26] Mr.Mou: This is the thing, I didn't find any key On/Off switch. The cut-off of input voltage to ESC will probably be tricky when this BMS can handle something about 100Amps. Maybe some high-power relay but it will lose something due to heat and also the size of this relay will be much more than space in the G30 body :D
[2024-02-23T11:33:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably since that effects what you see
[2024-02-23T11:39:12] sombre_enfant: Anybody has failsafe for Throttle ?
[2024-02-23T11:40:30] sombre_enfant: Ayo cleaner build than miro first battery's🙊🤣
[2024-02-23T11:42:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably only there pro version happens to have vcc aka keyswitch solution What ment above around bms ,some smart bms has bt on/off and starts nice Basically mks ment to have antispark switch on these ,does are up to x voltage ,so if you buy take a look what it is good for
[2024-02-23T11:43:26] puneDir: Oh nice :D Actually i pretty much liked it I can safely use it
[2024-02-23T11:47:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He lives in Germany if i am not wrong 😅

[2024-02-23T11:54:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's aint cool, It's better than that😁
[2024-02-23T11:54:25] sombre_enfant: Wich color brother🤨
[2024-02-23T11:56:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Look at mini spring making cnc machines, that has even smaller tolarences🤤🤤🤤
[2024-02-23T11:56:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Light Brown Unsure of what nationality she was from
[2024-02-23T11:58:19] Mr.Mou: Antispark switch Is basically what I was looking for, thx 🙏
[2024-02-23T11:59:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,that makes it with one extruder, this heats up more than one to be ready to change
[2024-02-23T12:00:21] sombre_enfant: Brown 🔥
[2024-02-23T12:00:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You should consider reselling filaments soon😁
[2024-02-23T12:04:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well , Unsure what machine he planned to make and fucked up 🤣 But had a nice laught Basically vesc run any engine what 3 phase type ,like my drill press
[2024-02-23T12:05:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I hope so and also it will be working for a while
[2024-02-23T12:07:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably you made most changes in last half year ,from frames up to all.

[2024-02-23T12:15:23] Gabe Enzo: Just add a fuck ton of silicone absorbent bags into the scooter you will never have to worry about it
[2024-02-23T12:17:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In my world , i dont see colors like this , telling this just as a story. When i was your age or younger, more skinhead ppl existed around here and they even hated me ,just because i love rap and that means your heart is black, in there eyes 🤷 But this didn't stop me😁 Also i had kinda all skin color girls in my life , pretty much i am into asian girls 😅 Most of them had nice big tits ,but also had gfs wirh small ones ,only thing i didn't had is fat ones 🙈 i dont mean to shame anybody with this, it's up to what you like and what is your body type , Like this may sound funny or not but when i want to have sex with a girl that should not mean wrestling 🙈🙈
[2024-02-23T12:19:45] puneDir: No need Just make everything and the Frame wateroroof
[2024-02-23T12:20:18] Gabe Enzo: Yeah but if that fails it's a last defense
[2024-02-23T12:20:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This was kinda positive comment from me , there is always stuff to learn for all , you learned a lot , sometimes in the hard way ,but didn't stop you what is nice
[2024-02-23T12:22:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I wont say full fill,but you loose nothing
[2024-02-23T12:24:20] puneDir: Tysm ♥️ you guys helped me a lot
[2024-02-23T12:26:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sure thing. You find that on ali ,just look out to get the correct one, mks has few types, maybe amazon too ,i am not familar with that
[2024-02-23T12:38:18] Mirono escooters: Ebrake button? Overrides throttle
[2024-02-23T12:45:39] Mr.Mou: Ok, its quite expensive just for switch with mosfets :D btw, I'm looking into the Flipsky 75100 PCB and found that in simmilar location where they put switch into the fancy ESC's is 2 always closed jumpers, maybe this is the switch? :D

[2024-02-23T17:39:22] Mirono escooters: Most likely, no one tested, schematics say yes
[2024-02-23T17:39:39] sombre_enfant: No like all esc, even my spintend died on cuttof but you got a good battery and bms shouldnt die at all

[2024-02-24T12:20:46] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): how thick should my nickel strips be for ~60A constant in a 15s4p config?
[2024-02-24T12:21:27] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: My school
[2024-02-24T12:24:01] puneDir: No active balance
[2024-02-24T12:25:20] haku: yes alot of folks like jk because of active balance
[2024-02-24T12:25:56] puneDir: <photos/photo_13124@24-02-2024_12-25-56.jpg>
[2024-02-24T12:26:01] puneDir: I wonder what did happened
[2024-02-24T12:26:33] haku: seems like this problem is just for lifepo4 batteries.
[2024-02-24T12:37:30] Gabe Enzo: What does active balancing even mean
[2024-02-24T12:37:50] Gabe Enzo: Like it balances while charging anyway
[2024-02-24T12:38:11] puneDir: Active balance is 7-24 balance
[2024-02-24T12:38:38] Gabe Enzo: so if a P is too low voltage it'll just take more amps from another P?
[2024-02-24T12:38:41] Gabe Enzo: that's just dangerous lol
[2024-02-24T12:42:08] puneDir: No
[2024-02-24T12:42:11] puneDir: Max 0.6
[2024-02-24T12:42:15] Gabe Enzo: then what is active balance
[2024-02-24T12:42:24] puneDir: Its max 600ma
[2024-02-24T12:43:24] Gabe Enzo: Usually 1 0.15mm strip is enough for about 35a no? so maybe just use double
[2024-02-24T12:43:28] Gabe Enzo: sandwich
[2024-02-24T12:50:07] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): if i go for 0.30 strips directly, will it be harder to weld?
[2024-02-24T13:07:54] Mirono escooters: Always??
[2024-02-24T13:08:09] Mirono escooters: Idk how many times u hear about bad smart BMSes But except Daly, 0
[2024-02-24T13:10:05] Mirono escooters: Active balance is dumping charge from 1 cell Group into another It's better, faster, and more efficient Passive is just into resistors, and thus, heat
[2024-02-24T13:18:57] Gabe Enzo: This cell dangerous to use? if so I'm in trouble
[2024-02-24T13:19:03] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters
[2024-02-24T13:19:16] Gabe Enzo: it's a bit deformed after I just dropped it I think
[2024-02-24T13:20:35] Mirono escooters: Deformed??
[2024-02-24T13:23:14] Gabe Enzo: Just has a little pressure point on it
[2024-02-24T13:23:50] Gabe Enzo: think it happened when I tore off the nickel
[2024-02-24T13:24:05] Gabe Enzo: If you don't have enough power then yes
[2024-02-24T13:24:13] Gabe Enzo: I personally will just use double 0.15
[2024-02-24T13:24:20] Gabe Enzo: weld one on top of the other
[2024-02-24T13:24:20] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-24T13:54:26] sombre_enfant: Fine
[2024-02-24T13:56:11] Mirono escooters: I'm not even seeing it

[2024-02-24T14:15:52] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): probably because it's caught in a web of zipties /s
[2024-02-24T14:27:32] Rose: Hey there sir, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-24T14:57:06] puneDir: Im going to make this battery even safer
[2024-02-24T14:58:17] Mirono escooters: Ono
[2024-02-24T15:07:07] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_13127@24-02-2024_15-07-07.jpg>
[2024-02-24T15:07:30] Happy Giraffe: Looks like cell on right was stuck with a nail lol
[2024-02-24T15:21:59] puneDir: <photos/photo_13128@24-02-2024_15-21-59.jpg>
[2024-02-24T15:22:14] puneDir: Im going to wire the balance cables over plexy
[2024-02-24T15:22:41] puneDir: I want this battery to last 1000 years
[2024-02-24T15:24:16] haku: why not fishpaper?
[2024-02-24T15:26:41] Happy Giraffe: Which cells and how much your max draw per cell?😁
[2024-02-24T15:27:24] Happy Giraffe: Would recommend to stop charge at 90% if need cycle life to infinity
[2024-02-24T15:27:43] Happy Giraffe: Bms gotta balance at that voltage level tho unlike cheap dalys
[2024-02-24T15:30:00] haku: my car i barely let it drop to 20% and always charge to 80%.
[2024-02-24T15:39:27] Gabe Enzo: I'm pretty sure the Tesla's 100% is an internal 80%
[2024-02-24T15:39:44] Gabe Enzo: So you're charging to 0.8x0.8 aka 64% LOL
[2024-02-24T15:40:04] Gabe Enzo: the drop is also 20% when it's zero % I believe
[2024-02-24T15:40:17] puneDir: It already has
[2024-02-24T15:40:18] Gabe Enzo: otherwise the cells would die after 3 years
[2024-02-24T15:40:44] Gabe Enzo: id say do 10 90 if you wanna actually have some usefulness
[2024-02-24T15:42:56] haku: i do not drive tto far.
[2024-02-24T15:43:20] Gabe Enzo: we ordered a Tesla it's coming in a month
[2024-02-24T15:43:29] Gabe Enzo: Model 3 maxed out Version
[2024-02-24T15:43:52] sombre_enfant: Y'all rich asl
[2024-02-24T15:44:04] Gabe Enzo: My dad is, but he doesn't give us any money at all.
[2024-02-24T15:44:05] sombre_enfant: Ima start trappin
[2024-02-24T15:44:08] Gabe Enzo: I personally am broke
[2024-02-24T15:44:11] Gabe Enzo: dude, it's scary
[2024-02-24T15:44:15] Gabe Enzo: Trapping is super scafy
[2024-02-24T15:44:41] Gabe Enzo: if you're trapping don't bother selling weed the margin is too small
[2024-02-24T15:44:47] Gabe Enzo: maybe for pocket change sure
[2024-02-24T15:44:47] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-24T15:44:58] sombre_enfant: Beat him up and take all his paper and do a credit fly out to thailand and mary a shemale, ez

[2024-02-24T15:52:55] Gabe Enzo: Ima Take molicel p45bs from my vaccum cleaner
[2024-02-24T15:53:08] Gabe Enzo: Spot weld them to practice
[2024-02-24T15:57:59] Gabe Enzo: what better way to prepare for spot welding molis, than spot welding on molis
[2024-02-24T15:58:02] Gabe Enzo: big brain time
[2024-02-24T16:02:40] Happy Giraffe: This will propably 4x cell life😉
[2024-02-24T16:03:04] Gabe Enzo: It's loose but can't find a way to open it without destroying it
[2024-02-24T16:03:07] Gabe Enzo: I wanna keep the case
[2024-02-24T16:03:19] puneDir: Can someone help me for fixing this
[2024-02-24T16:03:31] Happy Giraffe: Should atleast give you enough to use some molicels in your batt😅
[2024-02-24T16:03:53] Gabe Enzo: Tesla's use molis right?
[2024-02-24T16:03:58] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2024-02-24T16:04:05] Happy Giraffe: 500,000€ house burned down because of 300€ saved on battery cells🌚
[2024-02-24T16:04:56] Happy Giraffe: They had their own ones that were larger, not too sure what they use now
[2024-02-24T16:05:51] Paolo ⁭: Not every , only lasts
[2024-02-24T16:06:01] Jacob: Heya friends, is it possible to make kers with the vesc esc? :)
[2024-02-24T16:08:14] Happy Giraffe: Regen is possible with another throttle or xiaomi lever, kers (braking when throttle off) also possible if you set throttle to behave like centered throttle
[2024-02-24T16:10:26] Jacob: Sounds good :) will it change anything else setting it to centered throttle?
[2024-02-24T16:10:41] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_13135@24-02-2024_16-10-41.jpg>
[2024-02-24T16:10:41] Happy Giraffe: This makes it possible to have acceleration and braking with one throttle
[2024-02-24T16:12:08] Happy Giraffe: You gotta set the ADC settings to desired values. -Min value, basically idle voltage -Center value, if below this voltage the braking will start -And max voltage value where acceleration is 100%
[2024-02-24T16:12:51] Happy Giraffe: Test it fist in air and with low currents
[2024-02-24T16:13:47] Jacob: Thank you for the detailed explanation, but i honestly have no idea what volts its at when releasing brake, cause thats diffrent
[2024-02-24T16:14:20] Gabe Enzo: Got it :)
[2024-02-24T16:14:27] Gabe Enzo: one out of these 6 is failing for sure. The rest is gold.
[2024-02-24T16:14:39] Gabe Enzo: only about 300 cycles

[2024-02-24T16:14:53] Gabe Enzo: can't wait to make a triple pack for this Dyson
[2024-02-24T16:15:10] Happy Giraffe: This will calibrate throttle, keep motor in air as it can spin the wheel
[2024-02-24T16:15:17] Jacob: Oh it can map it itself to find right
[2024-02-24T16:15:28] Jacob: Oh nice thanks i will try it
[2024-02-24T16:15:43] Happy Giraffe: Yes and after you can adjust the braking point manually where you like it the most
[2024-02-24T16:16:06] Jacob: Thank you for your help! :)
[2024-02-24T16:18:14] Jacob: Motor doesnt turn just shows this, doesnt seem correct
[2024-02-24T16:19:27] Happy Giraffe: Dyson Molicel P50B👍
[2024-02-24T16:19:59] Gabe Enzo: THEY DON'T USE 21700 ANYMORE??? hahaha wtf is a 20700 p45
[2024-02-24T16:20:03] Happy Giraffe: Btw Molicel P50B pre-production cell is stronger than P45B. Lets see about the final mass produced cell if its not much worse
[2024-02-24T16:20:16] Gabe Enzo: bruh p42a is so overkill tho
[2024-02-24T16:20:16] Gabe Enzo: lmao
[2024-02-24T16:21:01] Happy Giraffe: I would defo get P50B on my bike if price wasnt insane when it launches
[2024-02-24T16:21:44] Gabe Enzo: omg I don't even know if these are molicels. Not like it matters but it's a shame that Dyson has downgraded
[2024-02-24T16:21:49] Happy Giraffe: Propably has your old adc values stored in
[2024-02-24T16:22:17] Happy Giraffe: Also this should change when you push throttle
[2024-02-24T16:22:36] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): did someone get that same mail from monorim? i don't need anything but 95% off of their e-bikes sounds like a deal
[2024-02-24T16:22:38] Jacob: Ah so i just try drive and it'll change?
[2024-02-24T16:23:00] Mirono escooters: 95% off? No way
[2024-02-24T16:23:18] Happy Giraffe: Hahahahahahhahhaahhahhahahhaa
[2024-02-24T16:23:24] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-02-24T16:23:28] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): lol
[2024-02-24T16:23:46] Happy Giraffe: Tire in air push throttle on calibration screen
[2024-02-24T16:24:06] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): sadd. so as expected... meh
[2024-02-24T16:25:26] Jacob: Still zero on everything 🤔
[2024-02-24T16:26:23] Happy Giraffe: If your setting is like this should give something
[2024-02-24T16:26:44] puneDir: <photos/photo_13143@24-02-2024_16-26-44.jpg>
[2024-02-24T16:26:46] Happy Giraffe: You have to have this open when pressing throttle
[2024-02-24T16:26:46] puneDir: Is this good
[2024-02-24T16:27:57] Jacob: It looks like this when im driving around:
[2024-02-24T16:27:59] Jacob: <photos/photo_13144@24-02-2024_16-27-59.jpg>
[2024-02-24T16:28:21] Jacob: But theres actually a bit kers now i just have to adjust strenght
[2024-02-24T16:29:09] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom does he need to manually put throttle numbers if using xiaomi throttle as centered one for gas/brake?
[2024-02-24T16:29:55] Happy Giraffe: Then try to adjust them manually
[2024-02-24T16:31:05] Happy Giraffe: This you adjust to move brake position
[2024-02-24T16:32:08] Jacob: Yea
[2024-02-24T16:32:23] Jacob: Ah so when it starts braking or how powerfull?
[2024-02-24T16:32:36] Jacob: Oh
[2024-02-24T16:33:02] Jacob: So does that mean this kers wont work with xiaomi script?
[2024-02-24T16:35:14] Jacob: Ah okay so probably not worth the trouble
[2024-02-24T16:35:45] Gabe Enzo: They used to be. now they just have no name.
[2024-02-24T16:35:56] Gabe Enzo: INR20700A
[2024-02-24T16:36:14] Jacob: Thank you both for your time :)
[2024-02-24T16:36:19] Mirono escooters: I have never known it to be p45
[2024-02-24T16:36:27] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13147@24-02-2024_16-36-27.jpg>
[2024-02-24T16:36:29] Mirono escooters: Always inr20700a
[2024-02-24T16:36:38] Gabe Enzo: it was 21700 I remember opening up packs years ago
[2024-02-24T16:36:48] Gabe Enzo: this is a recent pack
[2024-02-24T16:36:56] Mirono escooters: P45 didn't exist back then
[2024-02-24T16:37:01] Konstantin: Y, LG, Sony, molicell, Dyson use it
[2024-02-24T16:37:14] Gabe Enzo: Maybe it was p42
[2024-02-24T16:37:15] Konstantin: Today was fix v10
[2024-02-24T16:37:18] Gabe Enzo: they were bigger
[2024-02-24T16:37:26] Konstantin: 20700
[2024-02-24T16:37:38] Konstantin: 21700 and 18650
[2024-02-24T16:37:47] Gabe Enzo: all the cells have a healthy voltage, so idk why this pack was failing. Immaa test draw and see which one has Vdrop
[2024-02-24T16:38:00] Gabe Enzo: or I'll just blow These up for fun
[2024-02-24T16:38:00] Gabe Enzo: idk
[2024-02-24T16:38:14] Konstantin: Reflash fw, xD
[2024-02-24T16:38:19] Happy Giraffe: If it works now, you can adjust the negative motor current in motor tab for strenght. Maximum braking is when you take hand off throttle. For battery negative current, keep it very low depending on battery used
[2024-02-24T16:38:29] Gabe Enzo: No need to mod it the BMS works on voltage
[2024-02-24T16:38:37] Konstantin: If drop like 0.2....0.3v pack fail
[2024-02-24T16:39:08] Happy Giraffe: But yeah bit more complicated setup you have there
[2024-02-24T16:39:11] Gabe Enzo: honestly if all 6 of these worked I could make a very nice 2s3p pack for my mom's m365
[2024-02-24T16:39:12] Konstantin: Dyson aoem if fail, need to clean eeprom, or reflash it
[2024-02-24T16:39:27] Konstantin: I fix like 200+ Dyson battery ;)
[2024-02-24T16:39:39] Gabe Enzo: wow
[2024-02-24T16:39:58] Gabe Enzo: how do I reflash?
[2024-02-24T16:40:17] Konstantin: U need pickit 3
[2024-02-24T16:40:26] Gabe Enzo: is money involved
[2024-02-24T16:40:34] Konstantin: 20-30$
[2024-02-24T16:41:27] Gabe Enzo: First cell drops by 0.15v
[2024-02-24T16:41:32] Gabe Enzo: on 2a
[2024-02-24T16:41:37] Gabe Enzo: damn
[2024-02-24T16:42:48] Gabe Enzo: second 0.2v third 0.18 0.16
[2024-02-24T16:44:49] Gabe Enzo: so you're trying to say that Dyson designs these packs to fail on purpose?
[2024-02-24T16:44:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-24T16:46:16] Konstantin: If not believe me, charger them , cell by cell, 4.0v each and still error ocure;)
[2024-02-24T16:46:29] Konstantin: They stored on eep
[2024-02-24T16:47:07] Gabe Enzo: All these cells are fine
[2024-02-24T16:47:17] Gabe Enzo: every single one of them has the same vdrop 0.2v
[2024-02-24T16:47:31] Gabe Enzo: so it's a software issue? if I understand you?
[2024-02-24T16:48:37] Konstantin: Y, soft lock bms...
[2024-02-24T16:49:03] Konstantin: Something go wrong, and bms locked...it fine, for safety
[2024-02-24T16:49:58] Gabe Enzo: this is what I'm doing now @jamessoderstrom
[2024-02-24T16:54:23] Gabe Enzo: i bet you make crazy cash fixing those dysons lmfao
[2024-02-24T16:54:26] Gabe Enzo: Genius idea dude
[2024-02-24T16:58:53] puneDir: Is this good?
[2024-02-24T16:59:30] Finn: How many s you need?
[2024-02-24T16:59:33] puneDir: 20
[2024-02-24T16:59:43] puneDir: Theres no difference in price
[2024-02-24T16:59:53] Finn: Is aliexpress delivering to you?
[2024-02-24T17:01:55] Finn: .
[2024-02-24T17:02:55] puneDir: Yes but
[2024-02-24T17:02:59] puneDir: I need it asap
[2024-02-24T17:03:10] Finn: Replace resistor?
[2024-02-24T17:03:32] puneDir: No
[2024-02-24T17:03:44] puneDir: I dont want this shit that it even dies itself
[2024-02-24T17:03:59] puneDir: + i wouldnt trust it
[2024-02-24T17:54:42] sombre_enfant: Bro i can sell u that one cheap
[2024-02-24T17:54:57] Mirono escooters: To turkey? XD
[2024-02-24T17:54:59] sombre_enfant: 150A 20s
[2024-02-24T17:55:03] sombre_enfant: Sure

[2024-02-24T18:17:07] Gabe Enzo: he can
[2024-02-24T18:17:59] puneDir: Nope
[2024-02-24T18:18:18] sombre_enfant: Trust bro
[2024-02-24T18:18:57] puneDir: Its even impossible to pass a book from customs
[2024-02-24T18:20:00] sombre_enfant: What new script has adc...
[2024-02-24T18:20:28] sombre_enfant: Never worked out for me either,best is to connect it directy

[2024-02-24T19:00:07] Yamal: Hello people, would there be any option to make this engine a tubeless engine and not a split tire engine like it is now...?
[2024-02-24T19:00:26] Yamal: <photos/photo_13156@24-02-2024_19-00-26.jpg>
[2024-02-24T19:04:47] Mirono escooters: No Why? Split rim with tube is ez
[2024-02-24T19:05:15] Paolo ⁭: Yes, you have to buy the tubeless rim
[2024-02-24T19:06:21] haku: new tesla model y and cyber truck use the 4680 cells. not even for sale to public
[2024-02-24T19:08:11] Gabe Enzo: wtf even is 4680
[2024-02-24T19:08:42] Gabe Enzo: looks stupid
[2024-02-24T19:09:01] haku: its made in the USA with freedom baby
[2024-02-24T19:09:48] haku: only cells that i know of thats manufactured in the US
[2024-02-24T19:10:31] haku: in nevada factory i think
[2024-02-24T19:11:16] Unknown: Refund the kid
[2024-02-24T19:15:47] Yamal: the problem that half the tire is stuck to the engine
[2024-02-24T19:17:55] sombre_enfant: Impossible then or u do getto metod with duct tape
[2024-02-24T19:18:53] Paolo ⁭: I mean the whole rim, take with you the stator only
[2024-02-24T19:18:59] sombre_enfant: Refund Palestine 🤣
[2024-02-24T19:19:34] sombre_enfant: Whole rim is as expensive as the motor
[2024-02-24T19:21:21] Paolo ⁭: The problem isn't seal the rim, it's pretty easy. But with this rim you haven't clearance , it isn't deep enough so it's impossible to install any tire. Also the tubeless valve doesn't fit
[2024-02-24T19:25:24] Happy Giraffe: Finnish air force?
[2024-02-24T19:25:59] Happy Giraffe: Lets not get political
[2024-02-24T19:26:05] Gabe Enzo: was about to say
[2024-02-24T19:26:19] Gabe Enzo: honestly i shouldnt have posted that in the first place. politics is awful
[2024-02-24T19:26:48] Happy Giraffe: We all view the world from different points so we will never get a proper enough conversation so better just skip it xd
[2024-02-24T19:26:50] Gabe Enzo: causes a chain reaction. lets forget about it.

[2024-02-24T19:40:17] haku: sad to see onyx ebikes go out of buissness. They were doing 60-72v bikes 4 years ago when all competitors were at 48v. cant compete with china specially with china parts
[2024-02-24T19:41:40] Happy Giraffe: I would disagree to a point, many chinese bikes are complete crap. If they would do a proper setup like a 3 speed bafang BBSHD running low gearing and 72v it would kick ass for very little money and ton of torque :)
[2024-02-24T19:43:19] haku: that would be great. idk why everyone stick to hubs.
[2024-02-24T19:43:41] haku: easier maintanance i think
[2024-02-24T19:43:49] Happy Giraffe: Easy and cheap, doesnt require any understanding or skills from manufacturer
[2024-02-24T19:45:21] haku: i think super 73 is next to go. kinda sad but i have to admit china is killing the pev game
[2024-02-24T19:46:06] haku: even if western made parts for western pevs are made it will be a niche luxury thing
[2024-02-24T19:50:17] Happy Giraffe: Mostly its the manufacturers charging crazy amounts of shit components
[2024-02-24T19:50:35] Happy Giraffe: 2000-3000e bike using 10e shimano brakes etc
[2024-02-24T19:50:56] Happy Giraffe: And let alone the tiny joke sized batteries

[2024-02-24T20:20:33] puneDir: Yeah he did
[2024-02-24T20:21:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I gave one anyway in DM 😁
[2024-02-24T20:22:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And set it Correctly
[2024-02-24T20:23:22] Mirono escooters: 12k specialized ebikes ☠️
[2024-02-24T20:23:35] Mirono escooters: 3 msg down😳
[2024-02-24T20:23:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean vesc has to know ,if it does maybe doesnt ask for all amps when batt low 🤷‍♂
[2024-02-24T20:24:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Message made earlier than reading that coz i forget ,and better twice than non
[2024-02-24T20:25:06] Mirono escooters: Tru
[2024-02-24T20:31:47] Happy Giraffe: Those frames are so nice tho, if they could beef them up even more and make it for QS90 xd
[2024-02-24T20:32:20] Mirono escooters: Nice, but 12k nice?
[2024-02-24T20:32:30] Mirono escooters: Gimme a car or Kawasaki for that
[2024-02-24T20:32:35] Happy Giraffe: Frame could have integrated batt part in downtube holding like 20s8p batt
[2024-02-24T20:33:01] Happy Giraffe: that for 25kmh Bosch that snaps chains and drivetrains is a joke xd
[2024-02-24T20:33:03] Mirono escooters: Note the "could"
[2024-02-24T20:33:13] Mirono escooters: Wasted potential
[2024-02-24T20:33:47] Happy Giraffe: I calculated my DH bike build to cost 1350e (or 1200e if I dont need a new stator) without electronics
[2024-02-24T20:34:26] Happy Giraffe: slapping 150e for another vesc and something for a batt and its sub 2500e beast of a machine, perfectly legal if ridden at 25kmh xd
[2024-02-24T20:35:23] Happy Giraffe: yup haha, they charge insane amounts for 600wh batteries. IIRC 700-800e
[2024-02-24T20:35:37] Happy Giraffe: Stark Varg xd
[2024-02-24T20:36:16] Mirono escooters: Bosch stuff
[2024-02-24T20:37:08] Happy Giraffe: meanwhile me having chain and drivetrain lasting 4x longer with 10x the power. Go figure lol
[2024-02-24T21:16:46] Konstantin: All from Dyson battery
[2024-02-24T21:17:16] Gabe Enzo: there's lots of Dyson cells in recycle centers. it's would be possible to harvest them and make a 20s Moli pack
[2024-02-24T21:17:20] Gabe Enzo: THAT easily
[2024-02-24T21:17:30] Gabe Enzo: 30a 3000mah is beastly
[2024-02-24T21:17:58] Konstantin: 21700 if remember correctly on v11 and mb later, don't open my home v12 pack
[2024-02-24T21:18:20] Gabe Enzo: ah, so they do use real 21700 in some instances
[2024-02-24T21:18:50] Konstantin: They didn't handle current... Very fast voltage drop... Like on turbo full-empty time 15sec ;)
[2024-02-24T21:20:21] Konstantin: Own v8, v10, v12. Use them all. V12 coll, coz u can fast swap battery, like few second and ready to clean xD
[2024-02-24T21:21:08] Konstantin: Today off, mb tomorrow will check 75350
[2024-02-24T21:21:18] Konstantin: <photos/photo_13161@24-02-2024_21-21-18.jpg>
[2024-02-24T21:23:03] Gabe Enzo: Those cells are so abused dude
[2024-02-24T21:23:52] Konstantin: Y, after few years usage...
[2024-02-24T21:24:05] Gabe Enzo: when I make my 3p pack Ill be able to vaccun my whole room with the V8
[2024-02-24T21:24:11] Gabe Enzo: and about like 15m runtime on turbo
[2024-02-24T21:24:18] Gabe Enzo: on 1p it's 5 min runtime with turbo
[2024-02-24T21:24:25] Konstantin: V8 can drive any bms;)
[2024-02-24T21:24:35] Gabe Enzo: of course
[2024-02-24T21:24:37] Konstantin: V10+ use uart communication xD
[2024-02-24T21:24:54] Gabe Enzo: I was thinking a year back of using LIPO with the v8
[2024-02-24T21:24:59] Gabe Enzo: would be very compact
[2024-02-24T21:27:11] Yamal: https://youtu.be/5PydA6BjaEQ?si=CWGV254y3ngXLw9A
[2024-02-24T21:27:52] haku: anyone has dyson v10 stls. for head attachment.
[2024-02-24T21:29:21] haku: 10k lol
[2024-02-24T21:29:41] haku: if you watch the video these are malibu kids.
[2024-02-24T21:31:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fastest again 😁😅🙈
[2024-02-24T21:44:09] Face de Pin Sucé: They said "one of" which, for once, I like
[2024-02-24T21:52:27] Gabe Enzo: nah like in general they shouldnt be drained THAT hard with 1p LOL
[2024-02-24T22:08:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True
[2024-02-24T22:09:48] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): do y'all pot your batteries in some compound glue or how to prevent vibrations killing the welds?
[2024-02-24T22:14:01] francois schempers: @lBabacar @mrstealyogirI I read something that doesn't belong here, this is the last warning, no political, war, or religious content
[2024-02-24T22:14:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 10000$ escooter with a 3$ throttle 😁
[2024-02-24T22:16:10] Mirono escooters: If Vibrations loosen welds, it's a shitty batt
[2024-02-24T22:16:17] Mirono escooters: Potting is for heat or water reasons
[2024-02-24T22:18:05] Gabe Enzo: why do y'all heat shrink the BMS in the pack? doesn't it need a heatsink?
[2024-02-24T22:18:08] Gabe Enzo: Just curious
[2024-02-24T22:18:21] Gabe Enzo: Ill be bolting mine to the bottom plate for no issues?
[2024-02-24T22:18:43] Gabe Enzo: No suspension issue :)
[2024-02-24T22:18:56] Mirono escooters: No, shitty batt issue
[2024-02-24T22:19:05] Mirono escooters: Works also
[2024-02-24T22:19:16] Gabe Enzo: ok please don't ban me it won't happen again
[2024-02-24T22:19:24] Gabe Enzo: there's no other place for actual vesc help I'll die
[2024-02-24T22:20:08] Yamal: You thing here can put good Vesc..?
[2024-02-24T22:20:50] Konstantin: Why not
[2024-02-24T22:21:14] francois schempers: no problem, you both have been warn, no harm done, but I have to be strict or the group will turn to shit really fast
[2024-02-24T22:21:59] Jan: 😱😭
[2024-02-24T22:22:13] Gabe Enzo: Yeah I understand, I've been the owner of many groups, even bigger than this one. Not banning people for misbehaving usually leads to people going to war with the owner.
[2024-02-24T22:22:32] Gabe Enzo: Got so bad I had to leave.
[2024-02-24T22:22:55] Gabe Enzo: the owner can't be warm, in essence.
[2024-02-24T22:25:04] haku: what dualtrons is that?
[2024-02-24T22:27:59] Yamal: Storm limited
[2024-02-24T22:28:44] haku: oh this is the big boy dualtron.
[2024-02-24T22:28:48] Yamal: <photos/photo_13164@24-02-2024_22-28-48.jpg>
[2024-02-24T22:31:22] Yamal: In my house really like Dualtron,, I would like to return to some model in the near future to ride Vesc and do something fun
[2024-02-24T22:32:23] Yamal: For me thunder 2 is perfect
[2024-02-24T22:34:45] haku: how big is the battery compartment of thunder 2?
[2024-02-24T22:35:00] Yamal: Do you think that minimotors are good for Vesc or is it better to remove them and put Ly...?
[2024-02-24T22:35:22] haku: everything is better with vesc imo
[2024-02-24T22:35:28] Yamal: Haku ?😁
[2024-02-24T22:35:37] Yamal: Hakuna matata
[2024-02-24T22:35:42] Gabe Enzo: 84284 fit better
[2024-02-24T22:35:45] Gabe Enzo: or whatever it was
[2024-02-24T22:36:05] haku: lol.
[2024-02-24T22:36:31] haku: i recently found out you can change your name
[2024-02-24T22:36:39] haku: boomer moment
[2024-02-24T22:37:10] Gabe Enzo: @Bradhaku been thinking of changing mine back to Gabe. The people who were out to doxx me years back have forgotten about me. But it seems like I'm known as electron now? what do you think?
[2024-02-24T22:37:20] Yamal: I don't really have the measurements but they come with 20s9p and in the thunder 1 I have seen a 22s11p battery taking up the entire drawer
[2024-02-24T22:38:02] haku: wow. thats 21700 cells ofcourse
[2024-02-24T22:38:09] Yamal: Yes
[2024-02-24T22:38:52] haku: what about a nami burnie? how many cells
[2024-02-24T22:39:23] Yamal: 200
[2024-02-24T22:39:59] haku: good name. my name fits me more.
[2024-02-24T22:40:05] Yamal: haku you said a while ago that you had asian roots
[2024-02-24T22:40:43] haku: yes. direct decendant of genghis khan himself
[2024-02-24T22:40:48] Yamal: From what part if it's not too much to ask? I have family in South East Asia.
[2024-02-24T22:41:01] Yamal: Mongolia?
[2024-02-24T22:41:20] haku: naw. philippines and hawaii.
[2024-02-24T22:41:36] Yamal: Wou nice!👍
[2024-02-24T22:41:44] Gabe Enzo: changed it back. feels good to be myself again
[2024-02-24T22:42:01] haku: im just jokinf about the genghis khan
[2024-02-24T22:42:04] Gabe Enzo: "nicotine isn't addictive" 5 years later:
[2024-02-24T22:42:10] Gabe Enzo: They lied to me
[2024-02-24T22:42:39] Mirono escooters: Who said that
[2024-02-24T22:42:48] Mirono escooters: Now we gotta adjust to Gabe enzo xd
[2024-02-24T22:42:51] Gabe Enzo: Back then? all my friends. also people online

[2024-02-24T22:44:11] haku: i thought this was offtopic where i belong

[2024-02-24T22:49:55] Yamal: No hall
[2024-02-24T22:50:00] Gabe Enzo: Holy shit balls, Chat gpt is so smart it blows my mind. I used to be against it thinking it would be the devil or something. It just helped me write a program in C for calculating resistances, and letting you choose a series or parallel mode. seems I took all this Adderall for no reason, it done it for me..... I'm looking to use this tool in the future :) now I can submit my project which is due in a few hours and not fail the year :) Now what to do with all the Adderall I took for no reason. I am WIRED @Bradhaku I can't believe these fuckers are making me do coding after I chose electrical!!! like if I wanted to do coding I would've chosen a coding course goddamnit!!!!
[2024-02-24T22:50:27] haku: i think the rage mechanics scooter is dualtron thunder frame isnt it? @SibClimb
[2024-02-24T22:51:14] Yamal: No , is Dualtron compact
[2024-02-24T22:51:28] haku: i see. very cool
[2024-02-24T22:51:55] Yamal: purple and yellow yes ?
[2024-02-24T22:52:12] haku: yes
[2024-02-24T22:52:22] Yamal: Nice and powerful
[2024-02-24T22:52:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Which one ?
[2024-02-24T22:53:09] haku: theres multiple ones? the one on the videos
[2024-02-24T22:53:15] haku: purple one
[2024-02-24T22:54:02] Yamal: <photos/photo_13166@24-02-2024_22-54-02.jpg>
[2024-02-24T22:54:30] haku: oh its all purple
[2024-02-24T22:54:44] haku: the one he races with
[2024-02-24T22:55:01] Yamal: Maybe have diferent in the same color becaouse now I see this more small.. I dont know
[2024-02-24T22:55:44] haku: but anyways its always a good idea to use vesc on any scooter. dualtron stock esc is squarewave i think
[2024-02-24T22:55:51] Face de Pin Sucé: There were 2
[2024-02-24T22:56:08] Yamal: Two compact?
[2024-02-24T22:56:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Dualtron Compact And then RM-One (thunder based)
[2024-02-24T22:56:42] Yamal: Nice

[2024-02-24T23:01:14] Yamal: Raphael's Nami is elegance
[2024-02-24T23:01:33] haku: both are cool.
[2024-02-24T23:03:11] Yamal: It's cool that everything goes in the box, without having to carry the electronics on the mast or screwed underneath
[2024-02-24T23:03:31] haku: a dualtron without LEDs.
[2024-02-24T23:03:49] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, full red was a good call :D
[2024-02-24T23:04:16] Gabe Enzo: True. and if my heart tells me to stop, I'll respectfully listen to it.
[2024-02-24T23:04:30] Gabe Enzo: Just like coke you stop when your heart tells you to. don't be an idiot.
[2024-02-24T23:04:45] Mirono escooters: This is some high evening talk
[2024-02-24T23:04:55] Mirono escooters: Or when your heart stops
[2024-02-24T23:05:02] Yamal: For me, he is the most perfect and "fat" Nami on the face of the earth.
[2024-02-24T23:05:09] Gabe Enzo: yeah I took all that Adderall for no reason.. chat gpt saves the day and now im sitting here wired
[2024-02-24T23:05:10] Gabe Enzo: hahah
[2024-02-24T23:05:25] Gabe Enzo: i still got a few lines left. so I'll have them now.
[2024-02-24T23:05:33] Yamal: Those 75h engines are crazy pretty
[2024-02-24T23:05:36] Gabe Enzo: And no electrical work, we all know how that goes. BAD BAD I don't even have caffeine before electrical work.
[2024-02-24T23:07:11] Yamal: I know by heart every part that Nami is made up of.
[2024-02-24T23:07:20] Gabe Enzo: dude I can't do uni while smoking weed either I legit didn't go into classes for weeks because "I know it all' weed makes you so delusional. atleast me. Now I have 4 weeks of coding and shit to catch up on and 20 outstanding projects.
[2024-02-24T23:07:55] Yamal: well apart from the fact that you made a list with each of the modifications
[2024-02-24T23:08:13] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2024-02-24T23:08:42] Gabe Enzo: I've made the decision to just never smoke weed again. I can't be like you and have a joint on the odd while. one joint and im back to buying ounces.
[2024-02-24T23:08:51] Gabe Enzo: some people can, I can't.
[2024-02-24T23:09:23] Gabe Enzo: I've tried limiting many times.
[2024-02-24T23:09:36] Gabe Enzo: it was time to stop kidding myself. even one joint with the boys and I'm back into dependence
[2024-02-24T23:10:10] Yamal: Moto GP
[2024-02-24T23:10:10] Yamal: <photos/photo_13168@24-02-2024_23-10-10.jpg>
[2024-02-24T23:10:16] haku: you need 12 step my man.
[2024-02-24T23:10:21] Gabe Enzo: what's that?
[2024-02-24T23:10:48] haku: its a program for drug/alcohol dependancy.
[2024-02-24T23:11:11] haku: they dont have that in EU?
[2024-02-24T23:11:22] Gabe Enzo: oh alcohol, fuck that.. I went to have a pint between classes with my bro and at the end I had about 10 shots and had a Tri shot to leave the pub.
[2024-02-24T23:11:37] Gabe Enzo: some people genetically just can't enjoy drugs like normal people do
[2024-02-24T23:11:52] Gabe Enzo: as long as I don't kid myself I will be free of the prison
[2024-02-24T23:11:57] Gabe Enzo: I've came to terms with it.
[2024-02-24T23:11:59] puneDir: Its 1 am and im repairing bms
[2024-02-24T23:12:16] Gabe Enzo: Dude, just sleep. I tried that before.
[2024-02-24T23:12:19] haku: its just a phase. once you handle responsibilities you will stop
[2024-02-24T23:12:25] Gabe Enzo: Electrical work after being awake for 16h is a recipe for disaster
[2024-02-24T23:12:28] Gabe Enzo: Please just sleep
[2024-02-24T23:12:41] Gabe Enzo: Doing work while having a debuff is aeful
[2024-02-24T23:12:47] Mirono escooters: Like spotwelding a batt when tired No no
[2024-02-24T23:12:54] haku: aderral is a buff imo
[2024-02-24T23:13:05] Gabe Enzo: Not for me LOoool
[2024-02-24T23:13:23] Gabe Enzo: true but Addy + sleep deprivation = just thinking you can work when you can't
[2024-02-24T23:13:37] puneDir: Im gay if i cant repair it
[2024-02-24T23:13:39] Gabe Enzo: Miro knows.
[2024-02-24T23:13:57] Gabe Enzo: but for uni work? I become a god.
[2024-02-24T23:14:00] Mirono escooters: Bweh
[2024-02-24T23:14:26] Mirono escooters: Oh my social skills are ususally non existent But with Adderall it goes negative
[2024-02-24T23:14:45] Gabe Enzo: Yeah I had to stop taking stims for college days because it makes me autistic.
[2024-02-24T23:14:49] Gabe Enzo: Paranoia
[2024-02-24T23:14:52] Mirono escooters: Like, standing in a lift and lift opens and a person stands there? I didn't expect and did a jump😭😆
[2024-02-24T23:15:05] Mirono escooters: Also
[2024-02-24T23:15:21] puneDir: This is burned
[2024-02-24T23:15:28] haku: i use to take those to loose weight back in the day. for wrestling tournaments
[2024-02-24T23:15:34] puneDir: And 2L smd transistor And a lot of resistors
[2024-02-24T23:15:42] Gabe Enzo: Was hard to come to terms with Smoking weed because it made me a social skill god. Stopping a substance is hard when you have actual benefits. but soon the negatives just don't weigh up to the positives.
[2024-02-24T23:15:45] Mirono escooters: Heart races, paranoia, delusional, not processing stuff like walking (randomly being like, uh, I've walked past where I need to be) sleep deprived, bweh
[2024-02-24T23:15:50] Mirono escooters: I take it for exams only
[2024-02-24T23:16:09] Gabe Enzo: I take my Adderall on weekends only. and my college lets the entire school have Friday off :)
[2024-02-24T23:16:12] Gabe Enzo: I love Irish college
[2024-02-24T23:16:16] Gabe Enzo: and we get free cash for going uni
[2024-02-24T23:16:20] puneDir: You take what
[2024-02-24T23:16:21] Gabe Enzo: so much cash
[2024-02-24T23:16:26] Gabe Enzo: ADHD meds
[2024-02-24T23:16:31] puneDir: ah
[2024-02-24T23:16:40] puneDir: Im using concerta for 6 months i guess
[2024-02-24T23:16:44] puneDir: It has no effect
[2024-02-24T23:16:49] Gabe Enzo: Dose too low brother.
[2024-02-24T23:16:54] Gabe Enzo: talk to your psychiatrist
[2024-02-24T23:16:56] Mirono escooters: I went to 30 and went mad
[2024-02-24T23:17:04] puneDir: 54
[2024-02-24T23:17:08] Mirono escooters: I want dis
[2024-02-24T23:17:08] Gabe Enzo: also Methylphenidat is shit. ask your doctor for vyvanse
[2024-02-24T23:17:09] puneDir: No i dont want more
[2024-02-24T23:17:17] Gabe Enzo: yes but slow release mechanism
[2024-02-24T23:17:23] Gabe Enzo: aka only 3mg / hour
[2024-02-24T23:17:25] Gabe Enzo: which is nothing
[2024-02-24T23:17:29] Mirono escooters: Concerta was for me super shit Adderall too Now I use something new, wich has least side effects, but still exist
[2024-02-24T23:17:37] Gabe Enzo: Get vyvanse!
[2024-02-24T23:17:43] Gabe Enzo: it metabolizes to Adderall at a slow rate
[2024-02-24T23:17:50] puneDir: I dont also feel any side effects lol
[2024-02-24T23:17:53] puneDir: I just pee more
[2024-02-24T23:18:06] Mirono escooters: Fascinating info
[2024-02-24T23:18:12] puneDir: <sticker>
[2024-02-24T23:18:13] Gabe Enzo: also gives me no paranoia at uni. perhaps because Adderall release dopamine, and methylphenidate only adrenaline, whichis AWFUL
[2024-02-24T23:18:16] haku: all elite scooters there
[2024-02-24T23:18:29] Mirono escooters: Man studied it all
[2024-02-24T23:18:32] Gabe Enzo: Oh yeah, no issues with vyvanse and I had a horrible time with peeing with concerta
[2024-02-24T23:18:47] Gabe Enzo: I was going to go into med school before I got into electrical, I studied extensively.

[2024-02-24T23:19:03] puneDir: I drink 4-5l of water and pee 10 liters lol
[2024-02-24T23:19:07] Gabe Enzo: that is why I'm becoming an electrical engineer my guy.
[2024-02-24T23:19:17] Gabe Enzo: Get 100k a year, sustain the wife, get kids to uni
[2024-02-24T23:19:20] Gabe Enzo: get your own car
[2024-02-24T23:19:21] Mirono escooters: It's best if I don't reproduce

[2024-02-24T23:21:08] haku: the world depends on brilliant minds to reproduce
[2024-02-24T23:21:37] Gabe Enzo: Why so? youre smart and able bodied. Your ancestors did it for thousands of lifetimes.
[2024-02-24T23:21:44] Gabe Enzo: You got chosen from the 1 billion pieces of cum

[2024-02-24T23:41:57] Gabe Enzo: I feel safe on mh1 20s I can go about 70kmh so I can outrun the surrons, and even if not I am a better driver than those fuckers.
[2024-02-24T23:42:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Soon
[2024-02-24T23:42:09] Gabe Enzo: never leave the house without being on 100% charge.
[2024-02-24T23:42:09] haku: per rider. you have to invest atleast 50k
[2024-02-24T23:42:18] Face de Pin Sucé: You going to Xelectrics
[2024-02-24T23:42:21] puneDir: <animation>

[2024-02-24T23:44:12] NetworkDir: with 30cm extender? x)
[2024-02-24T23:44:14] Gabe Enzo: It's gonna be a whip
[2024-02-24T23:44:17] puneDir: No
[2024-02-24T23:44:19] puneDir: Bag
[2024-02-24T23:44:35] puneDir: 7p in 4p bag other 5p other bag
[2024-02-24T23:44:36] NetworkDir: 2x 5L bag needed for 20s8p
[2024-02-24T23:44:43] puneDir: ^
[2024-02-24T23:44:47] Gabe Enzo: im still looking for a bag to fit the 20s8p, but it seems I may be forced to drop a P. Worst case I pay James to print me an enclosure.
[2024-02-24T23:44:50] puneDir: One of them is ninebot bat
[2024-02-24T23:44:59] puneDir: The one cengiz maded

[2024-02-24T23:46:25] Gabe Enzo: :)
[2024-02-24T23:46:36] Face de Pin Sucé: <animation>
[2024-02-24T23:46:45] Gabe Enzo: literally me rn
[2024-02-24T23:46:46] haku: dyson packs have a bms?
[2024-02-24T23:46:49] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2024-02-24T23:46:54] Gabe Enzo: 6s1p Moli inside
[2024-02-24T23:47:04] puneDir: Some dysons have their own battery
[2024-02-24T23:47:13] Gabe Enzo: change that pfp back rn!!!
[2024-02-24T23:47:21] Gabe Enzo: or I klll u
[2024-02-24T23:47:22] puneDir: Why
[2024-02-24T23:47:27] Gabe Enzo: Because I liked it
[2024-02-24T23:47:29] Gabe Enzo: haha
[2024-02-24T23:47:31] puneDir: Lol
[2024-02-24T23:48:01] Gabe Enzo: turns out the Dyson pack I took apart was 100% healthy so I'm making a 2s3p pack for my mom
[2024-02-24T23:48:10] Gabe Enzo: it's gonna be a lit 12s m365
[2024-02-24T23:48:32] Gabe Enzo: Sadly not gonna go out on that shit. too slow
[2024-02-24T23:48:39] Yamal: Well, I'm going to try to go somewhere but I don't know, the one in Murcia takes me only two hours or so from home, the one I'm going to go to is CBDPower, which is the beginning of great races and surrounded by good people
[2024-02-24T23:49:34] haku: my dog is killing my dyson. always clogs up.
[2024-02-24T23:50:00] Gabe Enzo: ahha, back when we had a parrot she always clogged that shit with her dust and feathers
[2024-02-24T23:50:13] puneDir: We have dyson v8 animal+
[2024-02-24T23:50:22] puneDir: The battery of it is dead i guess
[2024-02-24T23:50:26] puneDir: Lasts 2 mins
[2024-02-24T23:50:35] Gabe Enzo: probably just BMS tripped, that happened to mine.
[2024-02-24T23:50:41] puneDir: <photos/photo_13172@24-02-2024_23-50-41.jpg>
[2024-02-24T23:50:43] Yamal: I would like to have signed up for the entire xelectric championship but between work and family I can't, but I will try to go to one, let's see...
[2024-02-24T23:50:49] puneDir: It works but not for long
[2024-02-24T23:50:54] haku: i need to upgrade or switch to the cheaper but effective shark vacum
[2024-02-24T23:51:00] Gabe Enzo: @Mltra spoke about it, just need a pick it v3 to reset the BMS
[2024-02-24T23:51:18] Gabe Enzo: most likely cells are healthy
[2024-02-24T23:51:41] puneDir: <photos/photo_13173@24-02-2024_23-51-41.jpg>
[2024-02-24T23:51:45] puneDir: Bms tester v99
[2024-02-24T23:51:53] Gabe Enzo: soon I'll be going around recycle centers and will pickup as much Dyson packs as I can carry.
[2024-02-24T23:51:57] haku: what is xelectrics? ive seen a youtube of it but coulnt understand
[2024-02-24T23:52:07] Gabe Enzo: Making a 20s4p Dyson 20700 pack would be littttt
[2024-02-24T23:52:33] Gabe Enzo: Literally healthy FREE molicels at recycling centers
[2024-02-24T23:52:39] Gabe Enzo: it's literally a dream come true
[2024-02-24T23:52:53] haku: is it a convention? or a store?
[2024-02-24T23:54:03] Yamal: <photos/photo_13174@24-02-2024_23-54-03.jpg>
[2024-02-24T23:54:06] Gabe Enzo: open it up and check cell health, worst case scenario you just reweld, flash BMS and put all back together. just make sure to not destroy the enclosure. theres little pins to undo and then it slides out
[2024-02-24T23:54:51] Yamal: <files/Dossier-12.pdf>
[2024-02-25T00:02:03] Mirono escooters: I've got thousands of cells in my Powerwall from recycled stuff
[2024-02-25T00:04:19] Gabe Enzo: Instead of my surron summer project im making a powerwall. Irish energy costs so much after the war.
[2024-02-25T00:04:28] Gabe Enzo: around 600€ a month on heating water and radiators.
[2024-02-25T00:04:38] Gabe Enzo: I can't afford it even
[2024-02-25T00:04:42] Gabe Enzo: sitting around in a cold house
[2024-02-25T00:05:01] Gabe Enzo: With fresh cells. You could guess I'm ballingm
[2024-02-25T00:05:01] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-25T00:05:10] haku: today i will stop all BS and start on my battery. its getting warm here. i dont want to miss out.
[2024-02-25T00:07:05] haku: look at all this experimented holders.
[2024-02-25T00:08:36] Gabe Enzo: my holders are about 2mm too wide for my pro 2, I'm gonna have to shave 1mm off each side. Hopefully won't affect integrity, should be fine. Or 0.5mm of each side and 0.5mm off each side of the deck extender
[2024-02-25T00:08:57] Gabe Enzo: seems like the more rational way
[2024-02-25T00:09:10] haku: just put fiber tape around it
[2024-02-25T00:09:30] Gabe Enzo: Yes, also have to make sure the extender isn't stressed, otherwise the threads die.
[2024-02-25T00:09:41] Gabe Enzo: I would literally die if that happens to my baby
[2024-02-25T00:10:40] haku: james designed this but the fancyness is all me haha
[2024-02-25T00:11:01] Gabe Enzo: anyone want these? they're taking up room.
[2024-02-25T00:11:10] Gabe Enzo: We love James
[2024-02-25T00:11:41] Gabe Enzo: tried selling them for cheap online, but to no avail! I'm just gonna throw them in the trash if y'all don't want
[2024-02-25T00:11:58] Tommy ª: toca ir con mi m365 stock
[2024-02-25T00:12:08] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-02-25T00:12:20] haku: keep it for spares my boy. money doesnt grow on trees
[2024-02-25T00:15:12] Mirono escooters: Got the holders? I never found time to design
[2024-02-25T00:16:03] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, seems like a modern problem
[2024-02-25T00:16:20] haku: no worries. you a busy fella. this is perfect
[2024-02-25T00:16:22] Gabe Enzo: Yes, police aren't allowed to have guns here.
[2024-02-25T00:16:58] haku: what? really?
[2024-02-25T00:17:00] Gabe Enzo: Police still my friends. My heart stops beating so fast when I see one. It used to be the opposite back in the day, glad those times are over.
[2024-02-25T00:17:07] Gabe Enzo: Yes, hands only, batons on occasion
[2024-02-25T00:18:25] Happy Giraffe: "How to lose your country to teen gangs"
[2024-02-25T00:20:15] Gabe Enzo: Even worse that teens are regarded as children and even if you assault someone you get a week in juvy
[2024-02-25T00:20:49] Gabe Enzo: At 18 they wipe your record.
[2024-02-25T00:20:52] Gabe Enzo: also bad.
[2024-02-25T00:21:14] Jan: Please try to make it at least look like a Pro2
[2024-02-25T00:21:36] Gabe Enzo: Yes, I'll be keeping the OG Look. sadly it has front and rear shocks, which takeaway the sleeper look
[2024-02-25T00:21:55] Jan: There are scooters out there that got tuned that have zero in common with the original anymore
[2024-02-25T00:22:05] Gabe Enzo: Oh, I hate that!
[2024-02-25T00:22:25] Gabe Enzo: im also keeping the OG dash, thanks to @kawaiinekololis :)
[2024-02-25T00:22:30] Gabe Enzo: What a legend
[2024-02-25T00:22:47] Tommy ª: bruh how much you want? i need one of these
[2024-02-25T00:23:02] Gabe Enzo: Eh, I was selling then for 80€ on Amazon. how does half price sound?
[2024-02-25T00:23:07] Happy Giraffe: Our situation is quite relaxed here but if problems occur police is heavily armed if needed and will receive direct help from defence forces. Worst scenario you are heavily armed lets say have a grenade launcher. There might be conscripts staying "on patrol/duty" and you might be facing a hello from Leopard 2 tank😂 Nobody has tried anything like that but thats possible😂
[2024-02-25T00:23:11] Gabe Enzo: they go for 90-110
[2024-02-25T00:23:25] Gabe Enzo: 40 and it's yours?
[2024-02-25T00:24:01] francois schempers: thanks @punedir and @sqlx1337 for the boost, we will soon have some features unlocked, keep it up guys 💪

[2024-02-25T00:24:38] Tommy ª: yea but i dont have money, actually is not bad price
[2024-02-25T00:24:53] Gabe Enzo: Let me know if you ever do, and if you want we can arrange a smaller price if you need.
[2024-02-25T00:25:03] Gabe Enzo: I'd be greatful for you taking it off my hands.

[2024-02-25T00:32:41] Mirono escooters: Most buyers are moron, so have to ask moronic simple question
[2024-02-25T00:32:47] Mirono escooters: Yes, annoying af
[2024-02-25T00:32:52] Mirono escooters: Cant even contact some sellers anymore
[2024-02-25T00:33:09] Mirono escooters: My brand new inverter started producing 1500Hz hum from transfos after 2 days.. Super high noise, annoying af. Something is failing or whatever.
[2024-02-25T00:33:13] Mirono escooters: So well dispute it is

[2024-02-25T00:45:57] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if I should make those axles from titanium as an upgrade but not really sure about my schedule
[2024-02-25T00:47:12] francois schempers: you you have a 1cm thick steel deck to make ! 😂
[2024-02-25T00:47:39] Happy Giraffe: 1 day a week to focus on deck but 4 days to lathe🤔

[2024-02-25T01:58:06] Yamal: It makes me think, that the dualtron motors have to go very very well with Vesc, they are also motors without hall, they only come with the 3 phases, I think that in output the motor does not have to do anything strange...
[2024-02-25T01:58:59] haku: <photos/photo_13184@25-02-2024_01-58-59.jpg>

[2024-02-25T02:11:09] haku: did not drain much

[2024-02-25T04:01:27] Gabe Enzo: do I have to balance the cells before I put them in or will the natural balancing just do it? @Bradhaku
[2024-02-25T04:01:34] Gabe Enzo: no cell is at a dead voltage
[2024-02-25T04:01:38] Franchesco Carofano: they burned

[2024-02-25T04:36:45] haku: @Mirono_escooters is this the hydraulic press your talking about?
[2024-02-25T04:36:53] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/JJgs_xZ4jZs?si=aF4yfNpul6x_KOA-
[2024-02-25T04:53:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nice I only saw the flipky version with key and everything
[2024-02-25T05:02:12] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-02-25T05:02:20] Tommy ª: shitsky too expensive
[2024-02-25T05:14:29] Franchesco Carofano: They burned me which one was recommended
[2024-02-25T05:14:37] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_13190@25-02-2024_05-14-37.jpg>
[2024-02-25T05:18:43] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I ordered 860mm handlebar 😐
[2024-02-25T05:33:37] rosheee: Burnorama
[2024-02-25T05:42:43] haku: nice. i thought the longest is 780mm
[2024-02-25T05:43:17] haku: in spintend we trust
[2024-02-25T05:43:52] haku: battery catch fire too?
[2024-02-25T05:47:00] Franchesco Carofano: The battery did not block, the BMS already unlocked it but they got stuck during the trip, like when the faces of the engines are joined, they lasted me about a month.
[2024-02-25T06:01:17] Franchesco Carofano: It had 74 volts and was running suddenly it started to fail and it turned off and both motors jammed. I disconnected the faces and effectively burned out the controllers. I disconnected all the batteries. It was blocked but I had an extra one and that one did have voltage, the one below it marked bad. I disconnected the bms and connected it and it came back without problem but the controllers smelled burnt they turned on they flashed red blue red. blue and smoke comes out, if it was because they lost power or because they damaged the moffe, the truth is, what happened?
[2024-02-25T06:25:56] haku: im glad your motors and batteries are fine. just get a spintend or better yet the new tronics or trampas
[2024-02-25T06:33:01] Franchesco Carofano: What do you recommend me
[2024-02-25T06:41:16] haku: imo i like spintend for best bang for buck thats quality. others might have better recomendations
[2024-02-25T06:42:43] haku: i have spintend 80/100 84/200 and 100/100v2 havent used it yet but i trust it.
[2024-02-25T07:05:28] Franchesco Carofano: Leave me your lick to see them
[2024-02-25T07:05:48] Franchesco Carofano: and see esroy price in chile
[2024-02-25T07:47:21] francois schempers: time for a snack 😂😂
[2024-02-25T10:18:41] puneDir: @Bradhaku @mrstealyogirI and me builded our packs in so close time lol
[2024-02-25T10:18:55] puneDir: First me than gabe than haku

[2024-02-25T12:58:12] Finn: Mj1?
[2024-02-25T12:58:12] Gabe Enzo: clean for My first time
[2024-02-25T12:58:21] Gabe Enzo: Ya just till the p42s come
[2024-02-25T12:58:45] Finn: Got here a tenpower pack but the project got cancelled
[2024-02-25T12:58:54] Finn: Hopefully nkon accepts returns
[2024-02-25T13:08:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: How you do that man? What scooter do you have?
[2024-02-25T13:21:25] Gabe Enzo: Pack looks low-key sexy
[2024-02-25T13:21:32] Gabe Enzo: the blue and white is a good combo
[2024-02-25T13:25:30] sombre_enfant: Why ?
[2024-02-25T13:25:48] sombre_enfant: Buy w copper for lord sake
[2024-02-25T13:32:40] Gabe Enzo: You mean use copper for this pack?
[2024-02-25T13:32:47] Gabe Enzo: dude I'll not be pulling more then 40a from this LOL
[2024-02-25T13:33:10] Gabe Enzo: I'm not even bothering to use double strips
[2024-02-25T13:34:58] sombre_enfant: No W shape copper
[2024-02-25T13:38:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: 🇵🇹 Are better
[2024-02-25T13:38:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: @PaoloWu do you still have blade
[2024-02-25T13:39:10] sombre_enfant: He sold it after he crashed
[2024-02-25T13:41:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: Oh is a shame
[2024-02-25T13:41:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: I wanted to see if he had the LG version or Chinese
[2024-02-25T13:43:51] sombre_enfant: He had blade 10 the one from like 2017
[2024-02-25T13:45:07] Paolo ⁭: Who said that?
[2024-02-25T13:45:15] Paolo ⁭: I literally never crashed on escooter
[2024-02-25T13:45:38] Denis Yurev: <sticker>
[2024-02-25T13:45:42] sombre_enfant: I remember u said wobble stuff ? U didnt crash ?
[2024-02-25T13:47:53] Paolo ⁭: No
[2024-02-25T13:48:07] Paolo ⁭: It wobbles yes but never crashed on it
[2024-02-25T13:48:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: I know
[2024-02-25T13:49:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: He had sane tone was my friend in Portugal Pboy and @XgunaX
[2024-02-25T13:49:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: What do you have know?
[2024-02-25T13:50:27] Paolo ⁭: Nothing, all c fork wobbles st high speed

[2024-02-25T13:52:39] sombre_enfant: Do you want external batt ? 20.8ah bluetooth bms ?
[2024-02-25T13:52:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have a blade gt used with lg mh1 6a cells and has 6000km the sag is mutch more than the chinese cells
[2024-02-25T13:53:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have sag of 11v with this instead of the 6v sag of chineses cells i wanna know if it's normal
[2024-02-25T13:53:39] sombre_enfant: Not really...
[2024-02-25T13:53:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: Since 9p of mh1 cell is 54a and controllers supposed to pull 70a
[2024-02-25T13:54:22] Finn: It didnt fit into g30
[2024-02-25T13:56:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: U think?
[2024-02-25T13:59:34] Paolo ⁭: Typical problem when you use anti spark with dual configurations
[2024-02-25T13:59:44] Paolo ⁭: These things should be banned from the market
[2024-02-25T14:07:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: I want check with people that had the battery
[2024-02-25T14:08:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: When mh1 has like 10a battery will have 90a to give now is 6a
[2024-02-25T14:08:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: Do you know anything about that @PaoloWu?
[2024-02-25T14:33:06] Gabe Enzo: 10a gets hot. 8a constant fine
[2024-02-25T14:45:40] Jacob: Hey its weird i almost got no electric brake but its at -75a for braking, shouldnt it be quite effective?
[2024-02-25T14:45:43] Jacob: <photos/photo_13197@25-02-2024_14-45-43.jpg>

[2024-02-25T14:48:40] puneDir: Wish me luck
[2024-02-25T14:48:56] puneDir: <photos/photo_13199@25-02-2024_14-48-56.jpg>
[2024-02-25T14:49:02] puneDir: I can repair but too much work
[2024-02-25T14:49:11] puneDir: Removed every faulty component
[2024-02-25T14:49:11] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-25T15:08:03] Gabe Enzo: is 0.15mm enough for 40a y'all think?
[2024-02-25T15:08:11] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13200@25-02-2024_15-08-11.jpg>
[2024-02-25T15:10:28] Mirono escooters: Reaaaaly depends on layout...
[2024-02-25T15:10:41] Gabe Enzo: what about this
[2024-02-25T15:10:47] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_13201@25-02-2024_15-10-47.jpg>
[2024-02-25T15:10:49] Mirono escooters: Pure nickel?
[2024-02-25T15:11:01] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13202@25-02-2024_15-11-01.jpg>
[2024-02-25T15:11:06] Gabe Enzo: 100%
[2024-02-25T15:11:11] Gabe Enzo: ahh
[2024-02-25T15:11:16] Gabe Enzo: then I do that way
[2024-02-25T15:11:45] Mirono escooters: Should be enough
[2024-02-25T15:16:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: But the new mh1 is only 6a
[2024-02-25T15:19:55] Franchesco Carofano: Quali sono le cose che il mio amico Paolo mi consiglia di fare?
[2024-02-25T15:46:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't know
[2024-02-25T16:00:45] Happy Giraffe: Welded 700mm into 800mm😂 Lathed the ends
[2024-02-25T16:04:34] Gabe Enzo: You can draw over specs.
[2024-02-25T16:04:46] Happy Giraffe: Next time set low voltage cutout that motor power will be reduced on low battery, it will not cut-off unexpectedly. Also best to have the cutoff end value above bms cutoff so vesc gently turns off motors before bms goes off
[2024-02-25T16:04:51] Gabe Enzo: Make sure to have a temp sensor tho
[2024-02-25T16:06:17] Happy Giraffe: Damn you will have massive sag
[2024-02-25T16:06:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ur was not ne us tge stock battery
[2024-02-25T16:06:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is stock
[2024-02-25T16:07:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: That us why I asked
[2024-02-25T16:13:12] sombre_enfant: Bro u fucked the trace shouldve just let them do it bow they might dont repair it
[2024-02-25T16:13:40] puneDir: No trace is fucked
[2024-02-25T16:13:45] puneDir: Theyre all there
[2024-02-25T16:14:08] puneDir: Theres some thin wires instead of resistors (for something different) but i removed them
[2024-02-25T16:18:49] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2024-02-25T16:22:12] Happy Giraffe: Haha😏 pressfit and TIG alu time
[2024-02-25T16:22:34] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-02-25T16:25:40] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-02-25T16:26:14] Gabe Enzo: not exactly optimal but making it work
[2024-02-25T16:29:50] Jason Nelson: Can someone tell me if there is a way to calibrate the voltage on the controller? Mine is over 1 volt off
[2024-02-25T16:30:03] Jason Nelson: Just over 1 volt
[2024-02-25T16:34:36] sombre_enfant: No its in firmware
[2024-02-25T16:35:56] Mirono escooters: I've once welded my own handlebar
[2024-02-25T16:36:03] Mirono escooters: Scared xD
[2024-02-25T16:36:41] Finn: ah yes bridging the resistors will help for sure
[2024-02-25T16:36:47] Finn: next time the cells will catch fire
[2024-02-25T16:36:57] puneDir: didnt used it Just tried somethinf
[2024-02-25T16:37:01] Finn: resistors only for fun there
[2024-02-25T16:37:15] puneDir: I calculated the internal resistance of that thin wire and compared with resistor :)
[2024-02-25T16:37:23] puneDir: For some other thing
[2024-02-25T16:37:47] Jason Nelson: Thank you
[2024-02-25T16:44:39] Gabe Enzo: @Bradhaku
[2024-02-25T16:48:40] puneDir: Nice
[2024-02-25T16:48:46] puneDir: Duct tape them
[2024-02-25T16:49:54] Gabe Enzo: I have no glue for sticking the 2 parts together
[2024-02-25T16:50:02] Gabe Enzo: might use hot glue
[2024-02-25T16:50:08] Gabe Enzo: was thinking of kapton
[2024-02-25T16:50:16] Gabe Enzo: or regular clear tape lol
[2024-02-25T16:50:31] puneDir: Kapton is too expensive
[2024-02-25T16:50:36] puneDir: Duct tape is good And strong
[2024-02-25T16:51:17] Gabe Enzo: I have none
[2024-02-25T16:51:23] Gabe Enzo: maybe clear tape will work?
[2024-02-25T16:52:09] Gabe Enzo: I'll ask my friend for duct tape
[2024-02-25T16:53:12] puneDir: They will
[2024-02-25T16:53:16] puneDir: I mean this
[2024-02-25T16:53:39] puneDir: <photos/photo_13204@25-02-2024_16-53-39.jpg>
[2024-02-25T16:53:54] puneDir: So it stays in one piece
[2024-02-25T16:55:34] Paolo ⁭: Found my first 2s batt XD
[2024-02-25T16:56:41] Gabe Enzo: You mean the regular tape?
[2024-02-25T16:56:53] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13205@25-02-2024_16-56-53.jpg>
[2024-02-25T17:00:34] puneDir: Yes
[2024-02-25T17:00:38] puneDir: No duct tape
[2024-02-25T17:07:07] Paolo ⁭: M365 pro series batt
[2024-02-25T17:07:18] puneDir: Zeros rear esc is blown again
[2024-02-25T17:09:49] puneDir: Im tired
[2024-02-25T17:12:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: For xiaomi o bet
[2024-02-25T17:15:24] Mirono escooters: Stop shuntmodding it
[2024-02-25T17:17:38] puneDir: It has same shunts for 1 months
[2024-02-25T17:42:42] Paolo ⁭: That's what we always say
[2024-02-25T17:42:55] Paolo ⁭: If it works now, doesn't meant it works forever
[2024-02-25T17:51:45] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-02-25T17:51:55] Mirono escooters: "but it worked" Same argument for 20s on stock Esc 😆😆😆
[2024-02-25T17:52:30] Rose: Hey there 𝒄𝒐𝒇𝒇𝒆𝒆, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-25T17:52:51] Gabe Enzo: Hey guys, this is my friend, he's looking for a scooter frame that can support his weight of 210 pounds
[2024-02-25T17:53:00] Gabe Enzo: He doesn't want any alu frame. Any good steel frames for him?
[2024-02-25T18:07:33] puneDir: i need to get vesc
[2024-02-25T18:08:37] Jacob: Ah yes ofcourse :)
[2024-02-25T18:09:11] Jacob: Damn the current was set to 85a for my 2x 20-25a batteries 😵‍💫
[2024-02-25T18:19:34] Gabe Enzo: Ppl who use 14s on stock xesc
[2024-02-25T18:19:35] Gabe Enzo: Be like
[2024-02-25T18:21:05] Paolo ⁭: Who said 16s works also
[2024-02-25T18:21:15] Paolo ⁭: And they even don’t know cap doesn’t exist anymore
[2024-02-25T18:31:15] Jan: His wants make no sense
[2024-02-25T18:31:49] puneDir: doesnt cap Explodes at high voltage
[2024-02-25T18:37:27] Paolo ⁭: Lol
[2024-02-25T18:40:04] Mirono escooters: Electrolyte over all components njam
[2024-02-25T18:43:51] Happy Giraffe: I only welded the ends and even the pressfit was strong enough let alone full-pen TIG😂
[2024-02-25T18:44:01] Happy Giraffe: Which part of bar did you weld?
[2024-02-25T18:44:19] Mirono escooters: End to end
[2024-02-25T18:50:51] Happy Giraffe: Damn, I wouldnt trust my abilities on that. In the end alu is so hot you cant really weld it anymore as it heats up so bad. Would need to go 10cm at a time😅
[2024-02-25T18:51:49] Mirono escooters: Twas steel : d
[2024-02-25T18:51:57] sombre_enfant: Finally 😔
[2024-02-25T18:52:29] Happy Giraffe: Which vesc model shows 1v off?
[2024-02-25T18:53:40] Happy Giraffe: Steel frames hard to make and require additional knowledge of shapes as they will bend a bit
[2024-02-25T18:53:57] Happy Giraffe: Properly designed stiff alu is more than enough for him...
[2024-02-25T18:54:24] Happy Giraffe: Im 210pounds with backpack and Xiaomi Pro no issues😂😂😂
[2024-02-25T18:54:54] Happy Giraffe: Tho would prefer something more tanky than that
[2024-02-25T18:56:05] sombre_enfant: Flipsky 75100 ig
[2024-02-25T18:56:35] Happy Giraffe: Lmao, spintends are within 0.1v to multimeter
[2024-02-25T18:57:41] Happy Giraffe: Bit easier but still not easy. Maybe MIG/MAG its possible. Im a TIG guy by religion
[2024-02-25T18:58:10] Mirono escooters: Bagette..
[2024-02-25T18:58:16] Mirono escooters: Oh sorry, MMA :)
[2024-02-25T18:59:08] Mirono escooters: I'm a antique man
[2024-02-25T18:59:54] Happy Giraffe: TIG is so therapeuti it supresses my PTSD from army😂 jk, but its nice as penetration will be always there
[2024-02-25T19:00:03] Mirono escooters: Sus
[2024-02-25T19:00:08] sombre_enfant: Guys i have fishpaper sheet kapton fiberglass tape and epoxy sheet where should i put them on my battery pack
[2024-02-25T19:00:16] Mirono escooters: Bagette just get it hot and don't burn through
[2024-02-25T19:00:47] Mirono escooters: Fibreglass tape is structural Fishpaper is isolating layer Epoxy sheet is last layer, before pvc
[2024-02-25T19:01:10] Mirono escooters: Kapton and fishpaper are used through each other Altough kapton more to hold wires and corner fine work
[2024-02-25T19:01:56] sombre_enfant: Where i put the fishpaper, between the wire and nickel to solder them ?
[2024-02-25T19:02:11] puneDir: why its called fishpaper
[2024-02-25T19:02:32] puneDir: Use plexyglass or epoxy sheet and fishpaper on lowest layer
[2024-02-25T19:02:37] Mirono escooters: Huh
[2024-02-25T19:03:00] Mirono escooters: U use it to wrap whole pack once, as a isolating and protecting layer Great for last resort moisture
[2024-02-25T19:03:03] Mirono escooters: Oh and dampening
[2024-02-25T19:03:09] puneDir: Cut holes in plexy / epoxy for best isolation Its what im going to make will send photos soon)
[2024-02-25T19:09:01] Rose: Hey there 𝒄𝒐𝒇𝒇𝒆𝒆, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-25T19:10:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: And the price diference?
[2024-02-25T19:11:35] puneDir: Im selling this for 40 bucks and people is still not getting it
[2024-02-25T19:11:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: Did you read what I asked you?
[2024-02-25T19:12:02] Paolo ⁭: No
[2024-02-25T19:13:07] Happy Giraffe: Does it blow up if used?😁
[2024-02-25T19:13:26] Happy Giraffe: Little to nothing
[2024-02-25T19:13:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: @PaoloWu
[2024-02-25T19:13:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is because of the tap
[2024-02-25T19:14:17] puneDir: what?
[2024-02-25T19:15:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: That tap on battery screams danger 😂😂😂
[2024-02-25T19:15:20] Jacob: Lol saw this in facebook market, a guy made the scoot drive on 2x Makita batteries, is this a thing?
[2024-02-25T19:15:20] Jacob: <photos/photo_13209@25-02-2024_19-15-20.jpg>
[2024-02-25T19:15:31] puneDir: i dont understand but it has holders and isolation etc
[2024-02-25T19:16:15] puneDir: <photos/photo_13210@25-02-2024_19-16-15.jpg>
[2024-02-25T19:17:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: Until they burn it is
[2024-02-25T19:18:45] Gabe Enzo: oh god
[2024-02-25T19:19:34] Rose: Hey there 𝒄𝒐𝒇𝒇𝒆𝒆, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-02-25T19:22:43] Mirono escooters: Ususally done on kids scoots
[2024-02-25T19:23:50] Unknown: I mean theyre still batteries, i'd rather use milwaukee ones though cause a lot of the other ones will kill on you and let you decharge it too much
[2024-02-25T19:24:18] Unknown: are there any like reynolds steel frames
[2024-02-25T19:24:19] Unknown: ?
[2024-02-25T19:24:19] Unknown: kind of like how you find on road bikes?
[2024-02-25T19:24:20] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝒄𝒐𝒇𝒇𝒆𝒆 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-25T19:24:33] puneDir: and its sold in 20 mins
[2024-02-25T19:25:21] Jacob: Lol ;)
[2024-02-25T19:27:05] Unknown: dont get me wrong i use makita tools, just milwaukee batteries, they just tend to last much longer in every way
[2024-02-25T19:37:22] haku: i wish i had a picture of mine. cold soldered like crap
[2024-02-25T19:40:16] haku: ive seen this in power wheels too
[2024-02-25T19:41:09] Mirono escooters: Anyone here has experience with inverters 😅
[2024-02-25T19:43:33] Unknown: my grandpa used to do the car battery in those old jeep electric cars
[2024-02-25T19:43:47] Unknown: he also put rubber over the plastic tires
[2024-02-25T19:43:53] Unknown: cause it would burn holes doing burnouts
[2024-02-25T19:43:55] Unknown: lolol
[2024-02-25T19:44:01] Happy Giraffe: Why you need those?😳
[2024-02-25T19:44:44] Happy Giraffe: To power a Stick welding machine from battery?😂
[2024-02-25T19:45:15] Unknown: hey man, roadside frame welding
[2024-02-25T19:45:19] Unknown: xD
[2024-02-25T19:50:24] Gabe Enzo: 72v hurts like a bitch
[2024-02-25T19:50:32] Gabe Enzo: I totally forgot I had to be careful with DC
[2024-02-25T19:51:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: A little to nothing is almost the double of the price
[2024-02-25T19:53:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: 75€ the 75100 V2 in my door the spintend is 150€ até my door is double the price
[2024-02-25T19:53:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: They are better yes
[2024-02-25T19:53:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: But depends what you want
[2024-02-25T19:54:22] sombre_enfant: New makerbase should be good, 1zuna fixed voltage reading on his firmware for the 75100v2 box an alu
[2024-02-25T19:54:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: How the fixed?
[2024-02-25T19:56:01] sombre_enfant: In firmware code
[2024-02-25T19:57:15] haku: link for w shape copper. ive never seen one
[2024-02-25T19:57:49] Paolo ⁭: Not normal
[2024-02-25T20:01:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: But where is it?
[2024-02-25T20:01:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: I measured the groups they are all OK
[2024-02-25T20:06:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: Battery has like 6000km
[2024-02-25T20:06:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: What battery do you had on your blade gt
[2024-02-25T20:07:01] Mirono escooters: Powerwall
[2024-02-25T20:07:03] haku: would this be legal for scooter racing in EU?
[2024-02-25T20:07:17] haku: technically a scooter haha
[2024-02-25T20:08:33] haku: remove the seat and stand on it
[2024-02-25T20:08:44] sombre_enfant: U didnt search enough🤣
[2024-02-25T20:09:06] haku: link my boy
[2024-02-25T20:09:10] sombre_enfant: Here you go. It is based on https://github.com/m365fw/bldc/tree/flipsky_75100
[2024-02-25T20:09:53] Happy Giraffe: External battery and a moped😂
[2024-02-25T20:09:55] haku: before i start cutting .2 i have to see all options. link it
[2024-02-25T20:09:58] sombre_enfant: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EwjsXwN
[2024-02-25T20:10:25] haku: thats nickle. i want copper like you said
[2024-02-25T20:10:28] sombre_enfant: Use this its easiest to weld and time saver
[2024-02-25T20:10:39] sombre_enfant: Nah i cutted the copper
[2024-02-25T20:10:44] Happy Giraffe: We get better prices from @jamessoderstrom than from Spintend
[2024-02-25T20:11:22] Happy Giraffe: The 45€ difference in otherwise expensive scooter is nothing. Its one of the most important components so yeah On spintend you get power button etc etc
[2024-02-25T20:12:06] sombre_enfant: Nope weight u dont stand and ext batt
[2024-02-25T20:12:15] Happy Giraffe: But everyone does how they want
[2024-02-25T20:12:45] Happy Giraffe: All that space available and external batt+esc? I smell lack of skill
[2024-02-25T20:14:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thing..... Good for nothing
[2024-02-25T20:15:55] haku: look how he leans. i dont understand the ching chong but cool
[2024-02-25T20:15:55] haku: <photos/photo_13213@25-02-2024_20-15-55.jpg>
[2024-02-25T20:16:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Inverter for what ,so wide question
[2024-02-25T20:17:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Would be interesting
[2024-02-25T20:19:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That can be the reason, also 6 k in grandma speed or 6 k max discharge mostly is not the same
[2024-02-25T20:21:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean i am not sure you could power it, but basically new mag (stick) welder is based on inverter, that's why its much easier to weld that old ones
[2024-02-25T20:21:46] Happy Giraffe: They use batts nowaday aswell
[2024-02-25T20:24:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 3 car battery in series and you can weld with rutil type stick
[2024-02-25T20:25:17] Happy Giraffe: Perfect to mess up with your old asshole boss. Weld his house locks shut😂
[2024-02-25T20:25:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Makes sense but not for daily use
[2024-02-25T20:26:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like for 1 shorter weld if you need 300 m cable it makes sense
[2024-02-25T20:26:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you wont be welding for hours and not superthick
[2024-02-25T20:28:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure what they can take , What is sure 3 mag 200 A welder used at the same time, melts out whole powerclock if that's a common one😁
[2024-02-25T20:29:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No
[2024-02-25T20:31:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: More like the name is used for a lot things by english,like happy i would say moped
[2024-02-25T20:32:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: 6000k / 60 is like 100 cicles I think is not that mutch for a lg battery
[2024-02-25T20:37:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I didn't talk about charging,but why /60
[2024-02-25T20:39:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why you talk imperial?😁 Say 95 kg
[2024-02-25T20:39:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not to much to choose from ,g2 maybe navee s65c ,
[2024-02-25T20:40:07] Gabe Enzo: G2 is steel yes? that's awesome.
[2024-02-25T20:41:42] Happy Giraffe: He should study more about materials before making stupid opinions based off some mis-understood wikipedia pages😂
[2024-02-25T20:41:53] sombre_enfant: G2 is trash
[2024-02-25T20:41:57] Happy Giraffe: No point in avoiding alu if properly made
[2024-02-25T20:42:05] Gabe Enzo: hardly it's literally just a g30
[2024-02-25T20:42:19] Gabe Enzo: g30 is good
[2024-02-25T20:42:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes
[2024-02-25T20:42:33] Gabe Enzo: and you literally have one 💀
[2024-02-25T20:42:35] Gabe Enzo: bruh
[2024-02-25T20:42:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lot problems with it , that's true
[2024-02-25T20:43:10] Gabe Enzo: What does it matter if you change every part in it anyways
[2024-02-25T20:43:19] Gabe Enzo: The frame has no issues
[2024-02-25T20:44:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So far more like suspension issues,but too new to have lot bad experience or story
[2024-02-25T20:44:43] Gabe Enzo: Keeping the stock "suspension' Is a dumb idea, but sure.
[2024-02-25T20:44:45] Gabe Enzo: I stand corrected
[2024-02-25T20:45:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like i have mate who asked, what to buy when it was new, he also has a g30 Than bought the g2 and didn't listen, now front sus is supercrap and he doesnt want to spend on it or sell cheap 🤷‍♂ So now dust keeper it is
[2024-02-25T20:49:14] Unknown: anyone got any good vids on a Max G2 modded?
[2024-02-25T20:49:31] Gabe Enzo: @wired_on_coffee may be interested depending on the price.
[2024-02-25T21:03:25] haku: this guy has a cool setup using pet bottles as filaments. no more buying filaments and good for the enviroment. https://youtube.com/shorts/c6Zb4cW5hOY?si=iKfj76xAHwtONwEL
[2024-02-25T21:03:42] haku: ive been watching him. very cool stuff
[2024-02-25T21:04:29] haku: good for cheaptards like me.
[2024-02-25T21:05:57] haku: also good product to market to enviromentalist folks.
[2024-02-25T21:06:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As i said he doesnt really want to sell it ,and if he would you need to take all ,so its not frame price thing,whole scooter with 3 k km and bad front sus🤔
[2024-02-25T21:08:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably half price of a new or something like that for start🤷‍♂
[2024-02-25T21:09:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I Would buy s65 broken,i only need one thing from it 😁😁
[2024-02-25T21:09:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you find zero And C type not good for me
[2024-02-25T21:12:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably g2 chats help you in that ,but owner of this chat builds one nowdays
[2024-02-25T21:13:25] Gabe Enzo: a g30 video would be good for him too. similar build.
[2024-02-25T21:13:34] Gabe Enzo: maybe @kawaiinekololis can help.

[2024-02-25T21:59:51] Jason Nelson: I measured the batteries when they were done charging and it was actually only .6 off, my batteries just don't charge to their full voltage so when you see that it's 1.5 to 2v lower than you think it should be that's a pretty significant percentage of the charge
[2024-02-25T22:00:24] Jason Nelson: I think g2 with snsn 11.5 inch suspension would be supreme
[2024-02-25T22:00:42] Jason Nelson: Better than inmotion s1
[2024-02-25T22:01:46] sombre_enfant: Jank
[2024-02-25T22:10:17] Konstantin: I'm order them too
[2024-02-25T22:10:31] Konstantin: Will see soon. 3-4 weeks +/-
[2024-02-25T22:19:38] Unknown: what would be not jank?
[2024-02-25T22:20:53] Unknown: dont you guys change the suspension?
[2024-02-25T22:21:11] Unknown: is the g30 suspension much better?
[2024-02-25T22:26:09] haku: with sombre everything is jank. hes french they classy
[2024-02-25T22:27:40] Unknown: if he is french, then im Jamaican

[2024-02-25T22:29:17] Mirono escooters: G2 suspension is quite ok
[2024-02-25T22:29:28] Mirono escooters: The front one had (has?) Issues
[2024-02-25T22:29:29] haku: sombre like LV, gucci and fendi leather on his scooters.
[2024-02-25T22:30:07] sombre_enfant: 20s4p good layout then if he go crazy the rest in a bag.
[2024-02-25T22:30:35] sombre_enfant: Far from that i just bet it all on tech strenght and price
[2024-02-25T22:30:47] haku: what if he puts it in a louis vuitton bag? still jank?
[2024-02-25T22:31:30] Gabe Enzo: 4p will be utterly useless to me when I get 22x3s in 2 months.
[2024-02-25T22:31:32] Gabe Enzo: I think ahead.
[2024-02-25T22:31:39] sombre_enfant: Yes

[2024-02-25T22:33:52] Unknown: i can find the g2 for $500 all the time on fb
[2024-02-25T22:34:03] Unknown: i can find the g30 for $230
[2024-02-25T22:34:12] sombre_enfant: Take g30
[2024-02-25T22:34:43] Gabe Enzo: I would personally take the g30.
[2024-02-25T22:34:59] Unknown: HMMMMMMM
[2024-02-25T22:35:09] Unknown: intersting
[2024-02-25T22:35:12] Gabe Enzo: Cheaper.

[2024-02-25T22:35:32] Unknown: oh right g30 is alu
[2024-02-25T22:36:04] Unknown: what if i want to jump it from a height and would prolly bend the alu? then what?
[2024-02-25T22:36:05] Unknown: hahahahah
[2024-02-25T22:36:14] Gabe Enzo: Suicide
[2024-02-25T22:36:17] Jan: You will also bend the G2 steel
[2024-02-25T22:36:22] Jan: Its a 2mm sheetmetal or so
[2024-02-25T22:36:24] Unknown: its that bad of steel?
[2024-02-25T22:36:26] Unknown: wtf
[2024-02-25T22:36:37] Unknown: damn i wish a bike company got in on this
[2024-02-25T22:36:43] Jan: There are no electric scooters for jumping
[2024-02-25T22:36:55] Unknown: it was just a theoretical
[2024-02-25T22:36:58] Gabe Enzo: Their build limits their ability for acrobatics.
[2024-02-25T22:37:02] Unknown: you gave me the right answer
[2024-02-25T22:37:10] Unknown: g30 it would be then
[2024-02-25T22:37:20] Gabe Enzo: You're looking into the g30 now yeah?
[2024-02-25T22:37:25] Gabe Enzo: I think it's a good choice
[2024-02-25T22:37:26] Mirono escooters: Fun fact, alu doesn't bend as steel
[2024-02-25T22:37:31] Mirono escooters: Steel will bend Alu will break
[2024-02-25T22:37:44] Unknown: well yeah, thats a point
[2024-02-25T22:37:49] Mirono escooters: It's downright stupid
[2024-02-25T22:37:52] Jan: If you want the most sturdy frame, go for a rental frame
[2024-02-25T22:37:56] Mirono escooters: XD yep
[2024-02-25T22:37:59] Jan: Like SNSC
[2024-02-25T22:38:00] Mirono escooters: Made to be abuse
[2024-02-25T22:38:02] Gabe Enzo: That shit is literally unbreakable
[2024-02-25T22:38:13] Gabe Enzo: Made to be used by normies
[2024-02-25T22:38:27] Gabe Enzo: Unsure if it's in America no?

[2024-02-25T23:02:56] Happy Giraffe: You guys should try a proper DH frame ebike and stop with the china scooters😘🌚
[2024-02-25T23:07:24] haku: you might be a pyro my boy.
[2024-02-25T23:08:03] haku: when i was a kid i was the same. but i used gunpowder
[2024-02-25T23:08:42] Happy Giraffe: 4p Molicel 45B?😁 Its good for 120A batt current
[2024-02-25T23:09:31] Gabe Enzo: p42a
[2024-02-25T23:09:41] Gabe Enzo: 30a constant no heat sure
[2024-02-25T23:09:44] Happy Giraffe: Then upgrade to 45B
[2024-02-25T23:11:35] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_13223@25-02-2024_23-11-35.jpg>
[2024-02-25T23:12:31] haku: is it okay for cells to reach 80c? ive bee. womdering this
[2024-02-25T23:13:05] puneDir: 94c and not burn?
[2024-02-25T23:13:07] haku: ive been told 40ts can do 45a
[2024-02-25T23:13:10] Happy Giraffe: 100% to 0% 30A load 70°c. Ofcourse will be bit different in a closed bag but you see how it is. Very well capable of 30A continuous. You cant press max throttle for more than 2 minute anyways on road
[2024-02-25T23:13:49] Happy Giraffe: Maybe small burst but way worse cell than 45B in every way than size😂
[2024-02-25T23:15:04] haku: p45b is top shelf.
[2024-02-25T23:15:21] Happy Giraffe: But here you see 4200mAh molicel deliver more energy than 50S thats 5000mAh cell at 30A😂
[2024-02-25T23:15:56] Happy Giraffe: Even at 20A the 50S is worse than 45B...
[2024-02-25T23:17:19] haku: do you have a table comparisson to 40t vs p42?
[2024-02-25T23:18:22] Happy Giraffe: <files/8A0A5499-786F-4F57-BCB4-4C9AD7C4F562 (1).jpeg>
[2024-02-25T23:18:30] Happy Giraffe: 40T by same tester
[2024-02-25T23:19:31] haku: dam.
[2024-02-25T23:20:08] haku: thats a big drop at 40a
[2024-02-25T23:20:12] Happy Giraffe: Not bad cell but runs a little hotter than P42A more noticeable vs 45B
[2024-02-25T23:20:15] Finn: what are the cells inside the G30 battery?
[2024-02-25T23:20:35] Unknown: whats it called when you like when things also blow up?
[2024-02-25T23:21:09] Unknown: i was the idiot who threw c02 carts from those bb gun pistols in bonfires
[2024-02-25T23:21:10] haku: 95c is thermal runaway teritory yea?
[2024-02-25T23:21:40] Happy Giraffe: Not sure, I wouldnt let my batteries run above 60°c lol
[2024-02-25T23:21:58] haku: can petg handle 60c?
[2024-02-25T23:22:39] Unknown: i also accidently like the fire travel to a gas can tip so i threw it into a pond that was in our yard, and the flames were so high it was licking the maple trees leaves lolol
[2024-02-25T23:23:48] Unknown: literally depends on per cell\
[2024-02-25T23:25:16] Unknown: 80c is plenty of lithium's max recommended tolerances
[2024-02-25T23:26:37] Unknown: and from what im looking up, anything above 35c can cause or will cause damage over time
[2024-02-25T23:26:47] puneDir: it can handle more
[2024-02-25T23:27:34] Unknown: anything above 90c is scary yeah
[2024-02-25T23:29:58] Happy Giraffe: Yes, but not sure if it deforms on long term use. Should not but it's plastic afterall. Glass transition temperature around 80c so that's the"melting" point
[2024-02-25T23:32:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: Because the range is like 60km
[2024-02-25T23:32:36] haku: pyromaniac is when you like to set things on fire i think but i dont like putting labels on people 😭
[2024-02-25T23:32:54] Unknown: labels are fun idek what you mean

[2024-02-25T23:33:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: Do you have pictures of it?
[2024-02-25T23:34:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: I cannot have afraid of heights
[2024-02-25T23:34:17] puneDir: no im going to print tmorrv

[2024-02-26T00:03:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I get it ,but still saying what i said before, packs can get tired by the lot charging, but that happens with grandma speed scooters, High end discharge all the time eats battery different
[2024-02-26T00:08:42] francois schempers: thanks @PaoloWu and @denis_yurev for the boost, every little bit helps 😁

[2024-02-26T00:15:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, its not really sure what's better ,but steel fixable on the otherhand you can book 3kg extra weight
[2024-02-26T00:16:28] Unknown: 6 and a half pounds?
[2024-02-26T00:16:32] Unknown: thats a decent amount
[2024-02-26T00:17:32] Unknown: i prefer steel on fixed gear bikes for example, but we're also not talking about some reynolds tube stuff when itcomes to scooters
[2024-02-26T00:17:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I had few different ones and i build a lot for customers and all of does are under test But had xiaomi,g30 ,oxo ,navee s65

[2024-02-26T00:19:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nope ,makes zero sense
[2024-02-26T00:19:35] Gabe Enzo: Just depends what you grew up with
[2024-02-26T00:19:40] Unknown: you'd have to be a man instead of a computer wiz to get it
[2024-02-26T00:19:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is a metric ppl chat basically
[2024-02-26T00:20:01] Unknown: i convert

[2024-02-26T00:24:29] francois schempers: @wired_on_coffee do one big message, instead of 5 small, easier to read, and chat is less spammed
[2024-02-26T00:25:59] Unknown: i have a whole set of taps
[2024-02-26T00:26:05] Unknown: like a big one

[2024-02-26T00:30:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I truly get what you say ,i had an mh1 extra pack from some older cells i had ,but they sagged a lot In the end of the day ,i would say whole pack remade ,was a waste of energy ,they worked up to lvl nice ,but my world started above ,so i changed it fast. And i made shit there self without vesc 😁
[2024-02-26T00:32:11] francois schempers: and I think this conversation has derailed enough to continue in off topic ;)
[2024-02-26T00:32:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't know if the pack of ruined
[2024-02-26T00:32:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: The experience I have is that lg mh1 are very resistant cells

[2024-02-26T00:51:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: It was not me that did this
[2024-02-26T00:51:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: This is stock
[2024-02-26T00:51:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Similar to oxo
[2024-02-26T00:51:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: Blade gt has 35a*2 controllers
[2024-02-26T00:51:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ok that's stock also
[2024-02-26T00:51:57] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I'm using 10s4p battery from same cells on my single motor Xiaomi and it's overheats everytime when the temperature on streets more than 10°😐😐
[2024-02-26T00:52:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2024-02-26T00:52:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Small pack
[2024-02-26T00:52:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Is it glued or plotted?
[2024-02-26T00:52:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have 16s6p on xiaomi from Panasonic bd
[2024-02-26T00:54:36] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Stock battery 🌚
[2024-02-26T00:55:00] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: how is it on practice? I'm using that for external battery right now
[2024-02-26T00:55:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Stock and overheats?
[2024-02-26T00:55:30] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: yup, I'm little overcurrenting it and I have higher kv motor than stock
[2024-02-26T00:55:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: Stock battery of xiaomi pro is mh1?
[2024-02-26T00:56:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: I think they are mh1 of 10a not 6a
[2024-02-26T00:56:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I was overcurrenting always, but i changed fast to greater S
[2024-02-26T00:56:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes
[2024-02-26T00:56:55] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: my opinion is ncr18650bd is just an fat version of Eve 26v with same specs but higher capacity so it's not 2.6ah(7.8a peak) but 3ah(9a peak) and it's cobalt when mh1/Samsung 32e is nickel
[2024-02-26T00:57:17] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: mh1/32e
[2024-02-26T00:58:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You should change to 21700
[2024-02-26T01:02:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: 21700 até expensive

[2024-02-26T05:31:16] Lyss: Hello everyone!!! So newbie dar dar vesc lady here. I have a electric skateboard it's a clients, I built a battery for it but I cannot get the remote to sync up it just flashes red the remote board seems to be communicating with the remote because when I turn it on it flashes fast and off it's a solid blue, but the remote has two red lights, no green. It's charged. The vesc boards 2 vedder.se old school mini USB cables I had to built a cable I connect to computer hoping maybe to update the firmware or something. But the only zip files I can get is Linux from vesc project website. So my question is there a vesc program available on win 10? Do I need to mini USB cables for each vesc board? Am missing some basic troubleshooting skills for the vesc? Thank you in advance I'm bangin my head against the wall over here... 😂🤔🤔🤔🤔

[2024-02-26T11:31:20] Konstantin: Solder another staff, and test gps , micro SD card ...
[2024-02-26T11:40:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hi Day Started early at work?😅 So shortly it would help if we would know what vesc and throttle you have ,so the setup, coz not all the same. Also vesc is not plug and play ,you need to setup all , what motor battery Throttle and so on And yes you only can do that via usb if you dont have Bluetooth modul connected, if you do you can do setup via bt http://VESC-PROjecT.COM Basic stuff you can get from here , register than you can dl free stuff ,like Windows tool After installed,as it starts up is slowly . And yes you get usb cable for each vesc normaly, its in the pack ,but you only use for setup , if it happens to be dual esc ,both needs setup
[2024-02-26T11:47:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You mean the wipe?
[2024-02-26T11:48:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats nice to have always

[2024-02-26T12:37:54] Happy Giraffe: 1/3 of it would be enough
[2024-02-26T12:38:12] Mirono escooters: You need purge line And it wastes like, nothing Don't overthink it
[2024-02-26T12:38:23] Mirono escooters: Also great first level checker..

[2024-02-26T12:53:21] Mirono escooters: I wanna mod printer and custom it xD
[2024-02-26T12:57:28] puneDir: When i was 12yo it was like 10 hr modding 30min printing And after every mod quality goes worse
[2024-02-26T12:58:05] Happy Giraffe: For me I would love to have consistent z offset that I wouldnt have to tune for every print for 4 restarts🌚
[2024-02-26T12:59:42] Mirono escooters: Bweh
[2024-02-26T12:59:51] Mirono escooters: Then you mod wrong

[2024-02-26T13:03:07] Happy Giraffe: It was like that when new but creality metal quality🔥❤️
[2024-02-26T13:04:17] Mirono escooters: Mine still work
[2024-02-26T13:04:20] Happy Giraffe: I should make my own from proper alu slotted profiles and Core XY setup
[2024-02-26T13:04:26] Mirono escooters: I don't wanna add double Z Altough I got the kit
[2024-02-26T13:04:31] Mirono escooters: I should add it
[2024-02-26T13:04:40] Mirono escooters: Like me with ender 6
[2024-02-26T13:05:06] Happy Giraffe: 400x400 and then some 150°c printbed and 400c°c nozzle would say hello to engineering materials
[2024-02-26T13:29:58] Gabe Enzo: the new solder I got is so shit I can't even finish this battery
[2024-02-26T13:30:00] Gabe Enzo: Omg

[2024-02-26T13:30:38] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2024-02-26T13:30:39] Gabe Enzo: still bad
[2024-02-26T13:30:44] Gabe Enzo: it literally won't stick
[2024-02-26T13:30:54] Happy Giraffe: Stannol is good
[2024-02-26T13:31:00] Gabe Enzo: what's that? a brand?
[2024-02-26T13:31:07] Happy Giraffe: Yes, german one
[2024-02-26T13:31:54] Gabe Enzo: I can usually work with cheap solder but this one takes the cake
[2024-02-26T13:32:03] Gabe Enzo: I got 100g for like 5€
[2024-02-26T13:32:31] Gabe Enzo: I have some industrial solder From my brother's tech class, I'll try see if that works
[2024-02-26T13:32:40] Gabe Enzo: Not alot of it I have tho
[2024-02-26T13:34:49] puneDir: Should i destroy the 20s7p and make 20s10p for zero?
[2024-02-26T13:35:28] puneDir: But too much work
[2024-02-26T13:38:42] Gabe Enzo: low and behind the old solder I had works
[2024-02-26T13:41:28] Gabe Enzo: is 14 awg enough for 35a constant?
[2024-02-26T13:41:37] Gabe Enzo: eh I'll double up, safe than sorry
[2024-02-26T13:42:37] Happy Giraffe: About in the limit if its a longer wire. AWG12 recommended
[2024-02-26T13:42:59] Happy Giraffe: Even small heat is just a waste of energy anyways
[2024-02-26T13:48:23] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13234@26-02-2024_13-48-23.jpg>

[2024-02-26T14:19:21] Lyss: Hey thank you so much for your response. Yes I work at night cause I need quiet to be efficient. My house is loco during the day jaja! Ok so I got this windows vesc tool I'm able to connect it says outdated firmware I need to update but I'm hesitant cause all configuration will be deleted and I really dot want to go through each spec or do any damage. I've been down this road with scooters years ago and I was into it but now I just want the thing to run and get paid ya know? Does it have options for programmed firmware? I just got the thing to run but it's blinking red green when charging , the remote works but only has one red light on the battery bars. I had a 60v battery previous I hasn't aware it needed specific battery details to function.
[2024-02-26T14:21:02] Lyss: But hell should I just bite the bullet and update? Cause it runs I could close it up and be done... But the thing goes too fast I'm amazed anyone can even ride it without going tits up face to pavement jajaja! Not funny but seriously

[2024-02-26T15:35:31] Yamal: Well, I can see on the internet that the vast majority of vesc are created for electric skates and those skates with a wheel in the middle, although some electric bicycles mount them, but the vast majority are for skateboards.....
[2024-02-26T15:36:12] Yamal: Trampa board?🧐

[2024-02-26T18:29:20] Gabe Enzo: 80100 can do quiet alot
[2024-02-26T18:30:10] Yamal: It is strong and resistant, right?
[2024-02-26T18:32:05] Happy Giraffe: Spintend 12 fet, you ride like a crazyman so need that for constant accelerations😂

[2024-02-26T18:36:42] Yamal: So 80v 100 is okay,,? Always I confused 150 is phase or battery?
[2024-02-26T18:39:09] Happy Giraffe: Phase in this case, 80100 wont be enough for you if you want 7-10kw per motor I think so better take the 250A 12fet one
[2024-02-26T18:39:23] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom can confirm as he has abused it more than I have
[2024-02-26T18:53:47] Mirono escooters: 🤷

[2024-02-26T19:18:01] Happy Giraffe: @mrstealyogirI you can order from amazon.de or too much trouble?
[2024-02-26T19:19:36] Gabe Enzo: they don't even want me to send that shit back
[2024-02-26T19:19:39] Gabe Enzo: thank the lord
[2024-02-26T19:19:50] puneDir: Turkey
[2024-02-26T19:20:06] puneDir: Which solder
[2024-02-26T19:26:28] Happy Giraffe: You were in Ireland currently correct? Still in EU🤔 So then amazon.de would have no tax. Or maybe amazon uk possible🤔
[2024-02-26T19:26:32] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13249@26-02-2024_19-26-32.jpg>
[2024-02-26T19:26:47] Gabe Enzo: I believe so
[2024-02-26T19:26:52] Gabe Enzo: Yes I use UK
[2024-02-26T19:27:16] Gabe Enzo: perhaps the most awful solder I have ever used. there's such impurities in it that won't even melt down fully. I have no idea how it's a real product
[2024-02-26T19:28:15] Gabe Enzo: I think I can. I'll check now.
[2024-02-26T19:28:15] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-26T19:28:40] Happy Giraffe: Lesson learned, not to buy 4 star rated items and to move into offtopic😂
[2024-02-26T19:32:42] Gabe Enzo: they want post money even though I have prime.
[2024-02-26T19:32:51] Gabe Enzo: Wtf, what the fuck is the reason for getting prime then
[2024-02-26T19:32:58] Gabe Enzo: absolutely a joke

[2024-02-26T20:28:21] Yamal: Like what controller❤️‍🔥..?
[2024-02-26T20:31:51] haku: use leaded solder 60/40
[2024-02-26T20:32:15] haku: if its legal there
[2024-02-26T20:32:28] Mirono escooters: Great
[2024-02-26T20:33:10] haku: idk why lead free solder is a thing.
[2024-02-26T20:34:46] haku: my dog and i do this. but i dont let him pull my heavy ass haha. i ride next to him at full gallop
[2024-02-26T20:45:35] Happy Giraffe: Damn palletfull of li-po cells🌚 Damn c4

[2024-02-26T21:08:00] sombre_enfant: All Israëli guy have it, i think only scooter they can get ask them
[2024-02-26T21:08:59] Mirono escooters: Pretty good, herodash also fan, me too
[2024-02-26T21:09:06] Mirono escooters: Just 1 swingarm weird but supposedly fine
[2024-02-26T21:13:33] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/9eEL1cJIkvI?si=CcCHLyVjzJA2Mrjw
[2024-02-26T21:13:59] haku: i thought china was the only one innovating
[2024-02-26T21:14:40] Gabe Enzo: No it literally didn't do anything LOL
[2024-02-26T21:14:44] Gabe Enzo: I tried trust me
[2024-02-26T21:14:54] Gabe Enzo: I used some solder from my brother's lab and it worked immediately
[2024-02-26T21:19:35] Gabe Enzo: @Happy_Giraffe what was that solder you recommend? Is it on Amazon UK?
[2024-02-26T21:20:09] Gabe Enzo: pretty much useless unless you're doing microsoldering. also I bet there's shit leaded solder as well.
[2024-02-26T21:20:10] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-26T21:22:42] haku: yes. alot of crap leaded solder from ali. get a good branded one.
[2024-02-26T21:23:17] Gabe Enzo: told my brother to grab me some from his school lab. I've never seen solder that good. And it's thick as hell too.
[2024-02-26T21:23:27] Gabe Enzo: Burns so we'll
[2024-02-26T21:23:39] Gabe Enzo: I'm low on cash rn
[2024-02-26T21:24:08] haku: i feel ya.
[2024-02-26T21:24:15] Gabe Enzo: spent 20 on a disposable today, I feel sick to my stomach
[2024-02-26T21:24:46] Gabe Enzo: could've bought more filament.
[2024-02-26T21:24:59] Gabe Enzo: I probably wouldn't do so if I didn't drink lean earlier
[2024-02-26T21:25:01] Gabe Enzo: I swear
[2024-02-26T21:26:29] Gabe Enzo: I know it's hard for you to believe but this solder literally couldn't even stick to copper
[2024-02-26T21:26:34] Gabe Enzo: Im not kidding
[2024-02-26T21:26:49] Gabe Enzo: no matter what
[2024-02-26T21:27:10] haku: it can also be your iron. haha
[2024-02-26T21:27:35] Gabe Enzo: True, I do need a new one. Actually I'll order some new tips and filament right now.
[2024-02-26T21:27:51] Gabe Enzo: just need someone to tell me what a good unleaded solder Brand on Amazon is
[2024-02-26T21:27:55] Gabe Enzo: it's hit and miss with Amazon
[2024-02-26T21:28:36] haku: atleast you can get branded ones in amazon.
[2024-02-26T21:28:47] Gabe Enzo: What ones that aren't wallet breaking?
[2024-02-26T21:30:03] haku: this one is made in china but good. TOWOT Tin Lead Rosin Core Solder... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0943TPRXK?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
[2024-02-26T21:30:21] Gabe Enzo: was just looking at that one, I'll plop it in the basket
[2024-02-26T21:30:55] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13251@26-02-2024_21-30-55.jpg>
[2024-02-26T21:30:59] Gabe Enzo: ironically cheaper than the solder I bought earlier
[2024-02-26T21:31:04] haku: mine is leaded though
[2024-02-26T21:31:17] Gabe Enzo: same brand, should be good.
[2024-02-26T21:31:23] Gabe Enzo: taking s guess
[2024-02-26T21:31:28] Gabe Enzo: worst case I file a return
[2024-02-26T21:31:40] haku: just get kester brand. its a known brand
[2024-02-26T21:32:03] haku: never used it though but ive read folks say its good
[2024-02-26T21:33:40] haku: i like this one too. good for thick wires. its 1.6mm. i use the leaded version
[2024-02-26T21:35:10] Mirono escooters: Leaded wins
[2024-02-26T21:35:22] Mirono escooters: I don't move from stannol Expensive but the boss.
[2024-02-26T21:36:19] haku: also clean your tips
[2024-02-26T21:36:40] haku: i wish we have that here
[2024-02-26T21:37:34] Mirono escooters: Sus
[2024-02-26T21:42:53] Gabe Enzo: My girlfriend does that for me
[2024-02-26T21:43:39] Gabe Enzo: the extender I printed is 1.5mm too low
[2024-02-26T21:43:45] Gabe Enzo: oh my fucking god
[2024-02-26T21:44:16] Gabe Enzo: i could just half ass it and use more silicone to solder the gaps, should I?
[2024-02-26T22:31:56] haku: i never print with regular supports always tree/branches style. this stuff is impossible to come off with petg.
[2024-02-26T22:32:27] Gabe Enzo: PLA snaps so well
[2024-02-26T22:32:44] Gabe Enzo: if only pla was heat resistant
[2024-02-26T22:33:38] haku: it does. but not petg. branch style is better for this filament
[2024-02-26T22:34:32] haku: whats the best way to print threads?
[2024-02-26T22:34:36] Happy Giraffe: Dont make it shit, make it properly
[2024-02-26T22:35:10] Happy Giraffe: In Z axis (x y plane)
[2024-02-26T22:35:22] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise will end up oval shape
[2024-02-26T22:35:40] haku: do you need supports still for the threads?
[2024-02-26T22:35:47] Happy Giraffe: Nope
[2024-02-26T22:36:04] haku: gotcha. i think thats how i messed up
[2024-02-26T22:36:04] Happy Giraffe: Just fine enough layer height like 0.2mm or so
[2024-02-26T22:36:19] Mirono escooters: Bwah just calibrate it
[2024-02-26T22:36:26] Mirono escooters: You'll regret rushing it
[2024-02-26T22:36:26] haku: yes i print at .2
[2024-02-26T22:36:54] Happy Giraffe: Me burning spintend v1 single as was in a hurry to pack it up😂
[2024-02-26T22:36:58] haku: it printed well. its the supports that wont come off
[2024-02-26T22:37:20] Happy Giraffe: Increase support to model z distance in slicer
[2024-02-26T22:37:24] haku: making a eagle talon back scratcher haha
[2024-02-26T22:37:48] Gabe Enzo: I kinda rushed the cell
[2024-02-26T22:37:50] Gabe Enzo: but not too much
[2024-02-26T22:37:57] Gabe Enzo: I'll regret it if it explodes
[2024-02-26T22:38:46] Gabe Enzo: to my knowledge it shouldn't short
[2024-02-26T22:39:03] haku: take your time like me. i give myself half a year to finish a scooter haha
[2024-02-26T22:40:32] Gabe Enzo: think this is shit?
[2024-02-26T22:40:46] Gabe Enzo: cheapest one
[2024-02-26T22:41:09] Mirono escooters: Cheap works
[2024-02-26T22:42:22] haku: i like sunlu. works for me
[2024-02-26T22:43:42] haku: idk what it will be long term though. it prints well for me
[2024-02-26T22:47:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: Teverun 7260r and I think wolf king gyt also
[2024-02-26T22:48:07] haku: nice. 90h motors straight off the factory.

[2024-02-26T22:49:52] haku: but you need 4 steering dampers ive read
[2024-02-26T22:50:25] sombre_enfant: No no no, its just 60h...
[2024-02-26T22:51:06] haku: you sure? that be cool if 90h off the factory
[2024-02-26T22:51:18] Yamal: You put Vesc..?
[2024-02-26T22:51:44] Yamal: Very big vesc..😁?
[2024-02-26T22:52:20] sombre_enfant: Will never happen.
[2024-02-26T22:53:18] haku: why is LY selling it though? theres no profit on single retail.
[2024-02-26T22:53:43] haku: have to think like a chinaman
[2024-02-26T22:55:09] sombre_enfant: Its like the 70h and 75h theres like 3 production scooter who have them and they dont sell much like less than 100 per year
[2024-02-26T22:55:48] haku: so this 90h is pretty much special order?
[2024-02-26T22:55:59] haku: for weped
[2024-02-26T22:56:55] haku: i want to fit a single motor 90h for g30 haha.

[2024-02-27T16:50:19] Gabe Enzo: If 3 die then the other 3 and 3 get disengaged

[2024-02-27T21:50:42] haku: for high discharge
[2024-02-27T21:53:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is not even vesc lol
[2024-02-27T21:56:59] haku: how much does 40t cost in EU? new cells?
[2024-02-27T21:58:30] Gabe Enzo: check nkon no
[2024-02-27T21:59:36] haku: i cant understand what nkon sells. different kinds of 40t
[2024-02-27T22:00:00] haku: is that the only source for trusted cells?
[2024-02-27T22:02:05] haku: 40t5 out available in EU. you guys advanced

[2024-02-27T22:40:19] haku: what motor 33x2 22x3?
[2024-02-27T22:49:56] Face de Pin Sucé: He's not a Rage Mechanics driver so I won't have any data on his races 😁
[2024-02-27T22:50:38] haku: its tuned by you right? or he just did it himself?
[2024-02-27T22:52:21] Face de Pin Sucé: We helped him but he did most of the work
[2024-02-27T22:57:29] sombre_enfant: Can you send link of the titane ?
[2024-02-27T22:58:45] Yamal: 33/2 (MHS) hight speed
[2024-02-27T23:09:26] haku: for track what is a better winding? im guessing 22x3 for fast aceleration yea?
[2024-02-27T23:12:30] Yamal: depends on the circuit
[2024-02-27T23:14:46] Yamal: I would like my next engines to be 33/2
[2024-02-27T23:16:56] haku: mine 17x4 if i dont get my desired burnouts
[2024-02-27T23:19:42] Yamal: Only I need the money, for a new frame, two new motors, two controllers, a high discharge battery and good brakes
[2024-02-27T23:21:03] Yamal: Nami come with 17/4
[2024-02-27T23:21:41] Yamal: No need , 22/3 good controller have torque”?
[2024-02-27T23:21:45] haku: no wonder they have so much torque.
[2024-02-27T23:24:51] haku: stock nami is 60h?
[2024-02-27T23:32:34] Yamal: Yes
[2024-02-27T23:36:25] Yamal: I think that generally all scooters come with 60h22/3, only Nami comes with 17/4
[2024-02-27T23:37:05] Yamal: It has torque but it is a little short at the top, a little below 100kmh
[2024-02-27T23:39:13] Yamal: Now the good and fun thing is to focus on second-hand scooters, the market is large, and enhance them to your liking! That's a real hook! I recently finished Nami and I'm already looking forward to starting a new project with a dualtron

[2024-02-28T02:36:23] Happy Giraffe: Is TRP the best 2.3mm rotor in 50€ price class? Im going to get some goodness for the Hope E4 brakes😁

[2024-02-28T02:46:07] Happy Giraffe: Saw those, 3.3mm but too big for E4/M4. Its only for v4😭
[2024-02-28T02:46:47] Happy Giraffe: I got Hope M4 from 2004🔥 Full CNC alu, thick yummy hoses etc
[2024-02-28T02:47:34] Happy Giraffe: Maguras feel so soft and springy compared to those Hopes. They are damn brutal
[2024-02-28T02:49:18] rosheee: ah u have that
[2024-02-28T02:50:03] rosheee: magura levers feel soft ^^ change the levers and the maguras calipers work ^_^❤️ but hope have more pad area - or at least it looks like they have more
[2024-02-28T02:55:59] rosheee: shimano saints + magura calipers ❤️ saints + magura calipers + steelflex ❤️ 612 levers + magura calipers + steelflex = ❤️❤️3«33«3❤️❤️❤️❤️
[2024-02-28T02:56:31] Happy Giraffe: Hope is raw power🔥 I just laughed when I brake on the 20 years old brakes that had been bled 10 years ago. Felt so nice😂
[2024-02-28T02:57:10] Happy Giraffe: Saint levers?🤔 Cost more than a set of magura?😂
[2024-02-28T02:57:15] rosheee: rofl?
[2024-02-28T02:57:23] rosheee: saint levers are like 50-60euro A PAIR
[2024-02-28T02:57:39] rosheee: mt7 levers are $$$ but crap ^^'
[2024-02-28T02:57:42] Happy Giraffe: Damn! Not a bad deal
[2024-02-28T02:59:00] rosheee: i used the hope 4 v4 x4 whatever they named on the gt2 nearly 1 year ago ^^' but front only and with the stock discs and like 50% touched the disc (pad - disc) and yah..it's easypeasy but saints have more directness, easy power and yah are easypeasy
[2024-02-28T02:59:26] rosheee: and the oil not fucks the environment ^^
[2024-02-28T03:00:11] Happy Giraffe: This defo a good thing about bio-mineral oil
[2024-02-28T03:01:38] Happy Giraffe: Can't wait to get, fit and repair the bbshd motor for vesc and feel some torque lol. Later with 72v battery should be about 250-300Nm torque on rear wheel...at just 4500w😅
[2024-02-28T03:03:43] rosheee: xd
[2024-02-28T03:04:59] rosheee: but hope nice 2 bleed ^^ but idk ^^' have to fix the hope calipers on the gt2 first 😆 have to find out how ^^' i think i need some adapter or so idk ^^' XD then u do fcking backflips with ur think and can tow cars xD
[2024-02-28T03:09:02] Happy Giraffe: Damn, I also gotta get a hope bleeding kit and bleed the brakes with DOT. Gotta choose dot 4 vs 5.1
[2024-02-28T03:12:16] rosheee: 5.1
[2024-02-28T03:12:23] rosheee: XD OMG u excited as hell 😆so good ❤️
[2024-02-28T03:13:16] Happy Giraffe: Seems 5.1 is the better one of what I read. Especially at -15c the shimano brake froze up and -20°c magura felt spongey. Mayne 5.1 will be more viscous in cold weather aswell🤔
[2024-02-28T03:13:54] Happy Giraffe: Yes...my first ever high performance bicycle. A stealthy bike having the power of a 125cc😁
[2024-02-28T03:21:43] rosheee: yes yah same as used for racecars i think

[2024-02-28T03:51:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: That is just my opinion
[2024-02-28T04:35:33] haku: word on the street is that rev rides going under. so sad to see china win. i blame banggood
[2024-02-28T04:39:00] haku: i did my part and bought my vsett from them. even though i think its overpriced. must be difficult to own a scooter/PEV shop in the US
[2024-02-28T06:57:05] sombre_enfant: Where ???

[2024-02-28T09:42:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wonder how good is that front fork

[2024-02-28T09:52:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's kinda explains the cabling ,i was looking why is that tape there
[2024-02-28T10:02:31] Yamal: A dualtron will be more stable, to a Nami in circuit than the slack right?
[2024-02-28T10:03:30] Yamal: In the end, when you visit a country you know perfectly well that you will visit other places and sites, not only what has to do with e-scooters.
[2024-02-28T10:05:55] Yamal: Do they now use a new one made by erexx?
[2024-02-28T10:20:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am not really a normal tourist type , how to explain this🤔 i use to travel a lot ,like there were years with 5-6 country/year Never visited any main tourist stuff like that was a thing i wanted to see, i am more into life and ppl , but sometimes these things meet
[2024-02-28T10:24:44] Yamal: <photos/photo_13292@28-02-2024_10-24-44.jpg>
[2024-02-28T10:25:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Design still the same anyway
[2024-02-28T10:25:35] Face de Pin Sucé: try to lean with the pressure, and you'll see the fork touching the track haha
[2024-02-28T10:28:53] Yamal: Now I understand you, you mean that the fork touches the ground if you tilt too much
[2024-02-28T10:29:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeap
[2024-02-28T10:31:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like when i went to Berlin, i went to have fun for a week and when i went there was festival of lights , what's pretty neat . When i arrived my mate came to the airport and asked Do i have something i want to see or such and i had non ,than he said I train you to be local ,so he picked two beers from his backpack and Started drinking inside the airport, and this continued on the train bus tram what ever 😁 I had flat in the party area. And till the morning come i knew how to get along the city and surly learnt what's a speti 😁 And what i meant under things meet is I went to C-base what is private club thingy let's say but pretty much know ,its hacker place I would say search on it ,but you find not too much what is going inside 🤣🤣
[2024-02-28T10:32:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Makes sense 😅
[2024-02-28T10:33:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Shock has stand out a lot 🤷‍♂ interesting choice for a speed vehicle
[2024-02-28T10:36:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: My question is more near, if does shocks work or not like 90x% of shocks
[2024-02-28T10:42:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Minimotors is a brand Vesc is project not one brand
[2024-02-28T10:58:48] Yamal: Well, the truth is that I don't know how they work, I've never tried a slack nor are there any in my country, I just know that I like the NUMO group and their career.
[2024-02-28T11:03:13] Yamal: momen tricher I like it more and more too, heh look the design is a little strange but it doesn't matter what's new and exclusive is always cool! and if it's powerful even more...

[2024-02-28T11:33:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: But people say is mutch more stable than vesc
[2024-02-28T11:33:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: Vesc burns a lot
[2024-02-28T11:33:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: Don't have have key working or screen

[2024-02-28T12:24:02] haku: nice weather
[2024-02-28T12:24:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: I didn't know about it how can I configure that?
[2024-02-28T12:25:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: Like I said I don't have Kelly I'm talking about people arguments
[2024-02-28T12:25:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: But this is a group os vesc so it's normal that is full of fan boys of vesc
[2024-02-28T12:25:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm a fan of vesc to
[2024-02-28T12:25:56] haku: laotie is the best scooter ever
[2024-02-28T12:25:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: My favorite contontroller
[2024-02-28T12:26:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: How can I configure it
[2024-02-28T12:26:48] Rogerio Figueiredo: I did burn my esc because in using 75100 V2 with 22s and brake at 5kmh
[2024-02-28T12:27:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: Only the ones you own all the rest suck
[2024-02-28T12:28:39] Happy Giraffe: We pick a few vesc desings that are good and others suck. Like the thermals on my first single vesc from spintend. So not fanboy but objective performance is only thing that matters here. Also running custom code etc is cool
[2024-02-28T12:29:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have two scooters with vesc my self and love it
[2024-02-28T12:30:02] Happy Giraffe: Nothing wrong with using other esc aswell but I got to be smoking if some 130€ esc comes close to spintend 80100😁
[2024-02-28T12:32:02] Yamal: No really hot…
[2024-02-28T12:33:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have 70€ flipky 75100 doing very god job so far
[2024-02-28T12:33:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I miss some features like key and stuff
[2024-02-28T12:34:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm still waiting so see how to configure brake power based on voltage tho
[2024-02-28T12:39:40] Rose: Hey there Alejandro, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-02-28T12:53:09] Rose: Hey there Alejandro, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-02-28T15:38:15] rosheee: never flipsky teh pls
[2024-02-28T15:38:43] Yamal: Some companies use the zero10x frame to make similar skates with its older brother zero11x, but the zero brand for me is from Falcon PEV although the frames all come from the same factory in China and they update with small details and their stickers
[2024-02-28T15:38:50] rosheee: bruno mars xD
[2024-02-28T15:38:57] rosheee: <sticker>

[2024-02-28T15:40:37] Yamal: Better g30 and Britney Spears
[2024-02-28T15:42:20] puneDir: Ohhh Thats why bottom sticker of my zero says falcon pev
[2024-02-28T15:43:06] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters is it better this time

[2024-02-28T17:56:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: With regen?
[2024-02-28T17:56:36] Happy Giraffe: Now gonna get ali digital caliper and test it against my micrometer😁
[2024-02-28T17:56:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Flipsky not the best brand, probably that ,but if you use it normaly, should be problemless
[2024-02-28T18:34:24] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_13312@28-02-2024_18-34-24.jpg>
[2024-02-28T18:34:55] Happy Giraffe: Not bad, within 0.01mm, within error of measuring
[2024-02-28T18:36:45] Happy Giraffe: Can slide the caliper back and forth very fast 20 times and still within 0.01mm😂
[2024-02-28T18:36:55] Mirono escooters: Ez
[2024-02-28T18:38:29] Happy Giraffe: Insanity this nice of a multimeter for 25€...ip54 as a bonus

[2024-02-28T18:50:47] haku: i will print this next
[2024-02-28T18:51:01] Happy Giraffe: Ahahahhahahah
[2024-02-28T18:51:15] Happy Giraffe: I got a decepticon logo on my bike
[2024-02-28T18:51:28] Happy Giraffe: Gotta laser engrave it to next one🤔
[2024-02-28T18:51:35] Mo: Anyone in England building scooters?
[2024-02-28T19:00:12] Yamal: Etorros I think,,🧐?
[2024-02-28T19:08:01] Mo: @EtorroS2020 ??
[2024-02-28T19:08:10] Mo: Is this him?

[2024-02-28T19:10:22] Yamal: Yes also have YouTube Chanel , I think start with vesc,, before kelly
[2024-02-28T19:13:08] sombre_enfant: Ah good machinist should always come out with some caliper and micrometer once he quit a job🤣
[2024-02-28T19:14:16] Happy Giraffe: Im not that desperate haha
[2024-02-28T19:14:50] sombre_enfant: I shouldve tbh....
[2024-02-28T19:17:17] Happy Giraffe: If boss is an asshole then sure😁

[2024-02-28T19:18:03] Happy Giraffe: The company Im going in took all workers to a weekend holiday in southern europe as a gift of making a nice yearly effort😁
[2024-02-28T19:22:54] Gabe Enzo: My sperg ass Would NOT do that so neatly
[2024-02-28T19:23:18] Gabe Enzo: what's all this for?
[2024-02-28T19:25:02] puneDir: Old balance cables went to there
[2024-02-28T19:25:45] puneDir: :D
[2024-02-28T19:26:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-28T19:27:14] Gabe Enzo: I planned my battery wrong and I didn't have space for copper wire so I just ended up using copper sheets around the thing
[2024-02-28T19:27:39] Gabe Enzo: I used 1cm wide, should be good for 40a. it's copper after all
[2024-02-28T19:30:33] Happy Giraffe: surely is, if its not 5 atoms thick
[2024-02-28T19:31:36] Gabe Enzo: I stole a nice pair of soldering goggles from the engineering lab today
[2024-02-28T19:31:45] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13318@28-02-2024_19-31-45.jpg>
[2024-02-28T19:32:01] Gabe Enzo: I mean not really steal, there was a box there full of them and they were all individually wrapped
[2024-02-28T19:32:09] Gabe Enzo: Logically anyone who needs them should take them that's why they're there
[2024-02-28T19:34:06] Happy Giraffe: school has more money than you anyways

[2024-02-28T19:41:10] sombre_enfant: Sorry now gatekeep time
[2024-02-28T19:42:25] Happy Giraffe: looks good
[2024-02-28T19:57:43] Mirono escooters: Dont regen above 84v and ur ok
[2024-02-28T19:58:59] haku: that suspension design the same as the nami one?
[2024-02-28T19:59:12] haku: the blast
[2024-02-28T20:00:01] haku: i like it looks beefy
[2024-02-28T20:01:34] Gabe Enzo: Can the 80100 work on 22s without regen?
[2024-02-28T20:01:37] Gabe Enzo: @TherealLizardDoggo
[2024-02-28T20:01:57] Gabe Enzo: Spintend
[2024-02-28T20:02:20] Gabe Enzo: It has 100v components? or does it. I just have a low amp 20s cell and was wondering if i can sneakily add +10% wattage by doing this.
[2024-02-28T20:07:12] Finn: Idk
[2024-02-28T20:07:17] Gabe Enzo: WOW it has been long since I saw an eBoard!
[2024-02-28T20:07:19] Finn: You ask me the same question 100 times
[2024-02-28T20:07:32] Finn: Write them and wait for them to answer
[2024-02-28T20:07:48] Gabe Enzo: I asked you once 😂😭
[2024-02-28T20:07:53] Finn: Naaah
[2024-02-28T20:07:56] Finn: 3times
[2024-02-28T20:14:18] haku: is voron printers still relevant today? i want to make one because of large prints
[2024-02-28T20:14:59] haku: i hope bambu makes a bigger printer
[2024-02-28T20:15:02] Yamal: Yes, but Nami blast only one arm in front and behind, this matter makes me a little distrustful, although it never breaks, and in terms of performance it is a light year away from blast, but very expensive........ ..
[2024-02-28T20:22:59] Happy Giraffe: Voron is bit hardcore stuff compared to Bambu xd Way more manual tuning and fiddling that maybe takes months to make it work
[2024-02-28T20:24:34] haku: naw. screw that then.
[2024-02-28T20:25:20] haku: i just want to print and go.
[2024-02-28T20:26:05] haku: i wish bambu make a p1s XL
[2024-02-28T20:26:18] Happy Giraffe: Maybe later at a higher pricepoint
[2024-02-28T20:27:03] Happy Giraffe: 300x300 volume printer like mine is currently going for 300usd but its slower and requires bit more maintenance and user checking
[2024-02-28T20:27:32] haku: atleast you can print full size helmets. my head too big
[2024-02-28T20:28:07] Happy Giraffe: mando was almost large enough, maybe if I used every mm of the plate and make it at an angle
[2024-02-28T20:28:26] Mirono escooters: I still got one vesc powered Just bad weather And so dangerous xD
[2024-02-28T20:28:31] Mirono escooters: I want with softer wheels
[2024-02-28T20:28:51] Happy Giraffe: Tho printer being crap the PLA popped off mid print and ruined it. Buildplate didnt stay still but bent a little during long printing
[2024-02-28T20:30:14] haku: need sacrificial vescs for the benefit of the community
[2024-02-28T20:30:55] haku: maybe pla warped. it happens on big prints with me
[2024-02-28T20:31:10] Mirono escooters: We sacrificed enough already 😂
[2024-02-28T20:31:20] Mirono escooters: Le bruh
[2024-02-28T20:31:27] Mirono escooters: Idk how
[2024-02-28T20:31:43] Mirono escooters: XD I printed Darth Vader helmet in like 8 pcs
[2024-02-28T21:04:56] haku: drill fights. https://youtube.com/shorts/kPCJP_OZXt0?si=HJWkzQ0dKS3KJW1A
[2024-02-28T21:07:43] Happy Giraffe: For drill fights watch Torque Test Channel
[2024-02-28T21:09:15] Happy Giraffe: Tried a Milwaukee at school, had worn out chuck. It was even a non-branded one so really poor first hands on experience. Would definitely need to be upgraded by a German Röhm chuck xD

[2024-02-28T21:37:18] haku: looks like 3shul or votol yea?
[2024-02-28T21:37:52] Happy Giraffe: two discs in rear? xd
[2024-02-28T21:40:22] Yamal: Only can see1..

[2024-02-28T21:48:00] Yamal: You work in fastride,,?
[2024-02-28T21:56:12] Happy Giraffe: Am I too tired or seeing ghosts?
[2024-02-28T21:56:49] Happy Giraffe: If thats single disc then really interesting design, hopefully not from Aliexpress😅
[2024-02-28T22:03:03] sombre_enfant: No, theres not only fastride in France...
[2024-02-28T22:03:30] sombre_enfant: Def from aliexpress.
[2024-02-28T22:05:05] Yamal: good ! In France you can really find all kinds of e-scooters, it's a shame you don't ride Vesc e-scooters that are so expensive
[2024-02-28T22:05:15] haku: this is a different motor that the other one. the other one is 90h
[2024-02-28T22:05:35] Yamal: Yes this is 80 I think he say
[2024-02-28T22:05:50] haku: i wonder why he changed
[2024-02-28T22:06:21] haku: maybe this is a better setup
[2024-02-28T22:08:02] haku: maybe he has multiple motors and unlimited funds for scooters. who knows
[2024-02-28T22:08:50] Yamal: He has a Thunder with yellow swingarms that look very good, apart from a zero11x, and a dualtron x, the world of modifications is simply wonderful
[2024-02-28T22:10:12] haku: i wish they had passionate folks modding scooters than surrons here.
[2024-02-28T22:13:24] Yamal: But you have in stock? And what more you have Momen, slack..?
[2024-02-28T22:22:26] sombre_enfant: The dog say it all, this breed go for 12k
[2024-02-28T22:23:04] haku: his dog is a poodle.
[2024-02-28T22:23:10] sombre_enfant: Not in stock, why buy 7k scoot u not sure to sell... But we ship in less than 96h
[2024-02-28T22:24:05] Yamal: 12 k no need for powerful escooter
[2024-02-28T22:24:16] haku: poodle is a french dog i believe. you can tell its french by the haircut too
[2024-02-28T22:25:41] Yamal: let's set high prices for a powerful modification

[2024-02-28T22:28:51] Yamal: 2-engine = €1000 2-controller= €1000 1- high discharge battery= €1000 brakes-500€ frame-? and going overboard, then I think that everything is cheaper if you go to the origin avoiding intermediaries...
[2024-02-28T22:41:41] Yamal: What I mean is that there is a range of powerful and very expensive vehicles that for less than half the price you can match in terms of performance but of course cooked at home.
[2024-02-28T22:47:59] sombre_enfant: Motor 450€ rim 300€ brake 200€ battery 600€ controller 400€ frame 700€

[2024-02-28T23:31:12] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-02-28T23:32:43] Yamal: If you don't like your frame, look in your city for a second-hand escooter, are there dualtrons,,kaabo,,?

[2024-02-28T23:39:52] Yamal: patience! Everything comes, Seeing your e-scooter finished is a satisfaction, but the process or path to achieve it is a great adventure that I would not change for anything!

[2024-02-29T02:18:24] Paolo ⁭: Petg Will never have good color as abs or pla, be cause it's little bit transparent
[2024-02-29T02:21:44] haku: petg and pla is pretty similar characteristics but petg just has a higher meting point?
[2024-02-29T02:29:35] Happy Giraffe: PLA tougher in and PETG stronger in another way😂
[2024-02-29T02:30:00] Happy Giraffe: Depends on how you load and orient it

[2024-02-29T09:43:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure also , pointless game , I mean for now 😁
[2024-02-29T09:47:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We had a " game" like this in high school,at the work side . Teacher didn't let any fights ,so if you guys could not stop, Teacher came draw two circles on the floor in hand far and till they didn't calmed ,they could slap eachother like in the video and you need to take it , game ended when they lost the hype after few slaps 🤣
[2024-02-29T09:54:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also there was another game ,what was kinda harder, but that's with only hand or with two fingers, this is a child game also ,just you play with full power. You really need hands of steel to take it after a while , coz whole hand feels burning, after 10 minutes you even feel it in your shoulders 😁
[2024-02-29T09:57:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Poor dogo

[2024-02-29T14:46:33] puneDir: But i have to buy vescs for zero first
[2024-02-29T14:49:03] Yamal: In the end I will have to buy a Xiaomi or a G30 to prepare it and make it a travel vehicle, so I can put it in the car and travel anywhere,,,,
[2024-02-29T14:49:40] Yamal: Dual?
[2024-02-29T14:51:56] Yamal: g30 more expensive on the second-hand market, but xiaomi can already be found at €100/150
[2024-02-29T14:59:43] puneDir: Yes for sure
[2024-02-29T15:04:49] Yamal: Anyway in my home like more minimotors, like Dualtron mini, or leger,,
[2024-02-29T15:05:59] Yamal: They don't like Xiaomi and they say that in Chinese that word means "crazy"😂
[2024-02-29T15:07:19] Gabe Enzo: Salvage the XT plugs
[2024-02-29T15:19:31] puneDir: I will Im going to repair it last time and remove the shunts
[2024-02-29T15:19:37] puneDir: Maybe it will work as it should
[2024-02-29T15:43:17] cihan: Can I use Shimano br-m375 mechanical disc brake caliper on 110mm disc of ninebot f2 pro?
[2024-02-29T15:44:20] cihan: Bicycle brake rotors are 140 mm or bigger. I'm not sure if I can use bicycle caliper on scooter. They're both post mount though.

[2024-02-29T16:00:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its basically not enough wide for rain riding
[2024-02-29T16:04:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need to check if caliper fits or not, Near the disc , check if 5 or 6 bolt hold it, xiaomi types have 5 So probably you have that too ,so only does good what made for that , you can find disc's in 110, 120, 135, 140 mm If 6 hole type search in bike life ,you find smaller ones there also
[2024-02-29T16:04:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Caliper fits xiaomi pro btw
[2024-02-29T16:05:05] Gabe Enzo: We are so fucking back

[2024-02-29T17:03:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't have the beta app on Mac is only for windows
[2024-02-29T17:03:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: Don't know why
[2024-02-29T17:07:31] Mirono escooters: Time to upgrade
[2024-02-29T17:07:35] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2024-02-29T17:45:31] Mirono escooters: Madlad
[2024-02-29T17:51:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ia have all systems but windows only only desktop
[2024-02-29T17:54:52] puneDir: is there anybody uses 84100hp
[2024-02-29T18:25:51] Izuna 生活: not done, but in progress
[2024-02-29T18:26:06] Izuna 生活: worst programming language to exist btw
[2024-02-29T18:26:09] Mirono escooters: O o
[2024-02-29T18:26:31] Izuna 生活: i always accepted it for being "easy" to program with, BUT ITS NOT. FUCKING CIRCULAR IMPORTS. WEIRD ASS LANGUAGE BUGS. IM A FUCKING RUST PROGRAMMER AND STRUGGLE WITH PYTHON
[2024-02-29T18:26:57] Izuna 生活: but im getting somewhere... slowly.
[2024-02-29T18:50:51] Happy Giraffe: Pokemon?😂
[2024-02-29T18:51:22] Happy Giraffe: Out of beta?
[2024-02-29T19:13:05] puneDir: Or i might get 75100 and mod it
[2024-02-29T19:13:21] Happy Giraffe: 80100 no?
[2024-02-29T19:13:39] puneDir: 84100hp is much more pricey
[2024-02-29T19:13:55] puneDir: I need some money lol I also want 84100
[2024-02-29T19:25:28] Mirono escooters: Not that more expensive right
[2024-02-29T19:26:05] Mirono escooters: No way rust programmer can't handle it
[2024-02-29T19:26:09] puneDir: idk but theres 40 euro difference
[2024-02-29T19:26:18] Mirono escooters: Respect programmers That's a part of me thats incapable
[2024-02-29T19:27:21] Gabe Enzo: Ugh I can't find the right phase
[2024-02-29T19:27:23] Gabe Enzo: fuck sake
[2024-02-29T19:27:36] Gabe Enzo: already tried 10 different combinations
[2024-02-29T19:27:43] Gabe Enzo: well not different it seems got it finally
[2024-02-29T19:37:52] Yamal: Maybe spintend is the best quality-price option on the market..?
[2024-02-29T19:43:00] Mirono escooters: Makerbase is 😳🤐
[2024-02-29T19:43:19] Mirono escooters: Looking at value per money, defenitely And its only improving I wanna try a 80100
[2024-02-29T19:48:33] Yamal: 150 a phase ?
[2024-02-29T19:49:01] puneDir: I want to be first one who tries it
[2024-02-29T19:49:09] Mirono escooters: Should do it easily
[2024-02-29T19:49:11] Mirono escooters: Well then
[2024-02-29T19:49:30] puneDir: Im trying to sell some stuff
[2024-02-29T19:49:37] Yamal: But no more and 200a ? Good cooling they say..
[2024-02-29T19:49:45] Mirono escooters: Foot pics?
[2024-02-29T19:49:52] Mirono escooters: It's 6 fet, don't expect wonders
[2024-02-29T19:49:59] Mirono escooters: It won't do more or less then Spintend
[2024-02-29T19:50:01] puneDir: Nah Batteries
[2024-02-29T19:50:09] Mirono escooters: Yes alupcb is perfect cooling
[2024-02-29T19:50:14] puneDir: I need 250 euro for 2 84100hp
[2024-02-29T19:50:22] Mirono escooters: I like makerbase Flipskys better brother
[2024-02-29T19:50:48] Yamal: Better than spintend?
[2024-02-29T19:50:59] puneDir: 75100 or 75100 alu no
[2024-02-29T19:51:17] puneDir: But no one tried 84100 But according to features it is better than spintend
[2024-02-29T19:54:37] sombre_enfant: Send your Cashapp i feel like misto beasto today
[2024-02-29T19:58:29] Mirono escooters: The files are online Is better See Engineer thread on esk8
[2024-02-29T19:59:36] puneDir: We dont also have that in turkey :D Thanks anyways ♥️
[2024-02-29T19:59:56] puneDir: Yes i saw them

[2024-02-29T20:17:15] puneDir: Yeah i know him from irl also from tg
[2024-02-29T20:17:39] puneDir: Also we Cruised with him last month Was fun
[2024-02-29T20:18:20] Yamal: Hehe nice !
[2024-02-29T20:19:39] Yamal: You can see a cool group with big scooters, I can also see from their channel that practically all brands of scooters have arrived in Turkey
[2024-02-29T20:19:54] puneDir: And theyre all shit
[2024-02-29T20:20:02] puneDir: Onvo yuki etc etc
[2024-02-29T20:20:06] puneDir: E waste
[2024-02-29T20:20:44] Yamal: I see Dualtron all, teverum
[2024-02-29T20:21:14] puneDir: Ah yeah
[2024-02-29T20:21:47] Yamal: King gt
[2024-02-29T20:23:53] Yamal: Nami?
[2024-02-29T20:32:30] Yamal: You modify the rear fork on the G30 to fit a larger engine, right?
[2024-02-29T20:33:30] Yamal: by True, a g30 with 75h engines would be very funny, has anyone seen it?
[2024-02-29T20:35:36] rosheee: nope
[2024-02-29T20:37:51] Yamal: 250€
[2024-02-29T20:38:18] sombre_enfant: 70-75h are same size, yes i seen one with 70h the french guy but his front motor stinks
[2024-02-29T20:38:24] sombre_enfant: Bad, its le
[2024-02-29T20:39:10] Yamal: 250 to

[2024-02-29T20:40:35] rosheee: idk magnetz of them
[2024-02-29T20:41:26] sombre_enfant: 60h, rion style
[2024-02-29T20:41:32] haku: what do you mean by 70h-75h is the same size?
[2024-02-29T20:42:42] sombre_enfant: Axis and casing, its like 2mm larger...
[2024-02-29T20:42:55] Yamal: Wou
[2024-02-29T20:43:55] haku: yes that french dude got 70h to fit. if he can do that you can prolly mod it to fit 90h
[2024-02-29T20:44:21] sombre_enfant: Hell nah
[2024-02-29T20:44:32] puneDir: Yes
[2024-02-29T20:44:32] haku: deck space will not be enough to power that though
[2024-02-29T20:45:05] Yamal: Rion motor with slick is just nice❤️‍🔥
[2024-02-29T20:45:44] Happy Giraffe: Damn dude was ripped off with 0.2€ cells
[2024-02-29T20:45:44] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_13372@29-02-2024_20-45-44.jpg>
[2024-02-29T20:46:31] sombre_enfant: Exact, 5p is tight with that... Idk if i go 5p and XX100 vesc or 6p XX250 vesc but way larger spacer
[2024-02-29T20:46:32] haku: this is the only part i dont cheap out on. cells.
[2024-02-29T20:46:49] puneDir: 1.7v wtf how it didnt went to 0
[2024-02-29T20:55:33] haku: dam $1500 for a amazon battery. crazy
[2024-02-29T20:57:20] haku: lives near me too
[2024-02-29T21:03:19] Gabe Enzo: Seems the cells still have an issue with only being 81.8v when fully charged. Other than that I still haven't went out on it to check if the resistance issue is still present
[2024-02-29T21:03:37] Gabe Enzo: So I can't make any assumptions (yet)
[2024-02-29T21:04:47] Happy Giraffe: Charger stops early?
[2024-02-29T21:05:09] Happy Giraffe: Or bms setting? Does charger use CC-CV protocol?
[2024-02-29T21:05:27] Gabe Enzo: It's a 20s charger 5a from Amazon
[2024-02-29T21:05:30] Gabe Enzo: Seems so
[2024-02-29T21:05:33] Gabe Enzo: Actually
[2024-02-29T21:05:45] Gabe Enzo: it shows 84v then drops as soon as I take the charger out
[2024-02-29T21:06:57] Happy Giraffe: BMS setting? I think bms or shitty charger that lacks protocol
[2024-02-29T21:07:40] Gabe Enzo: I balanced them all, They are all in the same formation they were last time. Means half of these cells must be dead. what a bummer
[2024-02-29T21:07:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: I want know that too
[2024-02-29T21:07:49] Gabe Enzo: Non smart BMS
[2024-02-29T21:08:05] Gabe Enzo: This battery doesn't deserve a smart bms
[2024-02-29T21:08:12] Gabe Enzo: The new one will.
[2024-02-29T21:08:48] Gabe Enzo: 4.1v cells all in their own half and 3.8v cells all in their own halves, and perfectly matched
[2024-02-29T21:10:45] puneDir: @mrstealyogirI measure balance cables
[2024-02-29T21:10:56] puneDir: Also why you dont get smart bms with active balance
[2024-02-29T21:11:11] NetworkDir: What features 84100 have and spintend dont have?
[2024-02-29T21:11:28] puneDir: Mirono said its better than spintend
[2024-02-29T21:11:35] puneDir: Bt and some other things
[2024-02-29T21:11:58] puneDir: Its nice to always look to this and smile :D

[2024-02-29T21:13:09] puneDir: i need some of them to get this running
[2024-02-29T21:13:40] puneDir: They trace cutted the en pin from regulator and added a switch
[2024-02-29T21:13:57] puneDir: Yes but cengiz said its possible to make it work in normal way
[2024-02-29T21:14:19] NetworkDir: Still i think spintend build and components have a better quality.
[2024-02-29T21:14:43] puneDir: No you only need 2 resistors or 1
[2024-02-29T21:14:58] puneDir: Spinted had solder blob issue some time ago
[2024-02-29T21:15:23] puneDir: Idk i havent fully understand what he said
[2024-02-29T21:16:12] puneDir: I really like how it looks
[2024-02-29T21:16:20] puneDir: My alupcbs was clean
[2024-02-29T21:17:17] puneDir: That sucks
[2024-02-29T21:18:10] haku: is it mandatory to open and clean spintend when purchased from amy?
[2024-02-29T21:19:25] Gabe Enzo: what I mean is I only grouped each P with the adequate voltage
[2024-02-29T21:19:39] Gabe Enzo: 4.08v cells with 4.06v cells and so on
[2024-02-29T21:19:57] Gabe Enzo: In the same P the voltage is identical.
[2024-02-29T21:20:08] Gabe Enzo: the series yes.
[2024-02-29T21:20:14] Gabe Enzo: Each series is different
[2024-02-29T21:20:34] Gabe Enzo: Won't this issue fix itself?
[2024-02-29T21:21:33] Gabe Enzo: I know for a fact I'm not gonna tear down this cell again 😭 I'll leave it be
[2024-02-29T21:21:36] Gabe Enzo: fuck that
[2024-02-29T21:22:04] Gabe Enzo: in theory the cells should balance eachother if left charging long enough no?
[2024-02-29T21:22:09] Gabe Enzo: Like 2 days on charge
[2024-02-29T21:22:59] Gabe Enzo: I'll use the cell as is and see if the range is still bad. I'm sure the balance isn't the reason for the range being so horrible.
[2024-02-29T21:23:07] Gabe Enzo: 3.9v cells should go way further than 15km
[2024-02-29T21:23:35] Gabe Enzo: issue I had last time before I rebuilt it.
[2024-02-29T21:24:03] Gabe Enzo: Yeah they're about 5 years old, sure they have 300 cycles but this seems like kicking a dead horse.

[2024-02-29T22:34:14] Jacob: Any rule for determining if the setup is capable? It should be im running 2x 2 max 20-25a batteries and a vesc and monorims 500w motor

[2024-02-29T22:34:55] sombre_enfant: Tp4056 clutched
[2024-02-29T22:35:17] sombre_enfant: Yeah idk what the max it can do
[2024-02-29T22:36:51] sombre_enfant: P5 has an issue i think can i check with ir tester ?
[2024-02-29T22:37:09] Mirono escooters: It should be able to do that
[2024-02-29T22:37:24] sombre_enfant: Maybe p9 too omg
[2024-02-29T22:38:16] sombre_enfant: I need to find 2.6ah cells 10A i think
[2024-02-29T22:38:39] sombre_enfant: No laying it, but when it discharge i had issue with i think
[2024-02-29T22:39:40] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_13378@29-02-2024_22-39-40.jpg>
[2024-02-29T22:40:24] sombre_enfant: It charge faster also so i really dont know, i think i killed vesc this way also, i had many lov voltage cut even my param cant allow it
[2024-02-29T22:41:24] Mirono escooters: That's dead man
[2024-02-29T22:41:27] Mirono escooters: Why use that
[2024-02-29T22:41:43] sombre_enfant: Well i dont have controll no more
[2024-02-29T22:41:46] Mirono escooters: Understandable lol
[2024-02-29T22:42:28] Mirono escooters: Sensible thinking and limits
[2024-02-29T22:42:42] sombre_enfant: But it dont
[2024-02-29T22:43:05] Mirono escooters: Shit pack then, just repair or replace
[2024-02-29T22:43:08] Mirono escooters: It's not a fix xD
[2024-02-29T22:43:13] Mirono escooters: Or well, active balancer
[2024-02-29T22:43:16] haku: is this your new battery?
[2024-02-29T22:43:25] sombre_enfant: Nope
[2024-02-29T22:43:51] sombre_enfant: If it does i will stole paolo's spaghetti in his town
[2024-02-29T22:48:19] Jacob: Aight im just gonna try and see how my system reacts, ill try go up slow, 100a phase current 30a from battery, and watch heat and hopefully not overload a battery
[2024-02-29T22:54:34] Gabe Enzo: I could charge each series all separately to 100.
[2024-02-29T22:54:44] Gabe Enzo: wont have to deweld the pack even
[2024-02-29T22:54:57] Gabe Enzo: charge the 4p all at one time.
[2024-02-29T22:55:12] Gabe Enzo: Just have no kapton or heat shrink it all went towards that cell
[2024-02-29T22:56:18] Gabe Enzo: Replacement soon anyways, just a bummer cause I wanted something to ride on for the moment.
[2024-02-29T22:56:18] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-29T22:58:09] Mirono escooters: Not you
[2024-02-29T22:58:23] Mirono escooters: Or was it ur batt
[2024-02-29T22:58:44] Gabe Enzo: Oh nvm we got 2 similar situations occurring at the same time
[2024-02-29T23:03:11] haku: does asa filament need a dehydrator?
[2024-02-29T23:05:20] haku: has anyone used this filament?
[2024-02-29T23:05:38] haku: seems like the best choice for scooter parts.
[2024-02-29T23:14:37] Yamal: haku it would be funny to buy him the frame with which you are going to destroy his new model😁
[2024-02-29T23:15:43] haku: i wish i was ballin like that. buy a full scooter and gut it 😭
[2024-02-29T23:17:01] haku: dont hype me bro. niggas might come for me. haha
[2024-02-29T23:17:16] sombre_enfant: Ni what bro ?
[2024-02-29T23:18:01] haku: hood niggas. is what i meant.
[2024-02-29T23:18:41] haku: gangstas.
[2024-02-29T23:21:34] haku: cant i say it. its in every song.
[2024-02-29T23:22:36] Yamal: Also AliExpress have frame , but no nice …
[2024-02-29T23:25:04] Yamal: Your frame I think is okay
[2024-02-29T23:26:21] Yamal: Later I show you one frame allmost the same and look nice ,, just I need remember the brand…
[2024-02-29T23:40:08] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/yoQQ73FzQHw?si=YeOlB7sTLU1KcLTi
[2024-02-29T23:43:04] Yamal: For me is nice , for put vesc heh
[2024-02-29T23:43:04] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-02-29T23:44:14] haku: what is that. look like a nami ripoff.
[2024-02-29T23:44:33] haku: looks cool though
[2024-02-29T23:46:31] Yamal: I liked it when I saw it a long time ago, it looks robust and the suspension system and front fork gives me confidence, it has nothing to do with a nami, because you can see some tubes on the sides,,
[2024-03-01T00:24:42] cihan: Are cable pull hydraulic calipers on AliExpress really bad? People praise trp hy/rd a lot but they're not sold in Turkey now and will be double US price if sold probably. Magura MT 5-e is already out of my budget. I was thinking of Shimano br-m375 however dual piston seems more charming now. Especially cable pull hydraulic ones.
[2024-03-01T00:27:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sry busy to answer,but ali type of that brake you say is kinda 1 years working,clone of an old Shimano,but thats expensive still and I forgot the name
[2024-03-01T00:28:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Anyway
[2024-03-01T00:28:14] Happy Giraffe: 100A phase for single monorim motor is a lot, I would use something like 80A and ferrofluid it
[2024-03-01T00:28:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13381@01-03-2024_00-28-23.jpg>
[2024-03-01T00:28:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bloody ender
[2024-03-01T00:28:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤣🤣🤣
[2024-03-01T00:28:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://fullcontrol.xyz/#/models/67cf20
[2024-03-01T00:28:58] haku: wow.
[2024-03-01T00:29:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And fun fact is heat was not to good at first, draw made for pla
[2024-03-01T00:29:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So bottom ring missing
[2024-03-01T00:29:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So really stands on that shit leg 🤣
[2024-03-01T00:30:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not perfect but just changed nozzle and realised this is longer,so modified z stop ,but still too close
[2024-03-01T00:31:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Before it was too far 🤣
[2024-03-01T00:31:07] haku: what nozzle did you use?
[2024-03-01T00:31:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Size is same
[2024-03-01T00:31:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 0,4 for this
[2024-03-01T00:32:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And i changed old 0,4 what was brandless to new creality one
[2024-03-01T00:32:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Waiting for 0,8 now ,tested 1 mm one ,was crying to see how that eats filament🤣
[2024-03-01T00:33:07] haku: i was trying that yesterday. i couldnt understand the program. how to upload to printer slicer
[2024-03-01T00:33:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure how it works in bambo
[2024-03-01T00:33:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe you need to copy paste gcode
[2024-03-01T00:34:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz it gives you sliced thing
[2024-03-01T00:34:20] haku: i dont know how to do that. i dont think you can with bambu
[2024-03-01T00:34:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not stl
[2024-03-01T00:34:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sadly i cant help you
[2024-03-01T00:34:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You should find some bambo group
[2024-03-01T00:34:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Here on tg
[2024-03-01T00:35:01] haku: maybe if i change slicer
[2024-03-01T00:44:54] Jacob: Good advice!
[2024-03-01T00:52:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically this file doesnt need one ,site is slicing and all you can setup is what you see there
[2024-03-01T01:06:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This looks nice from this distance, sadly the subs hide suspension working, wacthed in slow motion ,but promesing Some else had the idea of the pitbike suspension
[2024-03-01T01:43:04] haku: @Mirono_escooters @Happy_Giraffe looks like qs273 used as a midrive. thoughts on this
[2024-03-01T01:43:05] haku: <photos/photo_13383@01-03-2024_01-43-05.jpg>
[2024-03-01T01:47:14] rosheee: XD
[2024-03-01T01:47:59] Happy Giraffe: IPM motor just better as a mid drive, I see no point of using a hub as mid drive
[2024-03-01T01:48:45] haku: also too wide to fit it as a middrive. waste of space
[2024-03-01T01:49:16] Happy Giraffe: QS165 similar size and much more optimized for that. Even QS90 might offer same amount of power at much smaller package
[2024-03-01T01:50:04] Happy Giraffe: The thing that makes IPM beautiful is the cooling of windings and the ability to use field weakening or MTPA effectively
[2024-03-01T01:51:11] haku: can you not use field weakening on this?
[2024-03-01T01:55:18] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt help as much on hubs
[2024-03-01T03:20:36] Happy Giraffe: Need a reversed key😂
[2024-03-01T03:21:13] Happy Giraffe: Or just one that can be removed at both positions🤔 plenty of those
[2024-03-01T03:33:56] Happy Giraffe: 3D printer go brrr
[2024-03-01T03:50:20] Happy Giraffe: Haha, yes I can share my stl with you but created just two c shapes that use heat inserts to screw them into each other. Bottom C shape had the compartment for key. Worked very nicely, the lid I designed to fit quite tight so I can silicone it shut and open if needed
[2024-03-01T03:52:01] Tommy ª: guys, anyone can give me a small hand on lisp? i need to code a small output
[2024-03-01T07:04:15] Yamal: Finish the week
[2024-03-01T07:04:15] Yamal: Finish the week
[2024-03-01T07:04:16] Yamal: Finish the week
[2024-03-01T09:13:54] puneDir: Or weak weld
[2024-03-01T09:15:15] puneDir: I would suicide if my 20s7p has a weak weld
[2024-03-01T09:15:28] puneDir: Its literally impossible to unpack it
[2024-03-01T09:15:41] puneDir: 10000x isolation+ tape + glue + fishapper + plexy
[2024-03-01T09:21:59] puneDir: Its well balanced for now
[2024-03-01T09:22:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-03-01T11:13:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did you maybe try @kawaiinekololis ? Since he surly knows
[2024-03-01T11:38:34] Gabe Enzo: 80a phase for the 500w? you're tripping bro that'll melt it within a week. 65a max and thats pushing it
[2024-03-01T11:39:03] Gabe Enzo: 300w xiaoshit can barely handle 50a phase without boiling
[2024-03-01T11:40:18] Gabe Enzo: What are you planning on dual? if so it's fine go ahead
[2024-03-01T11:40:53] Tommy ª: Actually the pro2 takes 73amps before gets saturated or fail, also you only have 20secs before get smoke It's nice for a temp impulse, not great for constant
[2024-03-01T11:42:19] Gabe Enzo: offtopic
[2024-03-01T11:42:19] Jacob: Lol i set it to 100a but i dont even think i need that much, up the steepest hill in my city it used 60a and was at 33c
[2024-03-01T11:42:41] Gabe Enzo: do you have a temp sensor Jacob
[2024-03-01T11:42:51] Jacob: Any motors you guys can recommend that works with 12s? Since i hear monorim is bad
[2024-03-01T11:44:15] Jacob: Yeah for motor but none of my batteries :/
[2024-03-01T11:44:46] Jacob: Should i even be worried about battery temps?
[2024-03-01T11:46:49] Gabe Enzo: You shouldn't even be using the cell if it has no temp sensor
[2024-03-01T11:46:50] Gabe Enzo: Bro
[2024-03-01T11:47:08] Gabe Enzo: I'm usually not serious but this is serious
[2024-03-01T11:47:52] Gabe Enzo: What cell do you have even?
[2024-03-01T11:48:08] Jacob: Goddamn the hell do i do now, the first is a good external from denis yurev 44v
[2024-03-01T11:48:24] Gabe Enzo: Ask him what the specs of it are
[2024-03-01T11:48:28] Gabe Enzo: could be fine
[2024-03-01T11:48:32] Gabe Enzo: He's a good builder.
[2024-03-01T11:48:35] Jacob: The internal was monorim 48v that broke, where mirono removed bad cell and put new bms
[2024-03-01T11:48:58] Jacob: Yeah mirono is pretty sure both batteries can handle 20-25a each
[2024-03-01T11:49:10] Gabe Enzo: OK should be fine but never surpass that unless u got a sensor
[2024-03-01T11:49:11] Jacob: So now its 44v
[2024-03-01T11:49:21] Gabe Enzo: my cells have shut down many times, it is essential for low amp cells
[2024-03-01T11:49:21] Jacob: Good idea
[2024-03-01T11:49:32] Gabe Enzo: Took it out and it was boiling
[2024-03-01T11:49:33] Gabe Enzo: deadass
[2024-03-01T11:49:46] Jacob: But what happens if tou overload cells? Kaboom?
[2024-03-01T11:49:51] Gabe Enzo: Yeah
[2024-03-01T11:49:57] Gabe Enzo: Venting
[2024-03-01T11:50:04] Gabe Enzo: entire scooter turns to char
[2024-03-01T11:50:04] Jacob: 😵‍💫 nice to know
[2024-03-01T11:50:19] Jacob: Ill just stay at 30-35a combined
[2024-03-01T11:50:30] Gabe Enzo: it's parallel ya?
[2024-03-01T11:50:36] Gabe Enzo: You got 2x 10s?
[2024-03-01T11:50:37] Jacob: Yup y cable
[2024-03-01T11:50:42] Jacob: 2x 12s
[2024-03-01T11:51:26] Gabe Enzo: You can probably do 40-45a but don't take this for granted
[2024-03-01T11:51:42] Gabe Enzo: grain of salt
[2024-03-01T11:51:50] Jacob: Yeah thats why i stay at 30-35a to be safe
[2024-03-01T11:52:01] Gabe Enzo: 35a X 44v that's a nice 1kw
[2024-03-01T11:52:04] Jacob: I've burned 7 esc with this setup 😂
[2024-03-01T12:33:44] Awyba: Almost every Motor works with 12s its rather a matter of how much power in total you want to push
[2024-03-01T14:11:56] Jacob: Hey i just bought this lovely full hydralic shimano brake, i just wonder now that theres liquid inside the cable how do i get through the tube?
[2024-03-01T14:23:34] puneDir: Remove liquid remove cable pass the cable refill
[2024-03-01T14:24:22] puneDir: Also if you dont have mineral oil you can use total lhm plus or baby oil (In my case baby oil does better job than shimano mineral)
[2024-03-01T14:29:33] Happy Giraffe: I doubt it leaks much because of capillation effect. You will have to bleed those brakes anyways
[2024-03-01T14:30:19] Happy Giraffe: Even xiaomi esc did 80A phase for monorim😁 ofcourse if you abuse or ride incorrectly it will burn without sensor
[2024-03-01T14:31:15] Happy Giraffe: 500w one has temp sensor?🤔
[2024-03-01T14:31:29] puneDir: 150a phase 20s g30 motor on single
[2024-03-01T14:31:34] puneDir: it did lasted pretty long
[2024-03-01T14:40:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lovely pics you see nothing 😁
[2024-03-01T14:42:24] Jacob: Ahhh thanks :)
[2024-03-01T14:42:39] Jacob: Ill send another when i get home ;)
[2024-03-01T14:42:49] Jacob: Its prefilled :)
[2024-03-01T14:43:12] puneDir: Yes but you still have to bleed
[2024-03-01T14:44:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I guess from what you said thats a bl or br mt200😏
[2024-03-01T14:44:47] Jacob: Yeah the shimano mt201 😎
[2024-03-01T14:45:04] Jacob: Goddamn this scoot is making me poor
[2024-03-01T14:46:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Imagine when you spend on others scooters and need to beg for your own money
[2024-03-01T14:47:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also upgrades are serving you
[2024-03-01T14:47:17] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-03-01T14:48:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Speed was main thing to see?
[2024-03-01T14:49:28] Yamal: <photos/photo_13389@01-03-2024_14-49-28.jpg>
[2024-03-01T14:49:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you cut tubing,you surly will need to bleed it ,what needs some kind if bleeding kit and oil
[2024-03-01T14:49:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also 😁 i would recommend good oil what's ment for it
[2024-03-01T14:50:19] Jacob: Goddamn man, thats not a scoot thats an electric motorcycle 😂
[2024-03-01T14:50:40] Jacob: The bike shop is cutting it and everything for me now :)
[2024-03-01T14:50:57] Jacob: 100€ poorer 🥲
[2024-03-01T14:51:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Good
[2024-03-01T14:51:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brake and work?
[2024-03-01T14:51:43] Jacob: Jup new mechanical back and hydralic shimano front
[2024-03-01T14:51:45] Yamal: For now, yes, professor, I'm still a newbie at this!😂❤️‍🔥
[2024-03-01T14:52:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And the work?
[2024-03-01T14:52:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So they put it up?
[2024-03-01T14:53:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz thats not cheap even if they do all the work also
[2024-03-01T14:53:56] Yamal: They are tekro from the decathlon, I had it in the new closet and I assembled it to wear it out and test it..
[2024-03-01T14:54:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brake like that 28 euro
[2024-03-01T14:56:11] Jacob: 14000w am i hallucinating?
[2024-03-01T14:56:35] Jacob: I translate from my local currency, its more like 85-90€
[2024-03-01T14:56:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just asking to help you with it , before you press send video ,you can cut and edit it in tg , Than i dont ask what was main reason of the video, 2:20 long and what you would like to share was 15- 20 seconds , just saying Professor 🤣
[2024-03-01T14:57:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ok ,still not too cheap ,but i hope it will be good
[2024-03-01T14:59:22] Yamal: The reason for the video is not only the top speed or acceleration, but also the wtt peaks reached and the phase A's, maximum temperature reached, I can't think of anything else...
[2024-03-01T15:00:44] Yamal: Maybe someone can translate everything, what's happening...😂
[2024-03-01T15:08:13] Happy Giraffe: Now that you have temp sensor, if its on the windings you have a peace of mind if you set vesc to lower power at 70°c and cutoff at 90°c
[2024-03-01T15:09:04] Happy Giraffe: The hotter the motor gets the faster it gets even hotter but also cools down bit better as temperature differences are greater😁
[2024-03-01T15:15:04] Jesús: Hello, is there any way to reset the controller to put the firmware back in?
[2024-03-01T15:15:12] Jesús: <photos/photo_13390@01-03-2024_15-15-12.jpg>
[2024-03-01T15:17:42] Jesús: I can not connect
[2024-03-01T15:18:54] Paolo ⁭: With computer
[2024-03-01T15:19:06] Jesús: Vesc tool?
[2024-03-01T15:19:12] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2024-03-01T15:19:29] Jesús: what section?
[2024-03-01T15:19:39] Paolo ⁭: Firmware
[2024-03-01T15:19:59] Jesús: Yeah, but I don't think it's going to let me connect either.
[2024-03-01T15:20:12] Paolo ⁭: With USB cable?
[2024-03-01T15:20:24] Jesús: I am going to try
[2024-03-01T15:21:11] Paolo ⁭: If it don't works you can use st link
[2024-03-01T15:22:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But he doesnt have Engine temp sensor just esc
[2024-03-01T15:24:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Explain your self more
[2024-03-01T15:24:30] sombre_enfant: Remove hose on lever side with 8mm wrench pass it through and if u dont have bleed kit just burp it ghetto way
[2024-03-01T15:25:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Your esc temp max is 46 c Battery around 70% Not really sure what is that you cant think off
[2024-03-01T15:26:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What i see is bt disconnecting for a while
[2024-03-01T15:32:18] Jacob: Hey i just got the other one from the bike shop
[2024-03-01T15:32:41] Jacob: But when i press the lever the brake pads are barely loving
[2024-03-01T15:32:49] Jacob: The other one was strong
[2024-03-01T15:35:32] Yamal: I mean maybe I should pay more attention to certain parameters of vesc tool etc.
[2024-03-01T15:42:19] Jesús: nothing is not detected by usb
[2024-03-01T15:42:45] Jesús: the only way is with stlink?
[2024-03-01T15:47:55] Yamal: You said that the battery discharge was not registered in vesc tool..?
[2024-03-01T15:57:13] Happy Giraffe: he said he has motor temp xd
[2024-03-01T15:57:52] Happy Giraffe: grr
[2024-03-01T15:57:52] Happy Giraffe: Yeah for motor but none of my batteries :/
[2024-03-01T15:59:18] Happy Giraffe: What did you do just before it couldnt connect anymore? I would try multiple usb cables, atleast 2 PCs and also older version of vesc tool
[2024-03-01T17:30:25] Jacob: Heya what this bleeding kit called? And is it expensive?
[2024-03-01T17:30:55] Jacob: This bike shop guy bled it terribly so the pads dont move when i press the lever
[2024-03-01T17:32:30] sombre_enfant: Ez mtb kit its 15€
[2024-03-01T17:32:40] sombre_enfant: Come back

[2024-03-01T19:12:12] Happy Giraffe: Expensive is relative, you know modded xiaomi controllers used to cost 100€🌚
[2024-03-01T19:12:46] Gabe Enzo: Nice bit cheaper than on spintend.com due to import prices
[2024-03-01T19:12:51] Gabe Enzo: Not a tragic amount

[2024-03-01T22:57:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If i remember right it shows that when you power up or turn off for a sec
[2024-03-01T22:58:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Errors normaly not on screen, print faults in terminal
[2024-03-01T23:02:22] Tommy ª: In the dashboard script error count is the led count So 4 blinks in the red led, anyways in vesc shows the error code Also error 4 I think is abs overcurrent
[2024-03-01T23:02:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda all coz of shitty phase plugs and the internal charger
[2024-03-01T23:03:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ask where you bought it
[2024-03-01T23:04:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure to be honest, didnt had chance to experience

[2024-03-01T23:05:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why dont you to any hardware store and buy
[2024-03-01T23:06:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably will be faster and cheaper ,coz even if some donate, you still have shipping price
[2024-03-01T23:06:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 2 bolt in m5 cant be that much
[2024-03-01T23:07:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's interesting they sent that 😁
[2024-03-01T23:08:17] haku: i was having some issues a while back but it fixed it itself.
[2024-03-01T23:08:38] haku: maybe dirty leads or something
[2024-03-01T23:08:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can be right mate ,soon as he tells or shows how gets it ,solid or blink will know more

[2024-03-02T12:47:53] haku: why is there big capacitors in there. never seen that. thats spintend?
[2024-03-02T12:53:07] puneDir: Idk crngiz did something to it Also it doesnt dies with cutoff also it has ignition
[2024-03-02T12:53:36] puneDir: Makes 108 without fwk

[2024-03-02T13:57:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://youtube.com/shorts/W9xYuV_qekA?si=kzO0jR0s0Xo33hsf This was nice for the look
[2024-03-02T14:01:27] NetworkDir: With 50-50A dual setup on 20s and little bit FWK should reach 110km/h gps
[2024-03-02T14:02:10] NetworkDir: 8.4kW
[2024-03-02T14:03:47] puneDir: Yes 8400 w is a lot
[2024-03-02T14:06:54] Jan: Yeah there arent many production scooters past that
[2024-03-02T14:13:15] puneDir: I have 13.2 kw haha
[2024-03-02T14:16:17] NetworkDir: I dont think motors happy with 13.2kW also 75100s😂
[2024-03-02T14:26:24] puneDir: Both happy
[2024-03-02T14:26:45] puneDir: So happy about theres no weak weld
[2024-03-02T14:28:18] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: 3A is nothing
[2024-03-02T14:30:36] puneDir: Its been a long time since discharginf with 3a (actually charging another batt and limited the current)
[2024-03-02T14:30:48] puneDir: If there was problem there would be one pack with a lot lower voltage
[2024-03-02T14:50:56] Gabe Enzo: Monoshit Just killed the threads on my wheel
[2024-03-02T14:50:59] Gabe Enzo: FUCK
[2024-03-02T14:51:04] Gabe Enzo: it's not even fucking straight either
[2024-03-02T14:51:17] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13406@02-03-2024_14-51-17.jpg>
[2024-03-02T14:54:01] Gabe Enzo: THEY LITERALLY MADE IT WRONGGGGGGGGGGGGGG FUCKKKKKK
[2024-03-02T14:54:01] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-03-02T15:17:32] Jacob: Hey does anyone know what im doing wrong? When im accelerating the motor vibrates for a sec or 2 then drives normal, whats this vibration
[2024-03-02T15:18:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Define it more
[2024-03-02T15:19:21] puneDir: I hope turkey gets nuked
[2024-03-02T15:20:57] Happy Giraffe: Monorim moment
[2024-03-02T15:21:25] Happy Giraffe: Motor tuning not done correctly
[2024-03-02T15:22:30] Jacob: You know the feeling of the last seconds before burning the esc driving up hill and the motor starts vibrating, that vibration
[2024-03-02T15:23:14] Jacob: But i have no idea whats wrong
[2024-03-02T15:23:20] puneDir: Do you have g30 motor?
[2024-03-02T15:23:53] Jacob: I have the monorim 500w motor
[2024-03-02T15:24:05] puneDir: G30 motor shakes while accelerating 0-15 (75100) idk the solution Accelerate slowly
[2024-03-02T15:24:10] puneDir: Same one
[2024-03-02T15:24:13] Happy Giraffe: Give hall sensor another tune, then you must set sensorless rpm to high enough that motor wont saturate
[2024-03-02T15:24:16] puneDir: Your motor settings isnt good
[2024-03-02T15:25:03] Jacob: Pkay ill detect hall sensors again
[2024-03-02T15:25:04] Happy Giraffe: Try sensorless 3000erpm and check which motor observer you have
[2024-03-02T15:25:41] Jacob: Where is the setting you're referring to?
[2024-03-02T15:26:14] Happy Giraffe: Use ortega
[2024-03-02T15:26:42] puneDir: Isnt mxlemming better
[2024-03-02T15:27:27] Jacob: I've set it on Ortega now, it was on mxlemming before
[2024-03-02T15:27:35] Jacob: Thanks for showing where it is :)
[2024-03-02T15:29:21] Gabe Enzo: Don't mind the tape XD just a little test drive
[2024-03-02T15:29:39] Gabe Enzo: damnit I shouldve bought white Petg
[2024-03-02T15:29:48] Gabe Enzo: Fuck
[2024-03-02T15:30:02] puneDir: Hope it wont fail
[2024-03-02T15:31:07] Gabe Enzo: was about to go ride and it started to lash rain
[2024-03-02T15:31:25] Gabe Enzo: Quite literally as I spoke aloud "it better not fucking rain"
[2024-03-02T15:33:07] Jacob: Whats your specs man?
[2024-03-02T15:33:50] Happy Giraffe: Depends
[2024-03-02T15:35:18] Happy Giraffe: Next show me this value
[2024-03-02T15:35:45] Jacob: <photos/photo_13410@02-03-2024_15-35-45.jpg>
[2024-03-02T15:36:54] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, should be high enough. You can also try to change it to 2000 and 6000 if you feel differences but I honestly think this might be a matter of @jamessoderstrom doing a cloud setup for you🤔
[2024-03-02T15:37:01] Jacob: I was also told to set gears to 1.000 and motor poles to 30, idk if that matters
[2024-03-02T15:37:14] Happy Giraffe: Only for speed/rpm calculation
[2024-03-02T15:39:04] puneDir: What this does
[2024-03-02T15:39:52] puneDir: I mean whats the purpose of it @Happy_Giraffe
[2024-03-02T15:44:09] Happy Giraffe: Switches from sensored FOC to sensorless FOC
[2024-03-02T15:50:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tbh i dont 😅🙈
[2024-03-02T15:51:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔
[2024-03-02T15:52:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its up to motor ,more heat is made by bigger torque
[2024-03-02T15:52:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Was it that?
[2024-03-02T15:53:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why ? Explain
[2024-03-02T15:54:56] puneDir: So sensorless is better than sensored
[2024-03-02T15:55:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would add that dedicates the swiching point
[2024-03-02T15:56:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How you ended up with this 🙈
[2024-03-02T15:57:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Imagine like when you reach that erpm motor swich to sensorless mode, Before that you use the halls,for a nice start
[2024-03-02T15:57:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In single sensorless engine never knows for a part of a sec which is forward
[2024-03-02T15:58:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And "shakes" the engine at start
[2024-03-02T16:01:40] Jacob: Ohh pretty good explanation
[2024-03-02T16:02:08] Jacob: I'll try this ortega and if feels differently than mxlemming
[2024-03-02T16:02:20] Gabe Enzo: Matches with the front fork
[2024-03-02T16:02:36] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-03-02T16:02:41] Gabe Enzo: this is so tucked
[2024-03-02T16:02:53] Gabe Enzo: everything's is correctly screwed in
[2024-03-02T16:03:02] Gabe Enzo: Monorim is ass
[2024-03-02T16:03:02] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-03-02T16:05:20] puneDir: <photos/photo_13411@02-03-2024_16-05-20.jpg>
[2024-03-02T16:05:34] puneDir: Im going to print something like this for better looking
[2024-03-02T16:05:53] puneDir: <photos/photo_13412@02-03-2024_16-05-53.jpg>
[2024-03-02T16:05:57] Happy Giraffe: I kinda wanna try silent HFI on the bbshd if sensors are fucked before changing them
[2024-03-02T16:12:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Color ?
[2024-03-02T16:12:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: ?
[2024-03-02T16:13:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can try anyway
[2024-03-02T16:14:07] Gabe Enzo: Wobbly as shit
[2024-03-02T16:14:12] Gabe Enzo: for no reason
[2024-03-02T16:14:47] Paolo ⁭: You assembled bearing wrongly
[2024-03-02T16:14:52] Paolo ⁭: That’s the main cause
[2024-03-02T16:15:22] Gabe Enzo: I can't even control it at 60a phase
[2024-03-02T16:15:25] Gabe Enzo: Wtf
[2024-03-02T16:15:34] Gabe Enzo: Cells drop to 68v as usual
[2024-03-02T16:17:06] Gabe Enzo: way stronger than the Xiaomi 300w
[2024-03-02T16:19:47] puneDir: Shit
[2024-03-02T16:19:55] puneDir: That battery is gonna Explode
[2024-03-02T16:20:08] puneDir: Lower your amps
[2024-03-02T16:21:06] Gabe Enzo: I have a temp sensor
[2024-03-02T16:21:15] Gabe Enzo: It'll just shut off if it gets too hot lolza
[2024-03-02T16:22:45] puneDir: In battery
[2024-03-02T16:22:55] Gabe Enzo: Yeeah
[2024-03-02T16:23:03] puneDir: Bms has it?
[2024-03-02T16:23:06] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2024-03-02T16:23:19] puneDir: Can you read it I thought you had shit bms
[2024-03-02T16:23:47] Gabe Enzo: No i cant but it'll shut off if it gets too hot I know that for a fact
[2024-03-02T16:23:49] Gabe Enzo: it's non smart
[2024-03-02T16:23:51] Gabe Enzo: no app for it
[2024-03-02T16:23:59] Gabe Enzo: It's a dollatek 40a esc
[2024-03-02T16:24:37] puneDir: thats a bad idea
[2024-03-02T16:24:46] puneDir: hope you wont have issues
[2024-03-02T16:28:23] Jacob: Does anyone some good 10inch tires for ninebot g30max? Right now i have 10inch solid tires 🤮
[2024-03-02T16:34:35] Gabe Enzo: WHAT THE FUCK LOL I was going 90 there
[2024-03-02T16:34:39] Gabe Enzo: No fucking way
[2024-03-02T16:34:47] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-03-02T16:36:12] Gabe Enzo: 20a fw there, poor mh1s
[2024-03-02T16:44:14] Jacob: Hey i just pulled this original m365 battery out after not being used for decades it shows 2.8v is it kaput or just severely discharged?
[2024-03-02T16:44:31] Gabe Enzo: 2.8v meh razor edge it probably won't be good
[2024-03-02T16:45:09] Jacob: All cells cant be dead?
[2024-03-02T16:59:07] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2024-03-02T17:04:09] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-03-02T17:06:05] Happy Giraffe: Just charge it
[2024-03-02T17:06:51] Happy Giraffe: 2.8v not catastrophic but not good for long term especially if you draw current from them
[2024-03-02T17:07:50] Gabe Enzo: What's the hall count on a mini blade?
[2024-03-02T17:07:54] Gabe Enzo: @PaoloWu
[2024-03-02T17:08:12] Gabe Enzo: Seems to be giving speed a bit faster than it should be
[2024-03-02T17:08:18] Gabe Enzo: but i set it to 10 inc says it has 46 poles
[2024-03-02T17:11:00] Gabe Enzo: Yes. I was going 70 for sure
[2024-03-02T17:11:13] Gabe Enzo: seems wierd cause I set wheel diameter to 250mm
[2024-03-02T17:11:15] Gabe Enzo: aka 10 inch
[2024-03-02T17:11:27] Gabe Enzo: Yeah gets super duper hot
[2024-03-02T17:11:34] Gabe Enzo: Direct drive.
[2024-03-02T17:11:43] Gabe Enzo: Makes no sense.
[2024-03-02T17:11:52] Gabe Enzo: Thermal paste
[2024-03-02T17:11:55] Gabe Enzo: right onto Alu
[2024-03-02T17:12:03] Gabe Enzo: Scooter frame
[2024-03-02T17:12:16] Gabe Enzo: Also it's freezing outside
[2024-03-02T17:12:45] Gabe Enzo: Lmao I forgot to foam it up possibly so
[2024-03-02T17:12:53] Gabe Enzo: The thermal paste usually keeps it stuck
[2024-03-02T17:13:17] Gabe Enzo: I was also using 25a fwk
[2024-03-02T17:19:03] Gabe Enzo: I went 5km and only lost 140wh. I believe I've fixed the battery's issue. Other than it being terribly unbalanced the range is back.
[2024-03-02T17:25:48] Happy Giraffe: What vesc is this?
[2024-03-02T17:25:55] Gabe Enzo: 80100. spin tend
[2024-03-02T17:26:15] Happy Giraffe: Damn mine cools better inside a plastic box
[2024-03-02T17:26:24] Gabe Enzo: huh a what now?
[2024-03-02T17:26:28] Gabe Enzo: plastic box??
[2024-03-02T17:26:40] Gabe Enzo: I'm pretty sure I just didn't add enough thermal paste
[2024-03-02T17:26:46] Gabe Enzo: and didn't bolt it down
[2024-03-02T17:27:53] Happy Giraffe: This usually not the case if paste is a thin, even layer
[2024-03-02T17:28:05] Happy Giraffe: You lack mounting pressure I think for the paste to do any work
[2024-03-02T17:28:29] Happy Giraffe: This
[2024-03-02T17:29:57] Gabe Enzo: I usually just fill it with foam so much that it physically presses it down
[2024-03-02T17:30:21] Gabe Enzo: I have no way TO bolt it down too.
[2024-03-02T17:38:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's impossible
[2024-03-02T17:39:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On g30 ,you have solids🙈
[2024-03-02T17:39:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Original use last a lot time
[2024-03-02T17:40:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Does charger,charge it still?
[2024-03-02T17:41:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why Would it have 46
[2024-03-02T17:43:01] Gabe Enzo: Motor wizard did it
[2024-03-02T17:43:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Motor wizard has settings
[2024-03-02T17:44:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ebike size Engine have 46-48 usually
[2024-03-02T17:44:13] Gabe Enzo: I don't know the poles
[2024-03-02T17:44:20] Gabe Enzo: Only Paolo knows and he isn't answering
[2024-03-02T17:49:23] Gabe Enzo: The speed doesn't match. It shows 15kmh and GPs shows 8kmh
[2024-03-02T17:49:41] Gabe Enzo: Makes zero sense cause I set diameter to 10 inch
[2024-03-02T17:49:57] Gabe Enzo: Idk where it's pulling this info from
[2024-03-02T17:52:14] Jacob: Can i use a 44v charger i dont have the original for 36v anymore
[2024-03-02T17:53:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Set poles to 30, it's like that as he said
[2024-03-02T17:54:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That should make a change if it was 46 before
[2024-03-02T17:56:11] Gabe Enzo: What
[2024-03-02T17:56:21] Gabe Enzo: sure if you Wana explode your house
[2024-03-02T18:07:18] Jacob: Ah okay not so tempting, cant charge it then ;(
[2024-03-02T18:11:59] Happy Giraffe: Metal brackets? I could make you some when finishing francois project
[2024-03-02T18:12:24] Happy Giraffe: charge with rita if you have
[2024-03-02T18:12:44] Gabe Enzo: Nah it's ok I can do it myself, it's just I have to drill holes into the frame and then sandwich the ESC with a metal plank
[2024-03-02T18:12:52] Gabe Enzo: making 3 holes for the phase wires of course
[2024-03-02T18:13:19] Happy Giraffe: If you have a 3d printer then also possible
[2024-03-02T18:13:27] Gabe Enzo: Oh I do actually.
[2024-03-02T18:13:33] Happy Giraffe: petg or preferrably carbon fiber petg
[2024-03-02T18:13:47] Gabe Enzo: I got petg. Just I feel uncomfortable drilling into the frame
[2024-03-02T18:13:54] Gabe Enzo: but I'm so light it shouldn't matter
[2024-03-02T18:13:55] Gabe Enzo: eh
[2024-03-02T18:14:06] Happy Giraffe: small holes wont matter
[2024-03-02T18:14:30] Happy Giraffe: but you need a tap to make lets say m4 threads there and 3.3mm bit
[2024-03-02T18:16:10] Gabe Enzo: check pms
[2024-03-02T18:24:44] Jacob: Lol burnt that long ago 🥲
[2024-03-02T18:25:41] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: F
[2024-03-02T18:33:55] Happy Giraffe: Then might be able to charge it with 12s charger for 15 minutes and keeping an eye on it while it does. Should get cells above 3v to prevent further damage
[2024-03-02T18:34:20] Happy Giraffe: This would be at your own risk tho as we can't know your setup from here
[2024-03-02T18:54:52] Tommy ª: i just noticed the small trace for the step down in my 75100v2 🤧 just a small cut, solder a wire in the cap and you have a way to shut it off
[2024-03-02T18:56:51] puneDir: 84200hp uses same method lol
[2024-03-02T18:57:51] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters u think this is safe?
[2024-03-02T18:57:57] puneDir: Good idea
[2024-03-02T18:59:09] Tommy ª: not at all, this step down is super sensitive (the 5v one) for now i just have it as emergency shutdown or forced reboot, all my 75100 have a bug that usb stops working and i need to reset disconecting the battery (PITA to open the scooter for that)
[2024-03-02T19:04:08] Mirono escooters: I see no problem
[2024-03-02T19:04:32] Mirono escooters: But cut power to 12v chip
[2024-03-02T19:12:38] Gabe Enzo: I'm going with 20s8p and happy giraffe is making me a box.
[2024-03-02T19:12:48] Gabe Enzo: I just can't drop that P to 7p
[2024-03-02T19:12:58] Gabe Enzo: Need that range baby
[2024-03-02T19:13:21] Gabe Enzo: yolo
[2024-03-02T19:14:12] Tommy ª: it cuts the batt voltage to the 12v chip 😭
[2024-03-02T19:15:06] Mirono escooters: Bro start compacting ur msg into 1 😭
[2024-03-02T19:24:22] Konstantin: No. And do like this - bad idea, u have every time chance to .... XD
[2024-03-02T19:33:29] Tommy ª: Imagine switch it off while running 😭😭💀
[2024-03-02T19:33:56] puneDir: Guys we have some g30 esc randomly blows fets
[2024-03-02T19:34:11] puneDir: And works loud Anybody knows whats the solution
[2024-03-02T19:34:47] Tommy ª: Give me that solder
[2024-03-02T19:35:18] puneDir: Wut
[2024-03-02T19:46:31] Jacob: Gotcha, maybe im gonna buy a used m365 for my mother to commute to work so ill use that charger
[2024-03-02T19:47:04] Happy Giraffe: yes thats better
[2024-03-02T19:48:46] Tommy ª: If someone are getting problems with the motor temp reading in the makerbase 75100v2 Swap this resistor with a 01c (10kΩ}, this is a common issue 🤧
[2024-03-02T19:50:53] Tommy ª: The bms on m365 cuts the charger about 4.15 or 4.25 (depends of the firmware in the bms) Don't use more than 4amps, you can fry the diode You can be fine up to about 70v I always used my m365 with a 48v charger 🤧
[2024-03-02T19:53:58] Jacob: Lol so it wont 💥
[2024-03-02T19:54:21] Jacob: My 44v charger outputs 1.5a
[2024-03-02T19:56:13] haku: <video_file>
[2024-03-02T19:56:27] Tommy ª: nah actually the bms dont know if you plug the charger (literally) it just detects "current is going backwards so its charging :3" basically the negative amps the mcu just disables the charging mosfet once the cells goes to the desired voltage and it enables when it falls about 90%
[2024-03-02T19:57:35] Yamal: ?
[2024-03-02T19:58:03] haku: just some funny drama
[2024-03-02T20:00:46] Rose: Hey there Fiab0, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-02T20:01:49] haku: in the bike on bike crime

[2024-03-02T20:08:52] haku: i saw this in a bike group. hilarious
[2024-03-02T20:25:11] Gabe Enzo: This motor is so efficient haha probably because It doesn't heat up
[2024-03-02T20:25:47] Gabe Enzo: I just used 30wh there to go 1.5km no field weakening 50kmh max speed
[2024-03-02T20:25:58] Gabe Enzo: I can go to school on this no problems
[2024-03-02T20:29:49] Gabe Enzo: forgot to say I'm using Hella ebrake bro I only got rear disc

[2024-03-02T21:17:11] puneDir: I have jk bms and its like sik
[2024-03-02T21:18:14] Unknown: Lately they are pitiful I will change it with bms ant
[2024-03-02T21:19:00] NetworkDir: Ant to much bigger than jk
[2024-03-02T21:19:16] Alin Ciobanu: Nhaaa
[2024-03-02T21:19:57] haku: funny i was gonna buy jk because its suppose to be better than ant.
[2024-03-02T21:20:09] haku: i already have ant.
[2024-03-02T21:20:36] haku: vesc lords said its better
[2024-03-02T21:20:39] Alin Ciobanu: 240A continuous and 600A peak are 70x205mm and 16mm
[2024-03-02T21:22:34] Alin Ciobanu: I for my vsett I will make 20S 8P molicel p45b with bms ant only for charging and with direct discharge, only fuse for protection
[2024-03-02T21:23:00] Alin Ciobanu: Fuego 🔥
[2024-03-02T21:23:02] Alin Ciobanu: 😅
[2024-03-02T21:23:14] haku: you mean bypass discharge?
[2024-03-02T21:23:21] NetworkDir: Ant
[2024-03-02T21:24:26] NetworkDir: Something wrong in smart bms design @PuneDir your resistors burned at same location no?
[2024-03-02T21:24:30] puneDir: Yes
[2024-03-02T21:24:34] puneDir: Same location
[2024-03-02T21:24:42] Alin Ciobanu: Surely there will be failed units, but apparently JK is lowering the quality
[2024-03-02T21:24:46] NetworkDir: Something wrong in smart bms designs
[2024-03-02T21:25:01] puneDir: <photos/photo_13420@02-03-2024_21-25-01.jpg>

[2024-03-02T21:25:15] Alin Ciobanu: Better daly 😂😂😅
[2024-03-02T21:25:20] puneDir: Actually less
[2024-03-02T21:25:21] NetworkDir: Hahahaha
[2024-03-02T21:25:25] puneDir: It just burned itself
[2024-03-02T21:25:40] puneDir: Daly works for months now Jk lasted 23-22 hrs lol
[2024-03-02T21:26:04] Alin Ciobanu: A half pull is enough and it goes into protection 😂
[2024-03-02T22:03:21] Happy Giraffe: Try that in Texas
[2024-03-02T22:03:26] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-03-02T22:05:07] haku: this is actually florida lol
[2024-03-02T22:05:55] Happy Giraffe: Sounds about right tbh
[2024-03-02T22:07:22] haku: there is a whole drama debacle over this but this ones the highlight knockout of the night
[2024-03-02T22:07:43] haku: live from pay per view
[2024-03-02T22:10:55] Happy Giraffe: US never fails to amaze me, nowadays same stupidity has landed in EU aswell
[2024-03-02T22:11:21] haku: its a global phenomenon
[2024-03-02T22:12:03] haku: if your gonna commit vehicular manslaughter why not on a surron
[2024-03-02T22:12:55] haku: makes me want one and join the madness
[2024-03-02T22:31:37] Gabe Enzo: I'm having so much fun with 90a phase lol

[2024-03-02T22:46:45] Happy Giraffe: yeah its kinda nicely put together and a solid bike but nothing groundbreaking so far. If they used Molicel P45B then maybe bit more power
[2024-03-02T22:48:12] haku: do you think its cylimdrical cells in there? this might be nmc pouch
[2024-03-02T22:49:13] Alin Ciobanu: I’ve only seen cheap normal bms broken or burned
[2024-03-02T22:49:39] Alin Ciobanu: But smart bms never see
[2024-03-02T22:50:05] puneDir: My jk burned itself for no reason
[2024-03-02T22:50:17] puneDir: I didnt even used it Bms and whole pack was 1 day old
[2024-03-02T22:50:47] puneDir: <photos/photo_13131@24-02-2024_15-46-28.jpg>
[2024-03-02T22:51:06] puneDir: I bought 24s10p jk instead I lowered the balance amps to minimum and its fine now
[2024-03-02T22:56:53] Happy Giraffe: Not sure, nothing out of ordinary there anyways xd
[2024-03-02T22:58:40] puneDir: Anybody has design for something like this
[2024-03-02T23:08:40] Paolo ⁭: You don’t say the full story
[2024-03-02T23:09:13] Paolo ⁭: He was running 100A bms with 2 x Kelly 7230 300a each 😂
[2024-03-02T23:09:51] Alin Ciobanu: In theory it was at 50/60A each
[2024-03-02T23:10:21] Alin Ciobanu: But the problem that exploded to him when he attached the display to the control unit
[2024-03-02T23:14:13] NetworkDir: xD
[2024-03-02T23:14:47] Paolo ⁭: He set 50% as current limit, which means 150a max each . It’s not current Ampere, it’s percentage
[2024-03-02T23:16:49] Alin Ciobanu: I remember that they had set it properly, then if it touched I don’t know 🤷🏽‍♂️
[2024-03-02T23:23:15] Gabe Enzo: ebrake heats up the vesc so much but better than blowing an xesc
[2024-03-02T23:41:52] Happy Giraffe: dafug?
[2024-03-02T23:42:29] Gabe Enzo: time to learn freecad
[2024-03-02T23:45:06] puneDir: I know f360 but i dont have time
[2024-03-02T23:50:29] haku: cut it from plywood baby
[2024-03-02T23:51:22] Happy Giraffe: Fusion masterrace (when it doesnt freeze)
[2024-03-02T23:54:08] Happy Giraffe: free tho
[2024-03-02T23:55:10] Happy Giraffe: and has nice features like knowing exactly mass of a 3d body
[2024-03-03T00:05:41] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, ofcourse problem in product and not user😂
[2024-03-03T05:22:20] haku: anyone has a good brand recomendations for a good HDMI splitter?

[2024-03-03T11:31:00] Gabe Enzo: Super fun ride 60kmh gps
[2024-03-03T11:31:09] Gabe Enzo: Quiet some fwk just monitoring voltage with the meter while riding so it won't shut off my batt. Never seems to drop below 68v or so, once it hits 60v it's total shutoff even if you turn it off and on

[2024-03-03T13:54:18] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): does someone know if I can swap the plate with the disk brake mounts to the side with the cables on QSMotor (2000W)?
[2024-03-03T14:16:16] Gabe Enzo: It's cold 247
[2024-03-03T14:16:38] Gabe Enzo: usually the heat radiates to the outside after you leave the motor off, but for this motor it's cold 247, no issues with 3kw at all.
[2024-03-03T14:17:48] Gabe Enzo: Y'all think this deserves vesc? @Bradhaku
[2024-03-03T14:18:20] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2024-03-03T14:18:26] haku: every pev deserves one. imo
[2024-03-03T14:20:19] Gabe Enzo: It has 14s stock, goes about 33kmh. I know it can do wayyy more.
[2024-03-03T14:20:26] Gabe Enzo: 37 on a good day with no wind
[2024-03-03T14:20:35] Gabe Enzo: has a 500w motor

[2024-03-03T16:32:06] Yamal: Also people here with Xiaomi ride crazy
[2024-03-03T16:32:55] Yamal: They ride on the sidewalks, they cross red lights, they don't stop, and well, even 2 on a scooter.
[2024-03-03T16:33:08] Gabe Enzo: yeah same here.
[2024-03-03T16:33:28] Gabe Enzo: that's why you should need a license to drive these, not insurance but a license.
[2024-03-03T16:33:40] Yamal: In the city it is better to educate people that we are not the devil
[2024-03-03T16:33:53] Gabe Enzo: Yeah I always drive responsibily
[2024-03-03T16:37:42] Yamal: We are new vehicles! and we just want them to leave us alone without so much restriction, etc.

[2024-03-03T17:40:27] sombre_enfant: Is it good ? I wanna print a fork to test my size...
[2024-03-03T17:44:21] Gabe Enzo: probably harder to use then the ender 3 pro
[2024-03-03T17:51:11] Paolo ⁭: it's a average cheap bowden printer
[2024-03-03T17:51:44] sombre_enfant: What you mean some are more difficult to use ?
[2024-03-03T17:52:06] Gabe Enzo: Hard to explain but some are just more annoying than others
[2024-03-03T17:52:12] Gabe Enzo: Ender 3 is the worst
[2024-03-03T17:52:23] Gabe Enzo: so many things can go wrong
[2024-03-03T17:52:31] sombre_enfant: In wich point ?
[2024-03-03T17:53:10] Gabe Enzo: Shifting, errors in print, uneven bed heating
[2024-03-03T17:53:32] Gabe Enzo: settings changing, needing to level the bed after every print
[2024-03-03T17:53:42] Yamal: How many fet have shull 350?
[2024-03-03T17:54:06] Gabe Enzo: Can't print circles right either. some prints just come out bent and require so much sanding
[2024-03-03T17:56:20] sombre_enfant: Its only for prototyping
[2024-03-03T17:57:07] sombre_enfant: 12
[2024-03-03T17:58:56] Yamal: Big controller , but around 800€ for 2?
[2024-03-03T17:59:13] Yamal: Dificult to burn..?
[2024-03-03T18:00:08] sombre_enfant: If your battery is good it wont burn
[2024-03-03T18:03:30] Yamal: You thing vesc burn before kelly ?
[2024-03-03T18:03:41] Yamal: Just thinking in competition,,
[2024-03-03T18:03:51] sombre_enfant: What ?
[2024-03-03T18:04:05] sombre_enfant: Just do proper 22s10p
[2024-03-03T18:04:11] sombre_enfant: Ant bms
[2024-03-03T18:10:26] Yamal: No ! My scooter has 20s10p and I'm not going to touch it anymore, it's finished, thank God! I can't stop thinking about future protectors!!! why not? better 2 than one,,, I have 2 7218 and I don't know whether to sell them and buy vesc or simply use them and discard the electronics for the future project,,

[2024-03-03T20:15:05] Happy Giraffe: Anyone built a DIY box to print Nylon with?🤔 Im thinking of making one but bit worried about motors overheating if they are in the same heated space
[2024-03-03T20:15:39] haku: no havent tried nylon or asa. i want to though
[2024-03-03T20:15:56] Happy Giraffe: Did you try the califlower file?😁
[2024-03-03T20:16:08] haku: not yet i forgot haha
[2024-03-03T20:16:51] Happy Giraffe: Haha, I also wonder if I could leave the box open from bottom as heat would kinda get trapped inside anyways🤔
[2024-03-03T20:17:50] haku: how about cauliflower ear haha
[2024-03-03T20:18:10] Happy Giraffe: 99% of Detroit citizens

[2024-03-03T20:19:59] haku: i completly forgot. i watched openheimer yesterday before they took it off the theaters
[2024-03-03T20:20:24] haku: they say its best to watch in theaters imax
[2024-03-03T20:21:02] Happy Giraffe: Threater ticket prices here too wild I rather buy a proper hardened steel nozzle for printer😂
[2024-03-03T20:22:14] haku: i rarely watch movies. this openheimer is a must see because i like history
[2024-03-03T20:23:20] haku: i want to know if that film is historical accurate
[2024-03-03T20:26:20] Happy Giraffe: Yeah it can be quite interesting
[2024-03-03T20:27:07] Happy Giraffe: BROZZL High-End MK8 Nozzle Hardened Steel 0.8 mm Diameter for Creality Ender 3, Ender 3 Pro, CR-10, CR-10S and More https://amzn.eu/d/iVkUJGk

[2024-03-03T20:36:43] Paolo ⁭: This is 3 times bigger
[2024-03-03T20:37:22] haku: i saw you are right. 300x300 i might actually pick one up.
[2024-03-03T20:40:24] Happy Giraffe: If you want a big ass printer then maybe 350x350 or 400 would be better. Helmets that fit on 300x300 might not make it if you have a larger head🤔
[2024-03-03T20:40:54] haku: whats a big affordable one.
[2024-03-03T20:41:02] Paolo ⁭: I print parts for e-scooter

[2024-03-03T20:41:07] Paolo ⁭: I don’t need precision
[2024-03-03T20:41:28] Happy Giraffe: I think that can be calibrated aswell
[2024-03-03T20:41:47] Happy Giraffe: Klipper etc and boom its a mean machine after that
[2024-03-03T20:41:54] haku: anything that can run klipper is good right?
[2024-03-03T20:48:41] Happy Giraffe: You run it from external computer
[2024-03-03T20:49:21] haku: like a rasberry pi?
[2024-03-03T20:49:59] haku: i dont know how to code those things unfortunately
[2024-03-03T20:56:39] Happy Giraffe: Klipper bit of a mystery to me aswell, couldnt get it to run properly with a Linux
[2024-03-03T20:56:49] Paolo ⁭: Printing slow yes, but you can never have speed and quality as Bambù or prusa
[2024-03-03T21:02:53] haku: funny you said that. ive never really tried printing on that super fast or ludacris mode.
[2024-03-03T21:03:56] haku: i just print in standard speeds. maybe someone here with a bambu uses that setting
[2024-03-03T21:37:58] haku: why are these frames so expensive wtf.
[2024-03-03T21:40:45] Yamal: Fidoo
[2024-03-03T21:41:46] haku: that frame is almost 3 years old and price stil the same
[2024-03-03T21:43:25] Yamal: <photos/photo_13436@03-03-2024_21-43-25.jpg>
[2024-03-03T21:45:04] haku: ive seen some crazy ones. this is one of them
[2024-03-03T21:45:25] Tommy ª: the 1st speed bump:
[2024-03-03T21:45:26] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-03-03T21:46:27] haku: this is not a fiido anymore. haha
[2024-03-03T21:46:46] haku: looks like a custom frame
[2024-03-03T21:46:51] Finn: <sticker>
[2024-03-03T21:47:06] Tommy ª: actually pay 800$ for some painted tubes are crazy
[2024-03-03T21:47:25] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-03-03T21:47:59] haku: not me papi. ill make mine out of plywood
[2024-03-03T21:49:41] haku: i think this has adjustable front height suspension. some folks lower it for photoshoots. like cars
[2024-03-03T21:50:03] Yamal: <photos/photo_13437@03-03-2024_21-50-03.jpg>
[2024-03-03T21:50:54] Yamal: <photos/photo_13438@03-03-2024_21-50-54.jpg>
[2024-03-03T21:50:56] haku: oh no the fans
[2024-03-03T21:51:39] haku: how much money does this guy have. gold plated maguras and stuff
[2024-03-03T21:51:54] Yamal: <photos/photo_13439@03-03-2024_21-51-54.jpg>
[2024-03-03T21:52:11] Gabe Enzo: Seems I caught a case of bad filament @Mirono_escooters
[2024-03-03T21:52:15] Mirono escooters: So low
[2024-03-03T21:52:20] haku: classy
[2024-03-03T21:52:22] Gabe Enzo: or possibly the workshop is so cold that the filament is acting shit
[2024-03-03T21:52:29] Yamal: <photos/photo_13440@03-03-2024_21-52-29.jpg>
[2024-03-03T21:52:37] Mirono escooters: Unless resin, no
[2024-03-03T21:52:48] Gabe Enzo: Hmm? resin where.
[2024-03-03T21:53:15] Gabe Enzo: What resin
[2024-03-03T21:53:17] haku: thats a laotie looking frame
[2024-03-03T21:53:27] Gabe Enzo: What scooter is this
[2024-03-03T21:54:04] haku: im sure these are the scooters of the shiek of dubai
[2024-03-03T21:54:10] Yamal: <photos/photo_13441@03-03-2024_21-54-10.jpg>
[2024-03-03T21:54:23] Gabe Enzo: Ah dualtrom
[2024-03-03T21:54:25] Gabe Enzo: niceee
[2024-03-03T21:55:49] Yamal: <photos/photo_13442@03-03-2024_21-55-49.jpg>
[2024-03-03T21:56:18] sombre_enfant: The scooter lord took the first napkin,and said 3 shull is trash,now we gotta move on to flipsky 🥱
[2024-03-03T21:57:07] Gabe Enzo: I don't like how the front wheel is placed honestly
[2024-03-03T21:57:46] Yamal: Broken ?
[2024-03-03T21:58:00] Gabe Enzo: Crazy cause fiido is a dog shit Brand.
[2024-03-03T21:58:29] Gabe Enzo: The build quality on my fiido L3 is awful
[2024-03-03T21:58:35] Gabe Enzo: That's the most expensive one
[2024-03-03T21:58:58] Yamal: He had on his dualtron thunder 2, Shull?
[2024-03-03T21:59:16] haku: english boy. this aint the french congo. what does that mean
[2024-03-03T21:59:18] Gabe Enzo: Wheels fall out of the dropouts, design flaws with the nuts not bolting on hard enough as there's a foot stand in the middle.
[2024-03-03T21:59:30] Gabe Enzo: Frame isn't even straight
[2024-03-03T21:59:43] Gabe Enzo: wheels aren't straight either Shit brakes, constantly need regulating Goes into drive mode when you walk it.
[2024-03-03T22:00:10] Yamal: I could see in some video that he finally left the minimotors electronics behind and had fat motors and large heatsinks under the frame, but I don't know the electronics he chose?
[2024-03-03T22:00:15] sombre_enfant: He said he broke 3 its shit so he sell the last he have
[2024-03-03T22:00:29] haku: who is it?
[2024-03-03T22:00:32] Gabe Enzo: No speed modes either lmfao.
[2024-03-03T22:00:33] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-03-03T22:00:52] sombre_enfant: E scooter Worldwide champion in dubai and nyc
[2024-03-03T22:01:14] haku: i see. so 3shul bad now i guess.
[2024-03-03T22:01:15] Gabe Enzo: I would genuinely be dead if I wasn't into this hobby. I'm surprised it's legal.
[2024-03-03T22:01:26] Gabe Enzo: Upkeeping it is aids
[2024-03-03T22:01:49] Yamal: The problem is that it had them inside and in the images you couldn't see fans or anything, just the heatsinks, I think that for very high discharge controllers I should have them
[2024-03-03T22:01:53] sombre_enfant: Idk he dont do shii on mechanic part ig must be the ppl who program it bad
[2024-03-03T22:02:02] haku: you got the wrong fiido. the other kind has a big following
[2024-03-03T22:02:25] sombre_enfant: On the nami rmone its inside too
[2024-03-03T22:03:43] Yamal: Well, it will be the first one I see, because almost all the namis I saw prepared have the electronics in the same place as the original.
[2024-03-03T22:04:08] Yamal: I am considering putting a heatsink
[2024-03-03T22:08:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Good idea
[2024-03-03T22:08:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bridge heat ,wind does the rest
[2024-03-03T22:08:54] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters
[2024-03-03T22:08:58] Gabe Enzo: Do you mean resin filament?
[2024-03-03T22:11:20] Yamal: The truth is that in normal use I don't have temperature problems, even when I put it at full speed or give it hard starts, but on the track things change as time goes by, the vesc world is wonderful but I think we have to put a lot of emphasis on the temperature issue
[2024-03-03T22:11:56] Yamal: By the way, the fans on the scooters are very cool.
[2024-03-03T22:12:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am no fan of fans 😁
[2024-03-03T22:15:21] Yamal: Maybe that constant noise of powerful fans is not always the most pleasant thing but I think they do a good job
[2024-03-03T22:15:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: After a while you cant reduce heat with a fan while area is closed ,slowly as air gets warm also ,loses the effect I use to put external heatsinks on every bigger build or even smaller one if they have huge battery, so they go for hours
[2024-03-03T22:16:14] Gabe Enzo: It seems I've had this issue before when printing in the attic. We got temps of under 8c outside.
[2024-03-03T22:16:30] Gabe Enzo: nvvm 4° rn
[2024-03-03T22:16:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why the heck you print in the attic 🙈
[2024-03-03T22:16:58] Gabe Enzo: We don't have enough space to print inside.
[2024-03-03T22:17:15] Gabe Enzo: Also my family says it smells like shit
[2024-03-03T22:17:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Atleast make a paper box and cover it ,than you have less heat loss in a cold area
[2024-03-03T22:17:25] Gabe Enzo: I don't want it in my room either
[2024-03-03T22:17:36] Gabe Enzo: Good idea
[2024-03-03T22:17:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also eats less coz bed and head doesnt need all time max to keep heat
[2024-03-03T22:18:05] Yamal: No no, the idea or from what I have seen on some scooters is 2 fans, one takes in air from the street and the other expels hot air from the interior.
[2024-03-03T22:18:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I can understand it in a way
[2024-03-03T22:18:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I understand
[2024-03-03T22:18:25] Gabe Enzo: my room is super small and I don't wanna be sleeping next to that cancer
[2024-03-03T22:18:38] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-03-03T22:19:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically you can do this or make a tunnel for it ,i think @KenLawrence made such earlier, esc maybe was in the tunnel area, In fans way you need to filter air and probably no rain drive
[2024-03-03T22:20:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔
[2024-03-03T22:21:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: My room is kinda big but i have too much space,so i keep it in the other room
[2024-03-03T22:21:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i enjoy wacthing it sometimes
[2024-03-03T22:22:32] sombre_enfant: I talked with him on insta he told me how they break
[2024-03-03T22:22:41] Кирилл: Yes, to help the air leave the place. Creating a pressure difference. And the incoming air flow flies in again while you're driving.
[2024-03-03T22:25:39] Yamal: ? Big Aymard,I was so worried that I would go to races and events with the stock dualtron,,
[2024-03-03T22:26:04] Yamal: and I was happy to see it prepared
[2024-03-03T22:26:47] sombre_enfant: He still has a 20s maybe the stock one with diff bms🤣
[2024-03-03T22:28:31] Yamal: He still won the esc championship, right?
[2024-03-03T22:31:18] sombre_enfant: Yep but its not with dualtron team, esc scoot dont have vesc
[2024-03-03T22:34:37] Yamal: Yes…
[2024-03-03T22:44:49] Yamal: https://youtu.be/8vzQhGF4eCc?si=S9h_1mHNk0dYGXBn
[2024-03-03T22:48:35] haku: nice videography
[2024-03-03T22:55:01] Yamal: The truth is, yes, it makes you want to go on vacation.
[2024-03-03T22:56:03] haku: i like youtube videos with these style of videos. shot and edited like a pro.
[2024-03-03T22:56:41] haku: i can tell this guy is into cameras with those shots.
[2024-03-03T22:58:46] haku: if those shots are taken with insta 360 i want one
[2024-03-03T23:04:26] Yamal: https://youtu.be/2UtOOHnxD1M?si=Bx9Llc9l9YmMD-m8
[2024-03-03T23:04:39] Yamal: This man made good reviews of scooters, now he is very busy with unicycles, which is a shame,,,
[2024-03-03T23:06:17] Happy Giraffe: and its crap xd
[2024-03-03T23:10:17] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-03-03T23:11:41] haku: it is.
[2024-03-03T23:12:39] haku: i still want one though 😂
[2024-03-03T23:22:49] Happy Giraffe: Why don't you want something better?😂
[2024-03-03T23:23:08] haku: i like tiny ones. makes me look big baby
[2024-03-03T23:24:02] haku: idk i like mini bikes
[2024-03-03T23:25:00] haku: i like odd things
[2024-03-03T23:26:20] haku: also no other choice for small frames unless custom
[2024-03-03T23:27:07] Yamal: https://youtu.be/GvxvPge5M8k?si=-0BNWJuBFoyGqwz4
[2024-03-03T23:27:17] Yamal: Very good controller ..?
[2024-03-03T23:28:07] haku: no idea. that dude came here once then disapeared. prolly saw all the flipskys
[2024-03-03T23:29:50] haku: im sure its best. vedders creation
[2024-03-03T23:31:00] Yamal: 18 fet say
[2024-03-03T23:31:13] haku: i think that guy is involved with the new tronics design.
[2024-03-03T23:31:38] haku: i barely see him upload anymore too
[2024-03-03T23:34:13] Yamal: no idea, but it would be cool to try the x12
[2024-03-03T23:34:43] Yamal: there is a 24 s version and 30s version🔥😂
[2024-03-03T23:34:49] haku: get it and test. would be cool to see some info about it
[2024-03-03T23:36:40] haku: also all western parts with this. tronics too i think but not sure though
[2024-03-03T23:38:01] Yamal: Well, a friend buys them to ride 30s, but he still doesn't know 100x100, I would like to, maybe in the future, we have to save for new projects
[2024-03-03T23:40:04] Happy Giraffe: Buy a razor
[2024-03-03T23:40:22] Yamal: Are you going to finally mount things on your frame?
[2024-03-03T23:41:09] Yamal: Once you make the drums, the rest goes quickly.
[2024-03-03T23:41:11] haku: yea finishing up the battery soon. taking my sweet time
[2024-03-03T23:41:11] haku: <photos/photo_13445@03-03-2024_23-41-11.jpg>
[2024-03-03T23:41:31] haku: need to polish copper then weld it
[2024-03-03T23:42:18] haku: im in no rush really. haste makes waste papi
[2024-03-03T23:43:23] haku: im thinking of the best way to mount bms. side or top
[2024-03-03T23:45:13] Alin Ciobanu: Side
[2024-03-03T23:46:18] haku: i would if i can get more space off the frame. we will see
[2024-03-03T23:46:44] Alin Ciobanu: What a scooter?
[2024-03-03T23:46:52] Yamal: By the way, are the controllers inside?
[2024-03-03T23:47:03] haku: the best only. laotie TI 30 baby
[2024-03-03T23:47:49] haku: might have to mount it on the side or into the stem with the heatsink
[2024-03-03T23:48:58] Yamal: Voro motor killer 😂🔥
[2024-03-03T23:49:20] haku: i have a bigger deck but it looks too big. so i wont use it. someday when i get pouch cells maybe i would
[2024-03-03T23:50:00] Yamal: I see the sides as dangerous, if you fall you destroy the controller
[2024-03-03T23:50:47] haku: its cool. im just stunting with this scooter. fun project
[2024-03-03T23:51:09] haku: Im not planning to fall 😭
[2024-03-03T23:53:26] Yamal: It's great to make powerful scooters, and rest assured it's going to be the most powerful scooter in all of Las Vegas, don't get dualtrons or kaabo or anything like that style because you remove the stickers in the blink of an eye
[2024-03-03T23:54:38] Yamal: buy a moto gp leather suit
[2024-03-03T23:55:30] haku: honestly i just want it to do burnouts. my childhood dream to do it in a scooter and my dads dying wish
[2024-03-03T23:56:17] haku: he talked to me in a dream and said mount the bigger deck and get pouch cells you pussy.
[2024-03-03T23:57:55] Yamal: Did your father like e-scooters?
[2024-03-03T23:57:55] haku: he also told me he raised a man not a little bitch that cant do burnouts
[2024-03-03T23:58:05] haku: he liked cars
[2024-03-04T00:01:02] Yamal: a car with molicel and a powerful controller must be cool
[2024-03-04T00:02:51] haku: mine is okay. has all power i need. i dont even know what tesla uses i know i have the new 4680 cell
[2024-03-04T00:03:12] Yamal: The problem is that you could only drive it on a car track or in a private environment, you could also go to mountain or sparsely populated roads, but ultimately a scooter is more practical.
[2024-03-04T00:03:31] Yamal: You have a Tesla no?
[2024-03-04T00:03:55] haku: yes.
[2024-03-04T00:04:08] haku: its common in the US
[2024-03-04T00:04:13] Yamal: They are cheap in America or what, today there is a second-hand market
[2024-03-04T00:04:57] Happy Giraffe: Cars in US 1/2 the price than in EU😂
[2024-03-04T00:05:17] haku: you get alot of tax insentives. they keep thier value
[2024-03-04T00:05:32] Yamal: For me, electric cars are crazy limited, I fill mine up and drive 1000km
[2024-03-04T00:06:22] haku: for long rides i still prefer gas. due to gas stations everywhere. with electric you have to plan your route
[2024-03-04T00:06:28] Happy Giraffe: It's stupid they make them go 250kmh instead of 150kmh topspeed and added efficiency with larger batt😅
[2024-03-04T00:06:58] haku: electric good for city driving
[2024-03-04T00:07:24] asyan4ik: Rdy , stdy ,go ;)

[2024-03-04T00:07:30] Happy Giraffe: Or nobody needs 500hp in everyday riding could be like 200😁 fun cars are different cars
[2024-03-04T00:08:04] Happy Giraffe: Haha, bud light
[2024-03-04T00:08:26] haku: did you pot it?
[2024-03-04T00:09:05] haku: what vesc is that?
[2024-03-04T00:09:08] Happy Giraffe: Tbh could do a small team DIY design thats better car than most of them mass produced ones for less money😂
[2024-03-04T00:09:53] asyan4ik: Yeah
[2024-03-04T00:10:09] haku: im waiting for chinas import honestly. i want to see what they have to offer
[2024-03-04T00:10:12] Happy Giraffe: Aerodynamics and low weight would be killer combo.
[2024-03-04T00:10:36] Happy Giraffe: I just use two wheels, I might fall off if using 4
[2024-03-04T00:10:39] asyan4ik: Flip 75100 alu
[2024-03-04T00:11:59] asyan4ik: Cpu died, the cause is not known. All voltages are normal
[2024-03-04T00:13:06] haku: can you switch it for another one? or is it better to buy a new flipsky
[2024-03-04T00:15:26] asyan4ik: Cpu with shipping from out of town $30, replacement 5 bud ;)))
[2024-03-04T00:15:42] asyan4ik: 1 hour tine , rdy
[2024-03-04T00:15:48] haku: nice
[2024-03-04T00:17:27] asyan4ik: I was putting a screen on my board
[2024-03-04T00:17:58] asyan4ik: This is bullshit.
[2024-03-04T00:18:11] haku: how is that display. ive never seen alot of folks use it
[2024-03-04T00:18:13] asyan4ik: Flipsky ;/
[2024-03-04T00:19:05] asyan4ik: I decided not to put it in, it's a piece of shit.
[2024-03-04T00:19:33] asyan4ik: Ok , i can make video
[2024-03-04T00:24:02] Happy Giraffe: New one coming from Trampa
[2024-03-04T00:24:17] asyan4ik: <video_file>
[2024-03-04T00:37:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is this flipky screen?
[2024-03-04T00:38:49] asyan4ik: Yeah
[2024-03-04T00:39:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: Looking good the case
[2024-03-04T00:39:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: Did you printed yourself?
[2024-03-04T00:40:57] asyan4ik: No, it's a flipsky
[2024-03-04T01:02:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: I tought done one draw a good looking case for that screen
[2024-03-04T03:43:02] Chris Culver: How does the ignite port work on Ubox 2?
[2024-03-04T04:20:38] haku: i wonder if this is printed in TPU it will be bouncy
[2024-03-04T04:54:45] Happy Giraffe: No, TPU would absorb energy too much when it touches the floor. It isnt "springy" as a material
[2024-03-04T04:55:13] haku: whats a good bouncy material?
[2024-03-04T04:55:46] haku: wilson has a printed basketball. i wonder what they used
[2024-03-04T04:55:46] Happy Giraffe: Hard rubber, idk any printable ones. They did a fancy expensive NBA ball tho
[2024-03-04T04:56:19] haku: nylon is flexible yea?
[2024-03-04T04:56:26] Happy Giraffe: TPU also has different stiffness scales 95 being most common
[2024-03-04T04:56:35] Happy Giraffe: kinda but depends
[2024-03-04T05:26:54] haku: <video_file>
[2024-03-04T06:08:52] haku: amazing whoever designed this.
[2024-03-04T06:10:14] haku: <video_file>
[2024-03-04T06:23:53] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2024-03-04T08:20:12] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-03-04T08:20:34] Yamal: for fans of fans😁🔥
[2024-03-04T09:04:41] puneDir: I just found the reason of why zero escs keep dying
[2024-03-04T09:04:58] puneDir: I opened discharge on jk but forget to open charge :)
[2024-03-04T10:10:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not totaly sure why you ask this
[2024-03-04T10:10:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13453@04-03-2024_10-10-54.jpg>
[2024-03-04T10:12:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you have the ignite type ,plug in and turn the key
[2024-03-04T10:13:56] Yamal: Look nice this spintend
[2024-03-04T10:13:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You?
[2024-03-04T10:14:06] Yamal: No!
[2024-03-04T10:14:55] Yamal: Malasia or Singapore, I don’t know video from tune extreme
[2024-03-04T10:15:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ok, could be you on the highway 😁
[2024-03-04T10:15:23] Yamal: “Old video”
[2024-03-04T10:15:47] puneDir: Why
[2024-03-04T10:16:11] puneDir: Air conditioner
[2024-03-04T10:17:20] Yamal: weped, has one on each side, 145kmh, 2 30ah 40t batteries
[2024-03-04T10:17:48] puneDir: Ohhhh
[2024-03-04T10:18:16] puneDir: Guys i want to install vescs to my zero but i want to drill frame (vescs are in g30 box)
[2024-03-04T10:18:40] puneDir: How can i install 2 of them like this
[2024-03-04T10:22:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure, but Yeah would be interesting to know what they printed that "1000$ printed ball" from
[2024-03-04T10:26:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13455@04-03-2024_10-26-47.jpg>
[2024-03-04T10:27:02] puneDir: help :(
[2024-03-04T10:27:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What?
[2024-03-04T10:28:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like the first box?
[2024-03-04T10:39:34] puneDir: Both
[2024-03-04T10:39:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Does have space for bolts , (you are there) but probably Box max to front, than mark the bolts position , decide the how Simple drill big in enough hole to fit screw what comes out the other side and you put a washer and a nut ,with threadlock Or you drill a smaller size ,than make a thread, insert screw and tighten in the the body thread than the leftover what sticks out outside from the bolt, can get heatsink drilled and put over it and a washer and nut will hold the heatbridge together. In any way you should make the holes from smaller to bigger size what you need ,never go with big drill first. Also in both cases you should remove paint in the body inner side Paint doesnt help in the heatbridge and if you do external heatsink than you remove it from that side also and put thermal paste ,inner side I guess still has the silicone thingy
[2024-03-04T10:40:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I ment both are in a box like that?
[2024-03-04T11:02:19] puneDir: Yes
[2024-03-04T11:02:45] puneDir: Isnt there any other good options than drilling
[2024-03-04T11:17:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not really and there is two ,you cant kugoo that safely😅
[2024-03-04T11:18:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Under this is i mean when thay try to force esc to a place by foam pieces
[2024-03-04T11:19:03] NetworkDir: I think this version have a temperature problem
[2024-03-04T11:19:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also in the big pics if does esc are good ,they will stay and to long live and perform good you need to fix them good
[2024-03-04T11:20:01] NetworkDir: Best versions Ubox 80V 100A and Ubox 85V 250A
[2024-03-04T11:20:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also we talk about 4 holes ,not to much
[2024-03-04T11:22:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's a good idea to open anyway to change dried silicone pads ,but if its like the red ,than not really a temp issue than temp sensor in wrong position
[2024-03-04T11:23:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @jamaludin_algarnati you like teverun blade gt 2?
[2024-03-04T11:23:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just recieved one for some bearing change in engine's
[2024-03-04T11:24:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2024-03-04T11:33:01] Yamal: It's cool! Do you have a scooter workshop or what?
[2024-03-04T11:33:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes , i run a service
[2024-03-04T11:34:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And there is two shops sending stuff and we have local Facebook community also, but that's xiaomi related basically
[2024-03-04T11:48:31] Yamal: Is this the incline of the road you are going on?
[2024-03-04T11:50:18] Finn: Its the angle from the vesc
[2024-03-04T11:50:31] Finn: Vesc needs an gyroscope for that. Ubox has that for example
[2024-03-04T11:52:24] sombre_enfant: Is it possible to level it ?
[2024-03-04T11:59:39] Finn: I guess it levels it when you start the vesc
[2024-03-04T12:05:54] Gabe Enzo: Unlucky
[2024-03-04T12:19:02] Gabe Enzo: I wanna print an extender in advance for my molicel setup The escs with wires will be on the bottom that's about 2.7cm and also the cell will be 2.7 too so that's a 5.4cm extender
[2024-03-04T12:19:33] Gabe Enzo: can probably make the cell shorter too etc so I'm hoping for 4.8cm @punedir
[2024-03-04T12:19:33] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-03-04T12:56:00] Happy Giraffe: This sturdy enough for bicycle?🤔
[2024-03-04T12:56:13] Gabe Enzo: yea
[2024-03-04T12:56:38] Happy Giraffe: 🤣
[2024-03-04T12:58:13] Gabe Enzo: Why not??
[2024-03-04T12:58:23] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-03-04T13:13:12] Happy Giraffe: I'm just laughing because its 5mm wall steel 60mm square tube that holds even a 600cc motorcycle😂
[2024-03-04T13:21:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: NO Add +4 mm And all should be from inox😁
[2024-03-04T13:23:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably or more heavy
[2024-03-04T13:57:53] Happy Giraffe: Ok I will weld 15mm steel sheet next time
[2024-03-04T14:20:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁🤣
[2024-03-04T14:22:22] Rose: Hey there Abraham, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-04T15:35:27] puneDir: Printed this
[2024-03-04T15:35:46] puneDir: Now im going to make 2.8 inch lcd instead of shit stock casio watch type screen
[2024-03-04T15:43:43] Gabe Enzo: had a dream my 20s bms and charger released magic smoke
[2024-03-04T15:43:49] Gabe Enzo: Got super pissed
[2024-03-04T16:01:23] rosheee: 60A 😃
[2024-03-04T16:02:56] Gabe Enzo: Hmm
[2024-03-04T16:30:02] Jacob: What the fuck is it possible i just my vesc esc with 12s
[2024-03-04T16:30:37] Jacob: Drove up a very steep hill, and it shut down and motor is know like its braking when i pushing it
[2024-03-04T16:30:41] Jacob: Burned?
[2024-03-04T16:32:36] puneDir: Maybe motor burned
[2024-03-04T16:36:33] Jacob: Feels weird to say but i hope its motor not vesc
[2024-03-04T16:37:04] Jacob: But doesnt make sense i woulndt turn on
[2024-03-04T16:38:52] Jacob: How do i check if its the esc or motor
[2024-03-04T16:39:28] Jacob: And then turn on?
[2024-03-04T16:39:45] Jacob: Aight ill try when i pushed this home
[2024-03-04T16:44:24] Jacob: Nope im pretty sure its vesc, its vibrating when pushing, thats how the 6 other escs reacted when they burned
[2024-03-04T16:44:26] sombre_enfant: Better dont push it when its locked..
[2024-03-04T16:54:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if esc not fixed can turn of by heat , but this is also a settings question
[2024-03-04T17:18:56] Jacob: Hey i dont understand i've opened it and disconnected motor, and then turned it on, vesc lights green but nothing on esc and cant connect to it
[2024-03-04T17:20:20] Jacob: Can the dashboard be fucked or is vesc dead even tho it lights
[2024-03-04T17:51:36] puneDir: Does the motor turns freely when you disconnect motor cable
[2024-03-04T18:13:31] Jacob: Nope, burned the motor im pretty sure
[2024-03-04T18:13:52] puneDir: Rip motor
[2024-03-04T18:14:33] Jacob: Im more worried about the vesc tho
[2024-03-04T18:15:30] Jacob: Its dead if i turn it on and doesnt appear on screen even tho it lights green yea?
[2024-03-04T18:15:57] puneDir: Measure 5v
[2024-03-04T18:16:00] puneDir: Which vesc is it
[2024-03-04T18:17:14] puneDir: 3.3v and mcu working
[2024-03-04T18:17:20] puneDir: Maybe 5v dead cuz halls
[2024-03-04T18:17:40] puneDir: Flipsky doesnt have isolation on 5v (halls side)
[2024-03-04T18:24:05] Jacob: <photos/photo_13459@04-03-2024_18-24-05.jpg>
[2024-03-04T18:31:08] Jacob: How do i check whats wrong?
[2024-03-04T18:32:27] Gabe Enzo: You got another motor?
[2024-03-04T18:32:39] Gabe Enzo: I'm guessing your motor fried.
[2024-03-04T18:32:53] Gabe Enzo: Going uphill kills Xiaomi motors usually even at low voltage
[2024-03-04T18:33:13] Jacob: I used the 500w monorim and yes i have original 350w motor
[2024-03-04T18:33:24] Gabe Enzo: which one is the damaged one
[2024-03-04T18:33:30] Jacob: But wouldnt it turn on then when i disconnected it?
[2024-03-04T18:33:38] Jacob: Monorim 500w damaged
[2024-03-04T18:33:53] Gabe Enzo: Does the ESC show a light?
[2024-03-04T18:34:21] Jacob: Green light
[2024-03-04T18:34:29] Jacob: But nothing on dashboard
[2024-03-04T18:34:31] Gabe Enzo: connect the other motor and see if it works.
[2024-03-04T18:34:38] Gabe Enzo: hmm
[2024-03-04T18:34:41] Gabe Enzo: Xiaomi dash?
[2024-03-04T18:35:08] Gabe Enzo: does it connect to vesc tool?
[2024-03-04T18:35:12] Jacob: Also i cant connect to it
[2024-03-04T18:35:15] Jacob: Nope
[2024-03-04T18:35:23] Jacob: But green light on
[2024-03-04T18:35:43] Gabe Enzo: Check if the Bluetooth board is flashing
[2024-03-04T18:35:51] Gabe Enzo: open up the scoot
[2024-03-04T18:35:53] Gabe Enzo: you'll have to anyway
[2024-03-04T18:35:58] Jacob: Its open
[2024-03-04T18:36:03] Jacob: I disconnected the motor
[2024-03-04T18:36:09] Jacob: And saw esc lighting
[2024-03-04T18:36:17] Gabe Enzo: What about the bt module?
[2024-03-04T18:36:35] Jacob: Okay ill write a bit later i didnt see if bt module lights (its covered it black tape
[2024-03-04T18:57:47] Happy Giraffe: With 100 or 80A, didn't you have a temperature sensor there?🤔
[2024-03-04T19:01:18] Jacob: I sure did, but unfortunately didnt look at the app. And the motor has never exceeded 30c for me so it surprises me
[2024-03-04T19:04:29] Jacob: @mrstealyogirI, bt module not lighting no
[2024-03-04T19:04:55] Happy Giraffe: Error with sensor then, who installed it?😅
[2024-03-04T19:05:56] Jacob: No it was working fine, when i leave home it was always on 25c then it falls because its cold, then i rode a hill the other day and hit my max temp for that motor 33c
[2024-03-04T19:07:39] Jacob: Can i troubleshoot the vesc to see if i can fix it?
[2024-03-04T19:08:04] Happy Giraffe: So normally its temp range was 22-70°c or?
[2024-03-04T19:08:56] Jacob: 16-30c
[2024-03-04T19:09:06] Jacob: Because its 7c outside
[2024-03-04T19:09:39] Happy Giraffe: Then it didnt work correctly and had maybe poor placement🤔
[2024-03-04T19:10:44] Jacob: Well possibly yeah, i've never seen where it is inside the motor
[2024-03-04T19:11:09] Happy Giraffe: Even at-20c motor winding slowly warms up. It takes bit time for it to do so if motor been outside for an hour😄
[2024-03-04T19:11:23] Jacob: Makes sense yeah
[2024-03-04T19:11:33] Jacob: But can i fix do you think?
[2024-03-04T19:11:47] Jacob: Im sure its too much phase that killed it
[2024-03-04T19:12:51] Happy Giraffe: Usually the duration of it
[2024-03-04T19:13:26] Happy Giraffe: Vesc shouldn't blow up imo🤔 if phases not shorted
[2024-03-04T19:14:35] Jacob: That could actually be what happened that it shorted, not sure tho
[2024-03-04T19:14:44] Jacob: The phase wires from motor melted
[2024-03-04T19:14:54] Jacob: <photos/photo_13461@04-03-2024_19-14-54.jpg>
[2024-03-04T19:15:03] Jacob: And came out on top maybe they touched
[2024-03-04T19:15:24] Happy Giraffe: This seems like a failed solder joint🤔
[2024-03-04T19:15:43] Happy Giraffe: Couldnt carry the current so it heated up to solder melting point
[2024-03-04T19:16:06] Jacob: Goddamn how hot was that thing
[2024-03-04T19:16:15] Jacob: You're right though
[2024-03-04T19:18:54] Happy Giraffe: Cold solder joint will locally heat a ton with a decent current

[2024-03-04T19:19:36] puneDir: Cengiz cooking
[2024-03-04T19:21:45] Jacob: @Mirono_escooters do you have any ideas what the esc may suffer from? I mean burned mosfet, resistor or so?
[2024-03-04T19:23:27] Gabe Enzo: I was about to tell you this could be the case
[2024-03-04T19:24:55] Gabe Enzo: Damn
[2024-03-04T19:25:05] Gabe Enzo: Burned FETs 100%.
[2024-03-04T19:25:30] NetworkDir: G30LD 20s5p by @fungus93 :) Cengiz every time make a crazy and nice things.
[2024-03-04T19:27:23] Jacob: Always the fets 😥
[2024-03-04T19:27:48] Jacob: But that means it should work if i just change the burnt mosfet/s
[2024-03-04T19:29:03] Mirono escooters: Not following this
[2024-03-04T19:29:10] Mirono escooters: Many chats Tldr?
[2024-03-04T19:29:50] Gabe Enzo: check fets for shorts
[2024-03-04T19:30:03] Gabe Enzo: pray you didn't burn anything else
[2024-03-04T19:30:12] Gabe Enzo: fets usually take the hit
[2024-03-04T19:33:14] Jacob: Ah yeah wanted to hear if you had any idea what could be the part that burnt (i drove uphill and burnt both motor and something in vesc, but im trying to fix vesc)
[2024-03-04T19:33:32] Jacob: Thank you Gabe! I'll take a look
[2024-03-04T19:33:52] Yamal: Today time for check the infront hall,,,,
[2024-03-04T19:34:40] puneDir: ure late
[2024-03-04T19:40:45] haku: very nice. what cells?
[2024-03-04T19:50:46] Jacob: How do i test these fets?
[2024-03-04T19:51:01] Jacob: I have before seen mosfets with 3 pins
[2024-03-04T19:54:30] Gabe Enzo: If 1 and 3 is shorted it's dead I believe
[2024-03-04T19:54:53] Jacob: Yeah but where do i test them here?
[2024-03-04T19:55:07] Jacob: On the other side?
[2024-03-04T19:55:32] Gabe Enzo: Oh shit forgot these aren't xesc type FETs
[2024-03-04T19:55:35] Gabe Enzo: Wait
[2024-03-04T19:55:56] Gabe Enzo: Someone else will know
[2024-03-04T19:56:26] Jacob: Ah okay, i'll wait till they come along
[2024-03-04T19:56:41] Jacob: Thank you for your help man :)

[2024-03-04T19:58:50] Finn: Test between drain and source
[2024-03-04T19:59:15] Jacob: Ah thank you! And plus on source or plus on drain?
[2024-03-04T19:59:51] Finn: <photos/photo_13468@04-03-2024_19-59-51.jpg>

[2024-03-04T20:00:16] Finn: Nchannel enhancement type should be always open

[2024-03-04T20:02:02] Jacob: Drain on bottom
[2024-03-04T20:03:22] Jacob: <photos/photo_13470@04-03-2024_20-03-22.jpg>
[2024-03-04T20:03:46] Jacob: Ohhh heres some of the drain
[2024-03-04T20:03:52] Finn: Yes
[2024-03-04T20:03:57] Finn: Look here
[2024-03-04T20:04:13] Jacob: Oh yeah thanks im blind :)
[2024-03-04T20:05:26] Gabe Enzo: Guesing 2 of them blew
[2024-03-04T20:05:33] Gabe Enzo: usually one phase does it
[2024-03-04T20:05:46] Gabe Enzo: check pms
[2024-03-04T20:09:48] Jacob: Well actually now im confused because according to my logic they are all good
[2024-03-04T20:09:59] Jacob: They all show some number around 392
[2024-03-04T20:13:16] Jacob: All of them like this
[2024-03-04T20:14:02] Gabe Enzo: Hmmm so none of them are dead? interesting..
[2024-03-04T20:16:50] Jacob: Nope doesnt seem like it, so now its really confusing, i'll see if someone has any ideas what else it could be
[2024-03-04T20:17:04] Gabe Enzo: What's under the board? is it glued?
[2024-03-04T20:17:31] Gabe Enzo: Don't pry it open if it is
[2024-03-04T20:17:47] Jacob: Basically a layer of solid thermalpaste
[2024-03-04T20:19:42] puneDir: This thing has 3 fets only?
[2024-03-04T20:19:49] Gabe Enzo: it has 6.
[2024-03-04T20:19:51] Gabe Enzo: look on the bottom
[2024-03-04T20:19:53] Gabe Enzo: mirrored
[2024-03-04T20:19:56] puneDir: Oh
[2024-03-04T20:21:49] haku: how thick are your phase cables? do you have a hard time bending it?
[2024-03-04T20:22:26] Gabe Enzo: phase operator could've died
[2024-03-04T20:22:30] Gabe Enzo: any one of 3
[2024-03-04T20:22:40] Gabe Enzo: happened to my xesc but an esc is an esc
[2024-03-04T20:27:20] Jacob: Where are those?
[2024-03-04T20:27:35] Jacob: <photos/photo_13473@04-03-2024_20-27-35.jpg>
[2024-03-04T20:30:49] Gabe Enzo: These I believe, I wouldn't know how to test them tho. When it happened to me they simply looked blown.
[2024-03-04T20:31:29] Gabe Enzo: look with a scope and try find anything that's melted or brown
[2024-03-04T20:35:30] haku: if anyone interested $8.00 a roll petg. ive tried the pla of this brand and its not bad. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $68.82 38%OFF | KINGROON 10KG PLA PETG Mix color Filaments 10 Rolls/Box 1.75mm Filament Wholesales https://a.aliexpress.com/_m0mrr9C
[2024-03-04T20:37:52] Jacob: Hmmm it doesnt make sense, it looks as new as it just came out of the fabric, clean and tidy
[2024-03-04T20:38:20] Jacob: Maybe i'll have to try and put it back together, and try again
[2024-03-04T20:57:25] Jacob: Thanks good idea ill try :)
[2024-03-04T21:28:01] Yamal: My cables are at the exit of the 3.5/4 mm shaft, the standard ones, then we had to lengthen them with slightly thicker silicone ones
[2024-03-04T21:28:56] haku: is the silocone easier to bend
[2024-03-04T21:30:04] Yamal: Silicone cables are the best! They are super flexible
[2024-03-04T21:30:41] haku: is it copper wires?
[2024-03-04T21:33:20] Gabe Enzo: Hmm? they have to be.
[2024-03-04T21:33:24] Gabe Enzo: nothing else is conductive enough.
[2024-03-04T21:33:42] Gabe Enzo: except like gold but fuck that amirite
[2024-03-04T21:34:47] haku: there are silicone wires thats not copper i think. its like small strands of tinned wires
[2024-03-04T21:34:48] haku: easier to bend
[2024-03-04T21:35:02] NetworkDir: Should g30 stock cells
[2024-03-04T21:36:05] haku: i see
[2024-03-04T21:37:27] haku: i see. audio guys talk about these wires too. i forgot the kind of wires
[2024-03-04T21:39:33] haku: its like this
[2024-03-04T21:39:34] haku: <photos/photo_13476@04-03-2024_21-39-34.jpg>
[2024-03-04T21:39:47] Gabe Enzo: Both copper
[2024-03-04T21:40:29] haku: is there a difference in resistance and bendyness?
[2024-03-04T21:42:10] haku: there is also different sleeves. pvc or silicone. i think my phase wires are pvc thats why its hard to bend
[2024-03-04T21:43:03] haku: gotcha
[2024-03-04T21:43:07] Gabe Enzo: No, they're teflon plated. Also it uses thicker strands of copper.
[2024-03-04T21:43:13] Gabe Enzo: The usual for phase wires
[2024-03-04T21:43:34] Gabe Enzo: PVC is low temperature only.
[2024-03-04T21:43:46] haku: for batteries does it even matter? pvc or silicone?
[2024-03-04T21:44:27] Gabe Enzo: Using house wire pvc is awful for that.
[2024-03-04T21:44:37] Gabe Enzo: If you use super thick wires sure, but why?
[2024-03-04T21:46:24] haku: i see. im always wondering why other 70h have small cables. i thought LY just change the phase cables for looks
[2024-03-04T21:46:52] haku: wich is dumb because its oversized
[2024-03-04T21:47:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔 maybe beep mode on multimeter helps more Black in negative side of xt plug Positive should touch phase wires one buy one, Than the other way around, positive in the positive side of xt and negative on phases one buy one . Every beep is a short In the first place on the negative side,in The second positive side. If it beeps anytime dont plug back power coz plug will burn in your hand
[2024-03-04T21:47:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If i read right he said motorhas resitance by it self unplugged
[2024-03-04T21:53:47] haku: ill test this later solder sucker iron.
[2024-03-04T22:02:39] Jacob: I have an original pro 2 motor i can try with esc
[2024-03-04T22:03:14] Jacob: But i'll need to connect it to power for the motor to be tough to turn if esc is dead yeah?
[2024-03-04T22:03:59] Jacob: But im afraid of it saying 💥 when connecting again, cause all the other times i har burnt controllers and connected them again they created the biggest sparks ive seen
[2024-03-04T22:05:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's why you measure as i said
[2024-03-04T22:06:03] Yamal: From before is like this when I get this motor , just short..
[2024-03-04T22:06:05] Yamal: Does anyone have nickel-plated copper heatsink links?
[2024-03-04T22:07:36] Jacob: No beeps
[2024-03-04T22:08:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sent example in DM
[2024-03-04T22:09:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than if ok ,should be no spark or a little
[2024-03-04T22:09:07] Jacob: <video_file>
[2024-03-04T22:10:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks good
[2024-03-04T22:10:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i watch with no sound
[2024-03-04T22:10:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not at home atm
[2024-03-04T22:10:35] Jacob: There wasnt any beep i can tell you
[2024-03-04T22:11:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you touch the two ends of the multimeter you can be sure its on beep,but if it was than try with other motor
[2024-03-04T22:11:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: First just connect motor and spin by hand that should have no resitance
[2024-03-04T22:11:55] Jacob: Was no beep
[2024-03-04T22:12:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you you connect power and try
[2024-03-04T22:15:59] haku: what do you need it for. vesc?
[2024-03-04T22:16:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nope, but should get the effect with alu also ,but you could diy it
[2024-03-04T22:16:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Buys the copper heasink and get anodizing kit
[2024-03-04T22:17:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or try buy like that🤔
[2024-03-04T22:17:12] Jacob: Did that, no resistance
[2024-03-04T22:17:37] Jacob: Also tested them worked all
[2024-03-04T22:17:49] Jacob: What then is the problem i dont knoe
[2024-03-04T22:21:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or go other way around wirh diy , that's more easy Galvanise you copper heasinks , that's not to hard i can explain, only few things needed
[2024-03-04T22:22:04] haku: aluminum should be fine yea? or copper really makes a big difference?
[2024-03-04T22:22:17] Jacob: Well i'll have to connect it now to see if it works, but otherwise then probably yeah
[2024-03-04T22:22:23] haku: its only transfering heat
[2024-03-04T22:22:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is long answer
[2024-03-04T22:22:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So basically yes and no
[2024-03-04T22:23:08] haku: i guess thats why computer gpu/cpu uses copper
[2024-03-04T22:24:21] Finn: got the same
[2024-03-04T22:24:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Copper is better ,but since rest The inside part alu , Scooters body alu Half bridge not same stuff ,so doesnt make bigger differnce when last "layer" is better only
[2024-03-04T22:24:23] Finn: works very good
[2024-03-04T22:25:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He could just isolate with silicone sheet than nothing else needed if outside
[2024-03-04T22:25:23] haku: ill test it tonight.
[2024-03-04T22:25:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's ment for inside use
[2024-03-04T22:26:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But also pure copper starts to oxid
[2024-03-04T22:26:04] haku: car radiators are aluminum yea?
[2024-03-04T22:26:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mostly
[2024-03-04T22:26:42] haku: well any heatsink i guess aslong as its metal and tramsfering heat
[2024-03-04T22:27:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically i would not mix copper on frame if not well isolated, copper eats aluminium if they touch,copper brings down a lot
[2024-03-04T22:29:02] haku: you can also just buy the copper heatsink and nickel plate at home. its very simple but never done it
[2024-03-04T22:29:33] haku: i see. thats what some guy says about galvanic corrosion
[2024-03-04T22:29:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Me either
[2024-03-04T22:30:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Electro corrosion, bit of moisture enough
[2024-03-04T22:30:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also copper kills tons of different bakteria
[2024-03-04T22:31:16] haku: ive read that. thats why copper pipes are better
[2024-03-04T22:31:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This side is Pretty interesting, i mean the effectiveness is like shooting on paper sheet with a shootgun , that's kinda the way copper works on them😁
[2024-03-04T22:32:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In japan waste water channel is from copper
[2024-03-04T22:33:13] Yamal: and cool with water heatsink😂
[2024-03-04T22:33:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In the past it was mandatory for hospitals to have copper door handles
[2024-03-04T22:34:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically it protects it self in way but that doesnt like alu
[2024-03-04T22:34:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's why copper turns green
[2024-03-04T22:34:25] haku: would be cool to try nickel plated copper bussbars for batteries though
[2024-03-04T22:34:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Oxid
[2024-03-04T22:34:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its getting thicker from it
[2024-03-04T22:34:58] haku: patina yea?
[2024-03-04T22:35:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes basically
[2024-03-04T22:35:16] Yamal: but I definitely want to leave the hall sensors installed and mount a good heatsink, which I repeat I have no problems with the temperature, but things change in the circuit,,,,
[2024-03-04T22:35:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But its over effective, like church stairs needs to be sanded to get green stuff off 😁
[2024-03-04T22:36:13] haku: stautuenof liberty is copper.
[2024-03-04T22:36:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yep
[2024-03-04T22:36:39] haku: gifted by the french 😂
[2024-03-04T22:39:09] Yamal: and fans for fan fins,,?
[2024-03-04T23:01:27] Happy Giraffe: Time to go sensorless😂
[2024-03-04T23:01:45] Happy Giraffe: *insert HFI whine noises*
[2024-03-05T00:39:23] haku: @jamessoderstrom @TherealLizardDoggo this solder sucker iron is legit.
[2024-03-05T00:49:00] haku: <video_file>
[2024-03-05T00:49:55] haku: im just pulling off stuff that i dont even know. im not sure if its fast. faster than wick for sure
[2024-03-05T00:51:56] haku: it does get clean holes
[2024-03-05T01:03:04] haku: not too long. maybe a min
[2024-03-05T01:04:43] haku: good product for the price
[2024-03-05T01:06:34] haku: $2 cheaper now Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $12.26 70%OFF | YIHUA 30W 929D-V Electric Vacuum Desoldering Iron Suction Pump Iron Gun Soldering Repair Tool with Welding Nozzle 110V 220V https://a.aliexpress.com/_mshf5sq
[2024-03-05T05:50:58] haku: is there an upgrade aside from mounted jst ports or any new ports that the new spintend adc adapter have over the old one?
[2024-03-05T05:51:43] haku: https://spintend.com/products/ewheel-adc-adapter-v3-for-diy-ebike-escooter-with-vesc
[2024-03-05T05:51:44] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-03-05T07:03:55] Happy Giraffe: I think biggest change is the single/dual switch
[2024-03-05T07:04:44] haku: the v2 had that too i think
[2024-03-05T07:04:55] Happy Giraffe: So many light ports each giving 36w I'm kinda sceptical
[2024-03-05T07:06:13] haku: i want to get this but i already cut the cables and made jst connectors for the v2
[2024-03-05T07:06:56] haku: my spiny is completely different wiring than this
[2024-03-05T07:07:58] haku: thats good that thier always innovating though
[2024-03-05T07:11:20] Happy Giraffe: Kinda wished they would go to the newest latchinh jst style as its more secure and comes out easier if needed😂
[2024-03-05T09:45:38] Jacob: I just tried connecting it again, its just the same, nothing one screen but lighting green, anything to about the 5v circuit?
[2024-03-05T09:48:15] Happy Giraffe: Interesting if it blew critical esc components instead of just hall port. Otherwise you could use motor sensorless but if you can't connect to vesc at all its kaput
[2024-03-05T10:12:38] Jacob: goddamn what did i do wrong since i burned my whole setup
[2024-03-05T10:13:11] Jacob: ill try maybe connecting another dash. Cant i replace the critical components?
[2024-03-05T10:20:08] Happy Giraffe: Thermistor settings wrong. Also something else you changed after James did setup for you😁
[2024-03-05T10:20:46] Happy Giraffe: If setup works then saving a backup of it is useful and shouldnt change settings you dont know 😅
[2024-03-05T10:23:19] puneDir: why use single
[2024-03-05T10:23:40] puneDir: Isnt it called mosfet driver
[2024-03-05T10:23:53] puneDir: Phase operator 😳
[2024-03-05T10:24:49] puneDir: Does 5v rail showing 0v?
[2024-03-05T10:24:53] Jacob: lol rip 300 eur💸
[2024-03-05T10:24:58] puneDir: Also is there a short between 5v and gnd?
[2024-03-05T10:25:05] puneDir: no imma make u fix
[2024-03-05T10:25:05] Jacob: how do you measure they rail?
[2024-03-05T10:25:10] puneDir: Multimeter
[2024-03-05T10:25:25] Jacob: yeah i know but where on the esc
[2024-03-05T10:25:39] puneDir: Dont you have any 5v ports
[2024-03-05T10:25:55] Jacob: ah so just measuring in the port
[2024-03-05T10:26:10] Jacob: ill send you picture of it when im home again
[2024-03-05T10:27:19] puneDir: Ye
[2024-03-05T10:27:25] puneDir: Measure gnd - 5v
[2024-03-05T10:27:32] puneDir: In buzzer mode
[2024-03-05T10:27:46] Jacob: thanks mate
[2024-03-05T10:28:08] puneDir: Also measure the voltage Maybe theres some fuse in spintend
[2024-03-05T10:28:46] Jacob: Okay i'll do that after school :)
[2024-03-05T10:29:07] puneDir: I will help you Hope you can get it into life again
[2024-03-05T10:34:27] Happy Giraffe: For police or road conditions to think a few
[2024-03-05T10:44:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have a similar one ,when board is not too "crouded" its good . But you need to keep it clean ,coz after a while it sucked up a lot ,it will spit balls
[2024-03-05T10:45:38] puneDir: Imagine driving something police can catch :)
[2024-03-05T11:22:31] Gabe Enzo: Point Made
[2024-03-05T11:31:55] sombre_enfant: I really want it... But pay 22€ shipping and 20 of fedex tax just for that....
[2024-03-05T11:32:34] sombre_enfant: Is it possible to feed 12v from another source than the vesc ? The ubox buck are low...
[2024-03-05T11:52:10] Happy Giraffe: Time to get a rather bulky dc-dc conv🥲 Or get lights that support batt voltage
[2024-03-05T11:56:16] puneDir: So excited 2 things left to do Sand and paint the extender Connect the connectors :)))
[2024-03-05T12:03:07] sombre_enfant: I can simply put a dualtron converter
[2024-03-05T12:07:06] Happy Giraffe: What specs on the DT conv? I put way overkill 12v 10A on my 30w phone charger and 20w lights lol
[2024-03-05T12:07:56] sombre_enfant: 12v 3A i think
[2024-03-05T12:59:44] puneDir: get 12v 3a adapter remove rectifier give voltage from 400v capacitor
[2024-03-05T13:00:04] puneDir: free also good and reliable
[2024-03-05T13:02:54] puneDir: does ubox has fuse on 5v?
[2024-03-05T13:03:14] puneDir: or isolated 5v on halls
[2024-03-05T13:28:28] Rose: Hey there J.​B, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-05T14:49:46] Happy Giraffe: For fun, does anybody know whos Alan Hu?
[2024-03-05T15:00:52] Mirono escooters: Who
[2024-03-05T15:14:51] Happy Giraffe: Old scammer guy from ERT company, he was kinda like Artem Bulashev. He took money and didnt deliver to customers😂
[2024-03-05T15:15:21] Happy Giraffe: He was doing business with batteries, BAC controllers etc
[2024-03-05T15:32:03] Mirono escooters: funny, dont know him
[2024-03-05T15:32:57] sombre_enfant: My roles model
[2024-03-05T15:37:01] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt Sombre wanna be a fast scooter roadman instead? Would be more honest way to live
[2024-03-05T15:37:24] Mirono escooters: tf
[2024-03-05T16:24:41] Jacob: Hey friend, home from school :)
[2024-03-05T16:25:19] Jacob: Where do you want me to measure theres a bunch of gnd's here
[2024-03-05T16:37:54] sombre_enfant: Any
[2024-03-05T16:44:53] Jacob: It doesnt beep when those are touched
[2024-03-05T16:48:21] Jacob: But shows 315
[2024-03-05T17:04:09] puneDir: Does it gives 5v output
[2024-03-05T17:09:03] Jacob: Oh shit i measured continuity, i'll connect it with batteries and try. So then minus on gnd and plus on 5v?
[2024-03-05T17:20:12] puneDir: 5v and some random gnd
[2024-03-05T17:28:40] Jacob: Nope doesnt output any volts
[2024-03-05T17:29:23] Jacob: Man was right
[2024-03-05T17:34:01] puneDir: Mostly happens
[2024-03-05T17:34:17] puneDir: Send the pcb
[2024-03-05T17:34:27] puneDir: And grab the multimetwr
[2024-03-05T17:34:46] puneDir: I burned 2 vescs like that
[2024-03-05T17:35:08] puneDir: Its easy to isolate halls 5v You just need 2 1n4148 diodes
[2024-03-05T17:35:51] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-03-05T17:37:47] Jacob: Send it to you?
[2024-03-05T17:38:42] Jacob: You're a life saver man! thank you!

[2024-03-05T20:24:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: I installed the filters comes on needs to be disables
[2024-03-05T20:24:10] haku: making this now haha
[2024-03-05T20:24:58] sombre_enfant: Its disabled from source code, u cant use it anyway
[2024-03-05T20:27:11] Mirono escooters: Seems fine
[2024-03-05T20:35:33] Chris Culver: Because I accidentally allowed the BAT+ wire to touch the ground. Now there is no voltage on BAT and I'd like to fix
[2024-03-05T21:03:38] Happy Giraffe: Bambulab printers are insane😳
[2024-03-05T21:04:39] haku: all printers are good others just require more pro tuning yea
[2024-03-05T21:05:10] haku: bambu is noob friendly
[2024-03-05T21:16:55] Happy Giraffe: I cant see the day my ender printing like that😂
[2024-03-05T21:17:58] haku: even with klipper? thats crazy
[2024-03-05T21:18:43] haku: i wanted to get that sunlu printer that was linked here 300×300 bed
[2024-03-05T21:19:13] haku: it will be challenging for me to tune it.

[2024-03-05T21:24:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure ,maybe @Mltra or @Mirono_escooters knows they use to repair
[2024-03-05T21:25:16] Jacob: Oh yeah got good pic
[2024-03-05T21:25:19] Jacob: <photos/photo_13486@05-03-2024_21-25-19.jpg>
[2024-03-05T21:27:41] Mirono escooters: How and where
[2024-03-05T21:56:17] Finn: prob 5v
[2024-03-05T21:58:09] NetworkDir: check fuses
[2024-03-05T21:58:30] NetworkDir: "All power circuit(12v/3.3v/5v) is protected by recovery fuse,so does to ignite port"
[2024-03-05T21:59:01] NetworkDir: if your ubox died with hall sensor your hall shorted with phases
[2024-03-05T22:00:21] Konstantin: This version use 12v to ignition;))
[2024-03-05T22:01:51] NetworkDir: also check this components
[2024-03-05T22:03:33] sombre_enfant: What y all think of anycubic on linear rail and 40x40 printing surface ?
[2024-03-05T22:03:54] haku: what tool do you use to check if compoments working? multimeter?
[2024-03-05T22:03:57] sombre_enfant: E3d v6 head
[2024-03-05T22:04:15] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-03-05T22:04:44] haku: do you plug it in a powersupply then check?
[2024-03-05T22:05:28] NetworkDir: Multimeter Oscilloscope
[2024-03-05T22:05:39] NetworkDir: Depends to what you checking
[2024-03-05T22:06:00] NetworkDir: Sometimes you should take components from pcb for true result
[2024-03-05T22:06:27] haku: gotcha thanks.
[2024-03-05T22:07:08] NetworkDir: Yes, looks repairable
[2024-03-05T22:07:28] haku: 40x40 is small
[2024-03-05T22:08:20] haku: 255x255 already small for me.
[2024-03-05T22:08:59] haku: 40x40cm? or mm im not a metric guy
[2024-03-05T22:09:29] Jacob: Thank you is it just + one end of the fuse - the other end?
[2024-03-05T22:10:04] haku: is it a printer for ants?
[2024-03-05T22:28:27] sombre_enfant: Cm

[2024-03-05T22:38:56] haku: i also got a .6 and a .4 $2 hardened CHT nozzle
[2024-03-05T22:39:14] haku: i want to try carbon
[2024-03-05T22:39:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont have any hardened ,but tried1mm nozzle ,that eats filament like shit😁
[2024-03-05T22:40:06] haku: gotcha. the ones you need is the one without copper inside?
[2024-03-05T22:41:29] haku: i see. very nice. i just have to figure out if its plug and play without any calibrations
[2024-03-05T22:43:36] haku: have you tried printing in ludacris mode?
[2024-03-05T22:44:02] haku: i didnt even know they have thay setting till last week
[2024-03-05T22:50:36] haku: 13hr print this one.
[2024-03-05T22:55:51] Happy Giraffe: Dis good
[2024-03-05T22:56:26] Happy Giraffe: Dont use 0.4mm for carbon fiber materials😁
[2024-03-05T22:57:25] haku: .8 yea?
[2024-03-05T23:07:34] Happy Giraffe: 0.4mm too small for the fibers, it will be bad😅
[2024-03-05T23:07:39] haku: wow
[2024-03-05T23:07:42] Happy Giraffe: 0.6 enough
[2024-03-05T23:07:55] Happy Giraffe: That's what I would want😂
[2024-03-05T23:08:22] haku: would you recomend this over qs8 for only 350a?
[2024-03-05T23:08:43] Happy Giraffe: 350A batt current?😂😭
[2024-03-05T23:09:07] haku: sorry 175 ea.

[2024-03-05T23:13:38] haku: true irishman
[2024-03-05T23:14:34] Gabe Enzo: some four loko as the chaser
[2024-03-05T23:14:41] Gabe Enzo: that's what like Americans drink TO get drunk.
[2024-03-05T23:15:35] haku: whisky baby
[2024-03-05T23:16:04] Happy Giraffe: Where you gonna put qs10?
[2024-03-05T23:16:16] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2024-03-05T23:16:20] Gabe Enzo: What setup you gonna have?
[2024-03-05T23:16:35] Happy Giraffe: It aint pulling more than 150 with those cells🌚
[2024-03-05T23:16:39] Gabe Enzo: Bet you're getting paid handsomely
[2024-03-05T23:16:53] haku: what cells?
[2024-03-05T23:17:53] Happy Giraffe: How much 58T is tested to handle?
[2024-03-05T23:18:08] Happy Giraffe: Isnt 7.5A already quite a bit continuous?🤔
[2024-03-05T23:18:38] Happy Giraffe: Do you have setup to test yourself?🤔
[2024-03-05T23:19:45] Happy Giraffe: What about acIR?
[2024-03-05T23:21:06] Gabe Enzo: I told some of my engineer friends my new cell will have 26kw peak. they can't believe it 😂
[2024-03-05T23:21:11] Gabe Enzo: well they can, they're just bamboozled
[2024-03-05T23:21:15] Gabe Enzo: You know what I mean
[2024-03-05T23:21:47] Happy Giraffe: We have no idea what your on about but atleast you are in correct topic room😂
[2024-03-05T23:22:02] Gabe Enzo: Yeah, I'll have to. Some ass Stole my other one, it was 100€.
[2024-03-05T23:22:06] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2024-03-05T23:22:10] Gabe Enzo: I'm no spammer.
[2024-03-05T23:22:18] haku: @james have you built a battery with nmc pouches before? what brand would be good?
[2024-03-05T23:23:16] Gabe Enzo: Moto certified only. Anyway it fell once off the stairs, wasn't comfortable using it again anyhow.
[2024-03-05T23:23:17] Happy Giraffe: He needs to drink like a finn, but better not film it then. We have a specific word for getting drunk alone on the sofa wearing only boxers. "kalsarikännit"
[2024-03-05T23:23:34] Gabe Enzo: Nah getting drunk with a friend. Fuck drinking alone.
[2024-03-05T23:23:39] Gabe Enzo: Drinking alone = alcoholism
[2024-03-05T23:24:12] Gabe Enzo: as you know once it has a micro fracture it's best to throw it away. life and death here.
[2024-03-05T23:25:20] haku: would you recomend this over cylidrical cells?
[2024-03-05T23:26:25] Happy Giraffe: If your scooter doesnt look like Panzerkampfwagen IV then dont try your luck
[2024-03-05T23:27:18] haku: 😂
[2024-03-05T23:27:39] Happy Giraffe: Mr Tunstens one will, tomorrow will be fun drilling some stainless sheet and welding it to be 10mm thick construction🌚
[2024-03-05T23:28:09] Happy Giraffe: Im still waiting solid state cells from 2018
[2024-03-05T23:28:11] haku: gotcha. so its very rare to get grade a pouches. maybe in the US theres some sellers
[2024-03-05T23:30:33] Gabe Enzo: You Finnish ya?
[2024-03-05T23:30:47] Gabe Enzo: 100%>
[2024-03-05T23:30:56] Happy Giraffe: Nah he geh, swedish
[2024-03-05T23:30:56] haku: aliexpress/alibaba would not be ideal place to buy it?
[2024-03-05T23:31:02] Gabe Enzo: No lol
[2024-03-05T23:31:28] haku: most pouches are made in china bro
[2024-03-05T23:31:36] Gabe Enzo: Ok that is correct
[2024-03-05T23:31:42] Gabe Enzo: but like I just don't trust AliExpress
[2024-03-05T23:31:43] Gabe Enzo: at all
[2024-03-05T23:31:46] haku: thats the tech they use i. thier EVs
[2024-03-05T23:31:47] Happy Giraffe: Finns are the chads and swedes are the homopojkarna who march in parades
[2024-03-05T23:31:55] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-03-05T23:33:12] Happy Giraffe: We should both move to Norway anyways, I like Norwegian girls
[2024-03-05T23:33:29] Happy Giraffe: Tall, blonde...all that good stuff
[2024-03-05T23:33:36] cihan: I'm sorry for interrupting the conversation but are there any 51mm post mount calipers? Postmount standard is 74mm between screws. IS mount standard is 51mm between screws. However ninebot f2 pro uses 51mm post mount calipers. I want to change the stock caliper with a better one but I cannot find. There's an adapter like this on AliExpress for 51mm post mount to 74mm post mount but that's the only one I could find. https://a.aliexpress.com/_EJ6bd9X
[2024-03-05T23:35:04] haku: maybe @PaoloWu can recomend some good nmc vendors.
[2024-03-05T23:35:34] Happy Giraffe: No xtech for love of god
[2024-03-05T23:36:14] haku: xtech is hydraulic with cables yea?
[2024-03-05T23:36:33] Happy Giraffe: Yup and sucks ass big time
[2024-03-05T23:37:53] Happy Giraffe: If you can give me dimensions I could propably mill the adapter for you from mild steel
[2024-03-05T23:37:53] cihan: I've seen some reviews on YouTube for xtech but they leak and not recommended, they even can't end a season. I think I'll continue with mechanical brakes but maybe a better one. I was almost about to buy Shimano br-m375, I thought mine were standard 74mm post mount, then I wanted to measure before placing order and they are 51. I don't know why ninebot does this.
[2024-03-05T23:38:25] Happy Giraffe: Also if theres very little space between rim/tire and brake caliper you might need a disc spacer
[2024-03-05T23:40:04] cihan: Thank you so much for your concern and help but I would just place an order if I can find one or continue with stocks. I think it's not worth the effort to build something for Ninebot f2 pro except bigger battery.
[2024-03-05T23:40:58] cihan: I've also seen same problem when popple wanted to upgrade to Nutt brakes from stock ones but they were already bigger scooters with 160mm stock disc rotor.
[2024-03-05T23:43:11] Happy Giraffe: You can find cheap 2-5mm brake rotor spacers from Ali/Amazon
[2024-03-05T23:43:43] cihan: I'll check it, thanks. By the way do you reside in Ukraine now?
[2024-03-05T23:43:54] Happy Giraffe: With them you might also have to move brake caliper also bit further out depending how much space you need
[2024-03-05T23:44:05] Happy Giraffe: Nope Im 100% finnish
[2024-03-05T23:45:48] cihan: I understand, thanks. I just wanted to ask since you could be residing in Turkey now. @Happy_Giraffe
[2024-03-05T23:46:25] Happy Giraffe: You from TR?
[2024-03-05T23:46:30] cihan: Yes
[2024-03-05T23:46:48] Happy Giraffe: Cool, seems we got some fellas from there👍
[2024-03-05T23:47:30] cihan: Ninebot has done something very strange with brakes. 5 bolt rotors, 51mm post mount calipers, all against standards.)
[2024-03-05T23:48:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Common in xiaomi, ninebot world I even told you possible sizes what exists
[2024-03-05T23:48:42] cihan: I know only punedir and Cengiz who's famous by punedir but never seen Cengiz in conversation here, I can't be here much though.
[2024-03-05T23:48:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Finnish him😁
[2024-03-05T23:50:00] cihan: Yes, you told Shimano calipers fitted on pro 2 as I remember. Is it also via 51mm PS to 74mm PS adapter?
[2024-03-05T23:53:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes with adapter
[2024-03-05T23:53:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Any bike type is only possible like that
[2024-03-05T23:54:18] cihan: Is it also such type PS /PS adapter? https://a.aliexpress.com/_EJ6bd9X
[2024-03-05T23:55:05] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2024-03-05T23:55:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What is ps😁
[2024-03-05T23:55:23] Gabe Enzo: H801 i believe
[2024-03-05T23:55:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also two kinds exists this and a less long
[2024-03-05T23:55:29] Gabe Enzo: for monoshit
[2024-03-05T23:55:48] cihan: Post screw. It's same as saying post mount but they shorten it as PS on part numbers, I don't know why.)
[2024-03-05T23:55:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I like that more but not the monorim version
[2024-03-05T23:56:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also Monorim had steel and now alu ,shit alu
[2024-03-05T23:56:51] cihan: Thank you
[2024-03-05T23:57:39] cihan: Why aluminum is worse? It's very rigid, Shimano higher end brake adapters are also all aluminum, forged aluminum as I know.
[2024-03-05T23:58:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It really depends on all which is better for you ,the one you linked mostly shitty for pro
[2024-03-05T23:58:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You use less from pads
[2024-03-05T23:58:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I talk about the one Monorim makes not other ones
[2024-03-05T23:59:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13490@05-03-2024_23-59-53.jpg>
[2024-03-05T23:59:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That
[2024-03-06T00:00:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its even bent on the pics 🤣
[2024-03-06T00:00:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Main hole area is so soft easy to brake even for a kid
[2024-03-06T00:00:39] cihan: Do you mean I won't be able to use whole pad area? I'll also use 120mm or maybe 140mm rotor if I use 51mm to 74mm adapter. I want to add another bicycle post mount adapter on top of 51mm to 74mm adapter.
[2024-03-06T00:00:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You find similar shaped on ali what is more sturdy
[2024-03-06T00:01:14] cihan: It really looks soft.
[2024-03-06T00:01:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For First question answer is yes
[2024-03-06T00:02:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure why you want adapter on adapter
[2024-03-06T00:02:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You wont be able and probably only 140 size disc will work
[2024-03-06T00:02:48] cihan: I just want to use bigger disc if possible together with better caliper.
[2024-03-06T00:03:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When you use any adapter you grow the height of the brake
[2024-03-06T00:03:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So 140 or 135 is probably needed to have good grip
[2024-03-06T00:03:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 140 size better disc
[2024-03-06T00:05:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also bike adapters mostly mount to side not on bottom
[2024-03-06T00:08:13] cihan: Somehow I have to try some different parts and see how they fit and return the ones which doesn't work but aliexpress is the only source for me, I can't buy them locally.
[2024-03-06T00:08:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EQdZnYH this is like the monorim one,but there is another what looks like this just thicker, but didn't buy such in a while
[2024-03-06T00:09:50] cihan: On the other hand spending for Ninebot f2 pro doesn't really make sense probably. I like riding it but I mostly like it because it's small and I can fit it in small elevators, small shops and carry easily when I need. Otherwise vsett 10 plus or bigger scooter seems better choice.
[2024-03-06T00:09:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If i were you would buy both adapter and 140 size monorim disc
[2024-03-06T00:10:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well , I agree with this
[2024-03-06T00:11:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think non of the tube body ninebots should exist
[2024-03-06T00:11:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No f or d series
[2024-03-06T00:11:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And forgot what is the name of there kid size one but that also a no go
[2024-03-06T00:12:17] cihan: I'll check the both, thanks. The adapter on the link wasn't listed for me when searching since seller doesn't ship to Turkey but I can find from another seller.
[2024-03-06T00:12:33] cihan: E series?
[2024-03-06T00:14:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I just linked the first one what came , search like xtech adapter for xiaomi and you find a lot , that's how they came
[2024-03-06T00:14:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe
[2024-03-06T00:14:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say crap😁
[2024-03-06T00:14:48] cihan: I rode xiaomi mi 3 lite. It was my first scooter and I bought from Amazon but returned after few rides. 5.2AH battery. But I'll remember it, it was the first scooter I ever rode.)
[2024-03-06T00:15:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bms and esc in one board ,while tiny batt pack plotted together and all dies after a while ,there are no parts what can be bought for replacement
[2024-03-06T00:15:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tbh
[2024-03-06T00:15:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's the other crap series
[2024-03-06T00:15:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Still nothing can be bought for it
[2024-03-06T00:15:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have one in parts
[2024-03-06T00:16:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also another f40 ,just changed Bearings on this too
[2024-03-06T00:16:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On f series lot Bearing damage
[2024-03-06T00:17:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Single mi3 epoxy neck gluing brake's like non other
[2024-03-06T00:18:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In one year i repaired more from that than 365 pro or pro2 all together
[2024-03-06T00:18:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13491@06-03-2024_00-18-46.jpg>
[2024-03-06T00:19:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: F40 opened ,how the fuck can that even happen
[2024-03-06T00:19:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That dust was inside
[2024-03-06T00:19:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tell you how its made with bad decisions
[2024-03-06T00:20:13] cihan: Yes, they're on same board but I don't feel like they'll die soon. At least ESC doesn't heat up a lot, front cooling radiator works and cells are good quality. I'm at 1300 km now and only problem I had is front bearing losing oil because of rain. I still didn't change that front bearing and keep running it after I greased it. Higher quality, more viscous NLGI 2 grease filled up 70% works, it doesn't take rain as easily as before now. I rode in heavy rain 4 times and front bearing still works fine. I'll change to SKF 2rsh once it loses grease again. I have 8 in stock at home.)
[2024-03-06T00:20:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You are mixing
[2024-03-06T00:20:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I said that about ninebot kid scooter
[2024-03-06T00:21:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: F series has sensorless hfi contoller
[2024-03-06T00:21:10] cihan: Did you change stock bearing or do you also need the better quality bearings you installed after stock bearing?
[2024-03-06T00:21:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure what you mean under cooling radiator
[2024-03-06T00:21:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Around esc all is plastic
[2024-03-06T00:22:39] cihan: I still didn't open mine, I wish I won't have such a bad surprise.)
[2024-03-06T00:22:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yu surly will
[2024-03-06T00:23:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or worse
[2024-03-06T00:24:08] cihan: There's a radiator like part on front of scooter. Mosfets are attached to a cooling radiator and that radiator faces the front part where there are some plastic ventilation area.
[2024-03-06T00:24:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Regreasing Bearings is pointless ,but i dont go into this conversation
[2024-03-06T00:25:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2024-03-06T00:25:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know how it looks and works
[2024-03-06T00:26:10] cihan: I'll see how long it will last after regreasing. I trust in Mobil SHC Polyrex 462. :)
[2024-03-06T00:26:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you like
[2024-03-06T00:27:15] cihan: Yes, like this. I think that front plastic part supplies some cooling.
[2024-03-06T00:27:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Supply nothing
[2024-03-06T00:27:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Esc fixed on plastic
[2024-03-06T00:28:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Heat transfer super slow
[2024-03-06T00:28:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just no high power used so doenst matter
[2024-03-06T00:30:13] cihan: I wanted to mean thic part in front. There's a hole like thing there. It should better be not covered with mud.)
[2024-03-06T00:31:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also tbh who made the way its made , like motor cable route and such ,i would kick the shit out from him ,stupidest way possible and probably will survive few stuff like this ,all is forced in ,no cable or tire change,like made it for first problem than throw away type
[2024-03-06T00:32:13] cihan: Probably I'll never use high power with f2 pro. I can install Xiaodash if I can fit 80 or more cells inside once current battery dies. 40 cells are not enough for 110 kg and 1kw.
[2024-03-06T00:32:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In single ones there is nothing like that ,just the ine with rear engine
[2024-03-06T00:32:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also g2 has similar hole for Horn
[2024-03-06T00:33:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Better buy bigger frame and sell this
[2024-03-06T00:34:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you admitted ,this has its limits and after a while you run in not worty stuff
[2024-03-06T00:34:08] cihan: So is this also for horn on f2 pro? I didn't think where horn sounds before, probably so.)
[2024-03-06T00:34:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dunno you need to check,i only said g2 similar hole is the horn
[2024-03-06T00:34:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dunno if f2 has one ,if yes you can test
[2024-03-06T00:35:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Put ear to hole and use horn and you find out😅😁
[2024-03-06T00:37:07] cihan: You're right but I don't know which one. I have f2 pro and navee n65 now. I can sell one of them. But they pay little for second hand so I can keep them as long as I have space. I need one small scooter. I go to a small market which sells quality milk everyday, only small scooter can fit in this market.)
[2024-03-06T00:37:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sell n65 than
[2024-03-06T00:38:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And get bigger frame and build that f2 will stay for milk😁
[2024-03-06T00:38:47] cihan: I don't want to leave scooter outside. Even shopkeeper told me to take scooter inside market I went there first time with scooter. A customer's locked bicycle has been stolen when parked outside 2 weeks ago.
[2024-03-06T00:39:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, i dont live in the best place on the world but mostly i dont lock my stuff at the neariest shop
[2024-03-06T00:40:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Non will try to take it
[2024-03-06T00:40:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also this is kinda expensive fam house area
[2024-03-06T00:40:32] cihan: :) I sometimes buy 12 litres of milk and deliver it to uncle and aunt too. That scooter made at least 500 km of 1300 km for buying milk.)
[2024-03-06T00:40:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont drink milk at all
[2024-03-06T00:43:20] cihan: It makes sense. I am not racist by any means but here we have at least 100K Syrians, Afghans in my home city. And that market selling milk is close to Syrian neighborhood in city center. By the way Afghans don't steal, there are almost no records. Afghans get involved in different crimes.)
[2024-03-06T00:44:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda no point ,but dietician could explain this good , depends on your purposes But long story short since we miss an enzim to be able to consume milk ,your body needs make something to able to consume it, so it makes a third material what helps ,too bad for this body takes calcium out from bones ,so i hope you dont drink milk for that reason
[2024-03-06T00:45:04] cihan: And even Turkish residents of the city steal. I cannot feel confident leaving scooter outside.
[2024-03-06T00:46:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We have kinda zero around my place and non of migrant ppl stay here ,we are not Germany or Sweden or so to give unlimited amount of money for them , so they leave fast as possible, here we would recommend then working
[2024-03-06T00:46:30] cihan: No, we make yogurt and I like milk with coffee. I don't drink for calcium. Cheese and yogurt are better choice to benefit from milk rather than drinking. Nothing compares yogurt made at home unless it's sheep milk yogurt also made at home.
[2024-03-06T00:47:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I rarely drink any milk , sometimes some cheese or joghurt and i dont really drink coffe either 😅🙈
[2024-03-06T00:47:55] cihan: Hungary doesn't accept Syrians, just a little. Turkey absorbed the shock and our government benefits from them. They are mostly given citizenship and vote for governing party.
[2024-03-06T00:48:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We dont accept any mass off ppl like this
[2024-03-06T00:49:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And Forcedly surly not
[2024-03-06T00:49:01] cihan: Many people don't eat cheese often in Europe. Cheese is usual and standard breakfast food here. There's no breakfast without cheese and bread.)
[2024-03-06T00:50:03] cihan: Great minds think alike, not Turkish mind unfortunately.)
[2024-03-06T00:50:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You have this 🤔🤔 I dunno the name kinda home made easy cheese it can be sweet or salty also , nothing exist in shops usually, dunno the name but i like that ,its common thing in Romania i think
[2024-03-06T00:51:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When lot of the syrians were moving around EU
[2024-03-06T00:51:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Here on main station was crazy
[2024-03-06T00:52:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lot of that ppl had lot money with them ,more than you make in an year and you sleep on the street ,but you have 3-4000 euro in cash
[2024-03-06T00:53:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also as i said we dont give free money so most of the ppl who dont want to work will leave
[2024-03-06T00:55:04] cihan: I found it translated as curd cheese, it's lor in Turkish. We don't make it at home but it's easy. It's also way of using old, sour milk, otherwise you cannot drink it.
[2024-03-06T00:55:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think we talk About the same thing
[2024-03-06T00:56:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean we have history together so probably this was a shared thingy after a while
[2024-03-06T00:56:22] cihan: That's the proper way. You cannot mix immigrants not speaking native language with natives so fast.
[2024-03-06T00:57:38] cihan: Possible, I don't know how nomad Turks in Asia make cheese now but they use some cultivation from sheep stomach as I know.
[2024-03-06T00:57:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We dont mind any ppl basically, if you go around here , you find that every city greet is in all city minority language also
[2024-03-06T00:58:29] cihan: Attila is very common name there as I know like here.
[2024-03-06T00:58:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Attila surly
[2024-03-06T00:58:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Attila the HUN
[2024-03-06T00:59:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: One of our great leaders when we came here
[2024-03-06T00:59:13] cihan: Yes, origin of the name is same here too.
[2024-03-06T00:59:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As history say Attila was gods whip
[2024-03-06T01:00:09] cihan: A history teacher who studied bachelor's in France told it's asked a lot in French crosswords.)
[2024-03-06T01:00:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, i am sure Attila is spining in his grave how we lost the "blood" 😁😅
[2024-03-06T01:00:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cool
[2024-03-06T01:01:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This came with one of his sons
[2024-03-06T01:01:07] haku: made this last night and filled it with quarters. i thought it wouldnt work haha.
[2024-03-06T01:01:32] cihan: Cats would love it if it wasn't so heavy.)
[2024-03-06T01:02:53] cihan: I don't know much about his sons and heritage, should read. There's also a strange trade between Hungary and Istanbul municipality in past. After Turkey did Cyprus operation, Turkish money lost too much value and there was economic crisis. None of the big bus manufacturers want to sell Istanbul municipality busses. And Hungary sold us about 5000 Ikarus. We paid it with dried grapes, figs, etc.)
[2024-03-06T01:03:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically fucked up europe and the German emperor calmed us with 3000 farmer ppl So dont go and rob all around ,they make food and teach us how to make😁
[2024-03-06T01:03:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Shortly that's the story
[2024-03-06T01:04:05] Happy Giraffe: Turkish coffee I wanna try made in the original way
[2024-03-06T01:04:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hot sand?
[2024-03-06T01:04:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That i would try also
[2024-03-06T01:05:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lol ,i just remember I have kinda fam history alsoy dads brother went a few times there and
[2024-03-06T01:06:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I only know this after i was old enough but he use to take a bag of fancy bath thingy with him and porn magazines ,since it was forbidden there
[2024-03-06T01:06:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You could trade does for anything
[2024-03-06T01:09:34] cihan: I'm not sure if it's originally made with hot sand but it became popular in recent years. It's common to brew with hot sand in eastern Turkey probably. You basically grind coffee as fine as you can and put it inside coffee pot and add room temperature water, add sugar if you desire. Mix it with spoon and put it on the stove. You take coffee pot from stove just before it boils, you shouldn't boil it so it keeps little cream and bubbles on it. And you pour it inside coffee cups. That's it. Espresso is better, you can extract more from coffee with espresso.)
[2024-03-06T01:11:02] Happy Giraffe: I think its the ritual and experience that makes it taste better😁
[2024-03-06T01:11:40] Happy Giraffe: We western people have no traditions anymore, everything is same fukin USA halloween and some weird ass monetary events
[2024-03-06T01:12:04] cihan: Is this what he brought for bathing?
[2024-03-06T01:12:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No
[2024-03-06T01:12:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He sold stuff not bought
[2024-03-06T01:13:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some fancy soap
[2024-03-06T01:13:36] cihan: Probably. It's better than any soluble coffee since you use pure coffee beans but espresso is still better for me.)
[2024-03-06T01:14:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This i have from malta,but the full thing
[2024-03-06T01:14:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: Any changelog and fix list of @kawaiinekololis firmware?
[2024-03-06T01:14:31] cihan: Ahh, probably soap made in southern Turkey with laurel oil. Olive oil soap is pretty common here.
[2024-03-06T01:15:04] cihan: It's too rough, I tried once. I prefer knitted clothe for soaping.)
[2024-03-06T01:15:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 👆👆👆
[2024-03-06T01:15:31] cihan: I mean as a bathing equipment.)
[2024-03-06T01:15:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Have is, not use
[2024-03-06T01:15:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean read
[2024-03-06T01:15:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Didn't buy anything
[2024-03-06T01:15:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sold stuff
[2024-03-06T01:16:10] cihan: Sold in Turkey?
[2024-03-06T01:16:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes
[2024-03-06T01:16:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Take it there illegaly
[2024-03-06T01:16:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That and porn stuff in the 80's
[2024-03-06T01:17:14] cihan: I understand now. It's something old for bathing but we never had at home in my childhood. I just bought one with packet delivery when I was in hotel and didn't have something for soaping.
[2024-03-06T01:17:41] cihan: Porn magazine should be really valuable in 80s.)
[2024-03-06T01:18:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Soap was good brand in that time also and kinda souther or easter can not be bought at that time
[2024-03-06T01:18:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Surly he had hard times with that
[2024-03-06T01:19:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Had organise places to sell
[2024-03-06T01:19:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: First time he got one out on market place and ppl were kinda running on him to get it
[2024-03-06T01:19:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅😅
[2024-03-06T01:19:58] cihan: I can guess it.)
[2024-03-06T01:20:00] Tommy ª: The last change was updating the way of how vesc reads adc input Before it was from 0 to 1 Now it's 0 to 3.3
[2024-03-06T01:20:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: He is on holidays?
[2024-03-06T01:20:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't seem last days here
[2024-03-06T01:21:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: I tried on the controllers and numbers god mutch better when reach the limit
[2024-03-06T01:21:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: Doesn't go crazy like normal no flipky
[2024-03-06T01:21:30] cihan: Coffee cups from home.) I think they're good if you drink coffee a few times a day since they're very small.
[2024-03-06T01:21:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: @jamessoderstrom I bought 2 84200 for blade gt wish me luck
[2024-03-06T01:22:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Was kinda dangerous,if he would get caught probably he would be still in jail😁
[2024-03-06T01:23:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice,but too fancy for daily drinking
[2024-03-06T01:23:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I used to drink long coffe earlier,but long from cream not water
[2024-03-06T01:24:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So more like lot sugar and cream with some coffe
[2024-03-06T01:24:43] haku: its 85/250 now 😘
[2024-03-06T01:26:15] cihan: He would be released soon after being caught probably. They wouldn't take him to court for selling porn magazine, judges had more wisdom in past here.
[2024-03-06T01:27:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Such was full illegal ,i mean the magazines and to sell ,smuggle in the country ,who knows🤷‍♂
[2024-03-06T01:27:22] cihan: They are, you cannot wash in dishwasher, the golden parts get worse easily, and the patterns fade away in time.
[2024-03-06T01:29:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lot would say it's not even coffe that way but 🤷‍♂ I like my life sweet coffe sweet And pussy sweet also 👍 Not salty or sour🤣🤣 Now i should go to rest before more
[2024-03-06T01:30:08] cihan: If it's about smuggling drug, anything narcotic, weapon, then it is considered to be serious crime but porn magazine doesn't hurt anyone.) Judges had more power and initiatives in past and were respected people who had wisdom. He would be released easily even he was brought to court. Today I cannot guess what happens, judges cannot judge anymore.)
[2024-03-06T01:31:36] cihan: Well tastes differ and cannot be judged.) Good night
[2024-03-06T01:48:40] Izuna 生活: What firmware???

[2024-03-06T04:53:29] Tommy ª: He maded a script 💀
[2024-03-06T04:55:38] Tommy ª: Yea, now it's fixed and i messed in the wrong repo 😭😭😭 but it's fixed
[2024-03-06T04:57:50] Tommy ª: It's funny, I just put a ntc in the motor In 1km I got 121°c at 22kmh (uphill) This thing gets hot fast
[2024-03-06T04:59:08] Tommy ª: At 100 the screen starts counting as letters So A0= 100 A1= 110 In the photo you see C1 so 121°c The ntc is located in the halls "hole" (I removed the board) Also the outside of the motor it's barely warm, imagine if "it's too hot outside" imagine inside the poor coil C:
[2024-03-06T05:02:51] Tommy ª: I was testing uphill at stock values (17amp) and 20-22kmh and I got that temps So from factory it gets already super hot (250w motor)
[2024-03-06T05:03:48] Tommy ª: Also I put a ntc probe bc my old motor don't liked uphills :')
[2024-03-06T05:06:55] Tommy ª: Now I'm with my stock 250w m365 motor The burned one is a pro2 The stock takes about 44amps phase max and the pro2 over 74 (overkill?)
[2024-03-06T05:08:36] haku: grilled bacon lol. just wanted to try if its possible
[2024-03-06T05:10:18] haku: if you guys interested its possible with inderect heat. the fat will make it flare up if cooked normally
[2024-03-06T05:14:08] Tommy ª: I got a 0mhz CPU 💀😭

[2024-03-06T15:41:38] Izuna 生活: I usually only push changes to the official code, all my changes are already in VESC. If someone asks me for a specific firmware, I'm only building from original source.
[2024-03-06T15:56:58] Happy Giraffe: Anybody know a good 4G alarm/tracker with phone app to put in scooter/bike?

[2024-03-06T16:24:15] Yamal: Many people say that having only one engine is good to avoid losing traction at the front, but obviously dual engines are more fun.

[2024-03-06T16:27:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dual makes more sense for me If contoller is on that lvl or setable , should be no problem
[2024-03-06T16:29:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks nice but no gear in slipers 😅
[2024-03-06T16:31:41] Yamal: 😂

[2024-03-06T17:02:16] Yamal: Do you think it would be useful to set up something?
[2024-03-06T17:02:53] sombre_enfant: No trash an heavy
[2024-03-06T17:04:44] Yamal: Made in Korea ..😁

[2024-03-06T18:18:51] haku: use it
[2024-03-06T18:33:33] Gabe Enzo: It seems the ender 3 pro has more luck with petG than PLA
[2024-03-06T18:33:33] Gabe Enzo: the pieces I'm printing are incredible
[2024-03-06T18:33:57] Gabe Enzo: I don't even have to peel it off, it just hovers above it when the bed temp drops
[2024-03-06T18:35:38] haku: petg is great. almost like pla but denser plastic
[2024-03-06T18:35:43] Gabe Enzo: Got 2 pieces done today, just the front part of the extender and then I'm sealing this Scoot. Well.. For a week lmfao

[2024-03-06T19:00:20] haku: that designed looks to be inspired by apollo pro
[2024-03-06T19:00:29] Happy Giraffe: Glass?😂
[2024-03-06T19:06:36] Jan: This company makes me so aggressive
[2024-03-06T19:07:17] haku: lol why?
[2024-03-06T19:08:20] haku: they clearly stole apollo design.
[2024-03-06T19:14:36] sombre_enfant: Ah tough u said 146kph
[2024-03-06T19:19:58] Jan: They try to access JREV tiktok, instagram etc, i've blocked already double digit amount of accounts from them
[2024-03-06T19:20:07] Jan: They only want to steal designs

[2024-03-06T19:21:06] haku: chinas gonna china

[2024-03-06T20:24:48] Happy Giraffe: Yes, global phenomenon. Also I dont want people touching my bike either. If vesc could have integrated open source 4G module it would be so cool...

[2024-03-06T21:00:58] haku: have you tested it?
[2024-03-06T21:03:29] Unknown: My bad . The gps module is separate from vesc express. No I haven’t tested it yet but definitely looking forward to https://trampaboards.com/gps-module-for-vesc-express--p-35258.html

[2024-03-06T23:29:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Big boy
[2024-03-06T23:29:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This port was on it like this i guess
[2024-03-06T23:29:58] haku: everyone is finishing thier batteries and here i am doing this.
[2024-03-06T23:30:49] Happy Giraffe: Bruh be Happy you have beast of a printer to play with. You dont know how insane its to print things like that😂😅
[2024-03-06T23:31:08] Finn: Perfect for the new motor
[2024-03-06T23:31:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True
[2024-03-06T23:31:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Me far from mine😅 sadly
[2024-03-06T23:31:50] haku: eh. every printer is the same just need proper tuning i guess. mine is easy mode
[2024-03-06T23:33:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically you need less experience, while that is true what you say , the time you learn all shit is lot of waste material and energy
[2024-03-06T23:34:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also not all printers could race
[2024-03-06T23:35:59] haku: that is badass. what do you use to insulate after folding?
[2024-03-06T23:36:37] Happy Giraffe: Heated enclosure printer screams for CF-Nylon filaments

[2024-03-07T00:02:48] haku: dam i cracked my new bearings. i tried standing on it amd see how strong it is 😭
[2024-03-07T00:03:37] haku: for science
[2024-03-07T00:13:58] haku: what is fire resistant foam? sorry for noob questions
[2024-03-07T01:27:02] haku: <photos/photo_13506@07-03-2024_01-27-02.jpg>
[2024-03-07T01:29:35] haku: if i cant afford one. this would do
[2024-03-07T01:45:33] haku: aluminum haha
[2024-03-07T01:45:53] haku: wishful thinking here
[2024-03-07T01:46:35] haku: even a drill press this would be okay hopefully
[2024-03-07T01:49:10] haku: its pretty big 3kg of fillament.
[2024-03-07T01:58:12] haku: ill print it when my kingroon petg comes 😂
[2024-03-07T01:59:05] cihan: If I have no way to attach battery, BMS or controller to the deck with screws what would you recommend? I still didn't check inside the deck but I wonder what could be used to hold parts firmly and without rattling inside deck without screwing them.
[2024-03-07T02:04:41] cihan: You mean hot melt glue, right? Which is also called hot melt silicone.
[2024-03-07T02:28:09] haku: wow. that ali kingroon petg arrived already. less than 5 days
[2024-03-07T03:02:11] haku: goodluck fully stoping with e brake
[2024-03-07T03:04:47] haku: what group is this lol
[2024-03-07T03:05:20] haku: lol
[2024-03-07T03:07:01] haku: might be eskate or euc group those guys believe that
[2024-03-07T03:08:27] haku: thats true haha. high voltage low capacity
[2024-03-07T03:13:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: To mutch height
[2024-03-07T03:14:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ok
[2024-03-07T03:14:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ao it's just original firmware than
[2024-03-07T03:14:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: U fixed things to makerbase and Flipsky 75100 on original code?

[2024-03-07T04:26:44] Rose: Hey there L, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-07T06:18:15] Happy Giraffe: Why not just get something used instead?😅 Even the chinese 600$ mills are better when upgraded. Also you kinda want a cnc mill. Otherwise its not worth it at all.
[2024-03-07T06:21:17] haku: maybe give this a try and see if milling is for me lol
[2024-03-07T06:22:09] haku: its a free stl lol
[2024-03-07T06:24:00] Happy Giraffe: Tbh I would use CF-Nylon almost on par with alu😁
[2024-03-07T06:24:24] Happy Giraffe: But yeah both have their own strenghts
[2024-03-07T06:25:01] Happy Giraffe: Maybe can even mill steel with a veeeery slow feedrate
[2024-03-07T06:26:16] Happy Giraffe: Iex building some mounts or stuff on scooter and strenght wise
[2024-03-07T06:27:20] Happy Giraffe: I had 6 months petg printed bike foot stand mount. Bike weighs 37kg and was fine, imagine same again with CF petg😂
[2024-03-07T06:27:28] Happy Giraffe: Possibly
[2024-03-07T06:28:10] Happy Giraffe: You might wanna try it haha, its surely stronger than monorim alu adapter if designed right
[2024-03-07T06:30:17] Happy Giraffe: Get a hardened steel nozzle and try how insane those materials are😁
[2024-03-07T06:31:19] Happy Giraffe: Well if you modify their design and print from CF Nylon maybe not worse than mono lmao. Tho you need steel plates as torque arms
[2024-03-07T06:32:21] Happy Giraffe: But hardest thing is to calibrate those material printing profiles and print slower so layers adhere better
[2024-03-07T06:36:01] haku: ive seen videos of printed cnc mills working really well. its paid stls though
[2024-03-07T06:36:36] haku: if this works i will try one of those. metal parts and printed parts
[2024-03-07T06:40:17] haku: ima make this one with pride 😘 we using all the colors.
[2024-03-07T06:44:07] Happy Giraffe: Define "working well" maybe it mills soft wood but nothing else
[2024-03-07T06:44:52] Happy Giraffe: Even the alu framed ones usually too weak to mill metal let alone steel😁 Need cast iron to be solid and absorb vibrations etc
[2024-03-07T06:45:24] haku: this one was half chinese mill half printed parts. let me find the link
[2024-03-07T06:46:18] Happy Giraffe: 3D printed mill sounds like a monorim product to me
[2024-03-07T06:50:15] haku: your right even the china mills would be better than this. but this is $150 worth of parts maybe less haha
[2024-03-07T06:53:32] Happy Giraffe: 150$ paperweight
[2024-03-07T06:53:49] Happy Giraffe: Rather get hardened nozzle and CFNylon material for that money
[2024-03-07T06:54:52] haku: this will mill wood for sure though
[2024-03-07T07:00:24] Happy Giraffe: Yeah softest kind maybe
[2024-03-07T07:10:12] Yamal: https://youtu.be/iArKr5Ds1a4?si=mtRaKVtpds7rU0aX
[2024-03-07T07:10:17] haku: overture petg still better transparency compared to ali filament.
[2024-03-07T08:21:29] Mirono escooters: Try playing with temps
[2024-03-07T08:21:35] Mirono escooters: I got abs clear imma try ut
[2024-03-07T10:12:31] Oreo huzky: Bro has same safety standards as me 🥲
[2024-03-07T10:32:31] Happy Giraffe: You could do a temperature calibration part for the filament😁 easy to see how it behaves at wide temp range in relation to same print speed

[2024-03-07T20:27:53] puneDir: Sometimes hall short and die (i dont trust to zero halls) Also if motor cable gets cut or damaged it can give high voltage from hall cable

[2024-03-07T20:36:37] Gabe Enzo: LTspice?
[2024-03-07T20:37:34] haku: ant is passive from what i was told
[2024-03-07T20:38:04] puneDir: Btw i noticed something Jk uses 0603 resistors for protection on balance lines Also it provides 0.6 a balance That means 2.4w balance on 4v cell But 0603 resistor can only handle 1w So they pop (which mines did and fucked up the bms) Am i missing something or theres some big design flaw?

[2024-03-08T00:02:11] Gabe Enzo: the USA installs spyware on devices that aren't legally allowed to be detected with antiviruses.
[2024-03-08T00:02:22] Gabe Enzo: It really makes no difference who is "spying" on you

[2024-03-08T00:10:32] Tommy ª: i never can make work linux on my pc it just works on amd and intel

[2024-03-08T00:13:46] haku: i want to learn all this stuff someday.
[2024-03-08T00:16:52] FOCforever: Get a Pi...they are not expensive. A Pi4 can be had used very cheap and will be jsut a little bit slower and less capable of a pi5. AFter that, USB kb and mouse and any HDMI monitor and you are good to go! The SDcard is easy to laod from your mac or pc to get an OS on it for the pi. There is a TON of OS's for PI and ton of apps and other things too. I use a PI4 as a SAN, VPN and SFTP server.
[2024-03-08T01:12:22] haku: dumb question but can rasbery pi play minecraft?
[2024-03-08T01:34:09] sombre_enfant: Did u connect your Throttle to your adc adapter ?

[2024-03-08T09:38:08] Alin Ciobanu: Isn’t it better inverted?
[2024-03-08T09:45:57] Tommy ª: yup, i just putted in for the photo next time im going to make it right
[2024-03-08T10:22:53] Mr.Mou: Hi, after motor detection I've got Sensorless, even the hall is connected, can I check if the hall is working somehow? (75_100_V2)
[2024-03-08T10:37:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Under it bemf decupling?

[2024-03-08T10:43:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yep check wiring
[2024-03-08T10:43:39] Tommy ª: *ends with fried halls*
[2024-03-08T10:43:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On diamond it looks better
[2024-03-08T10:44:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But didn't made clear just black ,lazy to change filament for it😅 Also making some changes again
[2024-03-08T10:45:38] haku: black or any solid color with a transparent screen would be ideal
[2024-03-08T10:46:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have an idea again😁😁 but to long to explain And i am already tired thinking over what need to be done ,so skiping it till help or more Will arrives 😁
[2024-03-08T10:46:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Make one bro
[2024-03-08T10:48:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean for science, you can try out multiprocess off bambu
[2024-03-08T10:48:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And manual change
[2024-03-08T10:49:52] haku: i wish i knew how honestly. i dont have multicolor AMS.
[2024-03-08T10:50:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wonder if just the "dedicated area" would be possible 🤔🤔🤔
[2024-03-08T10:50:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In my slicer this called varriable wizard settings
[2024-03-08T10:51:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You basically cut drawing in parts ,what is sliced differently ,so infill or anything can be different
[2024-03-08T10:51:57] haku: with AMS its pretty easy. someday ill save up for it
[2024-03-08T10:52:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe its easy even without it
[2024-03-08T10:53:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://youtu.be/xxNzknUepws?si=FVqgOtPN9uiHkmS2
[2024-03-08T10:53:31] haku: ill see if i can manually do it. but i really doubt it
[2024-03-08T10:53:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Plenty vids on yt
[2024-03-08T10:54:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Possible probably
[2024-03-08T10:55:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It can end like that true but unsure what he did let's wait for answers maybe a pics And help him over
[2024-03-08T10:57:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe its not that hard and you dont waste a lot filament 🤷‍♂ i really dunno ,but ams does lot waste for sure ,but i guess that amount can be set or some already modified code to not push out a finger size something to check is it coming
[2024-03-08T10:58:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Near this Some sort of filament sensor would solve this also if it sens it coming stops wasting, or some ai cam 😁 Wants to much
[2024-03-08T11:03:42] haku: i saw the video. ill try it out later. thanks
[2024-03-08T11:20:04] puneDir: Finally its running

[2024-03-08T12:25:43] Mr.Mou: Ok, I'll check the wiring 😁

[2024-03-08T13:33:02] puneDir: Motor doesnt turns at its supposed to be Its more like click click

[2024-03-08T13:38:00] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-08T13:38:03] Alin Ciobanu: Have you tried reversing the vesc?
[2024-03-08T13:38:08] puneDir: Yes
[2024-03-08T13:38:18] Tommy ª: 75100?
[2024-03-08T13:38:21] puneDir: Yes
[2024-03-08T13:38:26] Tommy ª: from mks?
[2024-03-08T13:38:30] puneDir: Yes mks
[2024-03-08T13:38:36] puneDir: It was working before :(
[2024-03-08T13:38:46] puneDir: Removed from elshans scootee
[2024-03-08T13:39:02] puneDir: Is this firmware bug or something Please help me
[2024-03-08T13:39:23] Tommy ª: wait, you are using halls?
[2024-03-08T13:39:27] puneDir: No
[2024-03-08T13:39:30] puneDir: Im not
[2024-03-08T13:39:33] puneDir: Removed the halls
[2024-03-08T13:39:39] puneDir: Not even connected halls
[2024-03-08T13:40:08] Alin Ciobanu: Removed Hall sensors?
[2024-03-08T13:40:18] Tommy ª: rip, redo the detection manually also check if you dont have the stacked resistor model, famous from mks and its sh**t
[2024-03-08T13:40:58] puneDir: Stacked resistor? 3 resistors on top
[2024-03-08T13:41:02] puneDir: It has that
[2024-03-08T13:41:12] puneDir: How to do that
[2024-03-08T13:41:19] Tommy ª: yeah, that thing is never going to work well
[2024-03-08T13:41:30] puneDir: So i need to remove 2 resistors
[2024-03-08T13:41:35] puneDir: And only leave one
[2024-03-08T13:42:01] Alin Ciobanu: ?
[2024-03-08T13:42:42] Tommy ª: if you see this remove 2 in every phase, just leaving the one per phase and flash the 0005ohm firmware and you be fine
[2024-03-08T13:43:12] puneDir: Yeah mines has this
[2024-03-08T13:43:13] puneDir: Ok
[2024-03-08T13:43:39] puneDir: Isnt there a way to get it working now Without doing it
[2024-03-08T13:44:47] puneDir: My flipsky has them and it works
[2024-03-08T13:44:57] Tommy ª: just with ortega observer, redo the detection at 10amps (or until it spins) and dont use hss or vss, just sensorless
[2024-03-08T13:45:08] puneDir: Ok
[2024-03-08T13:46:03] puneDir: Better this time but same Should i set 1a?
[2024-03-08T13:47:25] Tommy ª: nah probably you need to do the mod with that controller, i cant find another way to make work the mks one, it works in some motors, another just locks or jerks and lot of noise
[2024-03-08T13:48:01] puneDir: That sucks So i guess my problem is normal right?
[2024-03-08T13:48:32] Tommy ª: i own 3 of these controllers and all of 3 with same issue, actually is a normal problem of the v2
[2024-03-08T13:48:43] puneDir: Weird that it was working before
[2024-03-08T13:48:55] Tommy ª: with same motor?
[2024-03-08T13:49:07] puneDir: Zero 10x motor but not same
[2024-03-08T13:50:13] Tommy ª: so no also you can try with the 75_300_r2 firmware at version 5.1, this one casually works on the "stock" controller (yea quite outdated)
[2024-03-08T13:56:53] puneDir: ok imma do
[2024-03-08T13:57:29] Tommy ª: (its the r2, srry)
[2024-03-08T14:00:38] puneDir: @Tommynwn just to clarify Im going to remove 2 of 3 resistors right?
[2024-03-08T14:01:05] Tommy ª: in each phase
[2024-03-08T14:01:14] Tommy ª: leave them like in the v1
[2024-03-08T14:01:40] Unknown: Cool
[2024-03-08T14:02:37] puneDir: Oki
[2024-03-08T14:02:47] puneDir: <photos/photo_13533@08-03-2024_14-02-47.jpg>
[2024-03-08T14:02:55] puneDir: Is this v1 or v2
[2024-03-08T14:03:06] Tommy ª: v2
[2024-03-08T14:03:14] puneDir: Hope this fixes the issue
[2024-03-08T14:04:18] Tommy ª: also luck with remove them, its quite hard to do it even with hot air + iron
[2024-03-08T14:08:12] puneDir: <photos/photo_13534@08-03-2024_14-08-12.jpg>
[2024-03-08T14:08:22] puneDir: What the fuck is this @Tommynwn
[2024-03-08T14:08:46] Tommy ª: another resistor but inverted 🤧
[2024-03-08T14:08:59] puneDir: You sure? Im not sure about the value thats why im asking
[2024-03-08T14:09:14] Tommy ª: they are all the same
[2024-03-08T14:09:17] puneDir: Oki
[2024-03-08T14:18:58] puneDir: <photos/photo_13535@08-03-2024_14-18-58.jpg>
[2024-03-08T14:32:49] puneDir: @Tommynwn less worse but same
[2024-03-08T14:32:59] puneDir: <photos/photo_13536@08-03-2024_14-32-59.jpg>
[2024-03-08T14:33:02] Tommy ª: what firmware?
[2024-03-08T14:33:04] puneDir: Heres the result
[2024-03-08T14:33:09] puneDir: V2 005
[2024-03-08T14:34:04] puneDir: Do you have any firmware that works
[2024-03-08T14:34:20] Tommy ª: the last beta works well tbh
[2024-03-08T14:34:27] puneDir: Do you have the file
[2024-03-08T14:34:34] puneDir: Also will it work with this shunts
[2024-03-08T14:34:39] Tommy ª: i can upload it here?
[2024-03-08T14:34:42] puneDir: Yes
[2024-03-08T14:34:50] puneDir: Can i use it with this shunts
[2024-03-08T14:35:01] Tommy ª: why not?
[2024-03-08T14:35:14] puneDir: Wrong amp reading?
[2024-03-08T14:35:33] Happy Giraffe: Motor flux difference way too big if using same motors
[2024-03-08T14:35:38] puneDir: Someone help me out pls :(
[2024-03-08T14:35:47] puneDir: Yes Vesc or firmware related issue
[2024-03-08T14:35:53] Tommy ª: that is what im going to say, i just noticed the flux thingy
[2024-03-08T14:36:36] puneDir: Motor is fine If i swap motors that one turns fine
[2024-03-08T14:37:10] Tommy ª: wait, if you put the vesc in the other motor it works normal?
[2024-03-08T14:37:16] puneDir: No
[2024-03-08T14:37:36] puneDir: Its connected to rear now If i connect to front Front does the same and rear turns
[2024-03-08T14:38:09] Tommy ª: <files/vesc_tool_test_windows.exe>
[2024-03-08T14:38:32] puneDir: Downloading
[2024-03-08T14:40:49] puneDir: Btw would the vesc work if i copy motor data from working one and paste to this
[2024-03-08T14:41:11] Tommy ª: it never worked with me
[2024-03-08T14:41:24] puneDir: How do you solved Im about to smash my head
[2024-03-08T14:41:57] Tommy ª: actually you tried shorting the phases? i have feeling of you having a lost phase
[2024-03-08T14:42:15] puneDir: What?
[2024-03-08T14:42:20] puneDir: I didnt understand
[2024-03-08T14:42:34] puneDir: Like bad soldering or smth?
[2024-03-08T14:42:40] Tommy ª: tl;dr: check the motor phases manually
[2024-03-08T14:42:54] puneDir: Oki
[2024-03-08T14:44:35] puneDir: No not the case
[2024-03-08T14:45:26] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-03-08T14:46:53] puneDir: Why theyre that different
[2024-03-08T14:47:45] Tommy ª: why they are that different? 😭
[2024-03-08T14:48:36] puneDir: Idk Can i dm you

[2024-03-08T17:08:20] puneDir: @Mltra
[2024-03-08T17:40:16] Yamal: Beyond the top speed, the fairing that they have given to the DT Thunder is curious, similar to the ESC e-scooter, it seems wonderful and original to me, a ride on that scooter must be great❤️‍🔥

[2024-03-08T18:37:24] haku: without spacer wow. where will the esc go?
[2024-03-08T18:38:08] NetworkDir: Layout similar to stock 14s7p
[2024-03-08T18:38:25] NetworkDir: Its @fungus93 art :)
[2024-03-08T18:59:35] haku: what frame is that?

[2024-03-08T19:40:08] Yamal: ☝️
[2024-03-08T19:43:33] haku: good thing about that style is you can have multiple rims for one motor or multiple motors on 1 rim
[2024-03-08T20:12:09] haku: no wonder we dont see magnesium frames anymore. that stuff is flamable
[2024-03-08T20:13:12] haku: i was thinking of next level frames and that would be a nono with lithium batteries
[2024-03-08T20:51:01] Mr.Mou: To be honest it doesn't feel as powerful as it should for 40+ Amps draw.. Any idea?
[2024-03-08T20:59:35] haku: someone explain how this works. crazy https://youtube.com/shorts/sNkkH_-wgqg?si=lPnQyV4GkaqD77NU
[2024-03-08T21:01:12] Gabe Enzo: Would bypassing the BMS for one singular charge, balance every cell to 4.2v?
[2024-03-08T21:01:19] Gabe Enzo: Just thinking.
[2024-03-08T21:07:10] NetworkDir: Stock FEB cells 40-50A discharge would i get And i add external battery pack on bag for reaching 100-120A totally
[2024-03-08T21:08:51] NetworkDir: I have 140 cells for external pack(aspilsan A28) 15A continuous discharge 25A pulse discharge
[2024-03-08T21:08:58] Mirono escooters: NO
[2024-03-08T21:09:11] Mirono escooters: In wich way would that balance them 😂😂😂😂
[2024-03-08T21:09:20] Mirono escooters: You'd overcharged some and have a big fire
[2024-03-08T21:10:53] Gabe Enzo: Overcharge?
[2024-03-08T21:10:58] Gabe Enzo: mathematically it makes sense
[2024-03-08T21:11:06] Gabe Enzo: 4.2v across each series
[2024-03-08T21:11:10] Mirono escooters: It doesn't
[2024-03-08T21:11:11] Mirono escooters: At all
[2024-03-08T21:11:23] Mirono escooters: 8.4 is 4.2+4.2 Also 4.1+4.3 Also 4+4.4
[2024-03-08T21:11:26] Mirono escooters: See where I'm going
[2024-03-08T21:11:49] Mirono escooters: Tis not a resistor. Then it would be If same value obv
[2024-03-08T21:11:50] Happy Giraffe: You have to setup motor/battery currents etc yourself depending on your setup
[2024-03-08T21:24:06] Mr.Mou: Where to start? The battery should be set correctly, it had BMS, max draw 100A. How to set up a motor then? I test it with a different controller and it does 35A with field weaving (15A). Can you please send me where I should set this in vesc?
[2024-03-08T21:24:26] NetworkDir: IR is 16
[2024-03-08T21:24:41] NetworkDir: Yeah 8.4kW looks very good

[2024-03-08T21:29:27] NetworkDir: Maximum on peak i use 20A from this cells
[2024-03-08T21:30:14] NetworkDir: I have a 7p with 15A i get 105A also 40A from internal battery pack 100A at all fine for me
[2024-03-08T21:36:22] Mr.Mou: I used field weaking at my previous controller (G30d), my setup: 13S7P 21700 with BMS (max draw 100A), MKS 75_100_V2 ALU, motor 48V 800W Mantis 10 single
[2024-03-08T21:37:57] FOCforever: Never really left...just life gets in the way and you have to go deal with that.
[2024-03-08T21:39:49] Mr.Mou: Eh
[2024-03-08T21:40:02] Mr.Mou: Basically in case of vesc yes
[2024-03-08T21:40:21] Mr.Mou: I still have g30 motor, controller dash for front
[2024-03-08T21:40:52] Mr.Mou: And back is vesc with mantis
[2024-03-08T21:48:33] Mr.Mou: Observer gain?

[2024-03-08T21:49:28] Happy Giraffe: Just change only the settings James told you about, dont mess with anything else on your own
[2024-03-08T21:49:54] Mr.Mou: I mean, what's observer and where to find it? I only find this above

[2024-03-08T21:55:51] Mr.Mou: To get some knowledge, is there some manual for vesc tool? 😄
[2024-03-08T22:28:33] haku: i have that same idea too haha. very cool
[2024-03-08T22:29:20] haku: you have a nice heatsink though. mine is not that beefy
[2024-03-08T22:30:38] Alex: I was wondered how can i hide the controller box, but after it i thinked about that a nice colored heat sink will be beautiful
[2024-03-08T23:07:17] Yamal: You will now show from the Vesc tool application what numbers that beast reaches
[2024-03-08T23:07:34] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: guys, finally I'm getting vesc for installing on customers ninebot max g30. Is there any basic manual how to setup it? My experience only is xiaodash and scooterhacking for Xiaomi/ninebot stock controllers
[2024-03-08T23:08:01] Alex: Its not 100% ready
[2024-03-08T23:08:27] Alex: I need a month to complete it
[2024-03-08T23:11:02] Alex: Its still in parts and some of the paintjob is not ready jet but in the old setup it does 16kW per motors on 135A
[2024-03-08T23:12:07] Alex: But now it got new upgraded motors the new 250A vesc s and new controller box and heatsink new design new suspension
[2024-03-08T23:12:07] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Alex has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-03-08T23:15:04] Yamal: Before you get 32kW total peak?
[2024-03-08T23:19:30] Yamal: Nice frame
[2024-03-08T23:27:32] Alex: Yes thanks it was a techlife x9 aka zero 11x
[2024-03-08T23:52:05] Happy Giraffe: Do you want to use ninebot dash or phone as display?🤔
[2024-03-08T23:59:29] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I know how to connect BLE 🌚 I mean, how to set speeds, current, or it's really very simple?
[2024-03-09T00:05:34] Happy Giraffe: I was asking if you wanna run the script to use ninebot screen or not. Not about ble, thats just plug and play😁
[2024-03-09T00:07:59] Tommy ª: You just can put the values in the script, is really easy tbh
[2024-03-09T00:16:25] Tommy ª: is too hard?
[2024-03-09T00:19:21] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Oh I didn't know about that
[2024-03-09T00:21:17] Tommy ª: you can edit the modes in real time on the script in the lisp editor on vesc also there i maded my fork for fix the secret mode + rear light + what to show in the screen actually the script have power with the display, even on my 4dot screen works
[2024-03-09T00:27:35] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): does someone know where i can source this connector? (case/panel mountable) https://www.ac-solutions.be/de/produkte/l1019dmr03by0300/KJ09K
[2024-03-09T00:31:14] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: This is speed mode or I can set DPC?
[2024-03-09T00:45:22] Tommy ª: actually in vesc everything is current based (there is rpm one but its not situable for something like a scooter) you need to set that in vesc tool like you want
[2024-03-09T01:33:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Anybody alive who knows where is Cruise contoll enable setting?

[2024-03-09T12:55:07] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: What about braking on 20s? I will install vesc on g30 for stable ~40kph, we need good brake power
[2024-03-09T13:00:16] Tommy ª: Bruh I got 47kmh on 10s Also the brakes in low speed (like 4kmh) are not big deal but works perfect at +8kmh
[2024-03-09T13:25:32] Jonas: Im on 20s awd and the disc is just optic 😅
[2024-03-09T13:26:00] Jonas: So ur fine

[2024-03-09T13:32:02] Mr.Mou: It really helped, thanks again 🤩 what does this current of motor means? It's somehow deviated to each phase?
[2024-03-09T13:56:03] Happy Giraffe: Haven't measured but that you can test with multimeter
[2024-03-09T14:08:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: It was nice if has same function has xiaomi an others have from stock and don't need other buttons
[2024-03-09T18:04:49] Rose: Hey there Shlomoda23, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-03-09T18:11:28] Alin Ciobanu: WTF🙃
[2024-03-09T18:15:39] puneDir: Isnt it possible to make it normal
[2024-03-09T18:15:45] puneDir: Bad design choice
[2024-03-09T18:20:53] Jonas: A vesc?
[2024-03-09T18:23:21] Jonas: Custom one?
[2024-03-09T18:34:49] puneDir: I already ordered it

[2024-03-09T20:32:48] haku: @PaoloWu how long ago did the 811 glitters came out? i feel like we are beta testers for this welder. 😭
[2024-03-09T20:41:00] Awyba: I'm currently planning what I will do when I get a Sur-Ron/Talaria after finishing my driver's license, but I'm not quite sure about the controller. My first thought naturally leans towards a Vesc from Trampa, 3shul, or the EBMX X9000. Unfortunately, there is no script for the stock speedometer, except for Torp controllers, which seem to support it. However, these are likely Vesc-based but have completely locked access, so you can only use the official app with its restrictions. Does anyone have suggestions on the best choice here? I'm trying to achieve a legal/stock-looking bike in terms of the controller and speedometer.
[2024-03-09T20:52:44] Awyba: You released their source code?
[2024-03-09T20:54:33] haku: thats awsome haha
[2024-03-09T20:55:09] haku: torp is pretty good ive heard
[2024-03-09T20:56:07] haku: yep. surron boys love this brand. they dont even know its vesc lol
[2024-03-09T20:57:55] haku: can you mess around with torp parameters in vesc tool?
[2024-03-09T20:58:49] haku: oh gotcha. thats lame of them
[2024-03-09T21:01:25] haku: exhibit a
[2024-03-09T21:06:03] puneDir: I need key to not get it stolen
[2024-03-09T21:07:37] Awyba: I mean that they support the stock functionalities is nice but that they hide the fact that they use vesc is just lame also pricing is another thing
[2024-03-09T21:07:56] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): Higo L1019 Panel Mount connector
[2024-03-09T21:47:40] Happy Giraffe: Then a lock where key can be taken out in any position, plenty of those around
[2024-03-09T21:48:07] puneDir: You got link
[2024-03-09T22:21:47] haku: this is the kind of squirting drill every man needs. https://youtube.com/shorts/P7mYq0BpJKM?si=mOufl3joQo3h5sPG

[2024-03-10T00:30:35] Happy Giraffe: Took 2 seconds to find a quality one😂
[2024-03-10T00:30:56] Happy Giraffe: I would avoid the alie shitty ones as they have stopped working on me, damn I should get this one the next bike...and find it inside EU😁
[2024-03-10T00:42:02] haku: <photos/photo_13571@10-03-2024_00-42-02.jpg>
[2024-03-10T00:42:19] haku: anyone here have this particular size of tire?
[2024-03-10T00:43:24] haku: do you guys know if it would fit a 100mm wide rim?
[2024-03-10T01:16:35] haku: i have a 100mm rim. whats the best 11" tire for that?
[2024-03-10T01:17:19] Happy Giraffe: 80€ for scooter tire😂 Lmao same price as a good enduro tire for moto
[2024-03-10T01:17:38] haku: gotcha. it gets really hot like 48c in the summer here. those might bald fast
[2024-03-10T01:18:19] haku: you can almost cook on the concrete
[2024-03-10T01:21:52] haku: lol. true. touvt isnt too bad is it? im sure it will stick in hot concrete
[2024-03-10T01:23:10] Tommy ª: Popular brand: *exists* Everyone: is a sh*t
[2024-03-10T01:23:16] haku: i see. i have 12" touvt right now. and while waiting for my welders parts i want to work on the scooter wheels
[2024-03-10T01:24:19] haku: thats why i was asking for a wider tire because i got the 12"rim
[2024-03-10T02:38:59] haku: i salvaged this bike and i want to turn it into a slow ebike for my son. what motor do you guys recomend? i will use a cheap hub motor if possible.
[2024-03-10T02:58:08] haku: ill be ebikeguy 2.0
[2024-03-10T06:37:24] haku: i think im just gonna do this to his bike right now. saves me money not buying a motor.

[2024-03-10T10:18:14] NetworkDir: Why 24V make 48V :D
[2024-03-10T10:18:46] Gabe Enzo: For a kid xd
[2024-03-10T10:19:17] Gabe Enzo: 7s is fine

[2024-03-10T11:07:17] Finn: If so put in p42 4p and push 70A😂
[2024-03-10T11:07:46] Gabe Enzo: 1p moli would suffice lul
[2024-03-10T12:27:47] haku: yep my boy is turning 5. i want him to have somekind of pev but theres nothing out there for that age aside from those powerwheels.
[2024-03-10T12:29:11] haku: going to get him a full face mtb helmet. i think 24-36v should be enough. i can always tune it down some in vesctool.
[2024-03-10T13:25:56] Happy Giraffe: Can he ride a normal bike?😁
[2024-03-10T14:23:41] haku: yes. i took training wheels off. he can balance but cant go fast enough to truly do it

[2024-03-10T17:03:45] Gabe Enzo: Not possible to fit 12 inch tires on a 11 inch 60h no?
[2024-03-10T17:04:33] Gabe Enzo: not something I should be using with 26kw no?
[2024-03-10T17:06:54] Christophe C.: Inception.... 😂
[2024-03-10T18:00:32] haku: where you in that tampa group ride?
[2024-03-10T18:02:50] haku: surron boys be wildin
[2024-03-10T18:31:31] Unknown: No I didn’t make it to Tampa
[2024-03-10T19:02:26] Gabe Enzo: Just got news that my dad's friend is in the ER in critical condition cause some asshole crashed into his Ebike.
[2024-03-10T19:11:34] haku: prayers to your dads friend. hope hes okay.
[2024-03-10T19:33:08] Happy Giraffe: All best wishes to him, let's hope he fully recovers
[2024-03-10T19:38:51] haku: this sad but funny. if there is someone agressive i will not remove my helmet. thats a sure way to get knocked out. but thats my opinion.
[2024-03-10T20:03:53] Unknown: You’re perfectly right. They were arguing about money owed for a battery. The dude that got ran over got a battery on credit, couldn’t pay because he said he had to buy Christmas presents for his daughter. He was told to return it,which he did but the other dude (Mike Watts)owner of Watts Wheels, wanted $400 for restocking fees. So that’s basically the story. It’s funny though because they’re both from New Jersey. They are buddies.. Supposedly .
[2024-03-10T20:04:56] haku: this is larry and mike yea? this video went viral lol
[2024-03-10T20:05:35] haku: so they just shook hands after or will this thing get settled somewhere?
[2024-03-10T20:16:46] Unknown: No shaking of hands.. Definitely not settled. I mean would you shake hands after a situation like this? I definitely wouldn’t.. I tried to buy a fardriver from Mike n he wanted more than what it cost plus $150 for helping me set it up . I told him I could get it for $300 shipped to my door plus I have a legitimate business and I don’t need his help hooking up & tuning it. I asked him why would I pay him that price when I can purchase on Ali. Dude went off on me telling me I’m disrespectful comparing him with Alibaba & AliExpress.. I know that he has a bad attitude & doesn’t know how to talk to people.. I wish someone would launch a bike in my chest.. I have a philosophy that I live by in the bike world.. Two wheels,One love ❤️. I see people whom I ride with as family & nothing less
[2024-03-10T20:18:01] Happy Giraffe: Damn drama😂
[2024-03-10T20:18:28] Unknown: Too much drama 😂
[2024-03-10T20:21:16] haku: east coast has a huge bike community. its amazing
[2024-03-10T20:21:49] haku: states and cities are so close together folks do super group rides
[2024-03-10T20:23:01] haku: here in nevada only riders are on harleys. we dont get that community here
[2024-03-10T20:41:46] Unknown: Yea the bike life is crazy here. I love it.. I’ve been riding PEVS since 2018. So I’ve literally grown with the community. You need to start a group. Telegram or Facebook & invite riders you know or meet.. Officially we only had 2 groups ECS (East Coast Scooters) & NYC PEV.. which was started by minimotors retailers. I started out working @ NYC PEV. Then went to establish Minimotors of Brooklyn . I’m literally one of the OGs .
[2024-03-10T20:43:00] haku: i was trying to look for east coast scooters but i cant find it in telegram.
[2024-03-10T20:43:27] haku: i was also recomended that group.

[2024-03-10T21:09:16] sombre_enfant: Maybe even a toddler
[2024-03-10T21:09:16] haku: when stuff goes down this is the only way to protect yourself from riots. this guy is prepared for the elections

[2024-03-10T21:09:55] Mirono escooters: Nothing is as permanent as a temporary solution that keeps working
[2024-03-10T21:27:30] Unknown: I’ll see if I have a link for the telegram. They had blocked me over scooter politics. I’m still in the Facebook group
[2024-03-10T23:12:32] haku: @Mirono_escooters did you design these crocs? https://youtube.com/shorts/BdpVqBtMdjs?si=4tZBykM0-NYi71pc

[2024-03-11T00:00:28] haku: i shouldve made mine like that instead of zigzags.
[2024-03-11T00:00:37] haku: pain in the butt to cut .2

[2024-03-11T00:10:46] haku: agreed. very scary stuff
[2024-03-11T00:11:20] haku: you have to make a small prayer to the battery lords on every weld
[2024-03-11T00:12:20] haku: that looks beefy.
[2024-03-11T00:31:42] haku: honestly ive never seen someone cut zigzag copper here. i hope im not making a mistake doing that
[2024-03-11T03:42:14] Jonas: Anybody tried installing such a fattie, on a g 30. I mean it should work jf i build some customized parts. And how trashy is the motor? Its 13kg so maybe I'm lucky. Wirhtis 3 Montt ali shipped nortor since i broke my shoulder i cant lift the scooter. so wouldn't nt it be smart to install an AWD for chilled driving abs and brake disk since i guess i won't find an anslof brake for that rhing. Rip pegasus bike now im back on my 23year old Paddy. Which goes 50. But sounds likr a 2 stroke st least the gas pedal is legal.. Some ideas on g30 project would. Be awesome
[2024-03-11T03:59:38] haku: i want to do that too. 11" on a g30 would be great. need alot of famcy fabrication to make it happen.
[2024-03-11T09:03:42] Jan: Why 11inch?
[2024-03-11T09:13:23] haku: recycle old motor.
[2024-03-11T09:14:32] haku: and you cam get more motor options and magnet size with 11 yea?
[2024-03-11T09:23:21] haku: wait it just clicked on me what sombre said. is that your bomber?
[2024-03-11T10:01:26] Mirono escooters: Was

[2024-03-11T11:52:17] Gabe Enzo: Just went 15km to school. cell only dropped 30%.
[2024-03-11T11:52:22] Gabe Enzo: resistance issue was the cause back then.
[2024-03-11T12:19:26] Gabe Enzo: Pfp is fitting.
[2024-03-11T12:33:12] Gabe Enzo: Not really.
[2024-03-11T12:39:47] haku: nice you a pcb repairman. did you change the mosfet?
[2024-03-11T12:44:57] Mirono escooters: What's wrong
[2024-03-11T12:58:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure why the the question is, but guessing 5 or less
[2024-03-11T13:01:33] haku: printed this modern chainmail. this made with harder materials would be good armor for racing gear.
[2024-03-11T13:01:41] haku: someone patent that.
[2024-03-11T13:02:22] haku: good for elboe and knee pads
[2024-03-11T13:02:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need to define question better, so we know what you mean. In Motor current you set phase amps, There is a number what you define and an absolute max number
[2024-03-11T13:06:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think not possible , highest firmware possible 5.1 for it Atleast this what i read for it now
[2024-03-11T13:11:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably not or with issues, Question is Rim would let bigger sit? (You saw 50h in big rim 11" teverun blade gt 2 motor) Also if it would let you ,not sure body would or suspension arm Tire would touch
[2024-03-11T13:11:43] puneDir: I replaced b opamp B fet driver And all fets with 214a ones
[2024-03-11T13:15:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh he bought it?
[2024-03-11T13:16:15] puneDir: @Tommynwn it works
[2024-03-11T13:16:20] puneDir: HahahahahHahahahahHAHAHAHAHHAHSHSHSH
[2024-03-11T13:16:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @roscheeee Pls send your small bike video with the g30 motor 😁
[2024-03-11T13:17:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Less good controller is enough
[2024-03-11T13:18:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is some 24-36v cheapo ones With low amps and remote option also
[2024-03-11T13:19:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically I support the idea I was a wild kid also I drove over a glass door when 2,5 yo with my pedal power trike and INSANE stunt bonus is I made zero injury

[2024-03-11T13:28:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically wrong You hit with the helmet😁
[2024-03-11T13:29:35] Mirono escooters: Can't patent that
[2024-03-11T13:29:42] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-03-11T13:30:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah but half population lives on 1/3 of size in your country and thats east coast

[2024-03-11T16:18:15] puneDir: Disclaimer Dont use mks 75100 and flipsky 75100 in same can
[2024-03-11T16:18:29] puneDir: Because of different can resistors canbus chip dies
[2024-03-11T16:35:47] puneDir: @Her0DasH does 75100 supports connecting another can chip to some tx rx?

[2024-03-11T16:38:36] Mirono escooters: Pure kapton???

[2024-03-11T17:14:33] Mirono escooters: From Facebook I want to share my experience with 3shulmotor controller. I met Hackey years ago before he even sold a single unit. Truly thought the world of him. Now 2 years later I regret ever buying another from him. At the time I bought a cl1000 for a build. It was for a custom motor. It burned up. And at the that time a few other customers controller were catching fire. Hackey said he had gotten bad mosfets! So he sent one more. It burned up. It was at this time I bought a cl700 and a cl350. I was told he had fix the problem. I never got the cl1000 to work. I don’t blame him for everything then. The motor was to blame I think. But it was at this point he stop communicating with me. Text after text went unanswered. When I finally got the 2 controller. The cl350 was missing its harness and Bluetooth. Took months to get the hardness. Was promised the Bluetooth would be shipped out. Months go by. I ask so many times about it. No answer. I finally reached out to his distributor in America. Cost me $75. Hackey offered to refund me $30. Which I never received. After I installed the cl700. I needed his help to set it up. After a few different attempts I got him to help. But after only 30 minutes riding it it stopped working. I was so unhappy with 3shul. I decided to remove it and replace it with a FarDriver. Now let talk about the cl350. I wanted to replace it to. But the controller support was way to small to hold a FarDriver. But once it was in stalled I found a great guy to help set it up. Was so nice have help. I paid him for his support. The cl350 was running fine up to the time mosfets burned up. I have a video of it burning up. I reached out to Hackey. Sent him pictures. He said he would send me a replacement. I refused his offer. I am finished with anything more with ( YOU). I was told he sent a refund on PayPal. After weeks and weeks of waiting for it to clear I refunded his money. I was so mad how I was being treated again. I want people to know before they put out there hard earned money what to look forward to. I have a friend that was working with Hackey to build a few custom controllers useing some special mosfets from USA. He said he wanted to sell it. And he said he was having the same problems with Hackey. He offered me a good price. But I wasn’t going to buy any more controller of his. But a short time later my friend showed me a few texts from Hackey. He said he wanted it back. But didn’t want to pay him in advance. He didn’t want to do that. It was at that point I bought it. Not because I needed it. But so Hackey could not have it. I’m out $300 on cl350. $700 on cl700. $1000 on cl1000. The cl1400 ! Will have to wait to see. I will share a few pictures of my burned up controller and one other’s customers. His controller did a lot of damage to his bike. My bms was damaged. If you had any bad experiences with 3shulmotors. Share them. Sent from my iPhone

[2024-03-11T17:19:19] Кирилл: If he set it up with auto-detection and that’s it, then it’s not surprising
[2024-03-11T17:19:29] Mirono escooters: I'm merely reporting
[2024-03-11T17:19:41] Mirono escooters: Incredible failure
[2024-03-11T17:20:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Explain more bro
[2024-03-11T17:20:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No idea,but i dont think so
[2024-03-11T17:21:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hmmmm interesting
[2024-03-11T17:22:04] Кирилл: I have already driven CL350 v2 and v4, no problems. You need to know what you are doing and setting up. There is too little information in detail about the settings and what the person did, how he connected, etc.
[2024-03-11T17:22:51] Happy Giraffe: A story about burned esc useless if we dont even know roughly the settings or the guy using it. If hes an idiot ofc he will make it burn with xiaomi motor😂
[2024-03-11T17:23:12] Кирилл: Auto detection and bad motor parameters can easily do amp spikes and oscillation
[2024-03-11T17:23:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes ,i get u now
[2024-03-11T17:23:56] Кирилл: Also the negative amps on braking auto detection sets same as positive values
[2024-03-11T17:24:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lot flipsky stories are similar
[2024-03-11T17:24:12] Кирилл: Users rarely sets the right battery amps etc
[2024-03-11T17:24:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And doesnt set cut at all
[2024-03-11T17:24:54] Mirono escooters: Vesc is too advanced for far driver users
[2024-03-11T17:25:15] Кирилл: Rage mechanics uses it, they know what they doing - it works
[2024-03-11T17:25:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also sets max amps possible before motor has ever turned one ,with hacked firmware
[2024-03-11T17:25:47] Кирилл: Ye
[2024-03-11T17:26:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Because of La Rage 😁
[2024-03-11T17:26:43] Кирилл: Le smart baguettes
[2024-03-11T17:27:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yep
[2024-03-11T17:29:45] Кирилл: I can definitely say that working with vesc open source and something powerful platform like 3shul is not plug and play. It requires an exact understanding of each step and what you are doing. There is no magic button to have a great ride right away
[2024-03-11T17:30:25] Кирилл: If you need plug and play - go nucular
[2024-03-11T17:30:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The more power you want the more you should know what are you doing
[2024-03-11T17:35:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I like to do stuff super secure , i do lot stuff for customers, i dont want them coming back for something nonsense, so i even dedicate things and if you are not ok with it ,you can just go. Like a far example,no we dont build you something what goes with 100 when you dont have brake's for it
[2024-03-11T17:36:01] Happy Giraffe: Its same as ASI BAC owners being stupid and end result was ASI locked the motor tune feature to trusted shops lol
[2024-03-11T17:36:11] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-03-11T17:37:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Will see where this gets ,but till some takes a look who has knowledge, we dont know why while we ha wall of text😁
[2024-03-11T17:37:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe
[2024-03-11T17:37:53] haku: moral of the story is buy a fardriver instead?
[2024-03-11T17:41:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe we hear some words of the Rage guys also on this story🤷‍♂
[2024-03-11T17:42:37] Happy Giraffe: Moral of story don't be a noob😂 (or overestimate your skills)
[2024-03-11T17:43:47] Happy Giraffe: Todays people got so weird thinking about their abilities sometimes
[2024-03-11T17:44:15] Happy Giraffe: Not knowing the guy as he didn't tell any of his settings seems suspicious, one side of the coin his story
[2024-03-11T17:46:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah i agree
[2024-03-11T17:47:37] haku: it is true though that it takes a genius to figure out vesc properly. fardriver is mostly plug and play like sabvoton
[2024-03-11T17:48:29] Happy Giraffe: Yup, but basic setup very simple. Tuning observers etc behaviour is the drugs and the money tho
[2024-03-11T17:49:28] Gabe Enzo: nothing else to insulate
[2024-03-11T17:52:36] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2024-03-11T17:52:49] Mirono escooters: I have kapton only in g30.. Resin plate underneath tho, so it doesn't short
[2024-03-11T17:53:18] Mirono escooters: That's.. special
[2024-03-11T17:57:06] puneDir: Experience :(
[2024-03-11T17:57:15] puneDir: Flipsky has 220 Mks has 100
[2024-03-11T18:01:19] Mirono escooters: Sure it's that?
[2024-03-11T18:01:19] Mirono escooters: Well, must be
[2024-03-11T18:16:26] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-03-11T18:17:43] Gabe Enzo: check pms
[2024-03-11T18:21:52] Finn: So they run at different high low voltages?
[2024-03-11T18:22:11] Finn: Just swap the resistor then issue solved
[2024-03-11T18:22:17] Gabe Enzo: I'm gonna disassemble this pack and make a 5s for my E-Bike.
[2024-03-11T18:22:29] Gabe Enzo: Getting new cells for my scooter anyway
[2024-03-11T18:22:33] puneDir: No but its more complicated

[2024-03-11T18:40:15] Gabe Enzo: they all are.
[2024-03-11T18:40:20] Gabe Enzo: basically just Amazon.
[2024-03-11T18:42:09] haku: i stopped buying from amazon unless it specifically says made in USA. and i doubt quality would be better
[2024-03-11T18:51:54] Finn: Ah normal can chip
[2024-03-11T18:52:54] haku: dam for this pricepoint this is pretty good. too bad company is predatory.
[2024-03-11T18:54:05] Finn: Front fork looks weak af
[2024-03-11T18:57:21] haku: they are for the "urban warriors" sounds racist to me
[2024-03-11T19:05:30] Tommy ª: bldc waves are quite different from pmsm 🤧
[2024-03-11T20:24:57] Jan: insulate against what?
[2024-03-11T20:25:14] Jan: Thats like one of the best electrical insulator and really really good thermal one as well
[2024-03-11T20:41:11] puneDir: Terrifying
[2024-03-11T20:41:37] Mirono escooters: Yeah, just easily tears
[2024-03-11T20:41:45] Mirono escooters: Combine with fishpaper or if screwed batt then ok

[2024-03-11T22:30:38] Happy Giraffe: I think PEVs can't be made to pay enough tax and be easily enough controlled by govmt so they just decide to make it impossible to ride them
[2024-03-11T22:31:43] Happy Giraffe: Luckily I can pay 100€/year insurance to have throttle ebike. So even if I go above 25 and crash to someone I don't have to pay their medical bills😅
[2024-03-11T22:32:45] Happy Giraffe: Insured but no plate😁
[2024-03-11T22:46:09] haku: move over here boys. lots of freedom left to give
[2024-03-11T22:51:09] haku: while waiting for my welder. i will try to make full chainmail armor with these.
[2024-03-11T23:00:46] haku: i did all the bars and flatened the edges. nothing else to do lol
[2024-03-11T23:02:06] haku: 10-15 days they say but its usually faster than that
[2024-03-11T23:08:29] Awyba: Why is it bubble wrapped?
[2024-03-11T23:15:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For what?
[2024-03-11T23:16:11] haku: i want to wear it while scooting on the hood
[2024-03-11T23:16:26] haku: full 3d printed chainmail armor
[2024-03-11T23:16:47] haku: never know who gonna stab me. need armor
[2024-03-12T02:12:55] Rose: Hey there fuck, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-03-12T10:10:12] Happy Giraffe: Wood box?
[2024-03-12T10:57:04] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13605@12-03-2024_10-57-04.jpg>

[2024-03-12T10:58:05] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-12T11:03:13] Mirono escooters: Compact your messages 😭
[2024-03-12T11:04:37] Gabe Enzo: I ain't making it to school on this

[2024-03-12T11:08:52] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2024-03-12T11:09:04] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2024-03-12T11:09:11] NetworkDir: Try with 6.05
[2024-03-12T11:09:30] Gabe Enzo: there's no rational explanation why I'm draining so many watts while going so slow
[2024-03-12T11:09:39] Gabe Enzo: can't update outsiders
[2024-03-12T11:09:46] NetworkDir: Yes something wrong
[2024-03-12T11:10:02] NetworkDir: 82C Very high temperature
[2024-03-12T11:22:27] Gabe Enzo: cops just turned around on me
[2024-03-12T11:22:41] Gabe Enzo: I jetted out of there, luckily changed my settings on the red lights
[2024-03-12T11:23:11] Gabe Enzo: There's news in Ireland the cops now have direct orders to test evs for speed
[2024-03-12T11:28:10] haku: thank you for your concern sombre. doing what i do is a side effect of too much freedom.
[2024-03-12T11:30:33] Happy Giraffe: 🦅
[2024-03-12T11:34:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In the usa nowdays everything sounds like that
[2024-03-12T11:35:40] haku: the chinese are the real racists. just saying
[2024-03-12T11:37:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We have insurance options like two years for now Types you can get If stolen (just if new) Life insurance for you And the common one for traffic accident, so if you scratch a car you have insurance .... All is mostly based on driver , so yiu can drive a scooter or ride a bike
[2024-03-12T11:40:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Here is similar also ,but if you ebike what is not pedal sensor or faster than 25 kmh Than you are moped ,so all rules what that has apply
[2024-03-12T11:41:06] Rose: Hey there Arne, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-12T11:46:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some maybe , i ment nowdays Us coz of the lot butthurt what happens nowdays. Everybody get offended from all , if you white male You born racist😅 white privilige and other shit
[2024-03-12T11:47:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I really wonder how a south park episode looks like
[2024-03-12T11:48:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean it was hard holded "mirror" before Now maybe its like my little pony to avoid mass sueing 🤣
[2024-03-12T11:50:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe this changes also when Trump wins again
[2024-03-12T11:56:09] haku: printed this spikey chainmail. it so punk baby.
[2024-03-12T11:56:29] haku: i think ill make my armor out of this
[2024-03-12T11:56:47] sombre_enfant: That one unemployed friend at 8am:
[2024-03-12T11:57:13] haku: lol. thats actually funny.
[2024-03-12T11:57:28] haku: its 3am here
[2024-03-12T11:58:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why is esc so hot ? Thats probably main problem
[2024-03-12T12:00:23] Happy Giraffe: This about right tho, just vesc needs a plate to cool it down
[2024-03-12T12:01:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure how good armor that would be ,but i have an idea ,if you can join them, atleast to be like a bracelet You can print from silk rainbow pla and sell to alphabet ppl events 😏
[2024-03-12T12:06:34] haku: good idea haha
[2024-03-12T12:08:55] haku: did you bolt it down?
[2024-03-12T12:10:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would guess no
[2024-03-12T12:13:27] Gabe Enzo: No lol, but it didnt have these issues before and it was only smeared down
[2024-03-12T12:13:44] Gabe Enzo: It's vacuumed. it's impossible to take it off unless you pry it.
[2024-03-12T12:14:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,since it's a thing there now , you may want to make money out of them, Stuff looks fancy ,with that color even more for them ,so why not 🤔🤔 Should make some and donate to some event dancers what ppl can see ,than makes some tik tok or shorts to advertise ,and since Usa Maybe better to get licence for mass use of the drawing 😁
[2024-03-12T12:14:42] haku: you use thermal paste yea?
[2024-03-12T12:14:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I even had a name in mind ,what is fun ,but wont help to sell since its from the other way around
[2024-03-12T12:15:51] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2024-03-12T12:16:07] Gabe Enzo: I'm still using so many watts to go to uni
[2024-03-12T12:16:10] Gabe Enzo: makes no sense at all
[2024-03-12T12:16:36] Gabe Enzo: I'm gonna have to charge it, which is annoying. it'll take an hour 20 min of standing beside it.
[2024-03-12T12:16:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The alphabet bracelet (From dave chappelle)
[2024-03-12T12:17:28] haku: yea. watch it carefully thats hot. something needs asjusting
[2024-03-12T12:20:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,i would say check , heat should not be like this, i am kinda sure it's in the air
[2024-03-12T12:21:25] haku: i think ill make a spikey chainmail shorts. to help me with abstinence. i notice i hit my PRs when i dont jack off
[2024-03-12T12:22:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤣😅
[2024-03-12T12:24:39] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13608@12-03-2024_12-24-39.jpg>
[2024-03-12T12:25:32] Gabe Enzo: It's so fast when it's at 100%
[2024-03-12T12:25:41] Gabe Enzo: 70kmh.
[2024-03-12T12:25:53] Gabe Enzo: 25a fwk and 25a batt I'm sure they 25a fwk isn't used fully The double suspension is so good cause the city roads are horse shit.
[2024-03-12T12:29:11] Gabe Enzo: scientifically true.
[2024-03-12T12:29:11] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-12T12:37:16] Finn: Paint does the job.
[2024-03-12T12:38:11] Gabe Enzo: what's that
[2024-03-12T12:38:20] Gabe Enzo: Circuit
[2024-03-12T12:39:01] Finn: Controlling mosfet with fixed voltage
[2024-03-12T12:42:38] Finn: Im in School rn and next week i write an exam about FET´s
[2024-03-12T12:42:46] Gabe Enzo: You in uni

[2024-03-12T12:43:09] Finn: Vocational school
[2024-03-12T12:53:49] Gabe Enzo: The monorim shocks are 150mm
[2024-03-12T12:54:07] Gabe Enzo: should I get 185 or 190mm? I wanna use 11" tyres.
[2024-03-12T13:01:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure why you put this near eachother, basically shock makes no difference in this question
[2024-03-12T13:01:45] Gabe Enzo: Will it work tho.
[2024-03-12T13:01:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hmmmm
[2024-03-12T13:01:52] Gabe Enzo: No, it should raise the scooter
[2024-03-12T13:01:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why is that wrapped like that?
[2024-03-12T13:02:46] Gabe Enzo: Because I couldn't drill the holes yet.
[2024-03-12T13:03:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What holes?
[2024-03-12T13:03:16] Gabe Enzo: For M4.
[2024-03-12T13:03:34] Gabe Enzo: Waiting on 3.2mm drill bits.
[2024-03-12T13:03:37] Gabe Enzo: Then I'll tap.
[2024-03-12T13:03:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So wrap holds you bottom plate?
[2024-03-12T13:03:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ⛓️📬
[2024-03-12T13:03:41] Gabe Enzo: Yea
[2024-03-12T13:03:45] Gabe Enzo: Metric ton of tape.
[2024-03-12T13:04:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And non m3 holes work now?
[2024-03-12T13:04:04] Gabe Enzo: No.
[2024-03-12T13:04:07] Gabe Enzo: They're all dead.
[2024-03-12T13:04:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz i wrap
[2024-03-12T13:04:28] Gabe Enzo: ?
[2024-03-12T13:04:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 👆
[2024-03-12T13:04:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Keeps fucking heat
[2024-03-12T13:04:44] Gabe Enzo: oH lul
[2024-03-12T13:04:46] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-03-12T13:04:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Body gets no airflow
[2024-03-12T13:04:51] Gabe Enzo: Lmfaooooo
[2024-03-12T13:04:58] Gabe Enzo: Youre right
[2024-03-12T13:04:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats why esc temp so high
[2024-03-12T13:05:01] Gabe Enzo: 💀
[2024-03-12T13:05:22] Gabe Enzo: Thanks for spotting that out
[2024-03-12T13:05:29] Gabe Enzo: my idiocy is comedic
[2024-03-12T13:05:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔
[2024-03-12T13:07:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe ,but just maybe You could do duckbtape around the deck ,to keep "water out" And than tape to body on few points not all ,like how the wrap is made now
[2024-03-12T13:08:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But making the new holes will help for sure
[2024-03-12T13:11:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Axle in the sus dont change position from that,just height grows
[2024-03-12T13:13:56] Gabe Enzo: Hmm?
[2024-03-12T13:14:11] Gabe Enzo: wym
[2024-03-12T13:14:23] Gabe Enzo: I want more height
[2024-03-12T13:14:49] Gabe Enzo: Thinking about it it would 100% work
[2024-03-12T13:17:21] Happy Giraffe: If not bolted the heat has no path to travel out from esc box
[2024-03-12T13:19:15] Gabe Enzo: I'm also surprised these mh1s aren't blowing up.
[2024-03-12T13:26:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It will grow height since its taller , also travel of sus grows
[2024-03-12T13:27:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13611@12-03-2024_13-27-53.jpg>
[2024-03-12T13:28:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Arms will sit like that ,but marked height will stay
[2024-03-12T13:29:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So this why i said shock doesnt really matter for your bigger tire here
[2024-03-12T13:29:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also note that sus is in neutral now
[2024-03-12T14:02:35] Mirono escooters: You have low expectations
[2024-03-12T17:00:03] Happy Giraffe: Grade 5 Titanium🌚 (pp hard) 50.3cm 26.15mm thick 1196gram. Density, mass and volume calculations match TiGr5👀
[2024-03-12T17:10:03] Happy Giraffe: Was a pain to cut this with a fresh bi-metal sawblade so definitely real stuff. Even this 5mm thin rod stiff and strong AF
[2024-03-12T17:43:45] Mirono escooters: How you'll machine it
[2024-03-12T17:44:40] Happy Giraffe: I pray to god and watch the chips fall off
[2024-03-12T17:47:30] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2024-03-12T17:47:38] Mirono escooters: Hope u got good tool tips
[2024-03-12T17:50:31] Happy Giraffe: will see about that, otherwise gotta ask my future boss to take a good carbide knife and 90 degree edge tip with him when he comes to present the company at school xD
[2024-03-12T17:51:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well if chips go fire you get in news 😁🤣
[2024-03-12T17:52:39] Happy Giraffe: Propably cant take 4mm deep chips compared to mild steel xd
[2024-03-12T17:57:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably
[2024-03-12T18:02:21] sombre_enfant: Wym 90deg?vbmt?
[2024-03-12T18:02:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You guys have carbite blades or pure steel ? Second also does the job ,but needs fresh made edge Also lathe is like cnc or can do negative angle tool hold Positive holding if something goes wrong tool is pulled into material so fucks clearance Negative push it self more far
[2024-03-12T18:03:16] sombre_enfant: I was doing titane with normal insert was fine just dont go too fast and deep cut... Ap0.5 was alright
[2024-03-12T18:03:38] sombre_enfant: Carbide seco brand the best
[2024-03-12T18:04:27] sombre_enfant: Theres also sandvik who's great... And the cheap but work alright garant/holex emuge franken
[2024-03-12T18:05:21] sombre_enfant: Pure steel is really old scool or if u need to quickly have a custom tool to do a radius or sum..
[2024-03-12T18:05:52] sombre_enfant: Mine was on velcro running fine
[2024-03-12T18:05:52] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. sombre_enfant has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-12T18:10:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For titanium i would go with that in negative tool stand Automatic Always No hand messing with this , Before you make hard or hot spots And yeah 0,5 till you see what is ok for no struggle, also must contoll chips since it only brake's in advertisement of the blade's 😅
[2024-03-12T18:10:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True old but if you like mentioned happens ,turns into gold in seconds
[2024-03-12T19:02:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Do u loose your settings if u update vesc firmware?
[2024-03-12T19:05:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: O fudge
[2024-03-12T19:06:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I wasn't the one who programed my vesc don't really know how to
[2024-03-12T19:10:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Need field weakening
[2024-03-12T19:26:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm on 5.2
[2024-03-12T19:27:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Very old the man who did the programing is very stuck in terms of change
[2024-03-12T19:40:38] Happy Giraffe: Diffent tips, meant the 45°😂
[2024-03-12T19:42:54] Happy Giraffe: We have carbide or some sort of harder bits (that are changeable), hardly never use HSS bits on lathe
[2024-03-12T20:24:41] sombre_enfant: If u on manual late its easier to just incline the turret...
[2024-03-12T20:27:24] haku: is it possible to weld titanium like that?
[2024-03-12T20:31:17] Gabe Enzo: weld? that's a piece.
[2024-03-12T20:33:21] haku: yes like join 2 titanium parts together
[2024-03-12T20:37:31] Mirono escooters: Hard but doable
[2024-03-12T20:38:09] haku: check this out @Her0DasH @Happy_Giraffe single swingarm for emotos. what are your thoughts.
[2024-03-12T20:39:43] haku: hub motor version. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $1,453.89 7%OFF | 17" Wide Rim 12kw High Power Single Swing Arm Hub Motor for Electric Motorcycle https://a.aliexpress.com/_mKxpx5G
[2024-03-12T20:40:16] Mirono escooters: Single swingarm is fine, but I don't see the point
[2024-03-12T20:40:19] Mirono escooters: If it's properly made
[2024-03-12T20:40:49] haku: i wouldnt trust my 100kg ass on it haha
[2024-03-12T20:41:09] Mirono escooters: Some high quality motorbikes exist with it
[2024-03-12T20:41:15] Mirono escooters: But except looks I don't see the point
[2024-03-12T20:41:30] haku: i agree. good to see it trickle to pevs
[2024-03-12T20:41:59] haku: easier tire change i guess
[2024-03-12T20:44:32] Happy Giraffe: Yes, some titanium grades are easier to weld than others but it can be welded. The workplace I go has 5 welders with titanium welding certifications😅
[2024-03-12T20:45:15] haku: can you do it?
[2024-03-12T20:45:17] Happy Giraffe: This is just some pressed/pushed rod I think
[2024-03-12T20:46:07] Happy Giraffe: Hell no, I dont have any welding certificates. I can do a tig joint on steel that wont break and is somewhat good but not anywhere near certification quality😅
[2024-03-12T20:47:08] haku: it would be cool if you can make a panzerkamfwagen style scooter frame with titanium lol
[2024-03-12T20:47:51] haku: just a rectangle box with a cover lol
[2024-03-12T20:48:42] Happy Giraffe: Sheet is much more expensive than rod haha. Propably ends up costing 600-1000€ just for the materials
[2024-03-12T20:49:32] haku: dang thats crazy. what are the advantages of titanium over ss? weight?
[2024-03-12T20:49:36] Happy Giraffe: But that frame would be stiff and solid lol
[2024-03-12T20:50:03] Happy Giraffe: Weight, no corrosion. Really depends on the quality of both. Many kinds of SS out there

[2024-03-13T11:15:10] Gabe Enzo: The sanding mouse will heat the piece somewhat so it won't lose "all" of its structural integrity. Still tho, don't shave off too much. 1mm off each side is a bit too much imo. that's 2mm total.

[2024-03-13T14:33:28] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_13622@13-03-2024_14-33-28.jpg>
[2024-03-13T14:35:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How ?
[2024-03-13T14:35:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Steering damper
[2024-03-13T14:35:26] puneDir: Im starting to build g30 this weekend 🥷
[2024-03-13T14:35:35] puneDir: 20s 11p (for now)
[2024-03-13T14:35:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: On hardest
[2024-03-13T14:35:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Too much (does not need a for now)
[2024-03-13T14:36:40] Jan: Such a disgraceful engineering solution 🤣
[2024-03-13T14:37:16] puneDir: Nooo Imma make 16p
[2024-03-13T14:38:47] Кирилл: Dont let it work harder than before. Make changes to trail. Mask the problem with a damper is a bad solution
[2024-03-13T14:41:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It works
[2024-03-13T14:42:13] puneDir: Imma make 6 damper
[2024-03-13T14:42:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: There is a dual damper for dualtron
[2024-03-13T14:42:49] NetworkDir: damper factory +$$$$$
[2024-03-13T14:42:57] Jason Nelson: Can't re-engineer the scooter
[2024-03-13T14:42:58] Jan: Should you though?
[2024-03-13T14:43:08] Jan: How about a water tank that has no hole in the beginning?
[2024-03-13T14:43:13] puneDir: I need longer stem
[2024-03-13T14:43:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And ride around the world ?
[2024-03-13T14:43:22] puneDir: No
[2024-03-13T14:43:27] puneDir: Idk why
[2024-03-13T14:43:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 16p how much ah each cell ?
[2024-03-13T14:44:36] Jason Nelson: Where are you putting all of those cells?
[2024-03-13T14:44:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 40ah ?
[2024-03-13T14:45:29] NetworkDir: i put 20s5p on deck with very hard layout and 20s6p on bag
[2024-03-13T14:45:30] Jason Nelson: I have 240 cells on my scooter and fitting them was a nightmare
[2024-03-13T14:51:30] Кирилл: This only works the right way if the geometry was calculated correctly initially. if it's bad right away from factory, it doesn't work. A damper on an incorrectly calculated geometry increases unnecessary loads and causes the system to interfere with itself.
[2024-03-13T14:52:40] Кирилл: The worst thing (the best for chinesium factory) is that there are people who buy a poorly working system for a lot of money
[2024-03-13T14:53:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If the front is higher then the back (because different shocks) is it bad ?
[2024-03-13T14:54:36] Jason Nelson: I could 328 650 cells with my deck extension but only 246 700 cells
[2024-03-13T14:55:25] Jason Nelson: Horrible geometry. If it's not dramatic it's not bad but I've seen some nightmares
[2024-03-13T14:55:55] Jason Nelson: Nobody wants to see a squatted scooter anyway
[2024-03-13T14:56:04] Jason Nelson: Lol
[2024-03-13T14:56:10] Кирилл: Critically minimum value of trail or zero trail (shouldn't come near here) for high speed is bad. You have to calculate it for concrete speed (if factory didnt do it)
[2024-03-13T15:02:53] puneDir: 20s7p inside with kaçak kat
[2024-03-13T15:02:56] puneDir: And 4p bag
[2024-03-13T15:03:05] puneDir: <photos/photo_13623@13-03-2024_15-03-05.jpg>
[2024-03-13T15:03:11] puneDir: I just putted it back to test
[2024-03-13T15:03:16] puneDir: Not finished yet
[2024-03-13T15:03:16] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-13T15:13:15] Happy Giraffe: Pay me 2000€ and I do stainless steel body for scooter that holds 20s12p inside deck🌚
[2024-03-13T15:14:09] Happy Giraffe: Includes titanium pole
[2024-03-13T15:14:26] Jason Nelson: You can fabricate a small shelf to come out from underneath the top of the swing arm and support the bag so that all the weight isn't sitting on the folding mechanism
[2024-03-13T15:14:31] Happy Giraffe: Right haha😂
[2024-03-13T15:14:38] Jason Nelson: Drop the bag a little
[2024-03-13T15:15:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't really understand but that's my scooter it does go a bit lower with me on
[2024-03-13T15:15:42] Jason Nelson: Do you have any examples?
[2024-03-13T15:15:52] Happy Giraffe: If I had frame building jigs ready etc it wouldnt be that big of a project. I really have no idea why others are not doing it🤔
[2024-03-13T15:16:20] Happy Giraffe: Haha, it was mostly a joke but its very possible to build your own frame id you want😁
[2024-03-13T15:16:37] Jason Nelson: Ju expensive fabrication tools required
[2024-03-13T15:16:39] Happy Giraffe: I do mostly boxes and lathed/milled parts
[2024-03-13T15:17:19] Happy Giraffe: Not that much actually. But if you work in a metalworking job then it would be perfect side business
[2024-03-13T15:17:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I know a couple oxs that put a bigger battery compartment instead of stock one
[2024-03-13T15:17:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sub13 did it if you know you know
[2024-03-13T15:18:31] Happy Giraffe: Sadly not haha
[2024-03-13T15:19:07] Jason Nelson: Anybody have advice?
[2024-03-13T15:19:10] Happy Giraffe: But yeah its useful, if frame selected for modding is easy to work on then really nice customizing opportunities
[2024-03-13T15:19:50] Happy Giraffe: Check the real voltage of battery
[2024-03-13T15:20:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So you guys doesn't have a rugged clamp on the oxos (if you even buy those)
[2024-03-13T15:20:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://youtu.be/nQzp3U2POsc?si=9YA31EN7koz5FP7c
[2024-03-13T15:20:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And I know people who did the compartment more pro
[2024-03-13T15:21:24] Jason Nelson: Real voltage over 74 but why does vesc say 30% at 73v is my question
[2024-03-13T15:21:39] Happy Giraffe: So 20s battery?
[2024-03-13T15:21:51] Jason Nelson: Yes
[2024-03-13T15:22:10] Happy Giraffe: And you have set it correctly in vesc? Does vesc read correct voltage?
[2024-03-13T15:22:55] Happy Giraffe: @jamsessoderstrom How does vesctool calculate battery %? Does it take into account the cutoffs etc?
[2024-03-13T15:23:03] Jason Nelson: It's lower than real voltage but I've been told that's hardware and can't be calibrated
[2024-03-13T15:23:16] Happy Giraffe: How much is it off?
[2024-03-13T15:23:22] Jason Nelson: My cutoffs haven't been altered
[2024-03-13T15:24:06] Jason Nelson: It was .6 at 36v but now it's over a volt so I'm assuming it's scaling
[2024-03-13T15:24:32] Jason Nelson: I think 1.2 v
[2024-03-13T15:24:34] Happy Giraffe: Hmm one volt deviation quite a lot but shouldn't be that large of difference
[2024-03-13T15:24:47] Jason Nelson: I use a greenly meter with true RMS
[2024-03-13T15:25:58] Happy Giraffe: So it thinks 4.2 is 100% and 3v 0%?
[2024-03-13T15:26:03] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_13622@13-03-2024_14-33-28.jpg>
[2024-03-13T15:26:12] Jason Nelson: Does it not use this range in percentage?
[2024-03-13T15:27:03] Jason Nelson: Is there a more accurate chart I could reference?
[2024-03-13T15:27:23] Happy Giraffe: So vesc would think 20s battery being empty 3.3v x 20 is 66v
[2024-03-13T15:27:47] Happy Giraffe: Here vesc says 0%😁
[2024-03-13T15:27:59] Jason Nelson: Makes sense if that's the case but the cutoff is 60v so would it's still be functioning after it reaches 0%?
[2024-03-13T15:29:12] Happy Giraffe: Better to put vesc cutoff first before bms😁 More soft turning it off
[2024-03-13T15:29:35] Jason Nelson: Thank you
[2024-03-13T15:30:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wdy (what do you think)
[2024-03-13T15:30:33] Jason Nelson: When putting batteries in series you should account for the fact that they will not sag in tandem so you should set your limits a little higher anyway
[2024-03-13T15:30:50] Happy Giraffe: Bwahahah
[2024-03-13T15:31:26] Jason Nelson: I had problems with the original 75 100 but the aluminum doesn't seem to give me any issues
[2024-03-13T15:31:42] Jason Nelson: I think I went through three or four of The originals
[2024-03-13T15:31:54] Jason Nelson: I have put more miles on the aluminum than all of those combined
[2024-03-13T15:33:04] Jason Nelson: You probably won't be booking it when your battery dies because you'll be coming so close to the cutoff that the controller will be throttling you back. I don't have the experience to say though
[2024-03-13T15:52:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @KenLawrence
[2024-03-13T15:53:36] Кирилл: Ye, it will be better because of trail increases here (rake angle also). Make sure to make trail less dynamic with strength shock absorber, but the way it looks - very much like an amateur construction
[2024-03-13T15:54:14] Кирилл: I personally don't like such angles of attack, but if you like it, leave it
[2024-03-13T15:56:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's an air shock that's why it is high
[2024-03-13T15:58:44] Кирилл: If you want to know how professional industries did good trail at C type suspension - take a look at Inmotion RS
[2024-03-13T15:58:59] Кирилл: <photos/photo_13627@13-03-2024_15-58-59.jpg>
[2024-03-13T16:00:14] Jan: There is a masterpiece of video about stability of two wheelers on youtube explaining the 3 most important factor. Its so fucking good it would change the whole industry if people would watch it
[2024-03-13T16:01:03] Jan: You can make a two wheeler stable with zero trail if you do one of those 3 at right
[2024-03-13T16:01:06] Jan: One was trail yes
[2024-03-13T16:03:57] Кирилл: https://motochassis.com/Articles/GeomAPB/steering.htm
[2024-03-13T16:04:07] Кирилл: <photos/photo_13628@13-03-2024_16-04-07.jpg>
[2024-03-13T16:04:31] Кирилл: Quite curious article
[2024-03-13T16:07:08] Кирилл: @AJAJ1992 check this out:)
[2024-03-13T16:12:57] Jan: Yeah the type of suspension can affect your trail under compression
[2024-03-13T16:13:20] Jan: I dont like C Suspensions that much
[2024-03-13T16:20:38] Gabe Enzo: I went over a hill yesterday at 60kmh and got some airtime lol
[2024-03-13T16:21:05] Gabe Enzo: i wasnt expecting to go in the air
[2024-03-13T16:21:07] Mirono escooters: Superior but varying trail sucks
[2024-03-13T16:43:16] Gabe Enzo: It's called Amazon because they're killing the Amazon rainforest

[2024-03-13T17:14:19] haku: long time no see bud!
[2024-03-13T17:31:11] Gabe Enzo: Does anyone know a fork for Xiaomi pro 2 that can hold 11" tyres?
[2024-03-13T17:31:24] Gabe Enzo: with a 22x3 for 11" tyre rim.
[2024-03-13T17:37:23] haku: this is in US?
[2024-03-13T17:39:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure, i was looking alien rides sign but ,why he would race that or old pics or 🤷‍♂
[2024-03-13T17:40:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Explain your self
[2024-03-13T17:45:44] Gabe Enzo: There's 2 types of big motors, one for 10" tyres and one for 11"
[2024-03-13T17:45:57] Gabe Enzo: ones with 6" rim are usually for 10"
[2024-03-13T17:46:09] Gabe Enzo: and to my knowledge the 6.5" or so is for 11" and above.
[2024-03-13T17:52:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's common
[2024-03-13T17:56:22] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-13T17:56:58] puneDir: Shitly setted up vesc 90 kg driver And slightly uphill 0-50 35-35a (i will make 55-55 tomorrow)
[2024-03-13T17:57:01] Jason Nelson: Amazon is the largest corporate contributor to renewable energy
[2024-03-13T17:57:18] puneDir: Around 3 seconds
[2024-03-13T18:01:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Music is a killer
[2024-03-13T18:07:37] puneDir: Lol
[2024-03-13T18:07:50] puneDir: apaci music 😀
[2024-03-13T18:24:55] Gabe Enzo: Just fixed that guys bike., about to get out on a test drive Works like new now.
[2024-03-13T18:25:02] Gabe Enzo: His brakes went out after that crash.
[2024-03-13T18:25:17] Gabe Enzo: Not gonna charge him more than 25 eh. He's a friend of my dad in church.
[2024-03-13T18:32:09] Finn: @Mirono_escooters Ill get an ebike for 50€😂 hopefully its a mountainbike... Mp2 on that rear motor would be finny
[2024-03-13T18:32:52] JPPL: Top much work, less time

[2024-03-13T18:39:21] Yamal: All with vesc?😁
[2024-03-13T18:40:31] haku: theres no family discounts when it comes to buissness
[2024-03-13T18:41:37] Gabe Enzo: Look what I found
[2024-03-13T18:41:37] Gabe Enzo: Tis a 45 min job. I won't even charge him for taking a look at it.
[2024-03-13T18:42:20] haku: magnetic dust. magnetite i think
[2024-03-13T18:42:23] Gabe Enzo: This E-Bike has the same design flaw as my FIDO, and it isn't even a FIDO
[2024-03-13T18:42:51] haku: lots of mini ebikes have that layout. jetson bolt too
[2024-03-13T18:42:53] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>

[2024-03-13T18:49:05] Yamal: Yes
[2024-03-13T18:49:40] haku: i did not know we had scooter racing here. good to know
[2024-03-13T18:51:13] JPPL: On corners are vesc, red is Kelly, teverun have original ctrl
[2024-03-13T18:57:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: A bit of oftipcness for today: an asmondgold quote pineapple 🍍 looks like a pokemon
[2024-03-13T18:57:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The left scooter what is it ?
[2024-03-13T19:00:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure what that means
[2024-03-13T19:01:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Anyway i ment main beat behind it
[2024-03-13T19:02:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: First of these what i see and actually has a pedal
[2024-03-13T19:04:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just iron dust or steel ,magnet is the middle
[2024-03-13T19:05:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You find the same shit in dyu and kugoo ,just no pedal
[2024-03-13T19:06:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Restart phone and clear cache
[2024-03-13T19:07:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure what's that ,but hey fuel scooter like that to an electric is not really a race
[2024-03-13T19:14:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: My next target is something like this upgraded to go 70-80kmh
[2024-03-13T19:14:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_13635@13-03-2024_19-14-09.jpg>
[2024-03-13T19:14:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Chain drive
[2024-03-13T19:15:10] haku: nice! what is it?
[2024-03-13T19:15:27] haku: frame seems can fit alot of stuff
[2024-03-13T19:17:39] Gabe Enzo: I've been waiting for E Vs Gas.
[2024-03-13T19:22:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Frame inside is a bit small cuze the motor it's a kids bike originally like the razors but we don't have we alternatives like those and nototec
[2024-03-13T19:24:53] JPPL: Teverun costumized, Blade arms, air shocks,
[2024-03-13T19:43:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Mototec*

[2024-03-13T20:10:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 4:35 listen🤣
[2024-03-13T20:12:27] haku: i unerstand a little bit of this language. its filipino language. hilarious
[2024-03-13T20:12:57] haku: the electric smoked the single motor gas haha
[2024-03-13T20:31:48] haku: @Happy_Giraffe good deal or not so good deal?
[2024-03-13T20:33:01] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if thats even real
[2024-03-13T20:33:21] haku: no idea. only way to see is pay thru paypal
[2024-03-13T20:33:50] Happy Giraffe: Anyways better get BBSHD the bigger brother of these motors
[2024-03-13T20:36:14] haku: but is this price is good?
[2024-03-13T20:37:23] haku: i wonder how much you can push these little mid drives
[2024-03-13T20:41:45] haku: 3 kits for 400
[2024-03-13T20:41:50] Yamal: At first the Teverun didn't attract me at all, I saw them as too "plastic", Today I'm changing my mind, I like them more and more structurally, I see their base to a good extent, it's not narrow at all, and I also like how short they look...
[2024-03-13T20:45:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tbh this teverun blade2 gt was here stock ,geometry was really bad
[2024-03-13T20:45:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Understand English part is enough
[2024-03-13T20:45:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tells they should be not one category
[2024-03-13T20:46:16] Happy Giraffe: Scam level good
[2024-03-13T20:46:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He says in half or one round all electric is far leadnig coz awd
[2024-03-13T20:46:28] Happy Giraffe: Bro its got a battery too😂
[2024-03-13T20:46:45] haku: yea lol. folks say its legit
[2024-03-13T20:47:12] haku: cant pay with paypal though. so idk
[2024-03-13T20:47:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What's this shop?

[2024-03-13T20:49:38] Yamal: 🧌
[2024-03-13T20:50:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤷‍♂ i am too honest , but could feel instabil feeling even doing 30
[2024-03-13T20:51:21] haku: lmfao i knew it. someone bought them all wtf.
[2024-03-13T20:51:38] haku: dammit next time dont think just buy
[2024-03-13T20:52:24] haku: this is a legit shop from what they said
[2024-03-13T20:52:33] Yamal: But teverun to ?
[2024-03-13T20:53:09] Happy Giraffe: Those parts not useful if you want a fun bike, need 72v and good frame to put it on
[2024-03-13T20:53:24] Happy Giraffe: Mid drive is crap like stores intend to sell them
[2024-03-13T20:54:05] haku: i wanted to resell.
[2024-03-13T20:54:24] haku: someone gonna list this fb marketplace haha
[2024-03-13T20:54:47] haku: also would be a cheaper alternative for my boys bike
[2024-03-13T20:55:55] Gabe Enzo: Y'all, I'm thinking of a setup for my brother's scooter. Would 13s3p LISHEN even be a good idea? I know for a fact this mh1 pack is totally dead. no hope for it.
[2024-03-13T20:56:10] Gabe Enzo: I'm on a tight budget
[2024-03-13T20:56:30] Gabe Enzo: Just something to get this 800w going, if it's not enough power I'll have to get a used 250w.
[2024-03-13T20:57:16] Gabe Enzo: Probably a better option for his weight. only 60kg. 15s4p is an option. 16ah 48a.
[2024-03-13T20:58:17] Happy Giraffe: Would be honestly better off saving more, its not worth to make scooter 50% worse by saving 50£
[2024-03-13T20:58:48] Gabe Enzo: I told him I'll pay for half his molicels for the condition that he saves half.
[2024-03-13T20:58:55] Happy Giraffe: Samsung 30T sometimes has been dirt cheap too
[2024-03-13T20:59:31] haku: they selling it $2 a cell right now
[2024-03-13T20:59:40] haku: idk if thats a good deal
[2024-03-13T20:59:52] haku: <photos/photo_13639@13-03-2024_20-59-52.jpg>
[2024-03-13T21:00:45] Happy Giraffe: Nkon prices really bad atm, idk whys the shortage there
[2024-03-13T21:00:51] haku: i want to stock up on good batteries fornfuture projects
[2024-03-13T21:01:04] Gabe Enzo: They deteriorate.
[2024-03-13T21:01:07] Gabe Enzo: It's like gasoline.
[2024-03-13T21:01:19] Happy Giraffe: Better not stock up if not a crazy deal, especially low cap cells
[2024-03-13T21:01:21] Gabe Enzo: If you keep them in a fridge at optimal temperature and optimal voltage then it lasts a bit longer
[2024-03-13T21:01:30] haku: but how long can you keep em?
[2024-03-13T21:02:12] Gabe Enzo: unsure but with lipo it quickly turns to chemical waste. If not kept at a specific temperature in a fridge at an exact voltage(3.3v I believe) then it will just lose all of its potential.
[2024-03-13T21:02:52] haku: lets ask @jamessoderstrom. how long can you keep batteries for?
[2024-03-13T21:03:22] Gabe Enzo: I kept one of my lipos at 3.3v at optimal temp and after 6 years it didn't balloon
[2024-03-13T21:03:30] Gabe Enzo: I was honestly amazrd
[2024-03-13T21:03:36] Gabe Enzo: it lost 0% capacity
[2024-03-13T21:03:38] Gabe Enzo: ZERO
[2024-03-13T21:03:47] Happy Giraffe: LiPo completely different game. They are just sitting time bombs lol
[2024-03-13T21:04:25] haku: i think you can keep new cylindrical liion batteries for years
[2024-03-13T21:04:40] Happy Giraffe: Not for that many but for some time yeah😁
[2024-03-13T21:04:46] Gabe Enzo: If kept at 3.3v and a cold space then I believe so. James will verify.
[2024-03-13T21:04:58] Gabe Enzo: Nominal voltage is actually not best to store at. Weirdly enough.
[2024-03-13T21:05:10] haku: tesla batteries made in 2014 still sold and used today
[2024-03-13T21:10:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When i opened it was sold out
[2024-03-13T21:10:32] haku: yep sold out in 10mins
[2024-03-13T21:11:02] haku: it was in my cart for a while. waiting to checkout but hesitated
[2024-03-13T21:12:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its like Happy said
[2024-03-13T21:13:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks good but these setups up to bike frame size and how much teeth your main has
[2024-03-13T21:14:00] haku: i wanted to use one and sell the others and profit lol
[2024-03-13T21:15:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13640@13-03-2024_21-15-17.jpg>

[2024-03-13T21:15:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also ziptie advertisement,no reallly calling me
[2024-03-13T21:15:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And the fuck is that Before the tire
[2024-03-13T21:16:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Battery has open charging port

[2024-03-13T21:18:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also maybe it's a time to time offer shop ,but they had only 5 kind of products and one sold out
[2024-03-13T21:20:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also cheapet 750w bafang set without battery is like 450 $ on ali
[2024-03-13T21:21:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes talking about teverun blade gt2
[2024-03-13T21:22:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The mini blade has much better geometry
[2024-03-13T21:26:30] Happy Giraffe: Being a collector of crap not useful either, rather one good motor and not being responsible of selling bomb batteried who knows what crap is inside
[2024-03-13T21:31:17] haku: thats true.
[2024-03-13T21:38:16] haku: i want my son to have an ebike. i think that kit would be perfect. instead of putting a g30 motor on a bike haha
[2024-03-13T21:38:24] haku: too late sold out haha
[2024-03-13T21:39:53] haku: put a midrive on that bmx i got for free
[2024-03-13T21:39:54] haku: <photos/photo_13572@10-03-2024_02-38-59.jpg>
[2024-03-13T21:48:54] haku: @jamessoderstrom this good price to stock on?
[2024-03-13T21:48:55] haku: <photos/photo_13644@13-03-2024_21-48-55.jpg>
[2024-03-13T21:48:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-13T21:51:54] haku: not really meant for scooter yea?
[2024-03-13T21:53:27] haku: are thesw quality cells though?
[2024-03-13T22:00:13] haku: awsome thanks. how long can i stock these up for? do they deteriorate?
[2024-03-13T22:00:55] Gabe Enzo: How fast can P42a charge?
[2024-03-13T22:05:22] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-03-13T22:20:02] sombre_enfant: 1,5c
[2024-03-13T22:20:09] haku: this is on par with p45? just with less capacity?
[2024-03-13T22:20:39] haku: wow! awsomw
[2024-03-13T22:20:51] NetworkDir: Sony vtc6 also good option
[2024-03-13T22:21:34] haku: cant find those for $2 a cell. this is available in the US for that price
[2024-03-13T22:21:55] NetworkDir: Yeah i mean 18650 version compared with samsung 30T
[2024-03-13T22:22:44] haku: i should make 2 packs one super high discharge with 30t
[2024-03-13T22:23:49] NetworkDir: Sony discharge ?
[2024-03-13T22:24:23] haku: 22s 30t would be awsome for this price dont you think?
[2024-03-13T22:25:10] haku: do you know the IR of these?
[2024-03-13T22:28:40] Gabe Enzo: You sure now
[2024-03-13T22:30:25] haku: dang. very nice
[2024-03-13T22:31:42] haku: can prolly do 45a
[2024-03-13T22:32:23] haku: this is a budget p45 then.
[2024-03-13T22:33:42] haku: this might be a better choice than my 40ts. just for higher discharge. burnouts
[2024-03-13T22:36:07] sombre_enfant: Yeah but dont go over 1c if u dont instant need the scooter...
[2024-03-13T22:38:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You know these guys?
[2024-03-13T22:38:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am in few spanish chats

[2024-03-14T00:01:10] haku: hes turning 5. when i was 5 i was already wrestling other kids.
[2024-03-14T00:02:20] Happy Giraffe: Lmao, we ate our own nostril treasures at 5
[2024-03-14T00:04:17] haku: lmao i got one just now haha. lets see if real
[2024-03-14T00:04:56] haku: i got an email notification that its back in stock
[2024-03-14T00:08:33] Happy Giraffe: Sure is a scam
[2024-03-14T00:08:56] haku: its a gamble
[2024-03-14T00:08:57] Happy Giraffe: Oil up and clean your AR for home visit
[2024-03-14T00:09:57] Happy Giraffe: Nobody aint giving a free one at those prices.130$ for battery motor etc etc not happening
[2024-03-14T00:10:37] haku: cmon bro. we will see. sometimes we get lucky
[2024-03-14T00:11:26] Happy Giraffe: You didn't see children films to find out what happens to the greedy people?🤣
[2024-03-14T00:11:40] haku: lmao
[2024-03-14T00:11:54] haku: hansel and gretsky?
[2024-03-14T00:24:49] Happy Giraffe: Any😂
[2024-03-14T00:29:00] haku: i feel like the homeowner set this trap lol. https://youtube.com/shorts/caQLMl6akFU?si=zRhV__vyjYgEdU8E
[2024-03-14T00:33:53] Happy Giraffe: Kinda stupid placement but yeah blind people, some reflectors and yellow-red paint needed tho
[2024-03-14T00:37:11] haku: hope its legit. lol
[2024-03-14T00:41:31] Happy Giraffe: You buy bbshd, not this one🌚
[2024-03-14T00:42:16] Happy Giraffe: Or a custom frame from a guy in UK and use QS90 motor🌚
[2024-03-14T03:25:40] Franchesco Carofano: What do you recommend more, the 7218kelly or the tronic 250?
[2024-03-14T03:27:21] Franchesco Carofano: <sticker>
[2024-03-14T06:41:41] Happy Giraffe: Yup, bbso2 smaller tho. Havent seen people tune them as much
[2024-03-14T06:43:33] Happy Giraffe: I would avoid kelly at all cost, lack many features and might not work with all motors properly. Latest versions have motor temperature sensor supports but still wouldnt buy them at that price and size.
[2024-03-14T06:57:06] haku: can you rip out the esc in there and put a vesc?
[2024-03-14T06:59:09] haku: i have some spintends 85/100 laying around
[2024-03-14T07:00:26] haku: im watching andy kirby in youtube. he did it with grin phaserunner.
[2024-03-14T07:01:10] Happy Giraffe: Sure
[2024-03-14T07:02:19] Happy Giraffe: Bbso2 less powerful tho and might not be compatible with the tuning parts of bbshd like metal gears etc. Haven't looked for them tho
[2024-03-14T07:02:57] haku: i will open one if it comes in. if it comes in haha
[2024-03-14T07:03:43] haku: bafang is known to be quality isnt it?
[2024-03-14T07:19:40] Happy Giraffe: Yeah kindof but they had some design flaws with first gen Bbshd, not sure about bbso2
[2024-03-14T07:20:13] Happy Giraffe: Chainline will be a challenge
[2024-03-14T07:22:46] haku: i already have an ebike. but i want a middrive. i think ill sell that folding POS
[2024-03-14T07:23:22] haku: fatbike is so heavy.
[2024-03-14T07:24:20] Happy Giraffe: Needs a proper frame😁
[2024-03-14T07:25:06] haku: i will find a used steel frame.
[2024-03-14T07:25:20] haku: some folks just give it away for free
[2024-03-14T07:32:29] Happy Giraffe: Alu also fine if its one of the better DH bikes
[2024-03-14T07:33:00] Happy Giraffe: Steel bends so bit different to ride and theres not a lot of full suspension steel frames available😅
[2024-03-14T07:33:45] haku: no suspension just a basic bike
[2024-03-14T08:06:33] haku: https://youtu.be/xUgKdtLmZfY?si=btqiwdHXjFEJZPmM
[2024-03-14T08:15:21] puneDir: Whats that 0s?
[2024-03-14T08:38:49] Happy Giraffe: Its go time boys
[2024-03-14T08:45:12] Happy Giraffe: Well, if you want a fun bike its 72v bbshd. Lesser voltages need gears and thats a pain in the ass
[2024-03-14T09:19:33] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-03-14T10:01:28] Face de Pin Sucé: I've read 11.6 for 30T

[2024-03-14T12:03:41] Happy Giraffe: Usually its even closer, not more than 0.01mm off. Good value for 10€ I must say

[2024-03-14T12:09:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pocket bike Minispeed bike Mini dirt bike Quad and more like that made with 50cc engine's are made for 4-5 year old kids

[2024-03-14T12:39:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably how Recorder compressed it or and tg compression 🤔 unsure maybe you see it like that coz of that music 😁

[2024-03-14T15:34:41] sombre_enfant: Sometime we do plan by hand when we need fixture or ez part...
[2024-03-14T15:35:00] Jan: Probably would draw it as a 20mm (f5) tolerance
[2024-03-14T15:35:41] Jan: 19.964- 19.951
[2024-03-14T15:36:28] Jan: But usually most use are g6,g7 and holes in H7
[2024-03-14T15:36:41] Jan: Super rare to see others than these
[2024-03-14T15:36:50] sombre_enfant: Why tf ? U can just do +- or 0- or +x +x, no need for letter then we need to check on a chart or mectab.... H7 for hole where an axis slide in why not
[2024-03-14T15:37:10] Jan: Depends in the end what fit you need
[2024-03-14T15:37:28] Jan: Axles and holes are rarely done in numbers to my knowledge
[2024-03-14T15:37:35] sombre_enfant: In the end ask for grinding and put whatever u need
[2024-03-14T15:37:42] Jan: Everything else is basically only done in numbers
[2024-03-14T15:38:38] sombre_enfant: True but if its only really important and to know the application of the hole... If its pressfit slide in... So when u mess up u know the second tolerance....
[2024-03-14T15:39:47] sombre_enfant: For exemple i do extrusion screw set who slide in a axle my boring hole is suposed to be 51H7 so 0 + 0.03 but i always goal for +0.05
[2024-03-14T15:40:00] sombre_enfant: Aim*
[2024-03-14T15:42:42] Jan: I didnt do a lot of machining myself, maybe you can teach me a little in that, engineering always pisses off the machine shop guys 🤣
[2024-03-14T15:43:11] Jan: "What is that piece of shit drawing again from the engineers, this cannot be made lol"
[2024-03-14T15:43:14] Jan: everytime
[2024-03-14T15:47:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Kelly 🤣
[2024-03-14T15:50:31] Happy Giraffe: Its fine actually, I just didnt want to search for axle tolerance that fits it😂
[2024-03-14T15:51:41] Happy Giraffe: But 19.964 too big🌚 I really need to save the 0.004mm😉
[2024-03-14T15:53:55] Jan: ^^
[2024-03-14T15:54:59] Happy Giraffe: Manual lathe quite fun, relaxing until you are close to the final value😂
[2024-03-14T16:05:26] puneDir: 250cc bike (50kg driver) Zero 10x with low settings (80kg driver)
[2024-03-14T16:05:26] puneDir: 10 meter drag race Btw zero kills it after 20-30 xd
[2024-03-14T16:05:58] puneDir: Today i smashed honda dio And pcx And this 250cc thingy
[2024-03-14T16:06:16] puneDir: 250 takes it on short but after 20-30kmh zero kills And if i set 55 amps on both escs zero kills everything But its uncontrollable like that

[2024-03-14T16:19:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Which one ?
[2024-03-14T16:20:39] sombre_enfant: Yeah when u forget fucking radius
[2024-03-14T16:29:42] Alin Ciobanu: 2600
[2024-03-14T16:30:28] Finn: Rip ubox
[2024-03-14T16:32:44] Finn: Is that the dc dc for 5V?
[2024-03-14T16:51:27] puneDir: Note 11
[2024-03-14T17:09:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: true motocycle owned
[2024-03-14T17:12:37] sombre_enfant: Thats when EDM come in clutch then u ask 800€ more because of electrode making + other machines in use🥱
[2024-03-14T17:14:29] sombre_enfant: I forgot to do radius on my custom fork they asked 700usd i added them they asked 200usd ..
[2024-03-14T17:20:10] Mirono escooters: Can always remove material But not easily add
[2024-03-14T17:45:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: With one of my ex company i actually did a work for them 😁
[2024-03-14T17:45:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But over Tedx
[2024-03-14T17:45:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: I use 1000 and even this way front wheel spins
[2024-03-14T18:07:18] haku: thank you. and for the measurements
[2024-03-14T18:22:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: No problem my friend
[2024-03-14T18:25:17] haku: thats good they used 6awg cables. looks like it can handle some current
[2024-03-14T18:25:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes but they are massive
[2024-03-14T18:25:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: Don't know if I can fit them in my blade gt
[2024-03-14T18:26:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I got the note 13 5g it's ok in terms of camera
[2024-03-14T18:27:26] haku: its nicw and beefy
[2024-03-14T18:27:43] haku: are you planning to open it?
[2024-03-14T18:28:06] haku: and see if clean?
[2024-03-14T18:28:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: Not for now
[2024-03-14T18:28:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: Maybe latter I will open them
[2024-03-14T18:29:20] haku: i think that whole bottom is a thick piece of aluminum heatsink. maybe you can find a flat one to replace it
[2024-03-14T19:13:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I really dunno why they do this , should be flat and polished to mirror ,side could have this
[2024-03-14T19:13:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cnc could flatten this fast ,just you need to get electronic stuff out and need a cnc
[2024-03-14T19:17:49] Happy Giraffe: Or even manual😂
[2024-03-14T19:20:19] Happy Giraffe: Manual tools with digital screens are pure love
[2024-03-14T19:24:23] haku: its a pretty interesting design. i think its designed for ebikes/surrons to be mounted outside
[2024-03-14T19:36:42] JPPL: Kelly is a beast! No doubt who says otherwise, vesc better in a lot off ways
[2024-03-14T19:37:00] JPPL: Kelly lover here
[2024-03-14T19:47:00] haku: i dont want to stir things up but would you say your kellys are better than your g300s?
[2024-03-14T19:47:46] haku: im sure its easy to set up
[2024-03-14T19:47:49] JPPL: Depends on Kelly model
[2024-03-14T19:48:21] JPPL: Kelly is almost plug and play, program is Basic , few options, i love the behabiour
[2024-03-14T19:49:01] JPPL: No screen options, more Basic software, but hardware is rocksolid
[2024-03-14T19:49:12] JPPL: No temp issues
[2024-03-14T19:49:26] haku: i had this same discussion with sabvoton vs vesc.
[2024-03-14T19:49:49] JPPL: Beber tried, cant say,
[2024-03-14T19:50:02] JPPL: Isnt it square wave?
[2024-03-14T19:50:14] haku: the ease of use and reliability is the main thing
[2024-03-14T19:50:30] haku: sinewave i think
[2024-03-14T19:50:55] JPPL: If it is should be good ctrls
[2024-03-14T19:51:44] JPPL: Previous to g300 i used Kelly on my zero11x
[2024-03-14T19:52:16] haku: i see. very nice
[2024-03-14T19:53:23] Happy Giraffe: Sabvoton is crap, takes 5x space and doesnt even support temp sensors on motor
[2024-03-14T19:55:56] haku: agreed. it is big but the old ones from 2018 still running today
[2024-03-14T19:56:30] haku: still they never changed the design though
[2024-03-14T19:59:50] Happy Giraffe: Also they are so damn expensive, in 3shul priced almost
[2024-03-14T20:00:46] haku: yes haha. idk how they keep thier value when theres better options imo
[2024-03-14T20:29:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Any way is good
[2024-03-14T20:32:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some like kelly some not ,its like We dont all need to love or like full same things I prefer vesc And find few things wierd on kelly ,like VGA cable thingy 🙈
[2024-03-14T20:33:48] haku: i still use display ports for my computer monitors insread of hdmi lol
[2024-03-14T20:34:12] puneDir: I cant pass 75 because of tank slapper 😭
[2024-03-14T20:34:33] Happy Giraffe: They are better🌚
[2024-03-14T20:34:42] puneDir: It happens so rapidly First vibration Then fucking suicide
[2024-03-14T20:34:52] puneDir: I need damper
[2024-03-14T20:39:13] Mirono escooters: C sus moment
[2024-03-14T20:39:51] puneDir: Isnt there a way to make it safe Instead of damper Damper is just 💀
[2024-03-14T20:58:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need a better frame Bro, i didn't said what i said about zero frame to generate hate or talk against you , it's just like that and in the long run ,you spend on this a lot and its like don quijote fighting wind mills
[2024-03-14T20:59:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you see you grow over it
[2024-03-14T20:59:17] puneDir: yeah but
[2024-03-14T20:59:23] puneDir: is damper a solution?
[2024-03-14T20:59:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Will not solve the problem
[2024-03-14T21:01:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is what i mentioned about the teverun blade 2 the other day Dampener on 8 and at 30kmh i feel the wobble , however it's holding but problem is deeper and as i said in the long run when you find a better for your self you will just look back amd wish you didn't spend more on this
[2024-03-14T21:02:01] Mirono escooters: Your only
[2024-03-14T21:02:10] Mirono escooters: It's fine
[2024-03-14T21:02:25] puneDir: sad
[2024-03-14T21:02:30] puneDir: i cant go fast
[2024-03-14T21:02:37] puneDir: always have to release throttle
[2024-03-14T21:02:58] Mirono escooters: Exhibit A
[2024-03-14T21:03:10] puneDir: yes damper is like that
[2024-03-14T21:03:18] puneDir: taping the broken water bucket
[2024-03-14T21:03:32] Mirono escooters: It's fine for c sus
[2024-03-14T21:04:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not all is like this
[2024-03-14T21:05:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like in the case if that blue armed laotie, if the two arms longness,the one above and the lower could be swapped would not be great but would work much better
[2024-03-14T21:05:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But thats impossible

[2024-03-14T21:50:57] haku: these straps just waiting to rip and kill me.
[2024-03-14T22:00:42] haku: dam the entry level to these tools is expensive.
[2024-03-14T22:02:16] haku: ill be patient and monitor the prices and strike when its on sale
[2024-03-14T22:06:12] Yamal: Is this the g300 you are talking about?

[2024-03-14T23:00:47] sombre_enfant: Thats for the big man only
[2024-03-14T23:01:18] sombre_enfant: When u reading on this in a train or bus its big dick energy
[2024-03-14T23:02:56] Happy Giraffe: This propably shit aswell
[2024-03-14T23:03:39] Happy Giraffe: Cheapassing in life not always the best option
[2024-03-14T23:03:45] haku: dude im not buying a $20k cnc machine. i just want to learn it
[2024-03-14T23:04:18] Happy Giraffe: Search used market, lot of better hobby manual lathes under 1k
[2024-03-14T23:04:35] Happy Giraffe: Maybe even could get a small mill for same amount
[2024-03-14T23:04:58] haku: i need to do more research on these machines
[2024-03-14T23:05:01] Happy Giraffe: But you aint getting a CN one for that money😅
[2024-03-14T23:05:47] Happy Giraffe: Better off buying a CN mill from alie and upgrading its frame and toolhead etc etc
[2024-03-14T23:06:25] puneDir: Smuggle CNC from local factory
[2024-03-14T23:06:46] haku: i just want to experience it. i think its for me
[2024-03-14T23:07:21] haku: selling bronze dildos on etsy
[2024-03-14T23:08:09] haku: sometimes you get great deals if you wait enough
[2024-03-14T23:09:30] puneDir: Yes
[2024-03-14T23:09:45] puneDir: 2024 best business fr
[2024-03-14T23:21:22] sombre_enfant: Soon i'll machine a bad dragoon on 5 axis mill but i want you to use it and do a vid for the group (for vesc research purpose only)
[2024-03-14T23:29:56] Happy Giraffe: Now when our school is finally moving to 3D model based G-code creation I get my will to live back
[2024-03-14T23:30:12] Happy Giraffe: Aint nobody actually programming a 5 axis by hand🌚
[2024-03-14T23:31:48] sombre_enfant: U can but not continous 5axis
[2024-03-14T23:32:00] sombre_enfant: Only for like oriented hole
[2024-03-14T23:32:50] sombre_enfant: But on heidenaim and siemens or manual guide straight g code u need to be chinese and speak in g code
[2024-03-14T23:34:34] NetworkDir: Why
[2024-03-14T23:35:06] Finn: <photos/photo_13676@14-03-2024_23-35-06.jpg>
[2024-03-14T23:35:09] Finn: <photos/photo_13677@14-03-2024_23-35-09.jpg>
[2024-03-14T23:35:16] Finn: Thats why
[2024-03-14T23:35:56] sombre_enfant: How tf u made the picture clearer with zoom ?
[2024-03-14T23:36:21] Finn: Its macro camera
[2024-03-14T23:36:53] NetworkDir: I test damper with negative trail at 75km/h and with bigger handlebar It's very stable Coming soon i test with +100km/h
[2024-03-14T23:39:19] Happy Giraffe: Soon getting access to 5-axis and school hopefully hurries with the software. Could even make a program at home and bring it to school if they make things properly🤔
[2024-03-14T23:40:20] Happy Giraffe: All kinds of custom sprockets for ebikes would be nice to do diy way
[2024-03-14T23:40:45] sombre_enfant: Fusion cam is really cheap around 700€ a year... Mastercam is 20k...
[2024-03-14T23:41:24] sombre_enfant: Sprocket is hard to make man..
[2024-03-14T23:42:06] sombre_enfant: Need 2 machine and dont warp it... Maybe rectification
[2024-03-14T23:42:24] sombre_enfant: No need of 5 axis also
[2024-03-14T23:42:34] NetworkDir: I mean as "very stable" is much better dualtron and same grade scooters i can handle wobbles
[2024-03-14T23:42:34] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_13679@14-03-2024_23-42-34.jpg>
[2024-03-14T23:42:34] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_13680@14-03-2024_23-42-34.jpg>
[2024-03-14T23:42:46] sombre_enfant: Turning phase and 3axis mill.. Or only mill
[2024-03-14T23:43:35] sombre_enfant: But depend for what use... Some are totally flat some are conical at the end of theet
[2024-03-14T23:43:57] NetworkDir: My trail now at negative because front exa291R 125mm need to convert 137mm Maybe on 150mm better
[2024-03-14T23:45:09] Ion: I'm actually thinking about building a mid drive bike
[2024-03-14T23:45:13] NetworkDir: This photos old photo (before snapping stem) External + internal battery finished Tomorrow external cable (8mm silicon cable) And mount stem, controller, brakes and finish :)
[2024-03-14T23:45:23] Ion: So a DH bike is a good start?
[2024-03-14T23:45:44] sombre_enfant: Idk if i do a damper mount for my vsett 10 @jamessoderstrom can u send pic with caliper mesurement i design it ?
[2024-03-14T23:46:03] Ion: Where would you mount batteries? (While keeping it looking somewhat clean looking)
[2024-03-14T23:47:53] sombre_enfant: U cant on that frame better do it on a hardtail frame... Full sus is worse for electric
[2024-03-14T23:48:49] Happy Giraffe: Yes, kinda the only option for higher power ones
[2024-03-14T23:49:25] Happy Giraffe: Lets see what the byrocracy does for us😂 They propably get the worst cam at highest price
[2024-03-14T23:49:27] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2024-03-14T23:49:55] Happy Giraffe: Batt hard to put on DH frames, usually put under frame low tube
[2024-03-14T23:50:02] NetworkDir: 4mm silicon cable fine for 80A on 2 meters?
[2024-03-14T23:50:05] Ion: What would you look for in a used bike for conversion?
[2024-03-14T23:50:11] sombre_enfant: The damper mount actually so i can send it to jlcpcb or alike
[2024-03-14T23:50:24] Happy Giraffe: We made some special tools to cut sprocket teeth
[2024-03-14T23:50:39] sombre_enfant: This year i might design part for many scooter and manufacture it
[2024-03-14T23:50:40] Ion: Also isn't it overkill for mostly road use? How would the suspension act with road riding?
[2024-03-14T23:51:24] Happy Giraffe: Motor choise, drivetrain has to be straight, overall sturdy enough frame
[2024-03-14T23:51:54] Happy Giraffe: Not really, most commonly used mtb frames are too weak for tuned bbshd/CYC setups
[2024-03-14T23:52:38] Happy Giraffe: If you make a low power one then cheaper frames might be sufficient
[2024-03-14T23:52:50] Ion: Is vesc worth it with bbshd? Looking at all parts together, would be quite expensive
[2024-03-14T23:53:08] Ion: Also what can they do? Like 4kw?
[2024-03-14T23:53:58] sombre_enfant: Mortising machine ?
[2024-03-14T23:54:34] sombre_enfant: We use that but for internal cutting
[2024-03-14T23:55:12] Happy Giraffe: I didnt look so much into it, just saw that they had some special setup. We really lack all the different tools to even cut hexagon holes...
[2024-03-14T23:55:21] sombre_enfant: But its yur pcb ?
[2024-03-14T23:55:27] Happy Giraffe: Absolutely
[2024-03-14T23:55:41] Happy Giraffe: 130$ vesc expensive?😳
[2024-03-14T23:56:39] Ion: Nah just in general lol. Also I saw someone made a vesc board that fits inside the motor itself, but couldn't find it anywhere
[2024-03-14T23:57:01] sombre_enfant: Hexagonal cut on lathe need b axis or special vibration tool with smaller theet one cutting theet is doing the job out of 6
[2024-03-14T23:57:55] Happy Giraffe: On 72v typically can be run 60A batt and above with ~90A phase or above. I will hopefully test it soon myself. This requires properly built drivetrain however, need of special offset front chainrings etc other expensive parts required😂 Also recommended to make it a single speed with around 42T front 36T rear gearing
[2024-03-14T23:58:09] Happy Giraffe: And we don't even have that😁
[2024-03-14T23:58:28] Happy Giraffe: I gotta mill a 17mm wrench slot for the axle but thats ok
[2024-03-14T23:58:53] Ion: Hmm interesting. But how about with gearing and PAS sensor? Would it work
[2024-03-14T23:59:45] sombre_enfant: Oh on axle its easy u put it in the 4 axis of a mill or a divider or on a lathe with y axis
[2024-03-14T23:59:53] sombre_enfant: And use an end mill
[2024-03-15T00:00:29] Happy Giraffe: I cant remember the cadense required on top of my head, PAS would be shitty on such beastly bike. It will do wheelies if you want just from pressing throttle
[2024-03-15T00:01:13] Happy Giraffe: Yup, we have a lathe chuck on a manual mill so will just do it there
[2024-03-15T00:01:33] Ion: https://lunacycle.com/blog/luna-bbshd-ludicrous-v2-released/ That was that vesc controller I saw btw
[2024-03-15T00:01:52] sombre_enfant: U will see u learn stuff fast in factory just choose the right one,not automotive one u will do 100-1000 same part search for mold or special niche u will do like 1-10 pcs per plan and program on machine
[2024-03-15T00:02:05] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/VOZwbD05p-w?feature=shared
[2024-03-15T00:02:35] Happy Giraffe: Yup, I got a foot in the best company in area. Cant wait to start there
[2024-03-15T00:02:53] sombre_enfant: If u need any help i dont bother to ask i got around 82 year of experience of engineering machining specialist
[2024-03-15T00:02:56] Happy Giraffe: Luna vesc is crap, they limit the rpm of motor in the firmware
[2024-03-15T00:03:28] Ion: Bruh, missed opportunity really
[2024-03-15T00:03:45] Happy Giraffe: Just slap a spintend 80100 and you are good to go
[2024-03-15T00:04:02] Happy Giraffe: I even got the Luna settings as a vesc setting file🌚
[2024-03-15T00:04:21] sombre_enfant: 85200 if u want to strip those nylon gear
[2024-03-15T00:05:53] Ion: Oh yea, I'm guessing that needs to be upgraded
[2024-03-15T00:06:10] Ion: Also what's a typical price for a bbshd? And where to look for one?
[2024-03-15T00:06:16] Happy Giraffe: Haha, 80100 will do that. The metal gear upgrade is kinda must
[2024-03-15T00:06:27] Happy Giraffe: 650$😅
[2024-03-15T00:06:48] Happy Giraffe: I got two motors from a friend to fix and use for under 300😅
[2024-03-15T00:07:14] Ion: Damn, nice 😁
[2024-03-15T00:07:22] Happy Giraffe: Might be good to look for people with broken nylon gear and repair them
[2024-03-15T00:07:46] Happy Giraffe: If they lack experience to service motor you could get a nice deal
[2024-03-15T00:08:04] Ion: Haven't seen a single one pop up on used market here (or Germany) lol
[2024-03-15T00:08:55] Ion: Also do you have any pics of completed conversions? Just to see how it looks @Happy_Giraffe
[2024-03-15T00:09:46] Happy Giraffe: I will search later
[2024-03-15T00:10:07] Happy Giraffe: Its propably illegal motor in germany as its rated 1000w
[2024-03-15T00:10:50] Ion: Well same here... 250w max
[2024-03-15T00:11:10] Ion: Imma have to get a Bosch logo 😂
[2024-03-15T00:14:17] Happy Giraffe: Cops propably know the motor as its so common😁
[2024-03-15T00:16:15] Ion: Dream would be fully legal looking ebike (with integrated battery), but powerful motor and pedal freewheeling (for throttle use)
[2024-03-15T00:21:46] sombre_enfant: Can u make a guide how to wire pas and use it to 25kph and hidden mode to use Throttle and brake hall to max potential
[2024-03-15T00:23:03] Happy Giraffe: I havent used PAS on vesc, I put throttle and torque sensor in parallel before adc module and then have a key switch to activate throttle so I can sneakily take key out and tell them its for "offroad use only"
[2024-03-15T00:23:35] Ion: That would be actually something I'd need to figure out too. How to make Vesc comply to speed limit with gearing
[2024-03-15T00:23:37] Happy Giraffe: Worked good until torque sensor started giving weird 1.5v pulses out of nowhere even when it was grounded
[2024-03-15T00:23:53] Happy Giraffe: Use single gear on 72v
[2024-03-15T00:24:05] Ion: Can vesc use external wheel speed sensor of some kind? Or know what gear it's in?
[2024-03-15T00:24:53] Happy Giraffe: Dont think anyone did that yet, just use single gear. It has wheelie torque and 80kmh topspeed on field weakening all with same gear
[2024-03-15T00:25:50] Ion: Fair I guess, so no reason to have them. Only thing would be to "look" as if I was pedaling above 25
[2024-03-15T00:25:55] sombre_enfant: Torque sensor is on pedal ? Idk what i exactly got on the bomber... I will build it in a month or two
[2024-03-15T00:26:42] Happy Giraffe: Yes, torque sensing bottom bracket is useful for hub drives. On mid-drives that fit on bottom bracket like bbshd you cant use that
[2024-03-15T00:27:40] Happy Giraffe: I can later calculate the pedaling cadence for 30-40kmh on 26" wheels and 42-36T gearing
[2024-03-15T00:28:14] Ion: Ok, idk if my idea is stupid or actually makes sense lol
[2024-03-15T00:28:29] sombre_enfant: Yeah i think its like this its right before the crankset on the bearing next theres the crankset arm
[2024-03-15T00:28:39] sombre_enfant: Show me wiring pls
[2024-03-15T00:28:57] Ion: Also wait, does the bbshd not have a torque sensor? Only cadence?
[2024-03-15T00:29:10] Happy Giraffe: I mean yeah that's maybe littlebit useful but if you go 50 uphill then cop just handcuffs you there😂
[2024-03-15T00:29:28] Happy Giraffe: Only cadence and those are crap
[2024-03-15T00:29:29] Ion: That's true 😂
[2024-03-15T00:30:04] sombre_enfant: In France if no laser gun only fee for excessive speed at much since they dont have exact number
[2024-03-15T00:30:26] Ion: Nobody modded that somehow? (idk how impossible it is admittedly)
[2024-03-15T00:31:11] Ion: Lol here we have a law that accepts "a police officers speed judgement by eye" as evidence, with the same weight as radar 💀
[2024-03-15T00:31:29] Happy Giraffe: It depends on which kind of torque sensor you have but in essence you put the signal outputs together before adc adapter. This will make torq sensor behave slightly differently when you have throttle activated or not
[2024-03-15T00:31:54] sombre_enfant: Thats crazy
[2024-03-15T00:32:14] sombre_enfant: Adc v2 ? Or only resistor on adc1
[2024-03-15T00:32:39] Ion: Yep it's crazy, but people even defend it 💀
[2024-03-15T00:32:47] Happy Giraffe: Impossible, even torq sens freehub is not possible because motor would pull same chain
[2024-03-15T00:33:03] Happy Giraffe: First gen adc
[2024-03-15T00:34:00] Ion: How do the "legal" bikes do it then? Different motor setup (since you can't spin motor without pedals)?
[2024-03-15T00:34:53] Happy Giraffe: Wiring depends on torque sensor model, mine outputted 3.3v but still had to route it trough adc module as it floats on 1.5v nominally and yeah adc v1 module throttle max value is about 2.2v so not much resolution for throttle left. Depends on setup
[2024-03-15T00:35:18] Happy Giraffe: I just pay moped insurance and have legal 1000w motor with throttle here
[2024-03-15T00:35:37] Happy Giraffe: Still limited 25kmh but atleast setup not illegal
[2024-03-15T00:36:53] Happy Giraffe: Cross section you mean?
[2024-03-15T00:38:34] Ion: That would require proper certificate of conformity and for it he a "real" vehicle lol
[2024-03-15T00:42:57] Happy Giraffe: Damn german regulations, here I dont even need a frame number. Just gotta pay up
[2024-03-15T00:43:29] Ion: Austria, ye it sucks
[2024-03-15T00:53:11] Happy Giraffe: Damn

[2024-03-15T01:43:26] haku: just saw my neighbor riding around in one of these. im so jelly
[2024-03-15T01:49:37] haku: lol it does. but its faster than my vsett. and hes doing no hands riding.
[2024-03-15T01:50:24] haku: i did not even know this existed until he told me where to buy it
[2024-03-15T01:55:19] haku: yea lol
[2024-03-15T01:57:03] haku: all i see is a qs motor upgrade and a huge battery in there
[2024-03-15T02:00:37] haku: what macro camera you use?
[2024-03-15T02:02:14] haku: can that be fixed? what component is that?
[2024-03-15T02:06:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: Guys any way to show in android mobile app no limit versions?

[2024-03-15T07:25:38] rosheee: but 30s gets warm
[2024-03-15T07:25:45] rosheee: and more expensive than 150$
[2024-03-15T07:27:41] rosheee: ^^
[2024-03-15T07:27:43] rosheee: but more sexy
[2024-03-15T07:27:44] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-15T08:23:53] haku: what spintend is that? 80/100?
[2024-03-15T08:25:50] haku: dam this effect is pretty cool.
[2024-03-15T09:55:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is there a way to know if my sensor cables is connected using the vesc app ?

[2024-03-15T10:57:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm coming to steal your battery 🔋
[2024-03-15T10:57:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is there a way to know if my sensor cables is connected using the vesc app ?
[2024-03-15T10:57:59] puneDir: 😁😂
[2024-03-15T10:58:05] puneDir: Btw its not even brand new cells
[2024-03-15T11:05:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: 30s3p
[2024-03-15T11:06:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: I used d traction control
[2024-03-15T11:06:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: U trust used cells ?
[2024-03-15T11:07:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: To me it'll be very hard to get cells locally (and impossible to ship from outside)
[2024-03-15T11:14:50] puneDir: Theyre from snsc All m26 Tested
[2024-03-15T11:14:57] puneDir: 60-70 cycle

[2024-03-15T11:30:13] Rogerio Figueiredo: Crap tires maybe
[2024-03-15T12:59:05] Happy Giraffe: When you do motor calibration it tells if it sees halls or not
[2024-03-15T12:59:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So recalibrate?
[2024-03-15T12:59:32] Happy Giraffe: Either will display "hall sensors" or "sensorless" depending if correctly sensed
[2024-03-15T12:59:43] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but save your old settings first
[2024-03-15T13:09:06] haku: https://youtu.be/j92Gt4VviSQ?si=Pf2cLkHntH_FPuLF good info here
[2024-03-15T13:36:11] Alin Ciobanu: Good morning, do you know anything about an update of the vesc tool app on iPhone?
[2024-03-15T13:37:10] Alin Ciobanu: I would like to put the fw 6.05 on the vesc but then I can’t touch anything with the phone
[2024-03-15T13:49:12] Happy Giraffe: Damn long info, will listen to it later as a podcast😂
[2024-03-15T13:52:01] Happy Giraffe: Police maxed out aliexpress build
[2024-03-15T13:53:18] haku: lmfao
[2024-03-15T14:41:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Might as well update to above 5.2
[2024-03-15T15:25:52] Gabe Enzo: Is it possible to use the front monoshit forks to make a rear non suspension fork?
[2024-03-15T15:25:59] Gabe Enzo: Just bolt it down
[2024-03-15T15:26:03] Gabe Enzo: @Bradhaku
[2024-03-15T15:26:16] Gabe Enzo: Think you did that
[2024-03-15T15:28:33] puneDir: Why you do that Its a pricey solution
[2024-03-15T15:30:36] Gabe Enzo: Not really, it was 80€.
[2024-03-15T16:12:58] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2024-03-15T16:48:45] Gabe Enzo: Any good vescs for 24s. this one says it's only 22s max.
[2024-03-15T16:50:10] Gabe Enzo: Something that's cheap
[2024-03-15T16:50:16] Gabe Enzo: Not like tronic or smth
[2024-03-15T16:52:16] Jan: Then you get something thats crap
[2024-03-15T16:52:24] Jan: 20S+ is not for low budgets
[2024-03-15T16:52:58] Gabe Enzo: I'm one to know.
[2024-03-15T16:53:01] Jan: Projects have bigger battery packs, bigger esc's and bigger motors, therefore bigger budgets need to be calculated in
[2024-03-15T16:53:11] Gabe Enzo: This for an Ekart
[2024-03-15T16:53:22] Gabe Enzo: Yeah 1k on the cell at least.
[2024-03-15T16:53:32] Gabe Enzo: 5kwh around.
[2024-03-15T16:53:44] Jan: There is no point in going for over 20S unless you do a 35-50kW project
[2024-03-15T16:53:56] Gabe Enzo: Yeah it's 50kw.
[2024-03-15T16:54:06] Gabe Enzo: that's why I'm looking at 24s.
[2024-03-15T16:55:29] Jan: So 50kW project and no budget.. Sounds like a suicide build
[2024-03-15T16:55:54] Gabe Enzo: I just said I'll be spending 1k on the cell alone. and 1k for motors obv
[2024-03-15T16:56:00] Gabe Enzo: What made you think that.
[2024-03-15T16:56:10] Jan: Cable drum brakes, HOTA tires, two different refurbished motors?

[2024-03-15T16:56:26] puneDir: Matte but i will still wrap it to zeros color
[2024-03-15T16:56:45] Gabe Enzo: So what like 4k total if im lucky
[2024-03-15T16:56:50] Gabe Enzo: don't really want to spend more.
[2024-03-15T16:56:55] Jan: A genuine 50kW build is gonna cost you 5-8k USD
[2024-03-15T16:56:58] puneDir: <animation>

[2024-03-15T18:56:55] Happy Giraffe: Try to reduce 10°c
[2024-03-15T18:57:36] haku: i never really mess with temp settings with my filaments.
[2024-03-15T18:58:03] haku: sometimes only first layer speed
[2024-03-15T19:06:08] Gabe Enzo: bottom plate will hold ther
[2024-03-15T19:06:34] Gabe Enzo: What better way to practice on welding molicels than welding on molicels
[2024-03-15T19:06:57] Gabe Enzo: These are 20700s
[2024-03-15T19:06:59] haku: can 801 weld copper well?
[2024-03-15T19:07:02] Gabe Enzo: Yea
[2024-03-15T19:07:09] haku: cool
[2024-03-15T19:07:15] Gabe Enzo: Weird cells
[2024-03-15T19:07:19] haku: show a peel video dm me.
[2024-03-15T19:07:19] Gabe Enzo: but 30a
[2024-03-15T19:07:32] Gabe Enzo: 3ah
[2024-03-15T19:09:11] Gabe Enzo: Would be cool to make a whole pack with these
[2024-03-15T19:09:55] haku: those are still quality cells i think. if you can find more why not
[2024-03-15T19:11:10] haku: i would make a pack out of 18350 cells if its good enough lol
[2024-03-15T19:11:32] haku: or 26650 cells
[2024-03-15T19:12:03] haku: back in the vaping days those weird size batterys were used
[2024-03-15T19:13:41] haku: nowadays 21700 has the best capacity and energy
[2024-03-15T19:13:42] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-15T19:23:02] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-03-15T19:23:21] Gabe Enzo: Weak.
[2024-03-15T19:23:24] Gabe Enzo: don't know what sup
[2024-03-15T19:23:35] Gabe Enzo: perhaps too powerful
[2024-03-15T19:24:02] haku: what size copper and are you using plated steel?
[2024-03-15T19:24:11] Gabe Enzo: 0.1mm pure copper
[2024-03-15T19:24:36] haku: no nickel?
[2024-03-15T19:24:40] Gabe Enzo: Nah
[2024-03-15T19:24:48] Gabe Enzo: Nickel on top no?
[2024-03-15T19:24:59] haku: try it with plated steel
[2024-03-15T19:25:09] Gabe Enzo: copper plated steel?
[2024-03-15T19:25:15] Gabe Enzo: Steel plated copper
[2024-03-15T19:25:35] haku: big difference. i also was doing pure copper before and welds are inconsistent
[2024-03-15T19:25:48] haku: nickel plated steel.
[2024-03-15T19:25:59] Gabe Enzo: I need to use copper
[2024-03-15T19:26:02] Gabe Enzo: First
[2024-03-15T19:26:06] Gabe Enzo: Bad idea for nickel first
[2024-03-15T19:26:20] haku: yes copper first then plated steel to hold it
[2024-03-15T19:26:46] haku: you dont need conductivity from the plated steel just use it to get a solid weld
[2024-03-15T19:26:47] Gabe Enzo: Nickel finefor that
[2024-03-15T19:27:15] haku: sure try pure nickel. but for me plated nickel is the best
[2024-03-15T19:27:45] haku: i think the pros use that too
[2024-03-15T19:27:47] Gabe Enzo: super hard to work on used cells
[2024-03-15T19:28:24] haku: nkt really. it will weld no matter how deformed the cells are
[2024-03-15T19:29:10] haku: <photos/photo_13692@15-03-2024_19-29-10.jpg>

[2024-03-15T19:29:22] haku: this is .2 with .2 plated steel.
[2024-03-15T19:29:53] haku: so difficult to remove the welds.
[2024-03-15T19:29:54] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-15T19:32:58] Alin Ciobanu: This bot is a little too intrusive
[2024-03-15T19:33:37] haku: baby girl rose was neccissary for folks like me
[2024-03-15T19:34:29] Gabe Enzo: Yea
[2024-03-15T19:34:47] Gabe Enzo: forgot to put nickel on

[2024-03-15T19:38:29] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-03-15T19:39:08] haku: nickel plated steel bro
[2024-03-15T19:39:30] haku: big difference in welds
[2024-03-15T19:39:35] Gabe Enzo: the initial weld is shit too
[2024-03-15T19:39:40] Gabe Enzo: with copper
[2024-03-15T19:40:10] haku: get some .1 or .15 plated steel
[2024-03-15T19:40:19] Gabe Enzo: I have some.
[2024-03-15T19:40:39] haku: is that what your using on that video?
[2024-03-15T19:40:52] Gabe Enzo: nickel
[2024-03-15T19:41:11] haku: use tge plated steel and report back.
[2024-03-15T19:41:48] Alin Ciobanu: Weld test of placated steel Then put the copper and weld with another piece of subsided steel on top

[2024-03-15T19:44:00] haku: what size copper and plated steel is that?
[2024-03-15T19:44:15] Gabe Enzo: I used iron
[2024-03-15T19:44:18] Gabe Enzo: It works
[2024-03-15T19:44:58] haku: lol just use the copper+plated steel and show a video
[2024-03-15T19:45:01] Alin Ciobanu: 0,15 steel plated 0,1 copper
[2024-03-15T19:45:13] haku: i want to know if 801d can weld copper
[2024-03-15T19:45:13] Gabe Enzo: don't have any
[2024-03-15T19:46:38] haku: get some baby.
[2024-03-15T19:47:14] Gabe Enzo: is this initial copper weld supposed to be so shit
[2024-03-15T19:47:24] Gabe Enzo: @lBabacar what settings do you use for copper
[2024-03-15T19:47:48] haku: i played around from .1,.15,.2 copper,nickel and plated steel the best combo for my welder is .2copper and .2 plated steel
[2024-03-15T19:48:03] Alin Ciobanu: Under the copper there is other steel plated among the series
[2024-03-15T19:48:19] Gabe Enzo: Isn't that bad for resistance
[2024-03-15T19:48:45] haku: what do you mean appeased? thats a big word
[2024-03-15T19:48:53] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2024-03-15T19:49:16] Paolo ⁭: And the rust risk is more
[2024-03-15T19:49:30] sombre_enfant: 36
[2024-03-15T19:49:37] Gabe Enzo: What tg
[2024-03-15T19:49:42] Gabe Enzo: isnt that like for nickel
[2024-03-15T19:49:42] haku: thats the only way to get solid welds for me bro
[2024-03-15T19:49:48] Gabe Enzo: I've been using 100-60
[2024-03-15T19:49:58] sombre_enfant: No nickel i use 18
[2024-03-15T19:50:00] haku: if its sealed it shouldnt be an issue
[2024-03-15T19:50:14] sombre_enfant: U trippin again my bro
[2024-03-15T19:50:40] haku: even .15 i blow holes thru copper + plated steel
[2024-03-15T19:51:55] haku: this is my welder right now @PaoloWu
[2024-03-15T19:52:06] Gabe Enzo: Doesn't stick at all
[2024-03-15T19:52:07] Gabe Enzo: wtf
[2024-03-15T19:56:43] haku: @lBabacar with all due respect please show a peel test. im dying to know if 801d can weld copper
[2024-03-15T19:56:51] haku: a video
[2024-03-15T19:59:31] Paolo ⁭: Doesn’t glitter weld copper directly?
[2024-03-15T20:00:13] haku: yes but im not getting consistent results. out of all the welds i tried some stick some dont
[2024-03-15T20:00:41] haku: welding with plated steel i get a solid weld. cant even remove it
[2024-03-15T20:01:33] sombre_enfant: U need to pust the solder paste
[2024-03-15T20:01:54] sombre_enfant: Yo i sent u... I cant do a vidéo
[2024-03-15T20:03:11] haku: dude with all due respect the photo you sent doesnt mean anything. it cant see how the copper peeled
[2024-03-15T20:05:00] Gabe Enzo: I'm gonna print myself a herb grinder.
[2024-03-15T20:05:06] Gabe Enzo: Trying to save money recently.
[2024-03-15T20:05:22] Gabe Enzo: ah
[2024-03-15T20:06:03] haku: dude please no solder paste wtf @lBabacar you know better
[2024-03-15T20:06:58] Mirono escooters: Solder paste??
[2024-03-15T20:09:08] haku: solder paste only good if you welding really thick stuff like .4 or .5
[2024-03-15T20:09:23] haku: and thats normally for prismatic cells
[2024-03-15T20:11:28] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13703@15-03-2024_20-11-28.jpg>
[2024-03-15T20:26:07] Mirono escooters: Don't print those. The spikes will shed plastic. Ain't healthy
[2024-03-15T20:26:10] Mirono escooters: Or so I've heard.
[2024-03-15T20:26:15] Mirono escooters: :)
[2024-03-15T20:30:30] haku: can you print a joint roller. i remember having a fancy brass one when i was your age
[2024-03-15T20:31:23] Ion: @Happy_Giraffe so I found a bbshd kit w/ 48v 17ah battery
[2024-03-15T20:31:53] Ion: Says bbshd 48v 1000W and 100mm (I'm guessing that needs to match the frame size)
[2024-03-15T20:32:20] Ion: Would you say it's worth 500€? How good are these batterys typically? Can they do like 50+A?
[2024-03-15T20:46:31] Gabe Enzo: Too professional to need one of those.
[2024-03-15T20:46:36] Gabe Enzo: can roll with my eyes closed.
[2024-03-15T20:46:39] Gabe Enzo: Literally
[2024-03-15T20:46:59] Gabe Enzo: Same applies for real plastic grinders.
[2024-03-15T20:47:32] haku: i was an amateur never turned pro. i still remember getting shit weed with seeds and it popped on my eye
[2024-03-15T20:48:04] Mirono escooters: Just metal or toothless grinders
[2024-03-15T20:48:15] Mirono escooters: But that's too offtopic, even for this chat.
[2024-03-15T20:48:42] haku: i dont know what kids use nowadays. some stuff just too strong. i dont smoke now btw
[2024-03-15T20:48:57] Gabe Enzo: I only need a size of a pea.
[2024-03-15T20:49:11] Gabe Enzo: that's how nice it is now.
[2024-03-15T20:50:04] haku: we call that mexican weed back then
[2024-03-15T21:07:05] sombre_enfant: Bro cant bill it thats lame even my 9yo bro can backstrap

[2024-03-15T21:19:45] haku: of i only had welding and cnc skills. this looks fun
[2024-03-15T21:37:21] Happy Giraffe: I would guess those batteries are good for around 30A
[2024-03-15T21:37:40] Happy Giraffe: Bbshd not worth to use with 48v anyway
[2024-03-15T21:38:26] Happy Giraffe: Motor alone is 650€ on ali last time I checked
[2024-03-15T21:42:01] Ion: It's a little used, scratched up, but not too bad. Would have to find a good frame then lol
[2024-03-15T21:42:22] haku: btw that bbs02 deal was real. folks recieved thiers. it was really that price
[2024-03-15T21:42:27] Ion: Is the 48v and 52v bbshd physically the same motor (by stator size etc)?
[2024-03-15T21:57:33] Rose: Hey there Dede, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-15T22:03:17] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/u26JGJg25BE?si=DA7twGd0VDVwPJkg
[2024-03-15T22:35:16] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but again I would not use bbshd at those voltages. You will need gears for that and its a pain in the ass with the chainline.
[2024-03-15T22:36:10] Happy Giraffe: Building a bike like that is a ton of work and need precise planning in order what parts to get. I lack that knowledge and I have a friend helping me aswell to build it

[2024-03-16T01:54:58] Ion: Yeah I can see that. Do you know of any good resources or groups for that? Is there an ebike focused one?
[2024-03-16T01:59:47] Happy Giraffe: Maybe High Voltage YouTube channels discord. Other places are just full of misinformation

[2024-03-16T02:23:34] haku: lol this guy is selling me his $200 bbs02 for $300. gotta love capitalism
[2024-03-16T02:24:40] haku: cant believe i missed out on that one. next time just buy and dont hesitate
[2024-03-16T04:18:07] haku: just have to say this multicolor ali pla is nice.
[2024-03-16T05:45:10] Yamal: cool what you do with the 3 d printer! Couldn't you make small scale scooters and original brands like Zero, Dualtron, Kaabo, etc etc g30 etc...?

[2024-03-16T12:19:04] Gabe Enzo: I got it to be perfect.
[2024-03-16T12:19:23] Gabe Enzo: I thought you were supposed to weld copper first, then nickel later. LOL
[2024-03-16T12:19:53] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13714@16-03-2024_12-19-53.jpg>
[2024-03-16T12:41:22] Happy Giraffe: People recommending to use stupid gearing and themselves say that something is well built even when its not. Using low voltage setup puts just ton of strain on chain and drivetrain because of too small rear sprocket. If using gears you will have chain that runs sideways and cassette wears out very quick
[2024-03-16T12:42:46] Happy Giraffe: Higher voltage allows you to make gearing to be more torquey as motors energy needed to turn wheel is reduced
[2024-03-16T12:43:47] Happy Giraffe: Usually you should use 3 gears max on a special 3-speed cassette sprocket or single gear
[2024-03-16T12:51:48] Gabe Enzo: what do y'all think of this story thing
[2024-03-16T12:51:53] Gabe Enzo: new telegram update
[2024-03-16T15:03:39] Ion: So internally geared hub is a good idea? Can they handle the power?
[2024-03-16T15:30:06] haku: yep thats it
[2024-03-16T15:30:29] haku: yes nickel over copper
[2024-03-16T15:31:02] haku: thats .1+.1?
[2024-03-16T15:31:36] haku: long trips such a hassle for electric.
[2024-03-16T15:31:57] haku: i still prefer gas for 400m trips
[2024-03-16T15:31:57] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-16T15:53:13] Happy Giraffe: They cant, maybe rohloff but thats way too expensive. If you wanna drop power way down then they could🤔
[2024-03-16T15:53:31] Happy Giraffe: 72V with first gear from internal hub would be fun😂
[2024-03-16T15:54:17] Happy Giraffe: Problem with those could be the chainline again, motor chain sits far from bike body so rear hub needs chain also as far as possible
[2024-03-16T15:57:10] Jason Nelson: I'm having an issue with my ADC controls. I think I had a disconnected adc2 so I took my display off the pole to resolder and put everything back together and when I did that now my adc1 is giving no response. When I unplug it the signal ramps up and when I plug the throttle back in the signal goes back down but it shows no response when I press the throttle
[2024-03-16T15:57:20] Jason Nelson: Has anyone had this issue? Is my ADC blown?
[2024-03-16T15:57:40] Jason Nelson: I've tried connecting multiple throttles
[2024-03-16T15:58:41] Jason Nelson: I believe 3.3, but I've had it working perfectly fine and did nothing with the positive and negative, only reconnected the one for the break
[2024-03-16T15:58:47] Jason Nelson: Brake*
[2024-03-16T16:02:53] Jason Nelson: <files/Screenshot_20240316-110015.png>
[2024-03-16T16:03:11] Jason Nelson: These are my signals
[2024-03-16T16:12:10] Rose: Hey there rOnii 👌🏼, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-16T16:14:50] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_13716@16-03-2024_16-14-50.jpg>
[2024-03-16T16:19:34] Jason Nelson: ADC must not be blown because when I disconnect the throttle after doing the settings the motor ramps up
[2024-03-16T16:39:33] haku: auto drive
[2024-03-16T16:49:59] Happy Giraffe: Still in Beta😂
[2024-03-16T16:50:20] Happy Giraffe: But in road conditiond like that maybe works well
[2024-03-16T16:52:55] Jason Nelson: I'm trying to take care of one thing at a time and figure out why my throttle signal is bad
[2024-03-16T16:53:05] Jason Nelson: I'm not really concerned about ADC2 right now
[2024-03-16T16:54:03] Jason Nelson: This is throttle connected
[2024-03-16T16:54:13] Jason Nelson: When I disconnect the throttle it matches ADC2
[2024-03-16T16:56:37] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_13718@16-03-2024_16-56-37.jpg>
[2024-03-16T16:56:50] Jason Nelson: Disconnected and rebooted
[2024-03-16T17:00:34] Happy Giraffe: Haha, theres so many stereotypic groups of people in traffic that its hilarius when they fuck up and you know exactly who it is
[2024-03-16T17:00:38] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-03-16T17:02:16] Jason Nelson: It has always done this for every controller that I have. When the throttle or brake lever are disconnected if floats at about a quarter to a third the signal strength
[2024-03-16T17:02:34] Jason Nelson: Should I reinstall firmware?
[2024-03-16T17:06:58] Jason Nelson: Is 6.0 the latest firmware for flipsky?
[2024-03-16T17:13:52] puneDir: No its normal on mks / shitsky
[2024-03-16T17:14:01] puneDir: It looks normal
[2024-03-16T17:14:20] puneDir: You need a 3.3k pulldown to make it lower
[2024-03-16T17:25:28] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_13719@16-03-2024_17-25-28.jpg>
[2024-03-16T17:25:34] Jason Nelson: Here is when I connect a different throttle
[2024-03-16T17:26:11] Jason Nelson: But the throttle gives no signal is my problem
[2024-03-16T17:26:30] Jason Nelson: I cannot get a read on ADC1
[2024-03-16T17:27:26] Jason Nelson: How do I measure?
[2024-03-16T17:27:37] Jason Nelson: Signal to ground?
[2024-03-16T17:27:44] Jason Nelson: Ok
[2024-03-16T17:28:13] Jason Nelson: Yes
[2024-03-16T17:37:41] Jason Nelson: Meter shows the same as the controller plus or minus .1 volts which I'm sure is typical
[2024-03-16T17:38:06] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-16T17:43:02] puneDir: tx rx
[2024-03-16T17:43:55] Jason Nelson: Both? I'll try another one
[2024-03-16T17:47:07] Rose: Hey there Dr, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-16T17:54:32] Yamal: Your car have Vesc?
[2024-03-16T17:59:42] Jason Nelson: That is for throttles doing the same thing
[2024-03-16T17:59:47] Jason Nelson: 4
[2024-03-16T18:00:14] Jason Nelson: And all four different brands
[2024-03-16T18:05:11] Jason Nelson: I guess I'm going to take my controller out of my other scooter and stick it into this one. I'll see what happens
[2024-03-16T19:35:50] Jason Nelson: Bypassing all of my wiring and hooking the throttle directly to the controller comes back with a signal so I guess I have some wires that got broken when I was trying to fix my ADC2 wire. I'm going to have to pull my wire out and check all my connections
[2024-03-16T19:36:16] Jason Nelson: It's just odd that it shows it connected but doesn't receive a signal
[2024-03-16T19:37:00] haku: its made for asian drivers. 😭
[2024-03-16T19:40:55] haku: beta not too bad. still need polishing though
[2024-03-16T19:50:34] sombre_enfant: So now u use old script ?
[2024-03-16T19:52:13] sombre_enfant: I plan to get vsett display with Throttle on the adc, do the key and speed mode works do theres hidden 25kph to full speed @jamessoderstrom @Aka13 ?

[2024-03-16T20:55:26] Gabe Enzo: No one told me you do it at the same time I learned that it mixes the 2 metals together to make a copper alloy Otherwise it wont stick
[2024-03-16T20:55:45] Gabe Enzo: 0.10 copper + 0.15mm Nickel
[2024-03-16T20:56:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is a scooter motor (1200watt zero10x) large outrunner
[2024-03-16T20:56:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or what
[2024-03-16T20:56:48] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2024-03-16T20:56:59] Gabe Enzo: Try the other ones tho
[2024-03-16T20:57:04] Gabe Enzo: Won't hurt it cause it's close range
[2024-03-16T20:59:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What is the wheal diameter of 10inch motor ?
[2024-03-16T21:01:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 250?
[2024-03-16T21:44:35] Happy Giraffe: Try that and then measure against gps with vesc logs and finetune wheelsize accordingly
[2024-03-16T21:47:24] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-16T21:48:24] puneDir: Btw front makes smoke on launch xD
[2024-03-16T21:54:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why does it sounds like it is moving inside but not outside?
[2024-03-16T21:55:25] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2024-03-16T21:55:42] Gabe Enzo: 254 but 250 bcz the tyre compressed

[2024-03-16T22:54:21] sombre_enfant: Throttle direct to the adc ? The nfc card works too ?
[2024-03-16T22:54:29] sombre_enfant: Wich wire u used ?
[2024-03-16T22:55:20] sombre_enfant: Use plated 0.1 h shape or w depend of your layout
[2024-03-16T23:48:37] sombre_enfant: If i use the 1k 2k resistor to 5v
[2024-03-16T23:50:20] sombre_enfant: Thanks for the clarification, also thanks for greenrider website, yeah they updated it vsett 10 motor again new vsett parts and the display... But i might get it on aliexpress
[2024-03-16T23:56:56] Rose: Hey there Dodo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-17T00:15:29] Gabe Enzo: what kw
[2024-03-17T00:15:39] Gabe Enzo: No need
[2024-03-17T00:19:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is motor current amps depends on battery and how much if so
[2024-03-17T00:20:24] NetworkDir: 35+35A 72V
[2024-03-17T00:23:45] haku: what display is that?

[2024-03-17T00:48:14] Gabe Enzo: My wallet bros
[2024-03-17T00:49:23] haku: ill tell you a secret. ali express is where those came from
[2024-03-17T00:58:04] sombre_enfant: Refund time incoming
[2024-03-17T01:00:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is motor current amps depends on battery and how much if so
[2024-03-17T01:13:03] Happy Giraffe: Usually motor amps can be around 2.5x the battery current
[2024-03-17T01:13:28] Happy Giraffe: But you must know what currents your setup can handle
[2024-03-17T01:14:39] Gabe Enzo: nah I'm ballin

[2024-03-17T01:55:22] sombre_enfant: Could i do that ?
[2024-03-17T01:55:22] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_13724@17-03-2024_01-55-22.jpg>

[2024-03-17T05:14:41] haku: i prolly need to know how to code to make it klipper
[2024-03-17T07:11:37] puneDir: Its gonna be on github
[2024-03-17T07:14:12] puneDir: Also its simple vesc display
[2024-03-17T08:40:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro punedir is such a bro he will help you for free
[2024-03-17T08:43:06] puneDir: :D yes i will
[2024-03-17T09:39:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Did not worked
[2024-03-17T09:54:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Meter ?😁
[2024-03-17T10:09:24] cihan: Does Nutt 4 piston brakes fit on ninebot f2 pro with 110mm rotor disc? Any ideas? Model name is Nutt y5.
[2024-03-17T10:10:02] cihan: I also have no idea about connectors on xiaomi brakes. Are they compatible with with Nutt connector?
[2024-03-17T10:12:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably not , surly not with that toy disc Also no reason for 4 piston brake on that And no connection not plug and play play since , xiaomi is sensor brake and this is cut off 3 wire xiaomi 2 wire is the nutt
[2024-03-17T10:13:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: However you can make it work , with dedicated e brake power,with a "chain of resistors "
[2024-03-17T10:15:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not totally sure what you mean under this maybe i get lost in translation
[2024-03-17T10:35:02] cihan: Thanks a lot. I'm going to buy a better caliper but I don't want to invest for f2 pro so I thought I could buy something better to use with another scooter in future.
[2024-03-17T10:36:17] cihan: That 5 bolt rotor disc drives me crazy, almost everything else except xiaomi world is 6 bolt.
[2024-03-17T10:47:29] sombre_enfant: Look i want to use hall brake Throttle over adc2, then i want something to short it with a button, so it must be a 2 wire on off switch that i connect to my 3.3v/5v with a resistor to not actually have full braking force when i push it but something between 20-50% of my brake current Now i wonder i can do it to not have ground loop or kill my stm (maybe diode) and the value of resistor Im so bad at electronic circuit so i cant really figure it out...
[2024-03-17T10:53:15] cihan: Does sensor brake mean this? Motor brake current is adjusted according to how much I squeeze the brake lever?
[2024-03-17T10:54:55] sombre_enfant: Is it standard 74mm postmount or weird ah xiaomi size, put a 140mm disc might work then
[2024-03-17T10:55:12] sombre_enfant: Its the sunlu s8
[2024-03-17T11:14:21] cihan: I had to jump this section to reply this message. Does 140mm 5 bolt disc exist?
[2024-03-17T11:15:09] cihan: 😁It's weird xiaomi 53mm or 51mm Postmount caliper according to some other sellers. I'll already add an adapter for 74mm postmount caliper. Problem is it's 5 bolt, I'll need 140mm disc but I didn't see on AliExpress.
[2024-03-17T11:25:34] sombre_enfant: It does exist tho..
[2024-03-17T11:26:35] sombre_enfant: Is it a motor on front or a rim ? I have a 10inch rim 125mm) 6hole disc kaabo brand new if it could fit
[2024-03-17T11:34:24] Tommy ª: Actually you can get the 120mm disk for 5 hole, is waay more thick than the 110 Also there is a 20mm brake pad caliper (the og uses 10mm) it locks the wheel pretty good
[2024-03-17T11:47:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Normal , already told you even disc what can be used
[2024-03-17T11:48:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes
[2024-03-17T11:48:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz you dont listen
[2024-03-17T11:50:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Monorim sells 140 mm disc what's 5 hole
[2024-03-17T11:53:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13727@17-03-2024_11-53-38.jpg>
[2024-03-17T11:55:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is partly true ,old type 110 was less thick ,but anyway bigger disc the better
[2024-03-17T11:56:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes ,just show you handfull in general
[2024-03-17T11:56:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you have bugs in tg ,clear phone cache and restart
[2024-03-17T11:57:27] Tommy ª: Actually there is a clone 110mm disk even smaller than original, I always seen on clones
[2024-03-17T11:58:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,what you say should be possible, since if you wire 2 wire cut off brake to xiaomi sensor ,you dedicate a brake power with resistors
[2024-03-17T11:58:34] Tommy ª: <photos/photo_13728@17-03-2024_11-58-34.jpg>
[2024-03-17T11:59:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Old ass m365 has this kind
[2024-03-17T11:59:47] Tommy ª: You sure? The m365 mine is 110 and it's from 2017
[2024-03-17T12:05:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13729@17-03-2024_12-05-14.jpg>
[2024-03-17T12:05:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wider 110 came later ,coz this was so shitty bendy
[2024-03-17T12:09:31] Tommy ª: Clones: yeah, it's still perfect
[2024-03-17T12:17:26] NetworkDir: It's my code but ok :) After finishing my zero I would fix pinout and share information for building this
[2024-03-17T13:49:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure what you mean by that 🤣
[2024-03-17T13:55:44] Tommy ª: Most of bad cloned xiaomis comes with that small brake disk even today 🤧
[2024-03-17T13:57:05] puneDir: I fucked so many bikes today
[2024-03-17T13:59:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont deal with clones,really rare
[2024-03-17T13:59:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Only if come and go
[2024-03-17T14:00:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We dont store anything like that in the shop or the workshop
[2024-03-17T14:01:16] cihan: It's rear wheel drive and disc rotor is located on front wheel Sorry, I didn't understand the part about rim.
[2024-03-17T14:04:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Rim is the metal thing in the middle of the tyre
[2024-03-17T14:05:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13730@17-03-2024_14-05-13.jpg>
[2024-03-17T14:07:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wheel you say more when you talk About the whole thing
[2024-03-17T14:08:25] Tommy ª: Here most of 40% of scooters are clones, sadly in my town like 80% ☠
[2024-03-17T14:09:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Where is here?
[2024-03-17T14:09:35] Tommy ª: s P a I n 😭
[2024-03-17T14:10:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than you should be familar with even the thing i said the other they that one of main xiaomi groups there reselled ali batts claiming made locally
[2024-03-17T14:12:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I Think clones should not exists at all ,or maybe in that case if better than original,but usually it's the other way around
[2024-03-17T14:14:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Last year ,i could mention 2 house fire ,sponsored by aovo pro left on charger for night First was one story family house But second was. 3 story house where fire was on First floor so he burned out another two floors 😅
[2024-03-17T14:14:43] Tommy ª: I never seen a "good clone", most of them with shitty battery, shitty knockoff chasis, bad even melted electronics Casually most of people don't difference a real Xiaomi with a clone or the classic "i tried the unlock speed method for Xiaomi and don't work" bruh Also a lot of clones turned into a fire ball, like it happend here recently
[2024-03-17T14:15:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah if they are muggle in this , they only look price tag
[2024-03-17T14:16:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is ppl like this here also ,all we can do is send them away with there crap😁
[2024-03-17T14:16:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We dont sell problematic models
[2024-03-17T14:17:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like things what doenst have any service possiblity
[2024-03-17T14:17:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If no parts exists,not much you can do
[2024-03-17T14:19:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like gt series anything possible Mi 3 lite Nothing 🤣
[2024-03-17T14:19:23] Tommy ª: Idk why but here the only thing is price tag Xiaomis got popular bc is cheap, ninebot don't selled here bc "is a Xiaomi but less cheaper" After this uh, clones appears, "it drives" for 200€ Bc these things exploding they banned using it in public transport
[2024-03-17T14:19:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Even surron parts i know
[2024-03-17T14:20:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I heard about the ban, all or clones only?
[2024-03-17T14:20:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think i saw a video about it, also one when they talk about helmets
[2024-03-17T14:21:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just Ricardo needed to explain,coz i speak spanish in zero lvl
[2024-03-17T14:22:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hola and things like that I know
[2024-03-17T14:23:08] Tommy ª: Everything is getting banned from 2024 and you only can use it until 2027 From 2024 you only can sell or buy a government authorised one, it uses a plate and it pass "security inspection" from the DGT Also it still a shit, I opened these scooters, all of them is the same bad thing inside, same bad quality but just with the "legal plate" plotted in the chasis The only Xiaomi allowed by gov is the new 4 series (from navee)
[2024-03-17T14:52:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Partly sad to hear ,coz this means shit ,but also end of clones I did see lot clones from inside
[2024-03-17T14:52:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also some other what ppl think maybe good
[2024-03-17T14:53:19] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-17T14:53:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like fiat 500 scooter,you would think that fiat puts his name near a something,but no , Inside is like in any shit clone
[2024-03-17T14:56:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In the purpose is a setable brake power than yeah
[2024-03-17T14:58:46] Tommy ª: Like I said, clones still producing but just with the "legal plate" Pure trash
[2024-03-17T14:59:57] Tommy ª: <photos/photo_13731@17-03-2024_14-59-57.jpg>
[2024-03-17T14:59:58] Tommy ª: Clone moment
[2024-03-17T15:00:34] puneDir: Btw zero is on low setting 35-35 instead of 55-55
[2024-03-17T15:00:57] Tommy ª: Bro let me drive it 🤧
[2024-03-17T15:01:33] puneDir: Sure Come turkey haha
[2024-03-17T15:01:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Normal for it
[2024-03-17T15:02:35] sombre_enfant: How quick can you send it ?
[2024-03-17T15:03:19] Gabe Enzo: Think this will fit?
[2024-03-17T15:04:37] Mirono escooters: Need a axle
[2024-03-17T15:05:09] puneDir: I will set to 55-55 and fuck some 250cc bikes
[2024-03-17T15:09:22] sombre_enfant: I sell this brand new never mounted
[2024-03-17T15:11:22] sombre_enfant: I mean in a letter
[2024-03-17T15:12:29] sombre_enfant: Pm
[2024-03-17T15:14:14] Happy Giraffe: Do a drag test run with the app Dragger
[2024-03-17T15:14:27] puneDir: I will this night
[2024-03-17T15:14:35] puneDir: But tank slapper is shit
[2024-03-17T15:14:44] puneDir: I had tank slapper today
[2024-03-17T15:18:40] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-17T15:18:40] puneDir: was slow
[2024-03-17T15:18:40] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-17T15:49:08] Gabe Enzo: is that 10x3?
[2024-03-17T15:51:02] cihan: I already got the 120mm disc, it seems thicker and also more rigid. I'm not sure if I'll be able to use it with single piston Shimano br-m375.
[2024-03-17T15:51:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fit ? in what?😁
[2024-03-17T15:52:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True ,anyway
[2024-03-17T15:52:47] cihan: I didn't really understand what you wanted to mean when saying rim. A rim brake?
[2024-03-17T15:53:44] Gabe Enzo: monoshit rear
[2024-03-17T15:53:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Rim is the whole metal thing what holds the disc
[2024-03-17T15:55:07] cihan: Ahh, I understood now, sorry. I understood rim of the tire at first.
[2024-03-17T15:55:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure,you need to check ,depends on where and how it can be mounted
[2024-03-17T15:56:19] cihan: I'll check if I can change that rim holding the disc. I didn't examine when I took off the tire before. Is it possible to change it and have a 6 bolt rim?
[2024-03-17T15:57:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on the rest of the scooter,what you still didn't show
[2024-03-17T15:58:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also he just offered you a rim what's like that
[2024-03-17T15:58:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also Gabe above showing another one
[2024-03-17T15:59:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you are there only who can measure what fits
[2024-03-17T16:00:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you like to make things difficult 😁 buying 140 size 5 hole disc would be more easy
[2024-03-17T16:00:42] cihan: I'll check, I've already got the 120mm rotor and Shimano br-m375 will be delivered tomorrow. Somehow disc needs to be bent for single piston, maybe I was wrong and stock disc is also as rigid as this one and piston movement is much stronger than I think.)
[2024-03-17T16:00:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I already told you monorim sells it ,unsure if you can order it from ali
[2024-03-17T16:02:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know that brake ,one sided just pad bigger ,if you mount it good will perform better than original
[2024-03-17T16:14:19] Happy Giraffe: Titanium🌚 But also needs a spacer between frame and bearing
[2024-03-17T16:14:30] cihan: I didn't see on AliExpress. I didn't check monorim price but ordering from somewhere which doesn't calculate and charge customs fee in advance is risky. I can pay either 30% or 70%. That's upto the initiative of the officer there. That's how customs work here.
[2024-03-17T16:15:05] cihan: It has all good reviews. I'm sure I'll be satisfied with it if I can fit it.
[2024-03-17T16:15:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Local monorim shop exists?
[2024-03-17T16:15:27] cihan: I've never heard of it.
[2024-03-17T16:15:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Search on Google
[2024-03-17T16:16:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Here we have a local one
[2024-03-17T16:16:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They sell that disc for 12,7 euro
[2024-03-17T16:24:56] cihan: It's expensive but fine since only alternative
[2024-03-17T16:56:53] Rose: Hey there Johann, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-17T16:58:30] Johann Pulk: Hello! Is there a guide or tutorial of some sort for installing a vesc controller on a vsett10+?
[2024-03-17T16:59:02] puneDir: I tried with mt25 and it fucked me up
[2024-03-17T16:59:07] puneDir: I keep the distance but i cant pass
[2024-03-17T17:02:43] cihan: Somehow I always miss some messages, I'm sorry.
[2024-03-17T17:12:36] cihan: Sorry, did you recommend this to me for changing the front tire with the one you show to fit a 6 bolt rotor disc?
[2024-03-17T17:14:12] sombre_enfant: If u want to machine custom axle go ahead
[2024-03-17T17:16:17] Ion: This for 10" tire? Dropout size same as motor? Also how much
[2024-03-17T17:17:14] sombre_enfant: Yes, dropout is 125mm same as a classic 10in motor.
[2024-03-17T17:22:06] Ion: Nice, maybe want to get it for g30 front, how much is it (without tire)?
[2024-03-17T17:22:37] cihan: Unfortunately that's not possible for me.
[2024-03-17T17:23:38] cihan: I don't think so I just can read for some minutes and than read again some hours later and miss some replies probably.
[2024-03-17T17:26:07] sombre_enfant: Where u from ? If u from eu i can sell it to you
[2024-03-17T17:29:08] Ion: Yep eu, but still need to see if I wanna do front disk or keep stock 😅
[2024-03-17T17:30:49] sombre_enfant: If u go over 50kph and already have a monorim or a fork... U better use it drum is too slow at those speed

[2024-03-18T00:27:46] haku: is there a big difference in a zero 10x frame and a vsett 10 frame?
[2024-03-18T00:32:08] Paolo ⁭: Yes the deck of vsett Is much more bigger
[2024-03-18T00:32:24] NetworkDir: Suspensions Battery Controller Handlebar Are custom another things stock
[2024-03-18T00:33:33] NetworkDir: Motors, deck (space for battery much bigger) Folding clamp and stem design better General design looks better
[2024-03-18T02:56:00] haku: is this brand made by segway? or clone?
[2024-03-18T03:06:40] Ion: Definitely clone, hiboy sucks

[2024-03-18T09:30:31] puneDir: Guys my rear motor shakes after 80 kmh
[2024-03-18T09:30:37] puneDir: Like it vibrates
[2024-03-18T09:30:42] puneDir: How can i balance it
[2024-03-18T09:40:40] sombre_enfant: Same way as a motorbike
[2024-03-18T09:40:57] sombre_enfant: But on road it wont shake as much as in air

[2024-03-18T10:07:28] Alin Ciobanu: I did the 5mm rise

[2024-03-18T10:14:54] sombre_enfant: What the point of this ?
[2024-03-18T10:16:38] Alin Ciobanu: To raise everything to 5mm and use the original platform
[2024-03-18T10:17:49] Alin Ciobanu: Maybe I’ll get up again and put the 190mm
[2024-03-18T10:17:53] Alin Ciobanu: 🤔
[2024-03-18T10:19:12] Alin Ciobanu: I’m actually undecided whether to keep this frame and finish it or sell everything 🙃
[2024-03-18T10:22:46] sombre_enfant: Sell everything bro
[2024-03-18T10:22:58] sombre_enfant: If only we could put 11inch...
[2024-03-18T10:23:25] sombre_enfant: Maybe i ll check next week zero 11 arm so i do 11 inch for next season
[2024-03-18T10:26:55] Alin Ciobanu: What price could I ask for?
[2024-03-18T10:28:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Clone
[2024-03-18T10:28:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It is but hiboy can be interesting
[2024-03-18T10:31:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Stupid thing is with that,there were swiss versions of it what is different Always, didn't see this body irl but saw other kind of hiboy and two from that one was made for Swicerland and that much better battery,like Imagine one has this normal clone looking one ,other had a similar housing like the g30 original has and was bolted nice ,rest i dont remember,but was interesting
[2024-03-18T10:32:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Show that
[2024-03-18T10:32:46] Alin Ciobanu: It can be seen in the picture
[2024-03-18T10:34:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I mean the deck part not the tail part
[2024-03-18T10:35:08] sombre_enfant: Idk i had mine for 800€
[2024-03-18T10:36:09] Alin Ciobanu: That doesn’t give me any problems on the rise
[2024-03-18T10:43:54] puneDir: It does
[2024-03-18T10:43:58] puneDir: How
[2024-03-18T10:44:40] sombre_enfant: U put weight the opposite way it shake
[2024-03-18T10:50:49] puneDir: I mean how do i know which side i should put the weight
[2024-03-18T11:28:53] sombre_enfant: Same thing as when u adjust a bar in a chuck, u push oposite way half the force
[2024-03-18T11:29:34] sombre_enfant: Take the higher point go oposite way make it half of that higher point
[2024-03-18T12:22:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on why
[2024-03-18T12:23:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like did you ever changed Bearings on that , is tire mounted Correctly to not shake whole? And so on
[2024-03-18T13:31:08] puneDir: Car run over the side of the motor
[2024-03-18T13:31:58] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2024-03-18T13:35:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohhh ,than probably shape is damaged
[2024-03-18T13:36:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure it's possible to repair
[2024-03-18T13:50:59] Johann Pulk: what vesc controller should i get for a vsett 10+ dual motor? i want it to be bluetooth controlled so i can switch power profiles on the go
[2024-03-18T14:02:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say spintend and @jamessoderstrom can even help you with them He resells and made few vsett's so can tell more detailed answer
[2024-03-18T15:55:45] haku: that thing is ready to shear off
[2024-03-18T15:56:35] haku: what mini van is that anyway pretty cool
[2024-03-18T16:12:35] cihan: I received Shimano br-m375 today. It doesn't fit Ninebot f2 pro anyway. I'm not sure if it can fit with spacer. With bigger disc it will probably still rub on not rim but tire. I installed 120mm disc instead of 110mm and it works without a problem.
[2024-03-18T16:13:49] rosheee: disc spacer
[2024-03-18T16:16:14] cihan: Will it work? I'm not sure but I can need 1cm spacer.
[2024-03-18T16:20:39] cihan: I have like only 4mm between screws holding disc and fork.
[2024-03-18T16:36:53] Happy Giraffe: If its that much you also need to offset brake mount 1cm
[2024-03-18T16:44:20] Gabe Enzo: found this on the floor
[2024-03-18T16:44:27] Gabe Enzo: Took it cause interested in the motor
[2024-03-18T16:44:35] Mirono escooters: On the.. floor?
[2024-03-18T16:44:39] Gabe Enzo: In the park
[2024-03-18T16:44:43] Gabe Enzo: in a puddle
[2024-03-18T16:44:46] Gabe Enzo: it was fully submerged
[2024-03-18T16:44:55] Gabe Enzo: battery gone tho
[2024-03-18T16:46:15] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2024-03-18T16:46:36] Gabe Enzo: Wish it was a g30
[2024-03-18T16:46:39] Gabe Enzo: someday Maybe
[2024-03-18T17:16:24] haku: someday maybe ill find a trashed surron in the park too. it can happen in my neighborhood
[2024-03-18T17:37:43] Gabe Enzo: at least they were that thoughtful

[2024-03-18T19:05:30] sombre_enfant: @koxx3 hi sir long time no see, wheres smart display ? been 3 year u edging us with its comming soon just need cnc case etc... Now theres many ppl coming with alternative...
[2024-03-18T19:07:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hi ! we received the 100 first units 2 or 3 weeks ago ;) the sales are launched, but in pack with a controller. we are currently passing CE certification.
[2024-03-18T19:08:55] sombre_enfant: Nice, why with specificially with a controller since vesc is open source and many people need different setup
[2024-03-18T19:09:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ask @SibClimb 😊
[2024-03-18T19:09:40] sombre_enfant: He will gatekeep.
[2024-03-18T19:11:41] Mirono escooters: Is CE certification expensive?
[2024-03-18T19:11:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes... very
[2024-03-18T19:13:58] sombre_enfant: Did you really had to do it tho ? If it would come down retail price?most ppl dont care abt it on that niche stuff
[2024-03-18T19:17:37] sombre_enfant: Been waiting like that for a display
[2024-03-18T19:21:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for EU, it's mandatory for integration with manufacturers. it's not a question of "user don't care", it's about responsability. you can't afford to crash a company just because of a potiential issue with a product. for price, see @SibClimb. I do only tech. Rage Mechanics handle the sales part ;)
[2024-03-18T19:22:41] Mirono escooters: For united Emirates?
[2024-03-18T19:22:59] Mirono escooters: Good you do the certification
[2024-03-18T19:23:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no idea, but most countries in the world ask for certifications, especially if there is wireless communications.
[2024-03-18T19:29:41] Mirono escooters: You typed UE ;)
[2024-03-18T19:31:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah, fixed ;) yes, sorry, I meant europe ...
[2024-03-18T19:35:49] Mirono escooters: : D
[2024-03-18T19:37:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: now, my goal is to produce nicer views to display infos during races. something like this ;)
[2024-03-18T19:39:28] Mirono escooters: Who has time to look : D
[2024-03-18T19:41:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: spectators ;)

[2024-03-18T20:06:13] Happy Giraffe: Or just in general a better one?😁
[2024-03-18T20:06:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: depends what you mean by integrated, but yes, I work on a AntiTheft device. it will work with any controller, but has some special features for VESC ;)
[2024-03-18T20:07:12] Happy Giraffe: Estimated pricerange?🤔

[2024-03-18T20:16:16] puneDir: also im going to add vesc ble support to it
[2024-03-18T20:34:11] NetworkDir: Yes now beta on github i work for add options to display
[2024-03-18T20:34:55] NetworkDir: This display touchable but need library and help for adding functions like modes

[2024-03-18T20:41:06] puneDir: refresh rate is 50ms
[2024-03-18T20:41:42] puneDir: wait i can actually make it 10
[2024-03-18T20:59:40] cihan: Thanks, everything needs to be offset with this scooter. I think I won't invest more than this rotor for it. By the way I adjusted the brake without squeezing the brake lever which is advised in almost all videos I saw. Now brake is much more firm, stronger. However it's jerky. There's an area on rotor where brake pad doesn't touch as much as other areas. I'm not sure if this is because brake pad surface isn't parallel to rotor surface or because rotor surface isn't flat enough. I wish it will be fixed in time as rotor surface gets polished by pads.
[2024-03-18T21:01:18] Happy Giraffe: Just see against light/white paper that every pad has same amount of distance to disc
[2024-03-18T21:18:53] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-18T21:21:48] puneDir: Its 6c outside and i dont had anything on me I couldnt speak because of the cold lol sorry Im going to add some cool ui and animations to it Features for now Turkish airlines xd Working odometer (more stable then vesc 6.05 one) 10ms refresh rate You can connect and use the vesc tool via screens bluetooth and wifi feature Shows batt and phase amps Pretty bright suitable for sunny day rides Doesnt freezes or gets bugged for now And it costs 8-9 euros
[2024-03-18T21:23:21] puneDir: I will improve it tomorrow so i could make people who paid 150 euros to shitron ey4 cry
[2024-03-18T21:25:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure why is that or name there 🙈
[2024-03-18T21:26:04] puneDir: It had that but i deleted cuz i dont have temp sensor and it kills space
[2024-03-18T21:26:22] puneDir: <photos/photo_13696@15-03-2024_19-35-50.jpg>

[2024-03-18T21:30:46] puneDir: Do you remember my small oled xiaomi display? It was freezing if i press brake while stopping
[2024-03-18T21:30:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont mind ,but it's Pretty different
[2024-03-18T21:31:00] puneDir: I tried all bizarre combinations with this one and it didnt froze
[2024-03-18T21:31:26] puneDir: Yeah ik

[2024-03-18T21:32:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is something what you bought, logo is something that you stole basically, big difference Also you may like the logo ,but kinda pointless

[2024-03-18T21:33:13] puneDir: Yeah youre right but i kinda like the way it looks

[2024-03-18T21:34:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I like stickers, the more fun the better
[2024-03-18T21:37:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Show you example shortly what i mean, but mostly even in stickers i am picky ,like lot hate for magura ones ,since That's the only thing whats free in there box ,so you pay your money to have that shit and advertise free 😅
[2024-03-18T21:37:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Keep on trying, but we believe you did

[2024-03-19T19:15:12] puneDir: I run sensorless And i guess he does too
[2024-03-19T19:15:41] puneDir: Whats vss?
[2024-03-19T19:16:07] puneDir: Nice Where can i activate it It should launch better right
[2024-03-19T19:16:34] puneDir: Lol with openloop erpm 100 it already launches like rocket
[2024-03-19T19:17:03] puneDir: Do you know wheres that vss First time hearing
[2024-03-19T19:17:31] puneDir: Im not sure if they connected it I didnt connected because of theres no space
[2024-03-19T19:17:59] puneDir: Hmm With that new settings i shouldnt be able to spin it in air without turning by hand right
[2024-03-19T19:18:34] puneDir: Can you send that detection to me He forget to send to me (im going to copy his readings because ubox reads better)
[2024-03-19T19:19:15] puneDir: Btw how did you fixed the not turning on issue

[2024-03-19T19:27:03] Happy Giraffe: Is it that good?
[2024-03-19T19:27:24] cihan: I feel like my rim has imperfect or not true surface on where the rotor is connected. I had shuddering / jerking braking on old rotor and on new rotor too. I felt it less on old rotor because stationary brake pad was adjusted far from disc before, now it's much closer and rotor doesn't bend as much as before. How can I understand if rim surface is imperfect and where I should sand?
[2024-03-19T19:27:49] Happy Giraffe: I think with halls Im not getting full torque lol
[2024-03-19T19:28:20] Happy Giraffe: Somehow 10kmh it kicks more punch. Could be just a matter of accelerated mass tho
[2024-03-19T19:41:22] Happy Giraffe: Inertia being my 37kg bike, 3kg backpack and 90kg fatass

[2024-03-19T20:30:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also usuage off that is bad , double tap to not blink, slide type much better to use
[2024-03-19T20:31:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont remember, i am sure there is right and left brake but i dunno if there is two potmeters on it or one
[2024-03-19T20:33:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Rims lot time imperfect on this lvl, not sure if rotor holder is bad or you should move the brake sideways
[2024-03-19T20:34:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if you see Paint on rotor holder area that can be a problem
[2024-03-19T20:34:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hard to tell without seeing yours
[2024-03-19T20:34:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I just had customer who said he has brake issues
[2024-03-19T20:34:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And brake is like new , perfect pads and disc but
[2024-03-19T20:35:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2024-03-19T20:35:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So " soultion" step 1 is , find the why
[2024-03-19T20:36:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Since you there and no pics video etc cant really help
[2024-03-19T20:36:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also not really vesc related thing🙈
[2024-03-19T20:42:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe needs more tuning
[2024-03-19T20:44:09] sombre_enfant: Do you have a pic or link of one working with the adc v2
[2024-03-19T20:45:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not really,but i could ask
[2024-03-19T20:45:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you would see g30 original lever and a nutt on the right
[2024-03-19T20:46:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: First setup was with magura lever and different engine
[2024-03-19T20:47:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Second with blade and nutt lvr
[2024-03-19T21:02:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So i looked up Support both hall brake and mechanical brake input , but only one potmeter so Yeah
[2024-03-19T21:02:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also noticed something stupid
[2024-03-19T21:03:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fresh pic from spintend site
[2024-03-19T21:04:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Is that button ? Or a light,looks like second ,but that port is 1/2 wd port 🙈
[2024-03-19T21:06:35] sombre_enfant: Its single dual button.. I think theres on v2 too
[2024-03-19T21:11:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know the function ,i just say With this look, it could be a light also
[2024-03-19T21:13:11] Happy Giraffe: Just worst kinda setup, direct drive hub with largest tire there is with 140kg mass to accelerate😂
[2024-03-19T21:13:30] Happy Giraffe: Thrust required for acceleration is a lot😅
[2024-03-19T21:15:32] cihan: Thanks. I think the surface holding the rotor is not true to axle. I don't think all rotors I had were problematic. I'll paint the rotor with pen and apply very gentle brake and see which areas rub and which don't. I feel it easily when braking gently, I just don't know which part I should sand. I'm almost sure problem is related with rim. I never had such problems with any cheap bicycle, bicycle frames are probably manufactured with lower tolerance and rims are already adjusted to perfection with spokes.

[2024-03-19T21:48:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: better yes or other escooter chat, what may have users with that scooter or more common chat in scooters world . I dont say this against you ,just we are not walking next to vesc and this chat is related to that and some users may take it is unwanted info and skip reading chat Coz not related,not vesc based scooter and i cant say they are not right.

[2024-03-20T02:29:10] haku: i cant recommend it though since i havent even ran it yet
[2024-03-20T02:29:27] haku: i think 22x3 is perfect setup for burnouts
[2024-03-20T05:29:54] Ion: https://trampaboards.com/vesc-display-p-36049.html Any Infos on this? Is this new?

[2024-03-20T08:59:12] Happy Giraffe: Quite expensive the electricity there
[2024-03-20T08:59:55] Happy Giraffe: How much you pay for house electricity per kWh?
[2024-03-20T10:03:01] Mirono escooters: Fast chargers always have bad rates
[2024-03-20T10:12:51] Happy Giraffe: Even in EU we dont pay those prices (at home), freedomlandia should have it cheaper🤔
[2024-03-20T10:13:59] Happy Giraffe: Finland fucked the system by making private companies sell it so I pay like 12€/month to have the contract running and consumpion based cost is 12€ aswell😂
[2024-03-20T10:22:54] Mirono escooters: And why?
[2024-03-20T10:23:17] Mirono escooters: A: its Tesla prices, you also pay for the infrastructure B: depending on his location, energy production can be expensive I don't see the link with merika..
[2024-03-20T10:23:42] haku: not too much but this rates better milage per dollar vs gas
[2024-03-20T10:23:52] Mirono escooters: Luckily lol
[2024-03-20T10:24:37] haku: i just got home walking my dog and this crap happened. what is this E00 E06

[2024-03-20T10:28:37] Tommy ª: at least still going more fast than essential with full battery
[2024-03-20T10:32:01] haku: ill worry about it tommorow so tired 5hr drive
[2024-03-20T10:32:25] Happy Giraffe: 1980's would be better with gas haha
[2024-03-20T10:32:48] Tommy ª: casually here is more cheap use gas than electric cars lol
[2024-03-20T10:33:27] haku: gas here its $5 a gallon and that will get 15 miles
[2024-03-20T10:34:29] haku: im the type of guy who brags about being cheap and saving a buck or two
[2024-03-20T10:34:59] Tommy ª: here is 1.5€ the litter, my car does about 85km every 5l after that you have my mum car, using 20l every 100km wtf

[2024-03-20T10:48:40] haku: tesla prices ridicoulous but i like the tech. this is the only thing i would pay premium on. self steer while masturbating is a really good selling point
[2024-03-20T10:50:58] haku: would it be okay to charge my vsett overnight with that e06 and e00 code? or this thing will catch fire?
[2024-03-20T10:52:24] Mirono escooters: guess bms cutted or so? should be fine, still protect itself
[2024-03-20T10:52:28] Mirono escooters: hope batt not cooked
[2024-03-20T10:53:05] haku: hope not. we will find out in the morning when i hear fire trucks
[2024-03-20T10:53:47] Happy Giraffe: Overnight never recommended but if non flammable area then its ok I guess

[2024-03-20T10:59:38] Mirono escooters: t got a bms
[2024-03-20T11:00:16] Mirono escooters: better vsett chat, no idea if that error is when purely driven flat flat, or if something funky.
[2024-03-20T11:00:20] Mirono escooters: james may knox

[2024-03-21T14:58:11] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_13793@21-03-2024_14-58-11.jpg>
[2024-03-21T14:58:21] Tommy ª: casually mxlemming but with bemf decupling works better
[2024-03-21T14:58:54] NetworkDir: Nice And how i can make big sound with motors ?😂 Zero vector freq?
[2024-03-21T14:59:34] NetworkDir: Maybe bldc mode :D
[2024-03-21T15:00:00] NetworkDir: Just for testing not permanent using
[2024-03-21T15:00:09] NetworkDir: Best way to make high sound with motor is zvf ?
[2024-03-21T15:07:34] Tommy ª: any way to reduce chain noise?
[2024-03-21T15:07:50] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-03-21T15:09:50] Tommy ª: but.. 😭
[2024-03-21T15:19:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Home or work?
[2024-03-21T15:21:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe , partly 🤔🤔 Bit reminds me when start ic dead on a monitor, almost powers up and ... Than nothing
[2024-03-21T15:22:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How old is yours?
[2024-03-21T15:23:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Have to disassemble it to look
[2024-03-21T15:26:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need to renew and change all
[2024-03-21T15:26:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: New chain and new gears and chain should be perfect size all ways
[2024-03-21T15:27:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also rear tire Bearings and motor Bearings should be new as well to avoid movements do bad balls etc
[2024-03-21T15:27:36] Tommy ª: i did, still noisy probably just the scooter design makes it noisy
[2024-03-21T15:28:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you did all this and chain is strait,you did everything possible
[2024-03-21T15:28:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Only more you could do is play with gear sizes to gain torque
[2024-03-21T15:29:46] Tommy ª: actually is 6:1, 31kmh max and it wheelies at half thorttle slow but enough for 5ah battery
[2024-03-21T15:30:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If made for fun than good
[2024-03-21T15:31:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You could go chainless but that will lower your performance ,if you do gearer belt drive ,but does wear out more
[2024-03-21T15:32:59] Tommy ª: bruh i used a belt scooter older than mine it was a pain, slips and wear enough for replace the belt in one week actually i dont care the noise, just people says "Its too noisy"
[2024-03-21T15:33:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yep belt is like that and chain is noise on these
[2024-03-21T15:34:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But would be more shity if you had the other frame where Engine is above
[2024-03-21T15:35:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This atleast has tube body ,other is a joke 😅, And tbh this conversation should be in general🙈
[2024-03-21T15:35:27] Tommy ª: offtopic actually
[2024-03-21T15:36:09] Tommy ª: smol bearings 🤧
[2024-03-21T15:36:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Is there maybe a community or some yt fellas facing similar problem? I guessing you didn't mess or chew the cables
[2024-03-21T15:36:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah 6000 is tiny
[2024-03-21T15:36:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kugoo m4 front tire has it also
[2024-03-21T15:37:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But why you have zz?
[2024-03-21T15:37:26] Tommy ª: why not? 😭
[2024-03-21T15:37:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz its not dust protected? Maybe
[2024-03-21T15:37:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Usually they are for closed machines
[2024-03-21T15:38:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 2rs type has double sided rubber sealing on this bearing
[2024-03-21T15:38:56] Tommy ª: anyways im going to replace it in 5 or 6 months, i tried all brands and none of them lasts, it gets destroyed inside
[2024-03-21T15:40:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way this is true and one of the biggest child shoe's problem in the scooter world ,that we roll 10 cm high in ball Bearings 🙈 They ment to fail like this
[2024-03-21T15:40:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not to mention no simering on them
[2024-03-21T15:40:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Most of them
[2024-03-21T15:40:53] Tommy ª: MAN FR 😂💀
[2024-03-21T15:42:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Imagine frame you show is almost 18 yo old and now you buy most expensive scooter and you find shit ballbearings everywhere and the cheapest possible, like half euro / bearing 🙈
[2024-03-21T15:44:02] Tommy ª: actually the original bearings are 6002rs but i replaced the rear rim and it uses shitty 6000rs (with 130kg driver is a bad thing) the front still original with original bearings and no problem
[2024-03-21T15:46:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Funny ,yeah atleast he has gear ,but no skill ,also that shit was beeping like hell before felt, to not to do what he is doing
[2024-03-21T15:48:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 6002 is like,one ball wider , but can fail also ,just more time ,but mostly on all scooters, rear tire gets more weight and stress , because how you stand and wear weight point is
[2024-03-21T15:49:41] haku: 3months
[2024-03-21T15:50:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also imagine common " bunny hop" Most ppl able to put first wheel over the bump or pothole what ever ,what saves stem ,but you can be sure that rear gets a big hit if you dont jump over all shit,while this is really difficult with a heavy frame
[2024-03-21T15:50:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like with an m365 we could easy ollie sideways to high pavement from the road
[2024-03-21T15:51:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But this cant be done with g30 what has 7-8 kg lithium inside 😅
[2024-03-21T15:51:31] Tommy ª: casually i do that on everything bc shitty streets or i cant avoid it sadly the razor wheigts a bit more than 18kg, it feels anyways
[2024-03-21T15:51:53] Tommy ª: bruh my m365 from 2017 still with original bearings 😭
[2024-03-21T15:52:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And probably they are in lovely shape
[2024-03-21T15:52:22] puneDir: anybody did a electric car before?
[2024-03-21T15:52:46] Tommy ª: rear have a bit of play but still fine, front are like original and no noise
[2024-03-21T15:52:56] Tommy ª: i tried but law says no
[2024-03-21T16:01:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes, a few guys for surely did, like Elon Musk

[2024-03-21T16:03:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: any of you experienced in mantis neck?
[2024-03-21T16:05:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It really depends on what you are doing, making a new car would require lot things, so you probably mean make something electric what is not
[2024-03-21T16:07:20] puneDir: 17kw electric car with nice design and top technology from scratch
[2024-03-21T16:08:04] Tommy ª: take a smart and make it electric, more cheap
[2024-03-21T16:08:06] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-03-21T16:08:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes more easy or a Piaggio ape

[2024-03-21T16:09:48] Tommy ª: ugly diesel thing
[2024-03-21T16:10:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: how much is the weight of this?
[2024-03-21T16:11:19] Tommy ª: about 400kg or so (with the 2cyl engine inside) without the engine idk
[2024-03-21T16:11:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ok
[2024-03-21T16:11:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But heavier than

[2024-03-21T16:12:02] Tommy ª: front
[2024-03-21T16:12:09] Tommy ª: 45kmh limit
[2024-03-21T16:12:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like ape , just that counts still a moped
[2024-03-21T16:12:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This also?
[2024-03-21T16:13:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What i mean is ,you can park anywhere like a moped ,no plate ,just insurance enough
[2024-03-21T16:13:52] Tommy ª: its a moped and uses the small plate i want to take one of these and make it electric but it needs to pass inspection like regular cars, so its illegal mod it
[2024-03-21T16:15:42] Face de Pin Sucé: They keep telling me to remove sdcard and turn it on again, no other solution proposed x) No, it is unmoved since months x)
[2024-03-21T16:47:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I will dm you later and you will see,long off for here

[2024-03-21T19:39:03] haku: how much does your weight add up right now?
[2024-03-21T19:40:29] sombre_enfant: In theory im at 28.6kg with no cells, and no tintanium handlebar/pole...
[2024-03-21T19:40:43] sombre_enfant: So its really tight for battery
[2024-03-21T19:42:11] sombre_enfant: The pole/handlebar setup should be less than 1kg stock is 2.8kg
[2024-03-21T19:42:24] sombre_enfant: I put sucé lever also...
[2024-03-21T19:43:47] haku: vsett lot more heavier for your weight class. they should make a middle weight division
[2024-03-21T19:44:50] Gabe Enzo: Not as heavy as the kugoo g4
[2024-03-21T19:44:57] haku: vsett 10 will be hard to compete with the 11" and too heavy to compete vs g30s
[2024-03-21T19:46:50] sombre_enfant: Yeah i will compete with the g30 and xiaomi, its not even a idea to deal on upper category only to win again the stock dualtron smooth brainer but loose to all the other one...
[2024-03-21T19:47:53] sombre_enfant: Weight will be alright but i choosed the vsett to actually have advantage against the g30 but finally i have none
[2024-03-21T19:48:22] sombre_enfant: Next year i ll do on g30 also. I wish i had my old g30 it was all ready for that...
[2024-03-21T19:50:00] haku: i feel the same when i first competed in amateur mma. i had to cut to 155lbs but if i dont ill be competing against the big boys
[2024-03-21T19:53:18] sombre_enfant: I will do mma someday dont forget my name guys

[2024-03-21T19:58:04] Yamal: By the way, does Fastride have equipment or not?
[2024-03-21T20:03:38] sombre_enfant: Wym équipement ? Gear to protect ? Or what, anyway i dont know fastride not all french ppl who use scooter are fanboy of fastride
[2024-03-21T20:04:23] sombre_enfant: @Bradhaku on 38kg this year will be serious theres two ppl running 70h and 11" system...
[2024-03-21T20:12:05] haku: yes but on a g30 frame. that be too heavy for a vsett
[2024-03-21T20:13:33] haku: unless make a custom carbon frame for vsett but that wont be a vsett anymore lol
[2024-03-21T20:16:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What you mean? You not fat 😅
[2024-03-21T20:17:22] Yamal: I mean if it has competitors
[2024-03-21T20:21:26] Yamal: I would like about 70 h too, the truth is that the new generation of LY engines are very nice,,
[2024-03-21T20:23:25] haku: i havent tested it yet. keep getting distracted with other things. now im fixing my welder to finish my batteries
[2024-03-21T20:23:56] haku: i think mine is gen 2.
[2024-03-21T20:24:35] haku: its getting hot where i live. i really need to finish. im missing out
[2024-03-21T20:29:11] Yamal: Does anyone know what type of motor winding the weped GTS has?
[2024-03-21T20:42:04] haku: it looks like ly motors. in the ali page they show this type of motor
[2024-03-21T20:58:39] haku: do you guys have a link to a cheap china small electric car? kinda like the golf cart size ones
[2024-03-21T21:17:10] Yamal: supposedly most escooter "come with the standard winding, we don't understand how that scooter could reach 146kmh with a discharged battery, and assuming it had a speed winding, it also had too much torque, hence my question,
[2024-03-21T21:18:31] haku: no idea. thats pretty fast
[2024-03-21T21:19:34] haku: 146 kmh might be the fastest scooter ive heard of
[2024-03-21T21:19:48] Yamal: Did you say before that in the end you mount your engines on a G30 chassis?
[2024-03-21T21:20:29] haku: i wanted too if it can fit. but need alot of custom stuff lol
[2024-03-21T21:21:06] haku: also g30 has a small battery bay for 2 of those motors
[2024-03-21T21:21:12] Yamal: No, in France there are faster people,🧌
[2024-03-21T21:38:15] sombre_enfant: Its scooter weight not rider...
[2024-03-21T21:41:44] Face de Pin Sucé: 164Kmh happened last week-end on track
[2024-03-21T21:42:51] haku: whuut. thats insane. on the track? or straight away track?

[2024-03-21T22:13:06] Yamal: Are there any 30s scooters competing in France?
[2024-03-21T22:23:41] sombre_enfant: No max is 22s
[2024-03-21T22:24:28] sombre_enfant: No reliable 30s system up to day so you end up with less performance than a good 22s
[2024-03-21T22:30:45] haku: is that true?
[2024-03-21T22:43:23] Yamal: 22s18p
[2024-03-21T22:54:46] sombre_enfant: No no i always tell lies and shit im a gremlin

[2024-03-21T22:56:46] Yamal: Shull man has a 30s version just like the x12
[2024-03-21T22:58:37] sombre_enfant: Yeah but u can push way less amps
[2024-03-21T23:00:27] haku: sorry to doubt you. with all due respect. ive been fooled by your kind so many times before
[2024-03-21T23:00:27] Finn: Perfect for low kv motors
[2024-03-21T23:02:10] sombre_enfant: Bro what ? Sound racist ngl
[2024-03-21T23:02:39] haku: what do you mean. i meant french

[2024-03-21T23:32:39] Yamal: For me, that guy on that e-scooter making deliveries is a hero, he couldn't be more authentic and funky.
[2024-03-21T23:40:26] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): life goals indeed i wish power scooter users wouldn't be so demonized & punished in germany, otoh that thing looks fast enough to be a getaway scooter
[2024-03-21T23:44:19] Yamal: At the European level this is a very delicate thing, it seems that in Portugal it is somewhat calmer, but we are waiting for a European "law" that will regulate all this chaos a little
[2024-03-21T23:45:59] Yamal: For me in my city and area currently, there are more problems and fines for it center of the city that outside of it that at the moment we can make routes...
[2024-03-21T23:47:55] Yamal: And well, I find the circuits theme to be the most interesting and fun, it is just another sport and it is very physical, also an opportunity to see big beasts and meet geeks from the world.😁
[2024-03-22T00:09:25] Happy Giraffe: You forget the fact he lives in freedomlandia. He propably has a tank on his yard

[2024-03-22T01:10:05] Yamal: By the way, the hall sensors are already ready
[2024-03-22T01:12:06] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-03-22T01:14:53] haku: dam. atleast halls is easy fix
[2024-03-22T01:17:22] Yamal: Well, what I said the other day, I will remove vesc to assemble old electronics, I will pretend that my wave is pure", but it will not be, it will make a kind of little squares simulating the Reina FOC wave, which has given me so much and I have enjoyed it
[2024-03-22T01:17:27] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-03-22T01:18:07] haku: sorry wasnt paying attention to chat.
[2024-03-22T01:20:17] Yamal: In short, I leave the sine wave to set up a simulated sine wave
[2024-03-22T01:27:23] Yamal: When my children get married I will ride Trampa, Shull, Tronic X12. because to ride Flipsky I better stay still
[2024-03-22T01:37:28] Chris Culver: $100 for VESC display? You're high.
[2024-03-22T01:41:18] Chris Culver: Btw what are good Regen settings for vsett 10+ with Ubox v2?
[2024-03-22T02:13:34] haku: my neighbor got a lambo. wtf nerd.
[2024-03-22T02:13:50] haku: prolly from ali 😂
[2024-03-22T04:57:02] sombre_enfant: Yo u got that rich dawg
[2024-03-22T04:58:31] haku: i think its one of floyd mayweathers house. with all due respect they like to ball out of control
[2024-03-22T04:59:22] haku: i mean by they are boxers. dont get it twisted
[2024-03-22T05:01:19] sombre_enfant: Its a huracan its 200k its alr, not a sto
[2024-03-22T05:01:56] haku: i dont even know what it is honestly. too rich for my blood
[2024-03-22T05:03:46] sombre_enfant: Stop lyin if u in same neighborhood u in the same game
[2024-03-22T05:04:03] Yamal: More than one here is made to choose between the same car and the g30, and he chooses the g30
[2024-03-22T05:04:52] haku: naw bro. im a single dad making ends meet. for real
[2024-03-22T05:07:17] Yamal: I really prefer a good van, to be exact Volkswagen transporter/carvelle or california
[2024-03-22T05:21:16] haku: if they would make a electic van with solar roof panels. that would be gamechanging
[2024-03-22T05:21:46] haku: i would live in it
[2024-03-22T05:25:39] Yamal: your surfboard inside and conquer beaches, then your Nordic girl, it is important that she knows how to cook well and your powerful scooter
[2024-03-22T05:28:28] Yamal: The surfboard thing because it looks good in your scene, but come on if you want a quiet life, keep your powerful scooter that will only ask for brake pads and discs and with your dragons👍😁🔥
[2024-03-22T08:01:09] Happy Giraffe: Doggo😍
[2024-03-22T08:47:50] sombre_enfant: Its ok what the issue ?
[2024-03-22T08:56:18] Happy Giraffe: Previous display with more features was 400-500€😂
[2024-03-22T09:10:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is this normal?
[2024-03-22T09:10:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Very low throttle
[2024-03-22T09:20:47] sombre_enfant: But i dont understand what tf he say he just popped say that then disappeared
[2024-03-22T09:28:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on what battery you have
[2024-03-22T09:29:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Strange? This is sensorless?
[2024-03-22T09:30:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends what style you need
[2024-03-22T09:31:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: In motor setup it said sensored
[2024-03-22T09:31:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Was joking only bro 😁
[2024-03-22T09:33:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe throttle settings?
[2024-03-22T09:59:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It did in a way ,but i knew he aint that😊

[2024-03-22T10:01:17] Gabe Enzo: Relaxing scoot at the pier
[2024-03-22T10:01:32] Gabe Enzo: monorim front got loose I almost lost control on a hard turn
[2024-03-22T10:03:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Atleast nice area
[2024-03-22T10:04:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also let us not have a moment like Boondocks s1 ep4 😅🙈
[2024-03-22T10:07:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: These ppl are just kinda retards if you think over, you rather get away with a ninja 2
[2024-03-22T10:08:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also interesting that if you have Ferrari you dont go 300 all time, saying such in country where you have no speed limit HighWay is kinda stupid 🤷‍♂
[2024-03-22T10:18:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This was like this Always or started now?
[2024-03-22T10:18:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Does engine work (spin up)?
[2024-03-22T10:18:34] Gabe Enzo: ESC overheating lulz
[2024-03-22T10:18:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wrap still?
[2024-03-22T10:18:50] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2024-03-22T10:19:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than unwrap
[2024-03-22T10:37:08] Gabe Enzo: I got a flat
[2024-03-22T10:37:08] Gabe Enzo: ffs
[2024-03-22T10:42:36] Happy Giraffe: He doesnt have it bolted afaik
[2024-03-22T10:58:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ofc
[2024-03-22T10:59:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't really know on the ground I don't notice that .
[2024-03-22T12:43:05] sombre_enfant: Bro what the hell is that sock ? Also u put a filter ? Put a cart wtf
[2024-03-22T12:49:21] Yamal: and press it! airbags are usually not good
[2024-03-22T12:54:12] Yamal: It is best not to smoke! but if you smoke, smoke well!😂
[2024-03-22T13:42:06] Gabe Enzo: huh?

[2024-03-22T15:05:11] puneDir: Guys i have a question Normally my battery was dropping 3-4v with full send But now it drops around 8v 🙊 What could be the reason? Im thinking about weather (3c outside) And tire pressures (they are around 36 i guess)
[2024-03-22T15:05:56] puneDir: Both batteries working properly And its pulling the same current Just less range more v drop and less power Also vescs get hotter in less time
[2024-03-22T15:06:36] puneDir: (i was using with 35-35a way less than my batteries max) 7p gets 45a draw 4p gets 25a
[2024-03-22T15:09:31] sombre_enfant: A weld is loose.
[2024-03-22T15:10:50] puneDir: Read again Both batteries working properly
[2024-03-22T15:12:06] puneDir: <photos/photo_13801@22-03-2024_15-12-06.jpg>
[2024-03-22T15:13:13] sombre_enfant: This dont mean shit
[2024-03-22T15:17:04] puneDir: I also pulled 70a from it and balances stay same
[2024-03-22T16:05:13] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2024-03-22T16:34:42] puneDir: 20s7p
[2024-03-22T16:34:47] puneDir: total 20s11p
[2024-03-22T17:29:51] haku: reminds me of this. https://youtu.be/CLlCxMuKhCI?si=-KtEnaBe6VrhW6Di
[2024-03-22T17:31:08] haku: before cellphones
[2024-03-22T17:48:16] puneDir: <photos/photo_13802@22-03-2024_17-48-16.jpg>
[2024-03-22T17:48:16] puneDir: <photos/photo_13803@22-03-2024_17-48-16.jpg>
[2024-03-22T17:48:25] puneDir: Bigger than expected
[2024-03-22T17:49:48] haku: i want to know how this performs. very good priced vesc
[2024-03-22T17:50:12] puneDir: I will test it when i buy one more of it
[2024-03-22T17:50:32] haku: this is yours right?
[2024-03-22T18:07:06] puneDir: Yes
[2024-03-22T18:07:55] puneDir: I guess im the first one who bought it
[2024-03-22T18:12:07] haku: @marine_tugah did too
[2024-03-22T18:12:25] haku: both of you
[2024-03-22T18:14:29] haku: it looks smaller but thicker than spintend counterpart
[2024-03-22T18:18:45] Happy Giraffe: Retarded heatsink design on bottom
[2024-03-22T18:19:25] Happy Giraffe: Would make more sense if different screw placement so it could be mounted to an external box for direct air on cooling fins
[2024-03-22T18:19:47] haku: yes. agreed. that should be changed. looks like its designed for external mounted
[2024-03-22T18:20:24] Happy Giraffe: Design sucks even for that
[2024-03-22T18:20:38] haku: even if external mounted still need to custom make mounts for it
[2024-03-22T18:21:21] haku: im hoping this thing performs well atleast. very good priced.
[2024-03-22T18:22:26] Happy Giraffe: Cooling will be an issue
[2024-03-22T18:22:59] puneDir: Its bigger in both ways
[2024-03-22T18:32:06] Gabe Enzo: I got a 1500 check from the government
[2024-03-22T18:32:15] Gabe Enzo: I'm gonna finish off my entire scooter
[2024-03-22T18:32:40] Gabe Enzo: getting 2 motors and pmts and another esc, as soon as it hits my bank account. that's 1k$
[2024-03-22T18:33:29] Gabe Enzo: 26kw Xiaomi pro 2 with 11" PMT is gonna be insane I just got new handlebars for it too.
[2024-03-22T18:40:40] haku: let me know how you fit 11 on a xiomi. ive been thinking of ways for a g30
[2024-03-22T19:04:48] Gabe Enzo: Limit suspension
[2024-03-22T19:04:55] Gabe Enzo: better than no suspension
[2024-03-22T19:05:02] Gabe Enzo: only able to be done by lightweight people tho
[2024-03-22T19:05:26] haku: that sounds like fatshaming bro 😘
[2024-03-22T19:05:37] haku: im the victim now
[2024-03-22T19:07:22] Yamal: https://youtu.be/VlD2GYtD29Q?si=Tyi-I6MIo7ZKClK0
[2024-03-22T19:16:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: U are not
[2024-03-22T19:17:37] haku: how does it perform? any updates?
[2024-03-22T19:20:53] NetworkDir: What values on adc can work like curise control? Sometimes after pushing throttle and release my scooter try to push again 😐
[2024-03-22T19:36:21] NetworkDir: How i can change or see ?
[2024-03-22T19:56:28] sombre_enfant: Do you got adc module or Throttle connected with resistor ?
[2024-03-22T20:00:47] NetworkDir: No directly connected to 3.3V
[2024-03-22T20:02:50] sombre_enfant: No resistor ?
[2024-03-22T20:03:02] sombre_enfant: U got ebrake aswell ?
[2024-03-22T20:03:10] sombre_enfant: U sure its safe ?
[2024-03-22T20:26:18] NetworkDir: Yes my brake is switch not hall
[2024-03-22T20:26:35] NetworkDir: I ride 600km with makerbase with this without any problems
[2024-03-22T20:27:16] NetworkDir: My throttle min voltage 0.89V and max 2.52V
[2024-03-22T20:27:29] NetworkDir: Brake min 0V and max 3.3V
[2024-03-22T20:33:24] sombre_enfant: Alright i guess i'll do like this then
[2024-03-22T20:33:40] NetworkDir: Yes i always use 3.3V
[2024-03-22T20:33:43] sombre_enfant: And i ll put the adc module to the ebike
[2024-03-22T20:35:54] NetworkDir: Any way to fixing my problem ?
[2024-03-22T20:38:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: I didn't try yet
[2024-03-22T21:09:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Should have used shaded wire
[2024-03-22T21:11:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They give you or you have to pay😁🙈
[2024-03-22T21:12:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You not even fat
[2024-03-22T21:14:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅 I think word should be bodyshaming
[2024-03-22T21:16:11] haku: thats the word haha
[2024-03-22T21:17:46] sombre_enfant: Ye bro stop the bulk its been 2 year already
[2024-03-22T21:18:19] haku: its been 5yrs now actually haha
[2024-03-22T21:18:49] sombre_enfant: The cut will be insane
[2024-03-22T21:26:23] haku: nah. no cuts this time. im good bro i like food
[2024-03-22T21:29:21] sombre_enfant: American food is ass y all be putting shrimp in pasta with sour cream and call it a day
[2024-03-22T21:31:44] Yamal: Do you think that in these 65h 33/2 you can fix the hall sensors and change the phases, for 10awg silicone phases, is it worth it...?
[2024-03-22T21:33:05] haku: yes. why not.
[2024-03-22T21:33:27] Yamal: I'm selling the pair for €100 and it's not selling, so I'm about to do this and keep them... although I really like the new generation of LY
[2024-03-22T21:33:51] sombre_enfant: Silicone 10awg?no its not for motor insulation will break
[2024-03-22T21:34:45] Yamal: What type of phases should I buy?
[2024-03-22T21:35:13] haku: just buy the whole phase cable with halls and temp sensor wire from ali
[2024-03-22T21:35:34] sombre_enfant: The one designed for motor and wich fit in your axle
[2024-03-22T21:35:45] haku: im not a pro at motors tgough
[2024-03-22T21:36:03] Tommy ª: old washing machine cord, never fails
[2024-03-22T21:36:04] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-03-22T21:42:20] Yamal: The only thing about these engines is that they are chambered and I don't like the chambers at all...
[2024-03-22T21:46:10] NetworkDir: I use snsc dashboard cable
[2024-03-22T22:11:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you describe somewhere still gets noise
[2024-03-22T22:15:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 10 awg how
[2024-03-22T22:15:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Measure that cable you have now
[2024-03-22T22:15:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The wide part
[2024-03-22T22:17:35] NetworkDir: It's not looks noise Something try to push more duty
[2024-03-22T22:18:49] Yamal: I say 10awg because is that what the new LY engines come with? but it seems a little complicated to pass them through the motor shaft.
[2024-03-22T22:18:58] NetworkDir: With 50A 150A on vsett motor your motors get hot? I check motor body after pushing 50a and 150a for 11km its very hot i can touch for 1 seconds
[2024-03-22T22:21:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mate ,you guys were already talking this it as i read you dont use signal what is from ble ,coz of different solution, but ble would filter, while you go analog now with no filtering
[2024-03-22T22:23:51] NetworkDir: So why just this problem on ubox? On box version in 5.02 i dont see something like this
[2024-03-22T22:24:22] haku: yes. the cables also doesent pass thru the axle
[2024-03-22T22:25:05] haku: maybe you can make hole bigger but that wouldnt be safe to ride i think
[2024-03-22T22:26:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont use mks ,so no idea , what i tell you is probably the why, near this the two probably works bit different I never faced such as i wire differently and Always shaded
[2024-03-22T22:27:07] NetworkDir: Yes maybe... I ask here maybe some value or option can cause this.
[2024-03-22T22:28:03] haku: why would you want thick cables anyway. its very hard to bend
[2024-03-22T22:28:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you could look on both what values u see maybe would help to figure it out
[2024-03-22T22:29:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For more power
[2024-03-22T22:29:26] haku: i see.
[2024-03-22T22:29:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: More thick means less heat in cables
[2024-03-22T22:30:10] haku: isnt thick cables only for high amps?
[2024-03-22T22:30:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Try to use lot power in weak phases and cable plastic melts off
[2024-03-22T22:30:19] haku: gotcha
[2024-03-22T22:30:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: High amps =power
[2024-03-22T22:32:57] haku: <video_file>
[2024-03-22T22:33:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fun but also
[2024-03-22T22:34:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Printed in one piece?
[2024-03-22T22:35:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Outer result super sucè
[2024-03-22T22:35:40] Yamal: Yes, my first intention would be to prevent the engine phases from burning.
[2024-03-22T22:37:06] haku: 2 pieces
[2024-03-22T22:37:37] Yamal: Sometimes I think that I could stay as I am and mount a large heatsink or sheet of about 3/4cm of aluminum under the vesc, but in my country it is very hot in the good weather season... I don't know...
[2024-03-22T22:40:14] sombre_enfant: Maybe put on 5v with 1k 2k resistor
[2024-03-22T22:41:04] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2024-03-22T22:43:38] NetworkDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-22T22:47:05] NetworkDir: Just adc values and options
[2024-03-22T22:48:14] NetworkDir: But i think before sensorless i dont see something like this
[2024-03-22T22:48:33] Tommy ª: im the only using vesc on a computer?
[2024-03-22T22:50:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on situation, but this is still help chat
[2024-03-22T22:55:35] Yamal: 84/200 = 12fet?
[2024-03-23T00:22:59] Happy Giraffe: No need for halls with vesc👍
[2024-03-23T00:27:01] Yamal: TRUE!! but those engines are not suitable for the Tronic 250, they heat up the electronics, Tronic 250 only with 22/3
[2024-03-23T00:38:04] Yamal: No can send imagine?
[2024-03-23T00:46:20] Happy Giraffe: Isnt awg 10 quite thin for fast winding?
[2024-03-23T00:47:25] Happy Giraffe: Then would need to make awg 8 right after the axle exit😂
[2024-03-23T00:47:50] Happy Giraffe: Why dont they just make a thicker axle?
[2024-03-23T00:48:07] Happy Giraffe: People have a file at home to scrape away 1mm🌚
[2024-03-23T00:52:00] Yamal: For speed motors, larger controllers are needed.
[2024-03-23T00:53:17] Happy Giraffe: Wouldnt 300A phase already toast a 4mm2 cable?🤔
[2024-03-23T00:56:06] Yamal: ly motor solution, but of course €800/900😑
[2024-03-23T00:56:44] Yamal: cnc rim and motor issues resolved
[2024-03-23T00:59:15] Yamal: the It is true that the temperature issue is an issue to take into account at Vesc.
[2024-03-23T01:03:26] Chris Culver: Can someone point me toward 6.05 for Ubox v2 please?
[2024-03-23T01:05:04] Yamal: We can observe how in the rises and falls of temperature, perhaps you can deteriorate components, Or rather, having very high temperature peaks, even for a few seconds, but on "many occasions" they are not good for your electronics,?
[2024-03-23T01:05:37] Chris Culver: Ahh ok. Thank you sir
[2024-03-23T01:08:15] Yamal: benjamin vedder should be in this group...😔
[2024-03-23T01:09:27] Happy Giraffe: He would be spammed upon so better not😂
[2024-03-23T01:27:03] Yamal: This year it seems that even bigger planes will be seen on the circuits..

[2024-03-23T01:49:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nice that motores seams very nice why do you sell it?
[2024-03-23T01:49:13] Yamal: Naccotech performance, only suitable for large controllers with a minimum of 12 fet
[2024-03-23T01:50:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why is that?
[2024-03-23T01:50:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: They are heigh kv?
[2024-03-23T01:51:35] Yamal: First, I don't like split tires, you need to use chambers, and if you want a guarantee over time, the engine phases are somewhat thin.
[2024-03-23T01:57:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes mutch like wolf king 60v version
[2024-03-23T02:10:03] Yamal: 😂.
[2024-03-23T02:12:36] Yamal: Is like jumanji.

[2024-03-23T02:13:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes speed motors they heat up a lot
[2024-03-23T02:40:46] haku: really 33x2 heats up more? i thought it was the oposite
[2024-03-23T02:42:15] haku: gotcha
[2024-03-23T04:21:09] haku: @PaoloWu does your glitter charge all the way to 6v? i changed my mosfets and seems like im stuck at 5.4v.
[2024-03-23T04:22:36] haku: why cant i send photos to this group no more?

[2024-03-23T17:31:04] haku: lol good luck. china plays by thier rules
[2024-03-23T17:35:36] NetworkDir: Battery

[2024-03-23T20:16:33] haku: to non car people he put a supra motor on a lambo.
[2024-03-23T20:19:06] Rose: Hey there Ivan, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-23T20:20:46] haku: disgusting and impressive at the same time
[2024-03-23T20:38:22] Yamal: Are there videos somewhere of the French Slack...?
[2024-03-23T20:40:24] haku: is there one? i thought its korean
[2024-03-23T20:41:48] Yamal: it's korean, In France there is one competing this year,,,
[2024-03-23T20:43:10] Yamal: Beyond the top speed it reaches, or how many seconds it spends doing 0-100, I love the brand and what it represents.
[2024-03-23T20:43:44] haku: i havent seen one yet. looks cool in the videos
[2024-03-23T20:45:46] Yamal: NUMO
[2024-03-23T20:47:37] haku: whats that?
[2024-03-23T20:47:53] sombre_enfant: A brand constructor
[2024-03-23T20:48:04] sombre_enfant: They do for weped and slack
[2024-03-23T20:48:40] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-03-23T21:05:53] Yamal: FOC my chickens gave me today
[2024-03-23T21:06:42] haku: thats cool you raise your own food.
[2024-03-23T21:08:55] haku: love eggs. wish i can raise chickens
[2024-03-23T21:33:21] NetworkDir: On 100A discharge 29.8Ah battery pack 6-8V drop fine? I think on 120A its drop 10V Battery continues discharge and bms fine 10V drop fine for low distance like race?
[2024-03-23T21:46:03] Yamal: A few don't take up much space...
[2024-03-23T21:49:19] Gabe Enzo: yep.
[2024-03-23T21:49:28] Gabe Enzo: Gotta be careful to not trip the bms tho
[2024-03-23T21:50:03] NetworkDir: Yes
[2024-03-23T21:50:17] NetworkDir: Ok tnx
[2024-03-23T21:51:21] NetworkDir: On 100A drops 10% (8V)
[2024-03-23T21:51:24] NetworkDir: Looks good
[2024-03-23T21:52:04] NetworkDir: But fast asf acceleration very fast
[2024-03-23T21:52:58] NetworkDir: With stock motors 60-60A 160A phase for low distance (race) should fine?
[2024-03-23T21:53:29] NetworkDir: Yeah very nice
[2024-03-23T21:53:39] NetworkDir: With 5A chargers instantly
[2024-03-23T21:53:40] Tommy ª: my 2p going from 52 to 39: 😭
[2024-03-23T21:53:55] NetworkDir: I should fix adc problem
[2024-03-23T21:54:04] NetworkDir: Little bit dangerous 😂
[2024-03-23T21:54:15] Tommy ª: they disabled stickers? 💀
[2024-03-23T21:54:47] NetworkDir: I use without active balance and 0.004V diff on 1 cycles Cells looks good
[2024-03-23T21:55:31] Gabe Enzo: For 18650 that's real good.
[2024-03-23T22:29:27] Happy Giraffe: @Tommynwn Stickers here are ok but try not to spam the help chat with those, I guess your sticker rights got removed for that. Also other users need to chat more in Offtopic/Vesc topic than help so you are not the only one😁
[2024-03-23T22:30:34] Happy Giraffe: Help needs to stay relatively compact for technical/error questions so people have opportunity to check 5 messages instead of 150 messages that talk about weather and have gifs/stickers😅
[2024-03-23T22:32:13] Tommy ª: but.. i never spammed?
[2024-03-23T22:34:42] Happy Giraffe: They are not needed there😁 it's for help only and needs to have as little offtopic messages as possible
[2024-03-23T22:35:05] Tommy ª: hm, ok
[2024-03-23T23:56:07] Yamal: You have put a kind of "night mode" so as not to stream content at night! Of course, if the night is for sleeping X)
[2024-03-23T23:56:43] Yamal: :(
[2024-03-24T00:20:57] Yamal: By the way, people, have you noticed a notable difference between 70h and 75h motors, in this case speed...?
[2024-03-24T01:50:54] haku: @jamessoderstrom do you know the winding of the vsett 9+ motor?
[2024-03-24T01:51:45] haku: would it be possible to do burnouts on it?
[2024-03-24T02:37:52] haku: gotcha. theres no other options for bigger magnet motor for vsett 9?
[2024-03-24T02:38:19] haku: oh nice
[2024-03-24T02:38:34] haku: vsett stock is 30h?
[2024-03-24T06:51:22] haku: finally done most of the welds. this took a while after fixing welder.
[2024-03-24T06:51:23] haku: <photos/photo_13815@24-03-2024_06-51-23.jpg>

[2024-03-24T10:05:20] Nick: I have kind of a wierd question but how possible would it be to hook up a high power electric motor to a turbocharger for a car and hook it up to a 72v battery with a "boost" switch
[2024-03-24T10:05:34] Nick: Basically an electric turbo but way powerful and stupid
[2024-03-24T10:34:41] puneDir: Looks epic
[2024-03-24T10:53:06] haku: i wish i did 😭
[2024-03-24T10:54:52] haku: there is a video about that. a vesc powered blower/supercharger for a car. its on youtube somewhere
[2024-03-24T10:56:34] haku: thanks to @james for designing the holders. it makes it look good
[2024-03-24T11:10:17] Yamal: All is ready to fly no..?
[2024-03-24T11:11:09] Gabe Enzo: How does the generator even know how to place the circles
[2024-03-24T11:11:18] Gabe Enzo: Been thinking about it but surely there's a formula @jamessoderstrom
[2024-03-24T11:11:18] Yamal: Disturb voro motor
[2024-03-24T11:11:23] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-03-24T11:13:02] haku: just need to put bms and mount the esc. that will take another 6 months lol
[2024-03-24T11:14:10] haku: no idea but its all his wizardry programing.
[2024-03-24T11:20:03] Gabe Enzo: Why so long
[2024-03-24T11:20:47] haku: i get distracted with other stuff. like making more dragons
[2024-03-24T11:21:00] Gabe Enzo: think how good itll be when ya drive it
[2024-03-24T11:21:53] Gabe Enzo: who has a pic of 10 inch vs 11 inch
[2024-03-24T11:21:58] haku: agreed. ill finish as fast as i can.
[2024-03-24T11:22:09] Gabe Enzo: dont rush
[2024-03-24T11:22:12] Gabe Enzo: but dont be a slack
[2024-03-24T11:23:09] haku: this supposed to be done by january. welder gave me problems and shipment delays
[2024-03-24T11:23:09] Yamal: Just do ! And enyoy your e-scooter
[2024-03-24T11:23:27] Gabe Enzo: ive been planning mine for like 6 months now
[2024-03-24T11:23:31] Gabe Enzo: but so many issues here and there
[2024-03-24T11:25:21] Yamal: Where you put the controller,,?
[2024-03-24T11:26:06] haku: either in the sides or the stem mounted on a heatsink.
[2024-03-24T11:26:51] haku: i have a bigger deck im really thinking about using it bit its too big
[2024-03-24T11:30:07] Yamal: I think that on the stem or below would be fine, the bad thing about putting them on the sides is that if you fall you can break them
[2024-03-24T11:33:11] Yamal: I look forward to seeing your controller working! You will show us what figures they reach
[2024-03-24T12:40:54] Jan: You need a motor that spins up to 100'000rpm and yes this has already been done
[2024-03-24T14:43:55] Happy Giraffe: Just get a supercharger instead😁
[2024-03-24T14:44:16] Nick: I don't wanna plumb oil lines 😩
[2024-03-24T14:44:53] Nick: I wish I could just plug a big ass battery into my car and make the motor output harder acceleration
[2024-03-24T14:45:08] Nick: Is ev swapping a whole car still like 30k minimum
[2024-03-24T14:59:50] Happy Giraffe: DIY hybrid systems bit of a no-no
[2024-03-24T15:00:36] Happy Giraffe: Not sure if even legal, but if you want electric just buy used tesla😁
[2024-03-24T15:18:35] Yamal: https://youtu.be/bErhu5iDReM?si=lY-7ZSj2utLuhYnZ
[2024-03-24T15:53:51] Gabe Enzo: A turbo just adds more air into the mix so more of it explodes and less is wasted. i assume that doing that would just create diminished returns, the turbo already increases efficiency and im p sure theres nothing else to light leftover.
[2024-03-24T15:55:37] Gabe Enzo: But yeah technically you would need less movement to get the required air intake. youre essentially just making a supercharger but unlike one it would not be powered by the engine tape but a battery.
[2024-03-24T18:10:19] Rose: Hey there Nadine Eisenberg, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-24T18:52:15] Mirono escooters: <video_file>

[2024-03-24T18:53:29] haku: my welder parts came in 8 days
[2024-03-24T19:43:42] haku: heres a video about bypass bms. https://youtu.be/jnIHLyIuz2s?si=_W6lP5i4cxI_J5_h
[2024-03-24T19:49:29] NetworkDir: Lol Throttle noise and results
[2024-03-24T19:50:05] haku: what part is that?
[2024-03-24T19:56:33] Happy Giraffe: Absolute fire🔥
[2024-03-24T19:57:03] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, always idiots in every group bypassing bms telling its fine
[2024-03-24T19:57:47] haku: this was sold from factory bypassed. unreal
[2024-03-24T20:01:31] haku: if it wasnt for the battery lords. i wouldve bypass my stock laotie battery and my new battery
[2024-03-24T20:02:44] haku: i would run bypass discharge
[2024-03-24T20:03:40] sombre_enfant: Fork
[2024-03-24T20:03:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How did it feel before you noticee it broke?
[2024-03-24T20:04:40] sombre_enfant: What happened u dont have any electric brake wired ?
[2024-03-24T20:07:56] sombre_enfant: Maybe u can machine a plain fork tube
[2024-03-24T20:17:48] haku: is there a huge performance difference in 22s vs 20s?
[2024-03-24T20:22:44] haku: @Happy_Giraffe @Her0DasH is this plasma or lazer?
[2024-03-24T20:26:28] deadword: O2 Oxygen cutting is not a laser Manual cutting machine
[2024-03-24T20:27:29] haku: i see. its pretty cool you can cut metal sheets to shape witg this machine
[2024-03-24T20:27:35] Happy Giraffe: Plasma I think, electricity and Oxygen as deadwood said
[2024-03-24T20:28:22] Happy Giraffe: Even with gas powered cutting its possible to cut thick metal at ease. Like 15-40mm thick sheets😅
[2024-03-24T20:28:49] Happy Giraffe: Oxygen and acetone is hell of a drug
[2024-03-24T20:29:34] haku: oh nice. @Her0DasH showed me a video of a plasma cutter on a 3d printers extruder. very cool
[2024-03-24T20:30:57] haku: these plasma cutters make it seems cutting sheets is easy.
[2024-03-24T20:31:21] Happy Giraffe: Its very easy with proper equipment
[2024-03-24T20:31:51] haku: can cut aluminum too yea?
[2024-03-24T20:32:16] Happy Giraffe: Our school has a CN Plasma cutter but it isnt used as the school is run by idiots
[2024-03-24T20:32:30] NetworkDir: Dimensions similar with snsc fork :D
[2024-03-24T20:32:40] haku: you lucky you have access to that
[2024-03-24T20:32:43] Happy Giraffe: I think so, but alu so easy to cut you can do it even easier
[2024-03-24T20:32:52] NetworkDir: Your stem wobble very abnormally
[2024-03-24T20:33:11] NetworkDir: I hit to transit car by shitty noise of throttle
[2024-03-24T20:33:36] Happy Giraffe: I would have access if it wasnt fucked by school. Machines not serviced and teachers dont know how to operate the machine. Kinda bummer. I wish I could just do my own stuff in school instead and self study lol

[2024-03-24T20:38:20] Happy Giraffe: Dont even understand how metal can be that weak. Just calculated my new Ti axle to hold 20,000kg load lmao (15mm diameter)
[2024-03-24T20:39:17] NetworkDir: They want to broke and broke and broke for more $
[2024-03-24T20:39:27] NetworkDir: People health dont care

[2024-03-24T20:43:12] Happy Giraffe: Especially as zeros go 100kmh it should be proper stuff

[2024-03-24T21:41:38] Happy Giraffe: Could sell the other part to cover your own costs
[2024-03-24T21:43:54] NetworkDir: If you mean cnc impossible for me

[2024-03-24T21:52:55] Happy Giraffe: If you know brake disc diameter you can scale it in Fusion 360

[2024-03-24T22:03:14] Yamal: You can ask Raphael... I think the perfect length depends a little on your height, being short anyway, he also did it in Titanium I think...
[2024-03-24T22:23:49] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_13824@24-03-2024_22-23-49.jpg>

[2024-03-24T22:24:35] haku: why are the handle bars so short for racing?
[2024-03-24T22:26:05] sombre_enfant: U need it for better controll of the scooter more aero and u can sometime sit on the scooter and hit your knee cap on the ground while cornering
[2024-03-24T22:26:27] sombre_enfant: But need titanium balls too or been doing moto....
[2024-03-24T22:28:27] Yamal: Rare kelly wait

[2024-03-25T05:51:05] Yamal: Let's see if anyone knows if it really has FOC
[2024-03-25T06:00:48] haku: its all the same size even with the higher voltage and amps models?
[2024-03-25T06:01:55] haku: if your going with kelly, imo fardriver is a better choice i think ofcourse vesc is best option
[2024-03-25T06:02:36] haku: the super champion racers is this the esc they use?
[2024-03-25T06:10:34] Yamal: I haven't seen anyone else that model of controller yet, the truth is, and the ones with the measurements have no idea, fardriver look good too
[2024-03-25T06:15:44] Yamal: Vesc is the cane! I want to try many models but you need money, I still think that the one that makes a big difference in the refrigeration of vesc, It will be the one that sees the best results and also prolonged ones over time.
[2024-03-25T06:16:29] haku: get a 12fet. lot more affordable than your tronic
[2024-03-25T06:47:51] puneDir: Pcbway and jlcpcb is fine for customs

[2024-03-25T09:24:09] sombre_enfant: Nah they'll never tell about the setup
[2024-03-25T09:55:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks plasma but shit pics
[2024-03-25T09:55:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What do you mean
[2024-03-25T09:56:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Gas powered Acetilen+ oxigen and you cut 20 cm thick even just Time
[2024-03-25T09:57:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Remember wrong Plazma plus small table laser with the plasma head
[2024-03-25T09:57:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Burned into my leg for a lifetime
[2024-03-25T09:58:14] Happy Giraffe: Our school gas cutter not that powerful haha
[2024-03-25T09:58:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And that's normal🙈
[2024-03-25T10:00:54] Happy Giraffe: Sadly, no standards
[2024-03-25T10:01:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They counted nothing , also casted🙈 and ti is not an option in cheap mass production
[2024-03-25T10:01:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: ?
[2024-03-25T10:02:24] puneDir: He hit to a ford transit from behind
[2024-03-25T10:02:30] puneDir: I just maded 94 without damper
[2024-03-25T10:09:15] Happy Giraffe: Yup, 10.9 steel would be enough👍
[2024-03-25T11:03:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You mean natural gas? That's good for cutting,but not for for thick,since less heat ,it would be ages to heat up something thick
[2024-03-25T11:04:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Huge ,plasma cutters have natural gas cutter usually for manual cuts , To cut leftovers to avoid hitting the head
[2024-03-25T11:05:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also recycle companies,coz much cheaper to cut with that
[2024-03-25T11:06:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean that non should use ,just who knows to run it ,also does have there own program to make , usually not same guys make draws and run the machine
[2024-03-25T11:07:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That sounds shit
[2024-03-25T11:08:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Was about to say ,that looks like that or the shape is more like there's
[2024-03-25T11:09:21] puneDir: :(
[2024-03-25T11:09:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pretty cold for you area, now we have few days of wind so colder here ,but before next weekend we have 23 c
[2024-03-25T11:13:46] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-25T11:25:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you dont mind i add some comments, After screen turns speed red you see nothing on the video ,unsure irl ,but not good to show off. Also why the head movement cam can be saw all the time in vid ,kinda strange for me
[2024-03-25T11:37:10] puneDir: Cam is Mounted to helmet I use ls2 rapid as helmet it blocks the down view So i always have to look under so quickly (to read speed) Also screen is visible with eyes but my sjcam cant capture it But im thinking about removing that overspeed red warning (speedo will always be white) Thank you for nice comments :) now im going to remove that overspeed function
[2024-03-25T11:40:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: After riding a while you should feel speed , i never look down to check such,on my own new build unsure that i will have any or something small to read how much juice left
[2024-03-25T11:42:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I probably have to wait a bit ,before we have screen build in helmets 😁 So no need to look down
[2024-03-25T11:45:18] puneDir: Yes Like pilot hud :D Actually its possible to make Im going to make some day !
[2024-03-25T11:45:50] puneDir: I get scared of speed after 80 I just wondered how fast i can do without tank slappwr
[2024-03-25T12:05:03] sombre_enfant: No damper ?
[2024-03-25T12:09:57] Gabe Enzo: who needs a damper if you have rusty bearings
[2024-03-25T12:12:52] puneDir: No damper
[2024-03-25T12:25:01] Gabe Enzo: sometimes i forget that 50-60 can even be death on contact.
[2024-03-25T12:25:22] Gabe Enzo: even 70 you can die easily with a head on impact regardless of a helmet
[2024-03-25T12:25:43] Gabe Enzo: helmet is just to prevent you being retarded IF you survive.
[2024-03-25T12:26:24] puneDir: Yes but equipment is important
[2024-03-25T12:26:42] Mirono escooters: Motorbike gear boys
[2024-03-25T12:26:58] Gabe Enzo: My wallet is crying
[2024-03-25T12:33:09] Mirono escooters: And your mom will if you die
[2024-03-25T12:33:13] Mirono escooters: Choose wisely
[2024-03-25T12:44:02] sombre_enfant: Nah with fullface helmet u chillin
[2024-03-25T12:44:38] sombre_enfant: Bro a good helmet registered for motorbike start at 60€
[2024-03-25T13:00:50] Yamal: Helmet type moto GP THE BEST😂
[2024-03-25T13:01:29] Yamal: with aileron behind
[2024-03-25T13:06:20] Happy Giraffe: Gas I meant O2 and acetylene😁
[2024-03-25T13:17:51] haku: use a phone gps with an alarm. it beeps when you hit your target speed so you dont keep looking down
[2024-03-25T13:35:02] haku: thats was cool who won? the nami?
[2024-03-25T13:36:46] Face de Pin Sucé: No, because of small mistake they put 20 seconds penalty so he doesn't win
[2024-03-25T13:38:21] haku: i see. very cool. the way you guys lean
[2024-03-25T13:38:59] haku: ill be tryhard tomorrow while running my dog and try if i can
[2024-03-25T13:42:19] haku: nvm i have to cut my stem to even do that.
[2024-03-25T13:55:51] sombre_enfant: What mistake u can do to have penalty ?
[2024-03-25T13:56:40] haku: 20sec prolly put him in last place lol. what did he do?
[2024-03-25T14:11:11] Happy Giraffe: 20sec is a ton, did he shoot co-racers like Mr.Aladeen?
[2024-03-25T14:11:47] Face de Pin Sucé: He had a big wobble and cutted a small chicane to not fall, but because he was first and not spanish, they decided that it requires 20 seconds penalty
[2024-03-25T14:12:23] Face de Pin Sucé: I would have been okay with 2-3 seconds penalty on a track that is 43 seconds/lap, but 20 seconds was just a joke
[2024-03-25T14:14:29] Jan: You can forward the penalty to Esteban Ocon
[2024-03-25T14:19:14] sombre_enfant: Mdrr
[2024-03-25T14:19:24] sombre_enfant: Au moin il a sauvé la trott nsm

[2024-03-25T14:50:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or tool size small?
[2024-03-25T14:51:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Usually you do this with train rail version of flamecutter ,not by hand guns But saw 10 cm thick cut by hand without cut car or what ever you call it
[2024-03-25T14:56:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you want to do that even, it's not for daily riding And kinda here we go again ,if you tall you are not ment for it
[2024-03-25T14:58:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: More like the terminator
[2024-03-25T15:01:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He already has it just not using
[2024-03-25T15:01:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just said he gets scared above 80 ,so soon as he gets scared is almost the target
[2024-03-25T15:01:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2024-03-25T15:02:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also for me this still strange like 🤔 Looking at the rpm in a car to know when to shift
[2024-03-25T15:03:36] sombre_enfant: When u a begineer u do that
[2024-03-25T15:03:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You just know it feel it hear it

[2024-03-25T16:24:28] Yamal: I'm not just saying that reaching 160 on a g30 has to be the most
[2024-03-25T16:25:26] Yamal: And regarding Mizan, what was it? Now there are cool races?

[2024-03-25T17:05:00] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: But what about display itself?
[2024-03-25T17:05:39] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I got issue with my nrf51820 modules, it's doesn't flashes :C, locked flash. So I need some solution for G30

[2024-03-25T17:43:11] Yamal: Great Raphael, I'm looking forward to seeing his new creation for this season.
[2024-03-25T17:43:11] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-25T17:52:54] Happy Giraffe: No traffic laws in Turkey?😅
[2024-03-25T17:53:04] Happy Giraffe: 100kmh scooter legal?🤔
[2024-03-25T17:57:40] Gabe Enzo: fiido too.
[2024-03-25T18:11:34] sombre_enfant: Put 247mm
[2024-03-25T18:13:00] sombre_enfant: From g30 ble ?
[2024-03-25T18:20:31] Gabe Enzo: lmao guys i was replacing a clients lights with my fiido front light and it scared the shit out of me because the LIGHT has a horn built in
[2024-03-25T18:20:41] Gabe Enzo: white and ground is for the light and red and ground is for the horn lol
[2024-03-25T18:20:49] Gabe Enzo: i assumed that red was the main one.
[2024-03-25T18:28:57] NetworkDir: Makerbase with new shunts :)
[2024-03-25T18:28:57] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_13831@25-03-2024_18-28-57.jpg>
[2024-03-25T18:29:15] NetworkDir: Yeah
[2024-03-25T18:36:46] sombre_enfant: Whats the point ?
[2024-03-25T18:41:17] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13832@25-03-2024_18-41-17.jpg>
[2024-03-25T18:58:57] JPPL: Negative ramping time influêncies the time you stop acelerating till it really stops acerating
[2024-03-25T18:59:19] JPPL: It cruises for that miliseconds
[2024-03-25T19:00:47] JPPL: Natural trothle curve is my personal choice, and Also less % dead zone
[2024-03-25T19:10:35] NetworkDir: I just upload vesc nrf with modified pinouts to g30 dash
[2024-03-25T19:20:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is the difference?
[2024-03-25T19:25:27] NetworkDir: Yes similar version
[2024-03-25T19:28:56] NetworkDir: Orginal shunts less 1mohm (total stacked resistance) New shunts 1.7mohm (total R)
[2024-03-25T19:29:42] NetworkDir: And it's why current read have a problem
[2024-03-25T19:30:36] NetworkDir: Yeah i know I try with default values but same I try with 6.02 looks problem fixed After fixing broked swing arm i test again
[2024-03-25T19:33:33] NetworkDir: Yes I remember again My real currents 1/2 on mks And resistance something like 0.7-1mohms difference
[2024-03-25T19:33:33] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. NetworkDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-25T19:34:05] haku: that teverun is fast. wonder if the new nmc pouch battery has something to do with it
[2024-03-25T19:38:02] NetworkDir: It's superme with lion cells
[2024-03-25T19:38:17] NetworkDir: 7260R with pouch
[2024-03-25T19:41:05] haku: i see. gotcha
[2024-03-25T19:43:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: Oh OK so it's fixed?
[2024-03-25T19:44:45] NetworkDir: I dont test but should fix with new shunts
[2024-03-25T22:01:35] haku: <video_file>
[2024-03-25T22:01:48] haku: not today boys. sorry i failed ya
[2024-03-25T22:05:02] haku: i will commit sedoku with my katanad
[2024-03-25T22:06:42] Rose: Hey there Jer, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-25T22:08:36] Finn: Deadlift💀😁
[2024-03-25T22:08:51] Finn: "Fuck"😂😂
[2024-03-25T22:09:15] haku: im a bitch today for some reason. this is normally my 1rep max
[2024-03-25T22:09:30] Finn: Nice nice
[2024-03-25T22:09:54] Finn: Im still in the progress of learning the basics
[2024-03-25T22:10:43] haku: youtube videos arw a good place to learn it. it also depends on your body type and style. sumo or conventional.
[2024-03-25T22:11:08] Finn: I have a very good trainer with a nice training plan
[2024-03-25T22:11:41] BBC: Hai ! Im a French student and I'm currently making vesc design for myself. I might sell some but I'd have to make sure they work perfectly beforehand. Here's a picture of the current design.
[2024-03-25T22:11:49] BBC: <photos/photo_13833@25-03-2024_22-11-49.jpg>
[2024-03-25T22:11:56] Finn: He didnt believe me that i got 1,6kg of bodyfat😂
[2024-03-25T22:11:58] BBC: Haven't finished it yet.
[2024-03-25T22:12:08] haku: nice! 3 best workouts imo is squat, deadlift and benchpress.
[2024-03-25T22:12:19] Finn: I did benchpress today
[2024-03-25T22:12:23] haku: thats not bad lol
[2024-03-25T22:12:35] Finn: I only weight 55kg💀
[2024-03-25T22:12:45] Finn: With 180cm height
[2024-03-25T22:12:48] haku: i think im at 30% bodyfat lol
[2024-03-25T22:13:02] Rose: Hey there Jer, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-25T22:15:38] Jan: Wtf
[2024-03-25T22:16:05] Jan: How are you alive?
[2024-03-25T22:16:38] Mirono escooters: Fak competitor, I'm 53kg
[2024-03-25T22:17:43] Jan: Im 183cm and 81kg and i once had an infection where i was bound to the hospital for a month and couldnt eat for weeks. I lost all my weight down to 64kg and it was already considered to give me food through direct blood stream injection so i dont starve
[2024-03-25T22:17:44] haku: thats the perfect weight for racing
[2024-03-25T22:18:12] Jan: 64kg was considered critical low dangerous weight
[2024-03-25T22:18:27] Jan: 55kg how?
[2024-03-25T22:18:35] haku: for your height yea. thats crazy
[2024-03-25T22:19:19] haku: you prolly ripped to AF. abs popping out like turtle shells
[2024-03-25T22:20:15] Finn: Idk
[2024-03-25T22:20:17] Finn: 😂😂
[2024-03-25T22:20:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Half chat got hernia looking
[2024-03-25T22:20:32] Finn: Even my doctor says to me that i have to eat more
[2024-03-25T22:21:30] haku: some folks are just built that way. super fast metabolism like my son
[2024-03-25T22:22:16] haku: thats actually the ideal body type if you want to do steroids
[2024-03-25T22:22:39] Finn: Yeah i have a very fast metabolism. Nothing sticks😂
[2024-03-25T22:23:25] sombre_enfant: Thats crazy couldnt be me
[2024-03-25T22:23:40] Finn: You can see every bloodline on my hand😂
[2024-03-25T22:23:58] sombre_enfant: Bienvenue
[2024-03-25T22:24:23] Finn: 4x in a week i go doing workouts
[2024-03-25T22:24:27] sombre_enfant: Its over for you start jelking
[2024-03-25T22:24:38] Finn: 😂😂
[2024-03-25T22:28:22] BBC: Also this one should do 120v 400amp peak (26s risky and 24s rated) most likely it would do 150a continuous.
[2024-03-25T22:36:05] Happy Giraffe: That fuck came from the heart
[2024-03-25T22:37:18] Happy Giraffe: Slenderman build tree
[2024-03-25T22:37:24] haku: i dont really cus but sometimes i have too.
[2024-03-25T22:41:09] haku: @Happy_Giraffe look at this frame. mid drive.
[2024-03-25T22:41:11] haku: https://landmoto.io/pages/bikes
[2024-03-25T22:41:31] haku: very cool street looking
[2024-03-25T23:05:02] Yamal: 175-92kg strong as an oak😁
[2024-03-25T23:08:18] Finn: Will the design be stackable?
[2024-03-25T23:16:53] Mirono escooters: 0 muscles
[2024-03-25T23:17:08] Mirono escooters: Hahahaahah, saame
[2024-03-25T23:17:19] Mirono escooters: Ppl always ask do u eat enough
[2024-03-25T23:20:23] Yamal: You have the weight of a real pilot, with 18fet, two speed motors and a high discharge battery, you would be every Frenchman's nightmare!!!
[2024-03-25T23:26:04] haku: im a man of my word. here is sedoku
[2024-03-25T23:41:21] Yamal: <photos/photo_13835@25-03-2024_23-41-21.jpg>
[2024-03-25T23:42:16] haku: thats a big boy!
[2024-03-25T23:42:53] haku: very nice! what esc?
[2024-03-25T23:43:01] Mirono escooters: I would 😂😂 now I need balls to corner like them
[2024-03-25T23:44:14] haku: m50lt?
[2024-03-25T23:49:12] Yamal: <photos/photo_13836@25-03-2024_23-49-12.jpg>
[2024-03-25T23:49:24] Yamal: 👆
[2024-03-25T23:50:06] haku: what is it?
[2024-03-25T23:50:07] Yamal: Well, it's a matter of spending hours on the circuit, I would rather say...
[2024-03-25T23:50:44] Yamal: Don’t know I think molicel..?
[2024-03-25T23:50:48] haku: looks very powerful
[2024-03-25T23:51:24] haku: molicel has a lighter color. idk maybe different color in eu
[2024-03-25T23:52:06] haku: need insulator rings though.
[2024-03-25T23:52:15] Yamal: <photos/photo_13837@25-03-2024_23-52-15.jpg>
[2024-03-25T23:52:46] haku: nice
[2024-03-25T23:53:58] haku: yea i think thats the 18650 molicel. not to sure. it has a darker wraper i think
[2024-03-25T23:54:29] Yamal: <photos/photo_13838@25-03-2024_23-54-29.jpg>
[2024-03-25T23:54:51] haku: thats for a scooter?
[2024-03-25T23:55:13] haku: wow
[2024-03-25T23:55:31] Yamal: <photos/photo_13839@25-03-2024_23-55-31.jpg>
[2024-03-25T23:56:02] haku: looks clean. he should use copper for high powered packs
[2024-03-25T23:59:01] haku: life goals someday. make a battery worthy of the vesc lords
[2024-03-25T23:59:45] haku: if not i will do sedoku again
[2024-03-26T00:00:09] haku: ty. this one is 28s
[2024-03-26T00:01:57] haku: maybe. for high powered packs like this what is the best size nickel if he cant do copper?
[2024-03-26T00:02:02] haku: .3?
[2024-03-26T00:03:28] haku: i forgot they make nickel sheets. good idea
[2024-03-26T00:03:48] haku: nickel easier to cut i think
[2024-03-26T00:06:43] haku: i see. thats great
[2024-03-26T00:41:04] Gabe Enzo: still bad for resistance yeah
[2024-03-26T00:41:36] haku: if theres 3 layers. prolly the same yea?
[2024-03-26T00:42:11] Gabe Enzo: as i imagine it there would be more resistance because theres simply more layers for the electrons to go through
[2024-03-26T00:42:38] haku: also how bulky is 3 .3 nickel
[2024-03-26T00:43:00] Gabe Enzo: very. i used it for my cell
[2024-03-26T00:43:03] Gabe Enzo: 2x 0.15
[2024-03-26T00:43:06] Gabe Enzo: pretty shit
[2024-03-26T00:43:12] Gabe Enzo: shouldve used copper/
[2024-03-26T00:43:28] haku: well you can do it now with your 801d
[2024-03-26T00:43:42] Gabe Enzo: I just saw no reason not to because it was a 30a pack.
[2024-03-26T00:43:59] haku: i mean for your moli pack
[2024-03-26T00:44:00] Gabe Enzo: to\*
[2024-03-26T00:44:06] Gabe Enzo: oh yeah of course
[2024-03-26T00:44:19] Gabe Enzo: in a few hours the scheduled package arrives.
[2024-03-26T00:44:42] Gabe Enzo: its so close its in my town lol, yet they didnt move it today, assholes.
[2024-03-26T00:45:51] Yamal: By the way, I want to clarify that the things I say or the jokes I make, I say them without any bad intentions, what is life without humor? I'm just an enthusiastic newbie eager to learn. May you rest, machines!
[2024-03-26T00:46:07] haku: if you dont use copper. feel free to join me.
[2024-03-26T00:46:11] Gabe Enzo: length = resistance (in the wire sense), so logically the same applies for stacks of metal.
[2024-03-26T00:46:30] Gabe Enzo: pretty abstract thinking here but i think @james can back me up
[2024-03-26T00:47:19] haku: all i know is for spot welders. copper has the least resistance then aluminum then nickel
[2024-03-26T00:47:24] Gabe Enzo: Im leaned out.
[2024-03-26T00:47:45] Gabe Enzo: broke my heart when i realized gold isnt such a good conductor
[2024-03-26T00:48:08] sombre_enfant: Dawg is on heroin but play it off because its liquid...
[2024-03-26T00:48:13] haku: would be ballin if you spot weld gold to your moli just to flex
[2024-03-26T00:48:52] Gabe Enzo: deadass project for the future
[2024-03-26T00:49:01] Gabe Enzo: as good as nickel ya
[2024-03-26T00:49:49] haku: is it. nice!
[2024-03-26T00:49:56] haku: is it weldable?
[2024-03-26T00:50:29] Gabe Enzo: whats the best metal?
[2024-03-26T00:50:48] Gabe Enzo: its weldable if its melting point is low.
[2024-03-26T00:50:55] Gabe Enzo: or the same as copper or nickel
[2024-03-26T00:51:09] haku: why is there gold plated contacts @jamessoderstrom is it for weatherproofing?
[2024-03-26T00:53:04] Gabe Enzo: gold itself is fully immune isnt it.
[2024-03-26T00:53:39] haku: there are manmade chemicals that can mess with it. but i think its nature proof
[2024-03-26T00:54:26] haku: like if you have a gold grill and you drink lean. that thing will melt it
[2024-03-26T01:05:05] Gabe Enzo: Amazing analogy for the situation
[2024-03-26T06:18:56] Happy Giraffe: Kinda ok ish looking thing but let's say if their claims are true
[2024-03-26T06:23:07] haku: you can prolly make a better frame than that.
[2024-03-26T06:39:53] Happy Giraffe: Frame building is very hard to do properly. Right now I could make one but it wouldn't be straight and might not have the proper geometry. For building it would need jigs to hold it etc etc think out the process completely. If you are interested in this stuff check "Paul Brodie" on YouTube
[2024-03-26T06:40:01] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-03-26T07:08:13] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2024-03-26T07:08:44] Happy Giraffe: The deathstare😂 I always pretend not to see cops so they think I didnt spot them and ride always that slow
[2024-03-26T07:09:20] haku: try and catch me stare
[2024-03-26T08:23:24] BBC: Yes
[2024-03-26T08:23:46] BBC: Fr4 but could use ims
[2024-03-26T08:34:52] Yamal: Morning people, I am selling 2 60h engines 22/3 for €400 in case anyone is interested, greetings
[2024-03-26T09:16:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: What performance/current do you expect ? Do you have experience with power board design ?
[2024-03-26T10:10:03] Oreo huzky: Bro this dosent even make sense are the cells connected via Bluetooth?
[2024-03-26T10:11:57] Gabe Enzo: That's just the overall size without welding
[2024-03-26T10:12:09] Oreo huzky: Oof
[2024-03-26T10:12:22] Gabe Enzo: that site is helpful to an extent.
[2024-03-26T10:12:36] Gabe Enzo: When James releases his generator itlll be better
[2024-03-26T10:36:01] sombre_enfant: Why he would tho ?
[2024-03-26T10:46:59] Gabe Enzo: Make it paid.
[2024-03-26T11:01:41] Happy Giraffe: Ti axle done🌚 Calculations said it holds 20,000kg before deformation so should be enough for bicycle😅
[2024-03-26T11:02:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Site name will be gatekeeper.com 😀
[2024-03-26T11:06:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Only true if he is small also
[2024-03-26T11:07:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Most off all sports like this have small and weightless drivers
[2024-03-26T11:08:15] sombre_enfant: Bro what the matter if one out of all ppl can pay it then ressel the file... Not worth it to sell a tool like that when u use it for your own buiseness
[2024-03-26T11:08:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Where is your friend?
[2024-03-26T11:08:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There should be a guy cutting your head off afterwards 😅🙈
[2024-03-26T11:12:49] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13843@26-03-2024_11-12-49.jpg>
[2024-03-26T11:12:55] Gabe Enzo: Totally forgot. You can tell I'm not a software guy.
[2024-03-26T11:13:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁😁
[2024-03-26T11:16:08] sombre_enfant: Dont seems strong enough
[2024-03-26T11:17:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Funny ,i just meet police yesterday around 1 am Fucker Standing near the car , he was in shit place to see ,but i didn't came from the main road ,so i was not fast ,but bottom leds were on the scooter what police doesnt really like I passed him slowly while starring eachother 🤣🤣🙈 but didn't wanted anything
[2024-03-26T11:18:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I did that ages earlier
[2024-03-26T11:19:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I still dont understand ,why an elefant needs a bike 🤷‍♂
[2024-03-26T11:22:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way its like thingy ,files have a licence not to resell but till ppl dont get in trouble.....
[2024-03-26T11:26:14] Gabe Enzo: oh my fucking god Ups is so rough
[2024-03-26T11:26:17] Gabe Enzo: Every spacer is cracked.
[2024-03-26T11:27:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What spacer?
[2024-03-26T11:27:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Never had any probs

[2024-03-26T11:31:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So far the most feared i sent was painting to Germany with dpd
[2024-03-26T11:33:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That had pretty much foam inside the boxes and around the pics and double box, dpd tells that in main sorting centers use conveyor belt stuff and packs need to survive 1,5 m free fall 🙈🙈🙈
[2024-03-26T11:36:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Need to repair or reorder and not use ups

[2024-03-26T14:38:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 20000 kg is elephant safe , bit more than 3 times could hold a males weight
[2024-03-26T14:59:52] puneDir: <photos/photo_13850@26-03-2024_14-59-52.jpg>
[2024-03-26T15:00:10] puneDir: Just remembered walking is also fun
[2024-03-26T15:08:37] Gabe Enzo: The pro 2 can hold a total of 90 cells vertically with spacers. sadly with my combo I'll only be using 88. Still plenty space left for wiring. @TherealLizardDoggo 92-94 easily possible with some 3d planning but it'll look dirty.
[2024-03-26T15:14:35] Gabe Enzo: Without spacers it is 100% possible to do 20s5p with the Xiaomi pro 2. Which is fucking awesome. That's literally G30 with rails.
[2024-03-26T15:30:16] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13851@26-03-2024_15-30-16.jpg>
[2024-03-26T15:46:37] cihan: 12km/h walking?
[2024-03-26T15:47:41] puneDir: 7.2
[2024-03-26T15:47:45] puneDir: Not long but fun
[2024-03-26T15:54:17] cihan: I adjusted the front brake and it's really tight now, I realised I don't nerd hydraulic since it's really strong and I think I can lock front tire or break stem if I pull the lever strongly however there's a wobble issue. Wobble is not caused by stem folding mechanism but because of the part just above the wheel. It was also addressed on some ninebot f2 pro review videos. I think this is the reason why I have a jerky brake. I can't modulate the brake. I can either brake very lightly or very strongly to prevent that jerky braking. I'm adding some videos to show amount of wobble. It's like 2.5mm wheel wobble back and forth. And the rotor disc movement from left to right when wheel is turning is only 0.1mm peak to peak which is I think should be tolerable. So how should I get rid of that jerky braking?

[2024-03-26T16:28:42] Gabe Enzo: Is the G30 deck stem the same dimension's as the pro 2 stem?
[2024-03-26T16:29:01] Gabe Enzo: It would be great to transfer the enclosure in the future.
[2024-03-26T17:01:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How much does the device cost ?

[2024-03-26T19:40:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,it can be however not fully useful, rubber shows if not in middle , usually disc also And if disc even bent making no sound while spining with hands is different than power spining on high rpm
[2024-03-26T19:41:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not fully
[2024-03-26T19:41:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Back in time we made an adapter to be able to mount xiaomi handlebar on g30 body

[2024-03-26T20:01:16] Gabe Enzo: The BMS i have has a heatsink on BOTH SIDES....... im now unsure if itll be safe to install while touching the cell
[2024-03-26T20:01:27] Gabe Enzo: it has fets on both top and bottom and metal top and botto
[2024-03-26T20:01:54] Gabe Enzo: actually wait it should never heat up, its 230a cont. I suppose it can hug the cell then.
[2024-03-26T20:14:02] Mirono escooters: Touching.. cell?
[2024-03-26T20:14:06] Mirono escooters: Put isolation under? 😂
[2024-03-26T20:16:40] Gabe Enzo: heat wise i mean
[2024-03-26T20:16:55] Mirono escooters: Isolation
[2024-03-26T20:17:05] Gabe Enzo: What kind.
[2024-03-26T20:17:08] Mirono escooters: You can hold a flame under resin plates and put finger ontop
[2024-03-26T20:17:31] Gabe Enzo: would that not stress the mosfets on the top then?
[2024-03-26T20:17:40] Gabe Enzo: mosfets on bottom will be radiating heat into the frame
[2024-03-26T20:17:47] Gabe Enzo: yet the ones on the top will radiate where?
[2024-03-26T20:18:48] Gabe Enzo: theyll be touching the heatshrink that will have the cells inside
[2024-03-26T20:21:24] Mirono escooters: If your BMS is that oversized I wouldn't even bother xD

[2024-03-26T20:37:43] Gabe Enzo: per 300w thats fine actually with dual
[2024-03-26T20:38:22] Finn: Yeah
[2024-03-26T20:38:27] Finn: will be hella fun
[2024-03-26T20:38:36] Gabe Enzo: those motors will never blow unless you let a fatass on your scooter
[2024-03-26T20:38:46] Finn: yeah
[2024-03-26T20:38:54] Finn: maybe ferrofluid but then it will get too expensive
[2024-03-26T20:39:04] Gabe Enzo: i let a fatass on my 300w 72v and he killed it in 5 min
[2024-03-26T20:39:16] Gabe Enzo: jej
[2024-03-26T20:39:41] Mirono escooters: It's not that expensive considering it's worth
[2024-03-26T20:39:56] Gabe Enzo: the ferrofluid will cost more than the frame
[2024-03-26T20:40:17] haku: amazon
[2024-03-26T20:40:31] haku: grin tech sells there.
[2024-03-26T20:43:15] Finn: I have my sandblasting and powder coated in white
[2024-03-26T20:43:27] Finn: it will look stealth afd
[2024-03-26T20:43:53] Gabe Enzo: your scooter will look stock as fuck
[2024-03-26T20:43:56] haku: thats nice!
[2024-03-26T20:44:19] haku: how much powdercoating cost there?
[2024-03-26T20:44:47] Finn: idk tbh
[2024-03-26T20:44:58] Finn: im still searching one who will do it
[2024-03-26T20:44:58] cihan: Ahh, I thought you meant scooter, sorry. I bought it for 200 ₺ with coupon on n11 about 3 months ago.
[2024-03-26T20:45:30] haku: i want to do it mine too since my frame is so square it will look good in m1abrams desert camo
[2024-03-26T20:46:01] haku: and i live in the desert
[2024-03-26T20:46:26] cihan: I thought he meant the scooter. :) I bought it for like 14-15 usd from a local seller in Turkey.
[2024-03-26T20:48:09] haku: maybe waste of money since its a disposable frame
[2024-03-26T20:48:42] cihan: I wish I had a lathe but I have no space for it in apartment. I lack space for everything. I would enjoy truing surfaces and making things I need.
[2024-03-26T20:50:17] haku: i would love one too. ive been eying some ali ones waiting for an oportunity
[2024-03-26T20:50:40] haku: a mini lathe
[2024-03-26T20:51:18] haku: and cnc

[2024-03-26T22:07:55] haku: no idea but its sinewave
[2024-03-26T22:08:10] haku: is it really? wich model?
[2024-03-26T22:08:25] Gabe Enzo: should be fine for nickel i guess.
[2024-03-26T22:08:39] Gabe Enzo: basically 0.1 only yup

[2024-03-26T22:08:56] Gabe Enzo: it probably cant even weld a double nickel sandwich
[2024-03-26T22:09:24] Yamal: and the latest modern ones, their new electronics
[2024-03-26T22:10:31] haku: weped should use vesc but i guess they dont want tgier customers frying thier esc with bad parameters
[2024-03-26T22:13:45] cihan: Thanks, good equipment is always nice to have and joy to use but I don't want to pay more than 100 USD since I'll probably make only one battery in next 5-6 years. I'll never need more than 6A from each cell. Some tables I found on internet claim 0.2 mm is necessary for 6A. I couldn't find the table shared here before. Do I really need 0.2mm?

[2024-03-27T11:53:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its the most common there since that's the origin of it
[2024-03-27T11:54:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And asi mods made by upgrade that bitch long time for now ,he sells packs With mounting stuff and all wires modded
[2024-03-27T11:56:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In mine you would see dual vesc ,had to modify box to fit and has external heatsink But still need to modify charging port cover and make a new cap where cables enter coz totally stupid by factory

[2024-03-27T12:30:45] cihan: What is deck width of ninebot g30?
[2024-03-27T12:30:55] cihan: I mean inner width.
[2024-03-27T12:32:47] cihan: I also have a question about using vesc controller with the BMS on battery. I have very limited space and I won't be forcing the battery to the limits so you can consider I'll never ride it to battery cut off. Will I have problems?
[2024-03-27T12:35:16] cihan: I also wonder if g30 is the best choice for cheap, reliable, moderately strong frame and big deck scooter for VESC or are there better options for cheap? I don't want to sell Navee n65 but I just opened the deck for the first time today and yes it's small.))
[2024-03-27T12:38:31] Gabe Enzo: G30 best.
[2024-03-27T13:03:11] Yamal: Same Vsett..?
[2024-03-27T13:10:19] cihan: Is thermal glue strong enough to hold bms and controller? I would like to place controller and bms on top of each other. One glued to the bottom (when scooter is sitting upside down) and and one glued to the top (on deck cover). Is this possible? @jamessoderstrom
[2024-03-27T13:19:26] cihan: Thank you. They won't be touching each other but they will be located close. Navee deck is even smaller than I made an estimation when watching battery change videos. Now I have a spare JK BMS, I couldn't fit it. :) I'll order smallest JK BMS which is 40A and enough for me and will keep 150A for future. I also consider Makerbase 84100HP since it's small. There's no way I can install 84200HP. Or I can use 75200 I already have. I liked having Bluetooth connection on board about 84100HP. What's your opinion? And I also want to use stock battery since it's in good condition. I can either use stock battery with it's own BMS or get a JK. Will 84100HP burn mosfet if battery cuts off?
[2024-03-27T13:19:58] puneDir: Dont use jk silver one
[2024-03-27T13:20:17] puneDir: Also 84100 is 100x better than other ones (i have one for sale if youre interested) (in turkey) (sealed box)
[2024-03-27T13:21:05] cihan: Are they bad? The 150A one I bought before is black.
[2024-03-27T13:21:35] puneDir: Silver box ones burn randomly for no reason
[2024-03-27T13:24:58] cihan: Unfortunately smallest black one is bd6A20s10p and it's same size as the one I bought - B1A20S15P - and I won't be able to fit it.
[2024-03-27T13:31:34] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-27T13:43:22] Happy Giraffe: Just bolt the controller tight against frame with thermalpaste
[2024-03-27T13:44:09] Happy Giraffe: Thermal glue transfers heat worse and isnt as efficient as needs thicker layer. Also removing esc will become pain
[2024-03-27T13:53:08] cihan: Thank you. Surface of Makerbase 84100HP is grid. Which one do you think transfers more heat? Filing grid and making surface plain and applying thermal paste to whole controller surface or leaving the grid and applying thermal paste to only higher areas of the grid? I cannot make an estimation but I think I won't have heat dissipation problem since I'll use controller at maximum 1200W and it won't extend 10 minutes.
[2024-03-27T13:53:26] Paolo ⁭: Easy 0.2 copper weld

[2024-03-27T13:55:32] Gabe Enzo: What welder
[2024-03-27T14:00:48] Paolo ⁭: Nahh
[2024-03-27T14:01:50] Gabe Enzo: How does that work
[2024-03-27T14:02:03] Gabe Enzo: doesn't it need to turn into an alloy before it touches the cell
[2024-03-27T14:02:14] Gabe Enzo: It's gonna snap no? copper is so weak
[2024-03-27T14:12:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's your opinion 🤷‍♂ Body is not made bad And also not a toy like lot dualtrons Mass producing different stuff doesnt help when non is perfect 🤷‍♂
[2024-03-27T14:14:38] Jan: The motivation behind using Ninebot MAX G30 as a platform boils down to its original concept. It was developed as a rental scooter to take heavy abuse. It is a lot more sturdy than most scooter which makes it perfect for tuning applications. It is quite small in size but the deck can let you carry up to 120cells 21700
[2024-03-27T14:15:50] Jan: We have people doing G30 builds in this community https://t.me/g30mod
[2024-03-27T14:16:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda like why 🤷‍♂🙈
[2024-03-27T14:17:19] Gabe Enzo: why dont you weld it in the same spot
[2024-03-27T14:18:06] Gabe Enzo: like the 2 spikes on one singular cell
[2024-03-27T14:19:25] Gabe Enzo: i dont understand why that welds.
[2024-03-27T14:37:34] Gabe Enzo: Is there a way to have rear suspension with 11 inch tyres with the G30?
[2024-03-27T14:37:56] Gabe Enzo: does everyone just use no suspension?
[2024-03-27T14:37:56] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-27T14:43:50] cihan: I would use it to fix controller and BMS without screw in case I can't have a groove to screw but James recommended placing BMS on top of battery. And I guess I can somehow use old controller groove for the new controller.
[2024-03-27T14:52:02] sombre_enfant: No vsett dont got single swingarm stuff...
[2024-03-27T14:54:28] cihan: Is the part about studiness valid for all g30 versions? Current version being sold in Turkey is g30e II.
[2024-03-27T14:55:44] sombre_enfant: Yeah its good just slow motor
[2024-03-27T14:56:40] Jan: I use this one as my base

[2024-03-27T14:58:01] Jan: Now
[2024-03-27T14:58:41] cihan: Some versions of JBD are marked as li-ion and some are lifepo4. JK BMS had support for all lithium types for all models. Should I strictly choose lithium ion model when shopping for JBD BMS? There are also 10-17S models and 6-21S models. Is there a certain model which has better quality than the others? I still cannot estimate how many cells I can fit in future. 20S can let me have 100 cells inside deck. But I can also choose 18S6P to fit a few more cells.
[2024-03-27T14:59:34] Gabe Enzo: what scooter?
[2024-03-27T15:00:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I guess you mean tread

[2024-03-27T15:01:26] cihan: It looks nice but I would hit every little bump on the road with such low deck. In fact I also have similar problem with navee n65 too but I wouldn't prefer lowering the deck for the roads I ride on.
[2024-03-27T15:01:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Gluing together,not a good idea from several sides
[2024-03-27T15:01:33] cihan: Navee n65.
[2024-03-27T15:03:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Choose what's marked with li ion ,better ones hard to define coz lot fact can effect why its the best for you
[2024-03-27T15:04:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: First decide what you want basically not bms ,
[2024-03-27T15:06:14] cihan: Yes, I mean thread.
[2024-03-27T15:07:02] cihan: I cannot really decide because I didn't model the space and exactly know how many cells I can fit. There was an app people were sharing the design. What's that app?
[2024-03-27T15:08:03] Yamal: Where is the factory?
[2024-03-27T15:08:26] Yamal: 130kmh? Bull g30😁
[2024-03-27T15:08:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There are more than one ,good ones not free
[2024-03-27T15:09:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also join suggested chat and you find lot example off overbuilds
[2024-03-27T15:10:31] Jan: 136-(140), need better roads for this
[2024-03-27T15:12:13] Gabe Enzo: what brakes are those?
[2024-03-27T15:13:03] Jan: Magura MT7&MT8 with Brakestuff 160mm discs
[2024-03-27T15:15:52] Gabe Enzo: not to brag but i can code that in C
[2024-03-27T15:16:02] Gabe Enzo: haha
[2024-03-27T15:18:50] sombre_enfant: Ninghbo
[2024-03-27T15:20:00] Yamal: Near nami factory
[2024-03-27T15:27:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What front brake do u have and btw too much power
[2024-03-27T15:27:19] cihan: Suggested chat?
[2024-03-27T15:27:24] Happy Giraffe: Its kinda failed design to start with
[2024-03-27T15:27:50] cihan: Because of navee n65?
[2024-03-27T15:28:03] Happy Giraffe: If you can grind it smooth it would also need to be done precisely or you leave uneven pressure for thermal paste
[2024-03-27T15:28:28] Happy Giraffe: If you have that vesc with no flat surface to cool from
[2024-03-27T15:29:50] cihan: So you mean that grid surface design is a flawed design?
[2024-03-27T15:33:20] puneDir: Zoom hydro :D yes some nice power Enough to make burnouts with flat tire
[2024-03-27T15:33:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Be careful on the rim and aren't zoom stock ?
[2024-03-27T15:35:14] Yamal: I suppose you will have speed motors, a discharge battery and what controller?
[2024-03-27T15:36:32] puneDir: Stock
[2024-03-27T15:39:00] sombre_enfant: Spintend 85200
[2024-03-27T15:40:33] Jan: We have all our projects tracked with parts lists and links here: https://jrev.group/
[2024-03-27T15:41:05] Jan: https://jrev.group/projects/jrev-projects/jrev-ninebot-max-g30-20s-002/
[2024-03-27T15:41:52] Jan: 3 ongoing internal project at the moment ^^
[2024-03-27T15:42:04] Jan: 2 Announced and 1 Unannounced
[2024-03-27T15:42:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_13864@27-03-2024_15-42-54.jpg>
[2024-03-27T15:42:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_13865@27-03-2024_15-42-54.jpg>
[2024-03-27T15:43:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: Anyone tried to connect this box from. Blade to vesc?
[2024-03-27T15:45:21] sombre_enfant: Where the track gt2 ?
[2024-03-27T15:46:43] NetworkDir: You should have a correct parameters for fixing this :) What tool can measure this shunts without fail
[2024-03-27T15:47:28] Jan: Also listed and in the works now
[2024-03-27T15:47:54] Jan: 1x GT2 1x G2 1x G30
[2024-03-27T15:48:07] Jan: G30 project could take until next year maybe
[2024-03-27T15:49:38] cihan: I found a JBD BMS model which has only 10mm height. That's perfect for my need.
[2024-03-27T15:52:55] Yamal: 👍nice
[2024-03-27T15:57:03] Happy Giraffe: Well how are you gonna make it cool itself to scooter body?😅
[2024-03-27T16:17:05] cihan: I thought passive cooling by heat dissipated to deck space could be sufficient but not sure.)
[2024-03-27T16:50:44] Yamal: Gt2-160kmh..?
[2024-03-27T16:57:44] cihan: In fact I have an option to cut the deck cover and place the radiator surface slightly outside and seal around the controller with silicone. But it will add some more effort and I won't be able to find cover if I want to do something else in future.
[2024-03-27T16:58:30] cihan: I like that radiator facing outside, ninebot f2 pro has it and it never exceeded 48 degrees until now under load and sun
[2024-03-27T16:58:41] Happy Giraffe: It is if not retarded design with fins making surface not smooth😁
[2024-03-27T17:00:54] cihan: Maybe I just stick a big high grit sandpaper on the table and gently rub the controller radiator against sandpaper to have even surface before attaching it.
[2024-03-27T17:01:13] puneDir: I didnt looked so detailed but i think that heatsink is removable
[2024-03-27T17:04:52] Happy Giraffe: That might be an option, I wonder if heatsink is even put on wth thermal paste😁
[2024-03-27T17:05:24] Jan: Yes
[2024-03-27T17:05:56] Yamal: Also 85200?
[2024-03-27T17:06:01] Jan: No
[2024-03-27T17:06:25] Jan: Its over 20S
[2024-03-27T17:07:07] sombre_enfant: Ask spintend the modified 85200
[2024-03-27T17:07:22] Jan: We already have the necessary controllers
[2024-03-27T17:07:53] Yamal: Fardrive
[2024-03-27T17:08:20] Jan: No
[2024-03-27T17:08:28] Jan: Stuff will be announced soon
[2024-03-27T17:11:26] haku: your g30 is the reason i want to build one. its very well done
[2024-03-27T17:14:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The g30 chat by Jan
[2024-03-27T17:14:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or you didn't read him
[2024-03-27T17:15:01] Yamal: I kidding
[2024-03-27T17:16:48] Ion: @Happy_Giraffe what's your opinion on the bafang ultra (g510, m620). For an ebike build
[2024-03-27T17:18:24] haku: sir wu. can you please do a video on a pull test with this method. i really want to know how copper sticks.
[2024-03-27T17:26:35] haku: what does this mean? bad or good?
[2024-03-27T17:43:01] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/wloqOzi5LJs?si=RQQW2VaRqSDtRcPK
[2024-03-27T17:44:05] Yamal: I find something like this more interesting to prepare than a g30.
[2024-03-27T17:48:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sus like mantis amd stem lock also
[2024-03-27T17:50:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Love you guys 🚨but chat in general pls❗️
[2024-03-27T17:51:16] cihan: I just noticed now, thanks.
[2024-03-27T17:54:10] Steven: 😂🤦‍♂️
[2024-03-27T17:56:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hurts two times 😁
[2024-03-27T18:20:22] Happy Giraffe: Gotta ask my buddy
[2024-03-27T18:22:52] cihan: Is there any benefit in getting higher amperage BMS while 40A will be sufficient for me? I'm about to place an order for this one but I couldn't be sure if it has active balancing. Could someone please help? Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! US $9.00 50%OFF | Built-In Bluetooth Smart BMS 7S 8S 10S 13S 14S 16S 17S Lithium Battery Protection Board 24V 36V 48V 60V Li-ion LifePo4 Balance https://a.aliexpress.com/_EJO1jWZ
[2024-03-27T18:23:39] Ion: It's also 1000w rated, but it's actually frame mounted like a stock ebike, not a bottom bearing mount
[2024-03-27T18:23:50] Ion: And has torque sensing
[2024-03-27T18:38:50] Gabe Enzo: dude thats 200 for one
[2024-03-27T18:39:11] Gabe Enzo: thats insane. i think ill go with some generic hydraulics instead.....
[2024-03-27T18:39:25] Gabe Enzo: how do you wire ebrake to the lever???
[2024-03-27T18:40:40] Gabe Enzo: my ass is not paying 400.
[2024-03-27T18:40:40] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-27T18:41:00] haku: small scooters are cool too. the portability of it. and its more challenging to make it fast. big scooters are just easier to put bigger components
[2024-03-27T18:42:42] Mr.Mou: Any idea why it gets so noisy at start? Dead hall sensors?
[2024-03-27T18:42:50] puneDir: Free energy
[2024-03-27T18:44:30] Gabe Enzo: just calculated i spent 1200 on my scoot so far, not including wasted money
[2024-03-27T18:44:36] Gabe Enzo: the rest of the shit ima order is 1200
[2024-03-27T18:44:39] Gabe Enzo: so 2400 total
[2024-03-27T18:44:57] Gabe Enzo: thats about 3k usd
[2024-03-27T18:45:11] haku: dont think about it. haha
[2024-03-27T18:45:24] haku: pretend you got robbed
[2024-03-27T18:45:31] Gabe Enzo: my ass made an excel spreadsheet
[2024-03-27T18:46:00] Gabe Enzo: waiting patiently for that 2k to arrive on my bank account
[2024-03-27T18:46:25] Gabe Enzo: then i can finish this once and for all and just enjoy my goddamn scoot
[2024-03-27T18:46:40] puneDir: im installing tractor tires to zero
[2024-03-27T18:46:43] puneDir: 90 65 6
[2024-03-27T18:46:49] Gabe Enzo: lmao
[2024-03-27T18:47:42] Happy Giraffe: Are you sure, you mean the new M635?
[2024-03-27T18:48:36] puneDir: Hope it has good grip
[2024-03-27T18:48:40] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-27T18:49:24] haku: good for burnouts
[2024-03-27T18:50:56] puneDir: Its bad?
[2024-03-27T18:54:29] haku: no idea.
[2024-03-27T19:02:10] Happy Giraffe: Check phase and hall connectors (then redo motor setup and remember to choose halls if it doesnt automatically want to use them)
[2024-03-27T19:05:07] Ion: M620 is frame mount, M635 is bottom bracket (like bbshd) but torque sensing
[2024-03-27T19:08:50] Ion: <photos/photo_13867@27-03-2024_19-08-50.jpg>
[2024-03-27T19:12:51] Gabe Enzo: fighting the urge to dig into my scooter after taking adderall
[2024-03-27T19:12:57] Gabe Enzo: Not happening.
[2024-03-27T19:14:13] haku: whatever you taking i need it. i cant find the motivation to work on mine
[2024-03-27T19:14:38] haku: all the fire died
[2024-03-27T19:14:39] Gabe Enzo: dont they give out adderall like candy in america?
[2024-03-27T19:14:47] haku: they do
[2024-03-27T19:14:50] Happy Giraffe: Torque sensor nice if throttle is illegal. My torque sensor from Erider started to give random pulses to 70% throttle so I had to disconnect it
[2024-03-27T19:15:35] haku: my neice was prescribed it but i told her mom to find another option
[2024-03-27T19:15:36] Happy Giraffe: Not sure tho what are those torque sensor specs on power input needed and output voltage to be suitable for vesc setup
[2024-03-27T19:15:47] Gabe Enzo: Its really helpful if its actually needed.
[2024-03-27T19:16:19] Happy Giraffe: I wouldnt run mid drives with a cassette in rear, only 72v single speed
[2024-03-27T19:21:12] Jan: Yesy discs are about 110 each and 612 levers 250 each
[2024-03-27T19:21:32] Gabe Enzo: you think its unsafe to use cheaper brakes?
[2024-03-27T19:22:06] Gabe Enzo: how do you mount e brake on a mechanical device?
[2024-03-27T19:24:12] Happy Giraffe: Just get another throttle for regen brake and use Magura MT5😁
[2024-03-27T19:24:55] Gabe Enzo: Me ages ago: im gonna have to make a good scooter so i dont have to spend that much money on a car''
[2024-03-27T19:24:57] Gabe Enzo: me now;
[2024-03-27T19:24:58] haku: spintend spinny has regen so you dont need the regen wire
[2024-03-27T19:25:00] Happy Giraffe: Or as you are in Ireland maybe you can find some second hand Hope brakes cheap as they are made in UK
[2024-03-27T19:25:13] Gabe Enzo: mech brakes are death trap arent they
[2024-03-27T19:25:19] Gabe Enzo: at 20kw?
[2024-03-27T19:25:27] Gabe Enzo: need hydralic?
[2024-03-27T19:25:42] Happy Giraffe: Hope brakes🌚 They are the best hydro brakes on the planet
[2024-03-27T19:25:42] Gabe Enzo: what exactly makes hydraulic so much better???
[2024-03-27T19:25:54] Gabe Enzo: its just pads after all
[2024-03-27T19:25:57] Gabe Enzo: whats the differenced
[2024-03-27T19:26:05] haku: less maintenance and adjustments
[2024-03-27T19:26:13] Happy Giraffe: Amount of pushing power as its hydraulic pressure instead a shity cable
[2024-03-27T19:26:56] Gabe Enzo: no way to mount 22x3 on pro 2 so im buying @roscheeee 's front fork and bolting it to the back
[2024-03-27T19:26:59] Happy Giraffe: So even if rotor is dirty and wet you still have some braking power
[2024-03-27T19:27:06] Gabe Enzo: pricey solution but i get to keep my front monorim
[2024-03-27T19:27:33] Gabe Enzo: i neeeed 11 inch 26kw pro 2 NOW
[2024-03-27T19:27:42] Happy Giraffe: Tried to make some titanium axles for front monorim today and snapped a M6 tap in half😂
[2024-03-27T19:27:57] Gabe Enzo: dont mind my spam, haku knows whats up
[2024-03-27T19:28:04] Gabe Enzo: addy side effect heh
[2024-03-27T19:28:16] Gabe Enzo: im grinding through the coding project
[2024-03-27T19:28:30] Gabe Enzo: im sick of being dragged down by these outstanding assignments
[2024-03-27T19:28:41] Gabe Enzo: Work hard now to relax larer
[2024-03-27T19:28:41] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-27T19:29:20] haku: do something with that focus and energy like workout
[2024-03-27T19:29:47] Mr.Mou: Ok, thanks 🙏
[2024-03-27T19:30:08] haku: i remember when i was young coked out and benchpressing the whole night.
[2024-03-27T19:30:25] haku: good ol days. now im old and fragile
[2024-03-27T19:31:45] Gabe Enzo: Old age doesnt start till you 55.
[2024-03-27T19:31:46] Happy Giraffe: For the motor setup use 750w outrunner settings
[2024-03-27T19:31:49] Gabe Enzo: u brainwashed
[2024-03-27T19:31:50] haku: bitch tits is what i got actually
[2024-03-27T19:32:16] Gabe Enzo: i remember back when i did coke i could walk through an alleyway with 100 criminals in it and say fuck it
[2024-03-27T19:32:25] Gabe Enzo: absolute menace.
[2024-03-27T19:32:41] Gabe Enzo: 400$ of coke in my blood.
[2024-03-27T19:33:00] Gabe Enzo: this is why i dont care how much i spend on this new hobby, whatever it is, its better than what it was before
[2024-03-27T19:33:03] haku: being young with no responsibilities but yourself is the best. enjoy it
[2024-03-27T19:37:48] Gabe Enzo: i got 30 assignments hehe, i wish.

[2024-03-27T21:44:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Money Will never come back ,while plesure while you scoot is priceless

[2024-03-27T22:05:42] haku: @Happy_Giraffe you might want to build one of these. https://youtu.be/zg4JiEdYUCU?si=1k211aa22NEjuroi
[2024-03-27T22:12:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: That bag is bigger than the scooter 5l?
[2024-03-27T22:18:11] NetworkDir: Should 5L but wide and deep
[2024-03-27T23:25:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: To. Mutch
[2024-03-27T23:54:19] Happy Giraffe: I think M635 very different from bbshd
[2024-03-27T23:58:31] Happy Giraffe: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O610byVzFuI&pp=ygULYmFmYW5nIG02MzU%3D
[2024-03-28T00:00:19] Mirono escooters: It doesn't have active balancing, only jkbms has. You don't need active balancing. Anything over 30ma from Daly is plenty And LLT has 160? 100? Whatever, more then enough And no, no point going higher amp BMS. Except if you don't like heat near cells, but just isolate
[2024-03-28T00:07:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Pov your controller cuts off during cop chase
[2024-03-28T03:12:28] cihan: Thanks a lot :)
[2024-03-28T03:15:52] cihan: I recently realised that even well adjusted low quality xiaomi brake with 120mm disc can lock front wheel , it's way more than what I need. I think hydraulic has better response time and better modulation. That's what makes hydraulic stop in shorter distance. Otherwise mechanical brake is also very very strong, I just feel so.
[2024-03-28T09:54:33] NetworkDir: What vesc version are you using ?
[2024-03-28T10:50:12] Happy Giraffe: Thats a small wheel so less force required to lock it and also low speeds. Locking up wheel also not good as you need the precise feeling of the brake. On 29" bikes even the maguras feel weak with 203mm rotors and best pads there is because of the wheel size😅
[2024-03-28T11:02:54] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters did you say double 6 awg for 360a?
[2024-03-28T11:07:36] Mirono escooters: Ionno, math time
[2024-03-28T11:08:59] Gabe Enzo: I actually don't know. can you point me with the right direction?
[2024-03-28T11:36:06] Happy Giraffe: 360A?🌚
[2024-03-28T11:52:21] cihan: Yes, wheel size matters. But mechanical is not junk by any means. The time it takes to apply enough braking force is just longer on mechanical. I think main loss of thick bicycle tires is when you need to slow down and speed up again. I read some researches some time ago and when the road isn't perfect thin, high pressure road bicycles aren't so much better than a 2 inch tire. But 2 inch tire becomes really disadvantageous if you speed up and slow down often.
[2024-03-28T12:33:06] Gabe Enzo: I want no heat issues whatsoever. it is better to assume everything to be constant.
[2024-03-28T12:34:11] Gabe Enzo: 15000mah Fast charge Molicel P30A powerbank soon
[2024-03-28T12:34:41] Gabe Enzo: With 3A PCB. Will be great for my laptop with fast charging.
[2024-03-28T12:55:45] Happy Giraffe: Its not junk if theres sunny weather and you ride low speeds. If wet/ice/snowy weather and disc has some dirt on it the mechanical loses all power
[2024-03-28T12:56:10] Happy Giraffe: -25°c mechanical cable would just freeze up and kill me😂

[2024-03-28T13:46:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can someone explain what this means (me inglesh its knot burry god)
[2024-03-28T13:50:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's kinda like badly translated deep thought, Like biking is more than travel ,but kinda advertisement
[2024-03-28T13:52:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Biking to more travel than regular travel ? I think they just had trouble on Google translate hahh
[2024-03-28T13:53:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Biking is more than just travel
[2024-03-28T13:53:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Take it like this
[2024-03-28T13:53:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Same goes to scooting
[2024-03-28T13:53:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe they meant cycle of life hh
[2024-03-28T13:54:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We dont just scoot to travel,we scoot and build em coz it's fun
[2024-03-28T13:56:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't they had a deeper meaning 😭
[2024-03-28T13:58:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Try to avoid collision ahha (ok I'll give it a try)
[2024-03-28T14:18:29] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-03-28T14:18:41] Mirono escooters: Loading screen advice 🤣
[2024-03-28T14:24:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Oblivion loading screen advice ahah
[2024-03-28T14:25:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: There is a lot more mispronouncing in the manual
[2024-03-28T14:33:41] Mirono escooters: Haha yeah
[2024-03-28T14:34:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Normal
[2024-03-28T14:34:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Read daly bms description
[2024-03-28T14:34:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Clearly tells who ever wrote or translate that had zero english knowledge and zero knowledge around bms
[2024-03-28T14:37:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: They let the Chinese equivalent of chat gpt to write it
[2024-03-28T14:40:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It would be better than this probably 😅
[2024-03-28T15:29:25] Gabe Enzo: I made a mini model bcz i kept losing focus when imagining the wiring.
[2024-03-28T15:29:38] Gabe Enzo: idk why I'm like this today
[2024-03-28T15:30:44] Gabe Enzo: Drawing a schematic would be too complicated, and im not touching any 3d software.
[2024-03-28T15:38:44] cihan: I didn't think about it, you're right. I really appreciate it if you still keep riding at - 25. :)
[2024-03-28T15:43:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: His Finnish
[2024-03-28T15:44:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mostly they are in hoodie till -10 or so
[2024-03-28T15:47:11] Gabe Enzo: Some guy just said I charge too high and someone else he knows can do it cheaper. I told him to go to that guy then?
[2024-03-28T15:47:30] Gabe Enzo: Apparently the person he knows changes 2 solid tyres for 30
[2024-03-28T15:47:43] Gabe Enzo: that is such a blatant lie. 15 a tyre my ass.
[2024-03-28T15:48:10] Gabe Enzo: Thing is if he asked nicely, I would've actually done it for 30. But now he can go suck a dick.
[2024-03-28T15:50:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 30 what ?euro? For 2 solid on m365?
[2024-03-28T15:51:08] Gabe Enzo: Yeah LOL
[2024-03-28T15:51:11] Gabe Enzo: for installation.
[2024-03-28T15:51:25] Gabe Enzo: I can tell he's lying. no one in their right mind would charge 15 for such hard work.
[2024-03-28T16:02:03] puneDir: <photos/photo_13873@28-03-2024_16-02-03.jpg>
[2024-03-28T16:02:24] puneDir: Hope it wil not end up in gore group but
[2024-03-28T16:02:29] puneDir: Longest stem
[2024-03-28T16:03:26] Happy Giraffe: Easy to tell him to go for his services then
[2024-03-28T16:03:52] Happy Giraffe: He probably too broke to pay 5$ more for tire service
[2024-03-28T16:21:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sorry was on the phone
[2024-03-28T16:23:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In the shop price for one is 25,36 euro And there is a price difference when you buy tire there or else
[2024-03-28T16:24:51] Gabe Enzo: Here I can guarantee it costs 70 in the shop.
[2024-03-28T16:24:53] Gabe Enzo: This is Ireland
[2024-03-28T16:24:58] Gabe Enzo: These prices are normal.
[2024-03-28T16:24:59] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-28T16:25:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 1 or 2?😁
[2024-03-28T16:27:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont mind ppl who wants solid to pay the price of work, and i also dont mind that they pay the price in ride experience and possible future battery issues 😁
[2024-03-28T16:27:18] Gabe Enzo: 1.
[2024-03-28T16:27:30] Gabe Enzo: I'll Google it
[2024-03-28T16:27:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need bigger handlebar also
[2024-03-28T16:30:21] Gabe Enzo: No mention anywhere , so I just emailed Loco scooters and asked them.
[2024-03-28T16:30:28] Gabe Enzo: They're the main scooter repair place for IE
[2024-03-28T16:31:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Shops dont like to share such detailed shit from all sides
[2024-03-28T16:32:49] Gabe Enzo: Ill be so surprised if they charge less than what I charge. 50-60 depends if friend or not.
[2024-03-28T16:32:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also its not how it works usually, there is some with dedicated prices and rest in work hour
[2024-03-28T16:33:11] Gabe Enzo: 50 friend price 60 normal price.
[2024-03-28T16:33:19] Gabe Enzo: and I include the tyre and tube.
[2024-03-28T16:33:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, from my side ,i am picky
[2024-03-28T16:33:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont mount such
[2024-03-28T16:33:32] Gabe Enzo: how much do you charge?
[2024-03-28T16:33:34] Gabe Enzo: o
[2024-03-28T16:33:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I send you to somewhere
[2024-03-28T16:33:56] Gabe Enzo: Engineer friend?
[2024-03-28T16:34:00] Gabe Enzo: or what
[2024-03-28T16:34:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For nobody
[2024-03-28T16:34:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For friends i explain its shit , they believe me
[2024-03-28T16:34:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I usually talk everybody out
[2024-03-28T16:35:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think if you lazy ass to check pressure weekly atleast and most of small scooter flats are from this ,than you should not even scoot
[2024-03-28T16:35:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅😁😁🤣
[2024-03-28T16:37:03] puneDir: Its already so big
[2024-03-28T16:37:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also for friend like this, who is geek enough to have issues like that , i tell him to visit me or the shop and we Will do it, also for some kids and woman we do this
[2024-03-28T16:39:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But soon as you hit the road you need to be responsible with your ways , doesnt matter how you go
[2024-03-28T16:50:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How do you lengthen the stem ?
[2024-03-28T16:50:57] puneDir: <photos/photo_13874@28-03-2024_16-50-57.jpg>
[2024-03-28T16:51:11] puneDir: Box looks like shit but its actually pretty high quality
[2024-03-28T17:15:45] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13875@28-03-2024_17-15-45.jpg>
[2024-03-28T17:16:48] Gabe Enzo: I realized the welds holding the stem will add an extra 3mm. Whoops.
[2024-03-28T17:18:57] Gabe Enzo: I can compensate by putting the BMS up there, it's not as fat as the escs.
[2024-03-28T17:30:51] sombre_enfant: Tf u need to shorten it bro
[2024-03-28T17:36:13] sombre_enfant: I have same really good
[2024-03-28T17:37:10] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_13876@28-03-2024_17-37-10.jpg>
[2024-03-28T17:38:48] Happy Giraffe: Really narrow handlebar not really stable😅
[2024-03-28T17:39:25] sombre_enfant: 620 mm is enough imo
[2024-03-28T17:40:04] Happy Giraffe: Is it 620? 700 would be kinda nice I think. Heck I pressfit+welded 50mm on my handlebar to make it 800😅
[2024-03-28T17:40:41] sombre_enfant: 700 on a scooter is a bit too huge if u dont have a wide body
[2024-03-28T17:40:42] Mirono escooters: Bike is diff story tho
[2024-03-28T17:40:55] Happy Giraffe: Im a big boy
[2024-03-28T17:41:04] sombre_enfant: On bike yeah u like to have 720 even if u not a giant
[2024-03-28T17:41:25] puneDir: same but zero has long asf handlebar already
[2024-03-28T17:41:34] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi felt alright after extending handlebar
[2024-03-28T17:41:44] puneDir: Just the pipe isnt big enough
[2024-03-28T17:41:50] Happy Giraffe: You mean wide?
[2024-03-28T17:41:51] sombre_enfant: Too much momenteum at the speed we ride... And u standing up
[2024-03-28T17:41:57] puneDir: Yes
[2024-03-28T17:42:18] puneDir: I have extender and im tall
[2024-03-28T17:42:21] puneDir: This is best height
[2024-03-28T17:42:54] Happy Giraffe: Kinda if people ride pulling the bar. Long stem poles are issue sadly.
[2024-03-28T17:43:39] Happy Giraffe: Proper joint mechanism on pole bottom and titanium pole will be🔥
[2024-03-28T17:44:27] Happy Giraffe: Or even beefier alu pole, seems manufacturers really want to save the 1€ on material and make it all break too easily
[2024-03-28T17:52:11] sombre_enfant: Thats what i have
[2024-03-28T18:01:38] deadword: Hello, I will use the G30 screen for the vesc 75100. Will it work if the throttle and brake are connected to the screen, via vesc?
[2024-03-28T18:02:31] Gabe Enzo: Uhh I'm pretty sure not so. @kawaiinekololis the creator of the project will know.
[2024-03-28T18:03:05] Izuna 生活: Yes it will. That's the point of the project.
[2024-03-28T18:03:38] Gabe Enzo: Does the off button just turn off the screen?
[2024-03-28T18:16:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's not the same hahah how much version they have of the same product hahah
[2024-03-28T18:17:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_13877@28-03-2024_18-17-22.jpg>
[2024-03-28T18:35:33] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-03-28T18:44:48] deadword: .
[2024-03-28T18:44:49] haku: i have a 780
[2024-03-28T18:44:53] deadword: 🙏
[2024-03-28T18:58:14] haku: genuine question. what vesc can power this?
[2024-03-28T19:00:15] Happy Giraffe: 3shul 1400🤔
[2024-03-28T19:00:34] Happy Giraffe: Thats just plastic on the phase cables😂
[2024-03-28T19:01:39] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2024-03-28T19:04:18] haku: lol. i think this is electric f1 motor
[2024-03-28T19:05:34] Happy Giraffe: Alibaba version of it maybe
[2024-03-28T19:07:47] haku: im sure.
[2024-03-28T19:08:36] yoann tsobanoglou: Hello, anyone using vesc-Uart script with raspberry for vesc display? And if so, has anyone figured out why vesc id twitches on screen? Is that a bug or some mis configuration on my part.
[2024-03-28T19:13:42] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom koxx / Francois Deslandes @kawaiinekololis You know about his issue?
[2024-03-28T19:44:47] Happy Giraffe: Laotie ti30 5600w being sold for 700€🤔
[2024-03-28T19:45:14] Happy Giraffe: My stupid ass would want to rice and upgrade it to hell and back
[2024-03-28T19:48:56] haku: naw i rather get it brand new for that price
[2024-03-28T19:49:29] haku: i got mine on bangood for 700
[2024-03-28T19:49:31] Happy Giraffe: If its only lightly used it would be better so atleast it doesnt have any factory flaws haha and hasnt burned yet
[2024-03-28T19:50:09] haku: with china scooters you never really know.
[2024-03-28T19:50:28] haku: well everything from china is a gamble and i love playing it
[2024-03-28T19:50:53] haku: i have that ali gambling itch
[2024-03-28T19:52:32] haku: im not gonna lie though brand new ti30 for 700 is one helluva deal.
[2024-03-28T19:54:40] Happy Giraffe: I would love to make my own frame but dont have the space and time. Would need a dedicated month for just planning and slowly building that
[2024-03-28T19:55:35] haku: thats the best option. your custom frame made to spec
[2024-03-28T20:01:13] Happy Giraffe: Maybe one day, right now skills, time and tools not enough
[2024-03-28T20:01:50] haku: dude you have all that. you just need materials
[2024-03-28T20:03:14] haku: your lucky you have all the tools. here i have to make mine
[2024-03-28T20:28:22] Happy Giraffe: Nop, need to make and build frame jigs and all kind of tools to have it perfectly square etc. No room for error😅 Tho my scooter would have 16" offroad tires😁
[2024-03-28T20:28:40] Happy Giraffe: Pls no
[2024-03-28T20:29:01] Happy Giraffe: If you want a mill, just save up for a decent used one
[2024-03-28T20:30:07] Happy Giraffe: School sells some of the lathes with digital displays etc for 1000$ so you will find somewhat similar deals there if you just look around. They weigh 2-3ton and can do every material easy😁
[2024-03-28T20:36:47] Mr.Mou: I've redo the motor setup with the same settings as before and it seems again OK, it still does some of the noise, but it's much smoother now. I've used the DD HUB MOTOR (~6kg)
[2024-03-28T20:37:25] Mr.Mou: <video_file>
[2024-03-28T20:37:48] haku: i think made with petg with 5 walls and solid infill this will be a good choice lol
[2024-03-28T20:38:51] Mr.Mou: You mean to use "Large outrunner ~2kg" and increase max power loss under override to 750W?
[2024-03-28T20:39:29] haku: also rainbow filament would make it mill aluminum
[2024-03-28T20:55:56] Happy Giraffe: Lol cant tell if you serious or not🤣
[2024-03-28T22:31:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This man had a lot of problems with weped I see that they aren't that good of a company. https://youtu.be/ulOk2Etz5YA?si=twhITN-ybZQf28-9
[2024-03-28T22:34:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: In 2019?
[2024-03-28T22:34:28] haku: thise guy has alot bigger problems if he can shell out 10k for a scooter
[2024-03-28T22:34:35] haku: 2023 when i got mine
[2024-03-28T22:35:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He got the scooter broken and more problems
[2024-03-28T22:35:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: U are from USA right?
[2024-03-28T22:36:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: In eu u have taxes
[2024-03-28T22:36:20] haku: yessir! no taxes for me 700 delivered to my door
[2024-03-28T22:37:11] haku: i shouldve got the whole stock and resold it
[2024-03-28T22:38:43] haku: <photos/photo_13881@28-03-2024_22-38-43.jpg>
[2024-03-28T22:38:59] haku: im so proud of this purchase
[2024-03-28T22:39:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is there any git
[2024-03-28T22:39:27] Yamal: I followed Ringo's case, it's a chore to spend so much on an e-scooter and have it arrive with problems and then the brand doesn't want to take charge, soon after I bought a dt x limited, although currently it still has the weped sonic x
[2024-03-28T22:40:23] NetworkDir: For 700$ looks cheap
[2024-03-28T22:40:28] NetworkDir: At least 60H motors
[2024-03-28T22:40:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have a raspberry pi zero2 w
[2024-03-28T22:41:15] Yamal: Apparently Mínimotors works very well in America, in terms of shipping, spare parts and after-sales services, weped is a "cool" brand but they still don't sell nearly as many units and they don't have as much stock of spare parts.
[2024-03-28T22:41:27] haku: i got more than $700 worth of fun on it
[2024-03-28T22:41:47] NetworkDir: 60V 38.4Ah Dual motor With very bad quality for battery and frame but 700$ Good for learning scooter mechanics and burning xD
[2024-03-28T22:41:59] NetworkDir: Yeah you can use for testing and learning
[2024-03-28T22:42:02] haku: now im putting 70h and 350a battery on it
[2024-03-28T22:42:13] NetworkDir: Lol i hope stem dont snap
[2024-03-28T22:42:30] haku: hope not. if it does parts are so cheap
[2024-03-28T22:42:34] haku: and abundant
[2024-03-28T22:43:10] NetworkDir: This frame shit but with somethings you can more safer
[2024-03-28T22:43:25] NetworkDir: Like put screw on folding mechanism
[2024-03-28T22:43:57] haku: i put a bunch of hardened steel bolts and screws
[2024-03-28T22:44:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: 50h not 60h
[2024-03-28T22:44:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: Es19 is 60h
[2024-03-28T22:44:43] haku: what is es19 do you have a link
[2024-03-28T22:44:43] NetworkDir: Also remember using thread locker on screws :D
[2024-03-28T22:45:07] haku: i am laotie brand ambassador
[2024-03-28T22:45:28] haku: make laotie great again baby

[2024-03-28T22:46:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: Laotie now is ANGWATT
[2024-03-28T22:46:37] haku: is it really. good to know
[2024-03-28T22:47:52] haku: if you buy these scooters really need some upgrades.
[2024-03-28T22:49:03] NetworkDir: Oh negative trail ☠️
[2024-03-28T22:49:14] NetworkDir: Stock zero 10x trail better than crap
[2024-03-28T22:49:57] haku: i dont know anything about trails honestly. what about trail for ti30?
[2024-03-28T22:51:44] yoann tsobanoglou: https://github.com/mark99i/vesc-display-install?tab=readme-ov-file
[2024-03-28T22:52:29] NetworkDir: https://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2020/04/steering-trail.html?m=1
[2024-03-28T22:54:06] haku: is this good bad or ugly?
[2024-03-28T22:54:37] haku: it looks pretty straight.
[2024-03-28T22:55:55] Gabe Enzo: that front sus looks Sus
[2024-03-28T22:57:16] haku: for 700 everything is sus.
[2024-03-28T22:57:20] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13884@28-03-2024_22-57-20.jpg>
[2024-03-28T22:59:35] haku: can you explain how you connect these in series
[2024-03-28T23:00:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: Thanks
[2024-03-28T23:00:49] haku: no one can answer this question about the trail? its good then
[2024-03-28T23:01:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is the diference in New 75100 V2? Filters?
[2024-03-28T23:02:04] Yamal: I think it's perfect….
[2024-03-28T23:02:38] haku: good to know. thanks
[2024-03-28T23:03:00] Yamal: seeing the path they take to draw the line between the shaft and the mast,,,
[2024-03-28T23:03:15] Yamal: but no idea,,,
[2024-03-28T23:05:08] Yamal: The truth is that the geometry of each model is very interesting.
[2024-03-28T23:07:09] haku: the look of this scooter is so 2019 though. if i can find a different frame thats adfordable i would use that
[2024-03-28T23:07:21] Yamal: Nami viper for example is a little behind, in the field it may do a good job, but otherwise it is not the most stable by any means.
[2024-03-28T23:07:27] Gabe Enzo: With a double 6awg wire.
[2024-03-28T23:08:07] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13885@28-03-2024_23-08-07.jpg>
[2024-03-28T23:08:17] haku: nice. how many in series is the long battery? and the wide one?
[2024-03-28T23:08:28] Gabe Enzo: pretty simple honestly, idk why others don't do this.
[2024-03-28T23:08:35] Gabe Enzo: 11s is internal.
[2024-03-28T23:08:40] Gabe Enzo: external 9s.
[2024-03-28T23:08:54] Gabe Enzo: I would've done 20s10p but I didn't want the scooter to get wider.
[2024-03-28T23:09:11] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Unlogical
[2024-03-28T23:09:14] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: 10+10 ok
[2024-03-28T23:09:21] Gabe Enzo: No difference.
[2024-03-28T23:09:35] haku: welcome to bro engineering
[2024-03-28T23:09:40] Gabe Enzo: I wanted to make use of the internal space.
[2024-03-28T23:09:55] Gabe Enzo: And I couldn't do 10p external because it would ruin my look, I need the scooter to be slim
[2024-03-28T23:10:05] Gabe Enzo: I was debating to drop a P, but 7p is kinda lame.
[2024-03-28T23:10:13] haku: where will the vescs go?
[2024-03-28T23:10:37] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13886@28-03-2024_23-10-37.jpg>
[2024-03-28T23:10:47] Gabe Enzo: 50mm spacer will enclosose all of this
[2024-03-28T23:11:21] Gabe Enzo: Everything is perfect so far.
[2024-03-28T23:11:21] haku: thats some bro engineering. everything so tight
[2024-03-28T23:11:36] Gabe Enzo: Yeah I'm talking to the millimeter here. Such a thing has never been done before.
[2024-03-28T23:12:01] Gabe Enzo: I just want a pro 2 that's a g30 killer, that's all.
[2024-03-28T23:12:08] haku: your bms is huge
[2024-03-28T23:12:08] Gabe Enzo: jej
[2024-03-28T23:12:22] Gabe Enzo: the peak of the cell is basically the constant of the BMS.
[2024-03-28T23:12:40] Gabe Enzo: Zero overheating issues, ever. Motors will be the same. ESCS should handle it just fine.
[2024-03-28T23:12:49] haku: what peak 350?
[2024-03-28T23:13:23] haku: you will have a hard time running these cells at 45a. everything eill get hot
[2024-03-28T23:13:47] Gabe Enzo: The cell will be able to output 360a constant. The BMS can do 230a constant. 575a peak. (never heats up)
[2024-03-28T23:13:56] Gabe Enzo: It is impossible to peak for that long on a scooter, you will crash into a wall
[2024-03-28T23:14:12] haku: 360 constant what?
[2024-03-28T23:14:20] Gabe Enzo: 45x8
[2024-03-28T23:14:23] Gabe Enzo: 360a
[2024-03-28T23:14:51] haku: cant wait to see this badboy.
[2024-03-28T23:15:02] Gabe Enzo: some people say the p42a can only do 30a with no ventilation but it doesn't matter anyway, it's impossible to find a way to peak for that long, even with 30a LOL
[2024-03-28T23:15:16] Gabe Enzo: im making this scooter able to survive a cop highway chase
[2024-03-28T23:15:27] Gabe Enzo: cause you will catch me dying before I give the cops my 3k scooter
[2024-03-28T23:15:30] haku: 40t and p42 has similar performance
[2024-03-28T23:15:46] Gabe Enzo: I'll be jetting 160kmh or so and I'll lose them.
[2024-03-28T23:15:54] Gabe Enzo: and the 11inch tyres will be super safe
[2024-03-28T23:16:14] haku: this i want to see. 11" on a xiomi
[2024-03-28T23:16:30] Gabe Enzo: Again, something never done before. Idk why people don't take up challenges.
[2024-03-28T23:16:31] haku: need atleast 70h
[2024-03-28T23:16:40] Gabe Enzo: 60h X2.
[2024-03-28T23:16:46] Gabe Enzo: I'm so light It doesn't matter
[2024-03-28T23:17:09] haku: daym boy. you on that engineering mindset
[2024-03-28T23:17:18] haku: dont let the fire die
[2024-03-28T23:18:31] Gabe Enzo: Hahaha yeah
[2024-03-28T23:18:39] Gabe Enzo: been in this engineering mindset since a kid
[2024-03-28T23:18:49] haku: i want you to figure out how to mount an 11" before i mess with my g30. im on that china mindset
[2024-03-28T23:20:53] haku: or i might just get one of those vsett 10" motors.
[2024-03-28T23:21:12] haku: 11 would be great tgough
[2024-03-28T23:22:59] Gabe Enzo: JREV front suspension forks, will be mounted onto the rear via bolts, and metal sheets will be stacked accordingly so the motor will fit. Using JREVS front sus kit for 100, I avoid buying 2x monoshit sets, which will be 200. So I save 100.
[2024-03-28T23:23:20] Gabe Enzo: Also less weight. JREV front sus is made for high torque motors. Monoshit will likely bend if only a single set of forks
[2024-03-28T23:23:33] haku: good idea
[2024-03-28T23:23:42] haku: i think
[2024-03-28T23:23:57] Gabe Enzo: Only con of this scooter is no rear suspension, but I am planning to design a Xiaomi rear suspension set for big motors.
[2024-03-28T23:24:03] Gabe Enzo: That's a future project though.
[2024-03-28T23:24:20] Gabe Enzo: G30 too. I don't think they exist? everyone I see with big motors has no rear sus
[2024-03-28T23:24:29] haku: why not use a g30 platform. more room and not too big
[2024-03-28T23:25:43] Gabe Enzo: in the future I will revamp this scooter and change that. But for now I simply love the pro 2.

[2024-03-28T23:29:39] haku: this is how i wanted to do it. but with ss arms
[2024-03-28T23:30:28] haku: let us work together as engineers and make this happen
[2024-03-28T23:30:28] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-28T23:45:33] Yamal: but g30 of the 130 vat with 11" engines, right?
[2024-03-28T23:52:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: I used for 2000km no problem at all
[2024-03-28T23:55:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: Did you buy all ready? I didn't find firmware for this new 84100 or 84 200
[2024-03-28T23:58:12] Yamal: No just I read is 10”…
[2024-03-28T23:59:40] Gabe Enzo: Yeah I'm going with something like you did.
[2024-03-29T00:00:02] Gabe Enzo: Your setup seems too wide
[2024-03-29T00:00:55] Gabe Enzo: Only now am I realizing I could've went with 10p because the rear dropouts would make the scooter wider anyways.
[2024-03-29T00:00:55] haku: yes. this is the upgrade path to most g30s is 10". im just doing this cause i have these extra motors lol
[2024-03-29T00:01:01] Gabe Enzo: 🗿
[2024-03-29T00:01:47] Yamal: Easy to put 10” ,,?
[2024-03-29T00:05:53] haku: yes it bolts on i think they come with 10 from factory.
[2024-03-29T00:08:29] Yamal: So can 60 h fit without a problem?
[2024-03-29T00:09:13] Gabe Enzo: I'm pretty sure you need zero mods. You just bolt it on.
[2024-03-29T00:09:59] Gabe Enzo: Bolt it on from the inside
[2024-03-29T00:10:07] Gabe Enzo: That way the motor will fit.
[2024-03-29T00:10:23] Yamal: M365 and g30?
[2024-03-29T00:10:42] Gabe Enzo: m365 can't.
[2024-03-29T00:10:43] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13890@29-03-2024_00-10-43.jpg>
[2024-03-29T00:11:51] Gabe Enzo: then add steel sheet layers if it's still too wide.
[2024-03-29T00:13:14] Yamal: Well, we'll see if in the future we get a g30,,, what would be nice if it was dual engine and as discreet as possible,,,
[2024-03-29T00:21:05] Yamal: Nami 60h 17/4 engine, the other one broke quite a while ago...
[2024-03-29T00:21:25] haku: that would be awsome bro
[2024-03-29T00:21:53] haku: i think @AJAJ1992 is 60h maybe 65h
[2024-03-29T00:22:05] Jan: Even 65H works on the back
[2024-03-29T00:22:20] Jan: 65H
[2024-03-29T00:25:50] Gabe Enzo: Motor worthy of rewinding.
[2024-03-29T00:28:19] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: <photos/photo_13892@29-03-2024_00-28-19.jpg>
[2024-03-29T00:28:27] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Is that okay for scooter?
[2024-03-29T00:28:38] Yamal: I would like to buy a couple of 70h or even 75h motors and forget about it, tubeless rims and fat phases to get a good discharge,, They are currently repairing my 65h 33/2 which are the ones I am going to ride for the moment, so I still have to wait
[2024-03-29T00:29:51] Gabe Enzo: This is for the 70hp scooter you have yeah?
[2024-03-29T00:30:01] Finn: Its okay for 3kw
[2024-03-29T00:30:10] Finn: Over that it will get hot
[2024-03-29T00:31:00] Gabe Enzo: wtf, it literally is 10000kva
[2024-03-29T00:31:10] Gabe Enzo: So dumb it can only handle 3000
[2024-03-29T00:31:23] Gabe Enzo: Stupidest product spintend has made
[2024-03-29T00:31:23] Yamal: Yes, but this time I'm going to ride it with the Kellys... and I can't say much if they're not going to jump on me.😂
[2024-03-29T00:32:48] Gabe Enzo: I think power wise you hold the world record for wattage?
[2024-03-29T00:33:01] Gabe Enzo: I haven't seen a stronger scooter.
[2024-03-29T00:33:34] Finn: Kva != Watt
[2024-03-29T00:33:46] Gabe Enzo: My bad, engineering is getting to me.
[2024-03-29T00:33:54] Yamal: I think the most I saw with the tronic 21,000w
[2024-03-29T00:34:02] Gabe Enzo: more like is and isn't
[2024-03-29T00:34:07] Gabe Enzo: But yeah ikik
[2024-03-29T00:34:31] Finn: Kva includes the efficiency of a system
[2024-03-29T00:35:02] Gabe Enzo: So with brushless that would be around 90%
[2024-03-29T00:36:59] Finn: I doubt that cos q is 0.9 for motors
[2024-03-29T00:37:02] Jan: The range i see is about in the 35-40kW range where the system actually performs up to that point. Some people claim 50kW+ but its only the battery pack, no controller or BMS support that
[2024-03-29T00:38:21] Yamal: <photos/photo_13893@29-03-2024_00-38-21.jpg>
[2024-03-29T00:39:14] Finn: Next maybe make a 0-100 gps drag race
[2024-03-29T00:39:21] Finn: Would be very interesting
[2024-03-29T00:42:02] Yamal: Well, the torque is very strong, but for that we would have to install them again. We had an idea and it was to cut the front part of the sheet metal where the controllers are anchored to attach a large heat sink.
[2024-03-29T00:42:44] Finn: Ooh nice
[2024-03-29T00:43:45] Yamal: but I'm going to go back to Kelly, I think the idea of trying them with the high discharge battery that I didn't have before appeals to me.........
[2024-03-29T00:46:19] Yamal: I am also starting with the topic of circuits, and the one I have near my house to train on is very small, so it is an incessant stop and start and the tronics get hot, the question is whether with a large heatsink this would not happen,,?
[2024-03-29T00:55:45] Jan: I think if 21kW is the power limit, more than 140 will be very difficult
[2024-03-29T00:55:59] Yamal: <photos/photo_13894@29-03-2024_00-55-59.jpg>
[2024-03-29T00:56:32] Yamal: Yes of course also I use 37A FW
[2024-03-29T00:59:19] Yamal: and the truth is that I don't know 100x100 what to do whether to continue with tronic or return to 7218....
[2024-03-29T01:11:05] haku: follow your gut. do whatever you feel is right with your scoot.
[2024-03-29T01:17:54] Jan: Would do spintend, really happy with the aluboxes
[2024-03-29T01:18:07] Chris Culver: Is it best to go with dual-vesc Ubox or two singles?
[2024-03-29T01:18:28] Chris Culver: Wolf Warrior 11 btw
[2024-03-29T01:18:38] Jan: We are actually cell limited on the G30, electronics could handle 30kW+ but cells are done after 20kW
[2024-03-29T01:20:20] Jan: To be honest whats the point in going faster, 140kmh on 10inch G30 frame is already lol
[2024-03-29T01:20:35] Jan: Pushing 150-160kmh would be a bit much
[2024-03-29T01:20:42] Jan: 11inch frames much bigger
[2024-03-29T01:22:55] haku: 11" might look funky on a g30 but im sure its a better ride quality
[2024-03-29T01:23:26] haku: lots of tire options too
[2024-03-29T01:27:34] Chris Culver: Which should I get
[2024-03-29T01:27:47] Chris Culver: I want to upgrade battery at some point
[2024-03-29T01:28:06] Chris Culver: 72 or maybe even 84 if possible
[2024-03-29T01:28:15] Chris Culver: Easily...
[2024-03-29T01:42:21] Jan: I dont like 11inches on the g30, it doesnt fit the proportions design wise
[2024-03-29T01:42:47] Jan: 2x 250A alubox
[2024-03-29T04:43:35] haku: https://youtu.be/AWdmRyVegy4?si=aZ2MsfpAOKHfFtg6
[2024-03-29T05:51:52] Chris Culver: 2x 250A is overkill, no?
[2024-03-29T06:20:28] haku: do you guys remember this scooter company? whatever happened to them. did they produce? https://youtu.be/aBQfs0V3wos?si=Uq3h-m9gopgWH4sH
[2024-03-29T06:35:22] puneDir: Same but for normal guys and starters it's bad
[2024-03-29T07:10:33] yoann tsobanoglou: No problem, would love to try to connect on Uart but gpio pins are taken by screen. Trying to find someone willing to fix code for money.

[2024-03-29T09:38:41] Yamal: Yes
[2024-03-29T09:41:23] NetworkDir: 10000A 50kW? So he using 5V with 10000A ? Lol What battery on motorcycle space can give 10000A or 50kW?
[2024-03-29T09:46:46] Gabe Enzo: "i know a guy" the guy:

[2024-03-29T12:01:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Shock*
[2024-03-29T12:02:07] haku: no idea tbh. this is old video. these guys dont use cylindrical cells
[2024-03-29T12:02:27] Yamal: Look nice ! Weight?
[2024-03-29T12:04:28] haku: all i know is hes a mfkng starboy
[2024-03-29T12:26:54] Yamal: 🫡
[2024-03-29T12:29:37] haku: what happened to that hunter qaud scooters? still around today?
[2024-03-29T12:38:01] Yamal: if they exist! I started following them with a Korean guy who has a YouTube channel called "day and night" he previously made videos with his Dualtron Ultra until I acquired the hunted quad, the truth is that it suddenly disappeared, it is missed,, , its routes the best Korean style, This skate you will have verified that everything is x 4 = 4 motors, 4 controllers, 4 brake calipers etc,,,
[2024-03-29T12:40:09] Yamal: Nowadays, with what is on the market together it does not make any sense from my point of view.......if what we want is autonomy to do long routes and kilometers and at the same time it is a powerful e-scooter, we can achieve them with better results and better performance
[2024-03-29T12:45:33] Yamal: https://youtu.be/Cf4O7XqUNGk?si=QixTtT7uxj2WftJd
[2024-03-29T12:47:39] haku: is this company china or korea? do they still make stuff today?
[2024-03-29T12:50:25] Yamal: I think is Korea
[2024-03-29T12:51:43] puneDir: Around 45-50
[2024-03-29T12:51:56] Yamal: Afterwards, most of them take the factory to China, although I think this brand has not spread much.
[2024-03-29T12:52:41] Yamal: too much for a Zero 10x...?
[2024-03-29T12:53:53] puneDir: Idk it flies well
[2024-03-29T12:55:51] Mirono escooters: Shittiest cooling ever! Avoid
[2024-03-29T12:56:11] NetworkDir: 🚜 🚎
[2024-03-29T12:56:49] Mirono escooters: There is no cos q for 3 phase dc motors..
[2024-03-29T12:57:15] NetworkDir: 75100 box ?
[2024-03-29T12:57:30] Mirono escooters: Even worse
[2024-03-29T12:57:41] Mirono escooters: 75100 has mos to alu plate That Spintend is through resin🤣
[2024-03-29T13:17:12] puneDir: Kule vinc
[2024-03-29T13:21:24] Finn: There still has to be an efficiency percentage
[2024-03-29T13:21:56] Mirono escooters: Yes, but not cos q like regular ac motors
[2024-03-29T13:31:09] Jan: No 😅
[2024-03-29T13:32:19] Jan: All electronics can handle now 500-600A max bat current except the cells
[2024-03-29T13:34:33] Jan: The steering geometry with the steering damper 😂😂😂
[2024-03-29T13:45:02] Happy Giraffe: 85% around at best scenarios
[2024-03-29T13:45:48] Rogerio Figueiredo: 3& bigger then scooter
[2024-03-29T13:45:51] Happy Giraffe: Efficiency depends lot from esc. With 12 fet spin it could be 85% and first gen 75100 77%
[2024-03-29T13:46:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why?
[2024-03-29T13:47:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: Your nickname should be steering geometry 😂 😂 only ninebot is good on steering geometry 😂 😂
[2024-03-29T13:48:10] Finn: Also has to do with mosfet type and switching frequency
[2024-03-29T13:48:29] Jan: Haha lol, there are other scooter with good steering geometries but its a minority. Bad steering geometry csn lead to death
[2024-03-29T13:50:28] Yamal: OK, then tell us the e-scooters with good geometry. In your opinion, there are many people here who want to make rockets.
[2024-03-29T13:51:11] Yamal: names and models!
[2024-03-29T14:04:08] Jan: Segway GT1, Segway GT2, Inmotion RS
[2024-03-29T14:05:07] Jan: Technically also Nami Burn E but there are other issues that make it unstable
[2024-03-29T14:06:24] Jan: Most fuckups happen when doing a C-Fork as the space is limited, people not understanding ending with a wrongly designed neck leading to shitty steering geometry
[2024-03-29T14:17:29] Happy Giraffe: Lack of steering engineering knowledge...
[2024-03-29T14:18:47] Happy Giraffe: Wouldnt want to say this but should be some standard in law to design a mass produced vehicle in order to avoid all the crashes. Afterall these are for "offroad" use
[2024-03-29T14:19:05] haku: ok what of this was an expensive brand name scooter. how is the steering geometry and trail?
[2024-03-29T14:20:37] haku: can anyone answer this?
[2024-03-29T14:20:56] Yamal: I love that suspension system and front fork, like the Kaabo Wolf GT, and even more so the slack core920, although some here say it's not worth it... it seems the safest to me...
[2024-03-29T14:21:33] Yamal: Why are we going to fool ourselves? If I had money I would get a slack
[2024-03-29T14:22:14] haku: if i had money ide use it somewhere else like tools to make a better scooter than slack
[2024-03-29T14:22:53] Yamal: even the 1220 with more autonomy but the high discharge batteries make me fall in love with them more every day..
[2024-03-29T14:24:22] Yamal: We agree, that with less money you can achieve better performance but sometimes you don't just look for that,, and you also look for the look,, the brand,,, the aesthetics,,,
[2024-03-29T14:25:05] haku: ive learned my lesson investing in electronics. bad value
[2024-03-29T14:25:33] haku: 10k today is 2k in 2 yrs
[2024-03-29T14:26:24] haku: but some folks have disposable income. why not buy what they like
[2024-03-29T14:27:06] Jan: It is not terrible but also not really great, for the speed it drives it will be fine. The scooter itself however is utter dogshit quality chinesium
[2024-03-29T14:27:53] haku: atleast the trail is great
[2024-03-29T14:28:29] Jan: eh i wouldnt say great but double stem forks are somewhat ok, better than most C-Suspensions
[2024-03-29T14:28:54] Jan: Super rare to have disposable income, i have only one friend who has that.
[2024-03-29T14:50:40] sombre_enfant: Burn e isnt stable...
[2024-03-29T14:52:04] haku: you said that about laotie trail. idk if you speak the truth friend
[2024-03-29T14:58:42] Yamal: burn e you have to put the steering damper very hard and put as much weight as possible forward to go at "high" speeds
[2024-03-29T14:59:47] Yamal: G30 is from Germany ?
[2024-03-29T15:00:49] Jan: Looks good without rider though
[2024-03-29T15:01:09] Jan: But i see the issue
[2024-03-29T15:02:53] Jan: As far as i know Segway developed the G30 in the US for rental applications but Ninebot took over the company in 2015
[2024-03-29T15:03:38] Jan: Its manufactured in china
[2024-03-29T15:04:29] Jan: If anyone wants to extend the list of scooters with actual good steering geometry, feel free: Segway GT1, Segway GT2, Inmotion RS
[2024-03-29T15:04:45] Jan: haha for sure an accident
[2024-03-29T15:04:51] Jan: they cant get basic engineering right
[2024-03-29T15:05:19] Jan: Im debating to respond with a laughing or crying emoji here XD
[2024-03-29T15:05:20] haku: so monorim good or bad?
[2024-03-29T15:05:45] Jan: Idea good, execution bad
[2024-03-29T15:06:02] Jan: With the JREV Speedfork trail is amazing ^^
[2024-03-29T15:06:32] Jan: <photos/photo_13900@29-03-2024_15-06-32.jpg>
[2024-03-29T15:07:01] Jan: You got the version without the brake bracket implementation right?
[2024-03-29T15:08:45] haku: make a 11" version you will sell billions
[2024-03-29T15:09:34] haku: the market is there for 11"g30.
[2024-03-29T15:10:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That makes it super scamy feeling 😁
[2024-03-29T15:11:21] sombre_enfant: What how ???
[2024-03-29T15:13:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also however its a positive trail ,but C what made with Pretty bad trail by vectors and i would say all of them what has this vector "connection" high is pretty instalbil High i mean stem bottom area and not wheel axle
[2024-03-29T15:14:10] Jan: We have a customer who installed an 11inch tire on this
[2024-03-29T15:16:11] haku: really! nice. some photos would be cool
[2024-03-29T15:16:12] Mirono escooters: At perfect speed and stuff too
[2024-03-29T15:16:18] Mirono escooters: Atleast it's not brushed anymore
[2024-03-29T15:17:19] Gabe Enzo: Oh ya, 3 phase has a different formula.
[2024-03-29T15:17:52] Jan: Yes but i would need his consent to post pictures. Its customer information if i would share here, that i cant
[2024-03-29T15:18:17] haku: gotcha. no worries
[2024-03-29T15:18:31] Gabe Enzo: It's not DC. It reverses the flow, ESCS have H-bridges
[2024-03-29T15:18:39] Gabe Enzo: sorry if I sound like a smart ass
[2024-03-29T15:18:45] haku: is it the french dude who has the 70h motors?
[2024-03-29T15:20:45] sombre_enfant: Thanks for the pic now i can copy in peace
[2024-03-29T15:21:32] sombre_enfant: I seen it it touch frame it killed his frame guard....
[2024-03-29T15:21:37] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-03-29T15:23:13] Gabe Enzo: @francois_schempers May I put up an advertisement here?
[2024-03-29T15:23:17] Jan: ?
[2024-03-29T15:23:22] Jan: Explain
[2024-03-29T15:24:12] Jan: The picture has been on our website for more than 3months
[2024-03-29T15:25:27] Jan: This is why i wont show any progress anymore on any of my projects until they are done
[2024-03-29T15:26:25] Jan: People with zero innovation just waiting like a parasite until the hard work is done 👏
[2024-03-29T15:27:15] haku: china baby
[2024-03-29T15:27:42] Jan: But yeah please feel free to copy, glhf im not stopping you
[2024-03-29T15:27:45] haku: punks scooters has enterd the chat baby
[2024-03-29T15:28:10] sombre_enfant: Jk man if i do a fork i go no suspension
[2024-03-29T15:37:29] Mirono escooters: It sucks
[2024-03-29T15:37:48] Mirono escooters: ???!!!!
[2024-03-29T15:38:02] Mirono escooters: Bröder, I know 🤣
[2024-03-29T15:38:13] Mirono escooters: It's correct to call it 3 phase dc
[2024-03-29T15:38:46] Mirono escooters: Aka bldc
[2024-03-29T15:39:45] haku: some folks are just born innovators. like the first guy who spot welded copper to batteries. now thats the standard
[2024-03-29T15:40:36] puneDir: <photos/photo_13901@29-03-2024_15-40-36.jpg>
[2024-03-29T15:40:52] puneDir: Today was fast and hot
[2024-03-29T15:41:08] puneDir: First time seeing battery reach 37
[2024-03-29T15:42:27] haku: is that bad or good?
[2024-03-29T15:43:12] puneDir: Good I guess
[2024-03-29T15:44:45] puneDir: Today I fully sent it
[2024-03-29T15:45:05] Yamal: 🔥⚡️
[2024-03-29T15:47:04] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/FlOQEsI_76g?si=YqjLzTfcv8IcXVhj
[2024-03-29T15:47:15] Yamal: Is okay ?? Now no C 😂
[2024-03-29T15:47:43] puneDir: I want it
[2024-03-29T15:48:27] haku: no lie thats pretty cool
[2024-03-29T15:50:45] haku: wolf is 10" or 11"
[2024-03-29T15:53:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: Add vsett and mukuta to that list
[2024-03-29T15:54:35] haku: vsett bad trail. all vsett exept 11
[2024-03-29T15:55:25] haku: laotie should be numero uno
[2024-03-29T15:55:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: It is
[2024-03-29T15:56:00] Yamal: The truth is I'm not a big fan of the double mast, maybe to hang a good battery and gain autonomy and such, but I prefer a single mast, more sporty look
[2024-03-29T15:56:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: In crap list is number one
[2024-03-29T15:56:34] Jan: Are unfortunately terrible
[2024-03-29T15:57:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: Zero 11x
[2024-03-29T15:57:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nop
[2024-03-29T15:57:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: They aren't my friend
[2024-03-29T15:57:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have you opinion
[2024-03-29T15:57:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: But is a bit influenced by being a fanboy of ninebot 😂 😂
[2024-03-29T15:57:43] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Rogerio has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-29T15:58:34] Jan: Its not an opinion, its geometry
[2024-03-29T15:59:20] Jan: For a completely different reason and its not ninebot related. Its about rental scooter frame quality
[2024-03-29T15:59:49] Jan: ok example
[2024-03-29T15:59:56] Jan: <files/image (15).png>
[2024-03-29T16:00:20] francois schempers: sure as long as you don't say anything controvertial, that you don't spam, and you don't use the group's notoriety, you're good
[2024-03-29T16:00:22] Jan: Is like vsett about the same trail
[2024-03-29T16:00:41] Jan: And this fender is omega lol stupid
[2024-03-29T16:00:55] Gabe Enzo: ill post in general
[2024-03-29T16:01:10] francois schempers: as long as it's scooter related yes
[2024-03-29T16:01:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is not
[2024-03-29T16:01:39] Jan: But its still not good, please ride 70kmh one handed
[2024-03-29T16:01:48] Rogerio Figueiredo: I ride mukuta and vsett
[2024-03-29T16:01:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: You theory is just that theory
[2024-03-29T16:02:17] Jan: ^^
[2024-03-29T16:02:49] haku: my brand loyalty goes to laotie. still the best geometry imho
[2024-03-29T16:02:53] Jan: Its not my theory and two wheeler stability has been common knowledge in the past 100years, except it somehow didnt reach the scooter industry
[2024-03-29T16:03:24] Jan: And i understand why, because people just copied without understanding and as the wheels got smaller, the issue of wobble got larger.
[2024-03-29T16:03:32] Jan: Nobody knew why
[2024-03-29T16:03:56] haku: vsett 9 is the worse
[2024-03-29T16:05:06] Jan: I had a Vsett and the stability is terrible
[2024-03-29T16:05:15] Jan: You got a steering damper?
[2024-03-29T16:05:48] Jan: and also please dont, nobody wants another dead person because of bad trail
[2024-03-29T16:06:28] Jan: The issue of bad steering geometry is real on scooter and really dangerous
[2024-03-29T16:06:47] Jan: The industry hasnt caught up yet but hopefully soon will
[2024-03-29T16:07:33] Jan: People want stable scooters, china doesnt know how, so they slap a steering damper from factory on it, introducing unecessary frame stress
[2024-03-29T16:08:58] Yamal: In matters of geometry and stability NUMO rules, He is the one who makes and distributes the coffee
[2024-03-29T16:09:55] Jan: <files/image (16).png>
[2024-03-29T16:10:02] Jan: Sorry but this doesnt look promising either
[2024-03-29T16:10:37] Jan: Caster angle is nice but fails further down
[2024-03-29T16:11:07] Jan: Short neck => wheel offset to the front
[2024-03-29T16:12:14] Jan: Its funny how they are somewhat aware of what they are doing but somehow not seem to understand
[2024-03-29T16:12:15] Jan: <files/image (17).png>
[2024-03-29T16:12:33] Jan: Their knowledge stopped on the caster angle somehow
[2024-03-29T16:13:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: I had a vsett 10 and stability was fenomenal
[2024-03-29T16:13:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nop
[2024-03-29T16:15:46] Yamal: They are not aligned by very little!!! don't be so critical of me
[2024-03-29T16:16:18] Jan: You cannot ride 70kmh+ one handed
[2024-03-29T16:17:12] Jan: Its not stable enough
[2024-03-29T16:17:30] Yamal: But is nice this game 👍🚀
[2024-03-29T16:17:47] Yamal: Just know what there are in the market
[2024-03-29T16:17:53] Jan: But please go and try XD
[2024-03-29T16:17:54] Jan: <animation>
[2024-03-29T16:18:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: I can't ride my xiaomi os ninebot g30 plus 70 with one hand
[2024-03-29T16:18:46] Jan: Yes because its also poor steering geometry for that
[2024-03-29T16:19:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: So g30 has bad geometry
[2024-03-29T16:19:23] Jan: I fixed that on the speedfork development. The reason why im using a G30 frame is the rental frame aspect, not its steering stability
[2024-03-29T16:19:40] Jan: Per default yes, but its also made for 20kmh topspeed
[2024-03-29T16:20:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: 70kmh + is very hard because of small wheels
[2024-03-29T16:21:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: If u add suspension more hard it is
[2024-03-29T16:22:05] Jan: I havent yet
[2024-03-29T16:22:33] Jan: No please dont say that, this is biased knowledge that is proven to be false
[2024-03-29T16:22:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_13902@29-03-2024_16-22-33.jpg>
[2024-03-29T16:22:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_13903@29-03-2024_16-22-34.jpg>
[2024-03-29T16:22:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: This is the worst wobles maker I tried
[2024-03-29T16:23:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I think is because is to be tall
[2024-03-29T16:24:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_13904@29-03-2024_16-24-55.jpg>
[2024-03-29T16:25:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nightmare of the wobbles
[2024-03-29T16:25:03] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Rogerio has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-29T16:26:58] Gabe Enzo: 50, 60, 70, 80 strength on the 801D comparison, on 0.1 copper + 0.15 iron.
[2024-03-29T16:28:24] Gabe Enzo: 85 Is 5x stronger than 80 but it blows holes in the copper.
[2024-03-29T16:28:41] Yamal: C… to..?
[2024-03-29T16:29:58] Gabe Enzo: Just needed a warmup there before I touch the real pack.
[2024-03-29T16:30:11] Gabe Enzo: 80 is best for 801D and iron
[2024-03-29T16:30:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes yes that is right and they need to be tight
[2024-03-29T16:32:02] haku: why is it not rippimg the coper
[2024-03-29T16:32:10] Yamal: <photos/photo_13906@29-03-2024_16-32-10.jpg>
[2024-03-29T16:32:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: My friend have one is nice scooter
[2024-03-29T16:33:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: I like to have that frame because I like small deck
[2024-03-29T16:33:38] haku: and thats .1?
[2024-03-29T16:37:25] Gabe Enzo: I've no idea
[2024-03-29T16:37:36] Gabe Enzo: I'm not gonna start the pack actually
[2024-03-29T16:37:38] Gabe Enzo: something is wrong.
[2024-03-29T16:37:57] Gabe Enzo: I know for a fact this welder can weld sandwiches, so it's something wrong on my part perhaps I'm putting too much/too little pressure?

[2024-03-29T16:38:28] Gabe Enzo: @lBabacar makes packs with it.
[2024-03-29T16:38:48] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2024-03-29T16:39:37] Gabe Enzo: I will experiment further, I have many 18650s around
[2024-03-29T16:41:09] haku: this is how i want mine to rip. idk how others do it. maybe thats enough
[2024-03-29T16:41:30] haku: <photos/photo_13908@29-03-2024_16-41-30.jpg>
[2024-03-29T16:41:31] haku: <photos/photo_13909@29-03-2024_16-41-31.jpg>
[2024-03-29T16:42:00] haku: thats why i do 2 sets of welds
[2024-03-29T16:42:10] Gabe Enzo: I do 4 welds.
[2024-03-29T16:42:16] Gabe Enzo: brb
[2024-03-29T16:42:54] Yamal: <photos/photo_13910@29-03-2024_16-42-54.jpg>
[2024-03-29T16:43:07] haku: battery bros how does copper weld with your welders
[2024-03-29T16:43:27] Jan: The double steering damper lol
[2024-03-29T16:44:48] Yamal: <photos/photo_13911@29-03-2024_16-44-48.jpg>
[2024-03-29T16:45:20] Gabe Enzo: Yeah 87 welds are so strong that The copper that's not welded rips
[2024-03-29T16:45:27] Gabe Enzo: as good as yours
[2024-03-29T16:45:30] Gabe Enzo: I'll try go higher.
[2024-03-29T16:48:05] haku: you can do 6 welds
[2024-03-29T16:49:05] Gabe Enzo: 93 is so good. it keeps getting better.
[2024-03-29T16:49:10] Gabe Enzo: 96 and 99 next.
[2024-03-29T16:49:17] Gabe Enzo: Almost impossible to rip
[2024-03-29T16:49:19] Gabe Enzo: and it stays
[2024-03-29T16:50:40] haku: im getting a kweld for my next battery
[2024-03-29T16:50:43] Gabe Enzo: I can't rip it off at 96.
[2024-03-29T16:50:46] Gabe Enzo: it's impossible
[2024-03-29T16:51:03] Gabe Enzo: now I'm confident with the molis
[2024-03-29T16:58:42] haku: ill be using the pink one. the blue and black is going to a buddy
[2024-03-29T17:02:26] Gabe Enzo: cutting copper is harder than I thought
[2024-03-29T17:02:55] haku: hehe. i had struggles too
[2024-03-29T17:03:12] haku: the curves
[2024-03-29T17:03:41] Gabe Enzo: Good I bought like 2kg copper
[2024-03-29T17:03:43] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-03-29T17:04:36] haku: get metal crafting scissors. it makes it easier. but i did .2 thats why its difficult
[2024-03-29T17:06:41] haku: its sharp and looks like this. to make cutting round shapes easier
[2024-03-29T17:06:41] Gabe Enzo: I only need copper on the little circle parts yeah?
[2024-03-29T17:06:58] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_13914@29-03-2024_17-06-58.jpg>
[2024-03-29T17:07:08] Gabe Enzo: Not outside of the circle
[2024-03-29T17:07:45] Gabe Enzo: Easier to space it all apart this way
[2024-03-29T17:07:45] haku: i think yea. im not to sure
[2024-03-29T17:08:08] haku: i just have ocd. i like mine rounded

[2024-03-29T17:11:35] Happy Giraffe: I could make you upgraded axles at a friendly price but need to find an M6 thread tap stong enough for titanium😂
[2024-03-29T17:12:17] Happy Giraffe: Absolute horror tapping thead to that material
[2024-03-29T17:19:29] haku: what metal is used to tap titanium?
[2024-03-29T17:19:42] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-03-29T17:20:08] Happy Giraffe: Regular HSS high speed steel is ok with bigger threads, need something tougher for smaller ones
[2024-03-29T17:20:22] haku: diamonds?
[2024-03-29T17:20:30] Happy Giraffe: M15 thread was ok with regular tools, M6 Cobalt tap costs 15€...
[2024-03-29T17:21:12] Happy Giraffe: Ti is not hard metal but a very tough one. Likes to wrestle back
[2024-03-29T17:21:54] haku: like my ex on our first date

[2024-03-29T17:22:24] Happy Giraffe: And I refer Ti as Grade5 alloy with added alu and vanadium. Pure titanium is soft and weak
[2024-03-29T17:22:30] Gabe Enzo: Lipo m365

[2024-03-29T17:33:50] Yamal: ?
[2024-03-29T17:33:52] puneDir: and I'm making 90 like that
[2024-03-29T17:33:56] puneDir: I mean the trail
[2024-03-29T17:34:12] Yamal: Yes I know but before I ask to
[2024-03-29T17:34:22] haku: in all stances is it good. even in the lowered stance?

[2024-03-29T17:38:00] puneDir: They sell it as yuki city king in here
[2024-03-29T17:39:30] puneDir: Escs pull more than batt max so it cuts off if you floor it
[2024-03-29T17:40:06] Gabe Enzo: That's hilarious.
[2024-03-29T17:40:37] haku: this frame has different compoments from different manufacturers.
[2024-03-29T17:44:22] haku: i rode this 54mph/86kph no wobbles
[2024-03-29T17:44:45] haku: only my dick steering it
[2024-03-29T17:45:57] Chris Culver: What bms would you recommend with 20s6p of P26A?

[2024-03-29T18:00:25] Chris Culver: Ewe
[2024-03-29T18:00:37] puneDir: Nice flowers
[2024-03-29T18:01:05] Gabe Enzo: It's hard to see where the holes are. Y'all have x-ray vision or something?
[2024-03-29T18:06:10] Gabe Enzo: I'll make It smaller
[2024-03-29T18:06:28] haku: use a caliper
[2024-03-29T18:06:38] haku: engineering brain time
[2024-03-29T18:11:52] Gabe Enzo: Might tear this off and start again. I don't want anything falling apart. I'll do this same design on the 18650s.
[2024-03-29T18:12:03] Gabe Enzo: For practice.
[2024-03-29T18:12:27] haku: precut the copper.
[2024-03-29T18:13:19] haku: i feel like a pro coaching ya buddy
[2024-03-29T18:15:01] haku: <photos/photo_13924@29-03-2024_18-15-01.jpg>
[2024-03-29T18:15:32] haku: lay it out so you dont guess
[2024-03-29T18:18:15] Gabe Enzo: but how did you do that
[2024-03-29T18:18:37] Gabe Enzo: I can't even get it the same when cloning the piece
[2024-03-29T18:18:38] Gabe Enzo: smh
[2024-03-29T18:18:47] haku: i used a lighter color petg to see where the cells are

[2024-03-29T18:21:28] haku: make sometging like this in cad. i had to cut mine
[2024-03-29T18:22:20] haku: battery lords just use cardboard or paper.
[2024-03-29T18:22:20] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-29T18:32:10] Yamal: https://youtu.be/pEr4-7uq8uE?si=YTnTdiKdzxgijsbX
[2024-03-29T18:37:14] Yamal: I know how much you like small scooters, but another good thing about the big ones is that you can go miles.
[2024-03-29T18:38:33] haku: small scooters cannot compete with big scooters when it comes to speed and range. but its also cool to have a small one for portability
[2024-03-29T18:39:12] haku: big scooters just have all the space.
[2024-03-29T18:39:31] Happy Giraffe: Scooter designs just need to stop being toys, most cant be really taken serious. They lack too much behind bike RnD
[2024-03-29T18:48:04] haku: here in the US. its very rare to see big scooters. somefolks use small ones to commute. they prefer ebikes here
[2024-03-29T18:49:08] haku: e moped is what im thinking is the best choice.
[2024-03-29T18:49:51] Happy Giraffe: Sitting very comfortable for long rides if riding position is personalized
[2024-03-29T18:50:30] Happy Giraffe: 60km run on a 35kmh xiaomi was pain but could easily do more on bike
[2024-03-29T18:50:45] Gabe Enzo: Sitting on a bike is a drag too.
[2024-03-29T18:50:55] Gabe Enzo: It just rapes your ass
[2024-03-29T18:51:02] Happy Giraffe: Part of the pain was 0°c weather with icy roads lol
[2024-03-29T18:51:05] Gabe Enzo: No matter what seat you have
[2024-03-29T18:51:17] Gabe Enzo: I'd rather stand.
[2024-03-29T18:51:25] Gabe Enzo: at least you get calories in.
[2024-03-29T18:51:26] Happy Giraffe: Not really😅 full suspension is like sitting on a cloud
[2024-03-29T18:51:56] haku: lol. try riding your scooter after a heavy squat day. you will be wobbling
[2024-03-29T18:51:56] Gabe Enzo: They need to make an E-Bike with a couch on it.
[2024-03-29T18:52:08] Happy Giraffe: Hardtail hurts your balls when you hit a bump
[2024-03-29T18:52:09] Gabe Enzo: Been so long since I worked out I forgot about that.
[2024-03-29T18:52:32] Happy Giraffe: There are very nice seats available
[2024-03-29T18:52:46] Gabe Enzo: Try going 70kmh downhill on a road bike and hitting a pothole
[2024-03-29T18:53:04] Happy Giraffe: Road bike☠
[2024-03-29T18:53:05] Gabe Enzo: Ass dead for weeks
[2024-03-29T18:53:08] Gabe Enzo: Yeah
[2024-03-29T18:53:31] Happy Giraffe: DH bikes🤩
[2024-03-29T18:53:52] haku: road bike.
[2024-03-29T18:54:22] Happy Giraffe: Nut Crack-a-Tron 2000
[2024-03-29T18:54:32] Gabe Enzo: This is where I was sitting
[2024-03-29T18:54:39] Gabe Enzo: When it happened
[2024-03-29T18:54:48] Happy Giraffe: Are you geh?😂
[2024-03-29T18:55:01] Happy Giraffe: That looks like a spear lol
[2024-03-29T18:55:04] Gabe Enzo: Used a bike too big so the only way I could steer was like that
[2024-03-29T18:55:11] Gabe Enzo: had to lean forward
[2024-03-29T18:55:44] haku: this was the one that violated me
[2024-03-29T18:55:52] Gabe Enzo: oh my god
[2024-03-29T18:56:01] Gabe Enzo: That looks gay
[2024-03-29T18:56:34] Happy Giraffe: Your all pretty gay
[2024-03-29T18:56:39] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-03-29T19:08:45] Gabe Enzo: Not as gay as scooter hacking chat.
[2024-03-29T19:09:29] haku: im sure we all drinking bud light here. we just keep it on the low low
[2024-03-29T19:10:51] Jan: You just need to build very compact ;)
[2024-03-29T19:10:59] haku: this is my favorite one. i use this everyday
[2024-03-29T19:11:57] haku: true. but a fully modded small scoot vs fully modded big scoot theres a gap. thats why they have weight classes on races
[2024-03-29T19:12:23] Yamal: large platform to do ideal kilometers
[2024-03-29T19:13:00] Jan: The question is always what do you need in terms of power speed range
[2024-03-29T19:13:16] Yamal: platform where you can move your feet and change positions without problem
[2024-03-29T19:13:37] Jan: Wide deck could be also done on a small scooter
[2024-03-29T19:13:43] Jan: Weight will be a big point
[2024-03-29T19:13:54] Gabe Enzo: Yea but extra height.
[2024-03-29T19:13:57] haku: some folks like to max everything out just to flex. im not that way though. i like practicality
[2024-03-29T19:13:59] Gabe Enzo: Doesn't matter to some tho
[2024-03-29T19:14:55] haku: the deck that i got for laotie can fit 22s 16p
[2024-03-29T19:15:18] haku: cant do that to a small scoot. too heavy
[2024-03-29T19:19:31] haku: its very challenging to build a small scoot though. a big scoot you can just bolt everything.
[2024-03-29T19:19:37] Yamal: I think the weight of the e-scooter is something to take into account when you go over 120kmh
[2024-03-29T19:20:37] Yamal: only Rion thinks about aerodynamics
[2024-03-29T19:24:00] Jan: Williams F1
[2024-03-29T19:24:16] Jan: Rion was just aestethics
[2024-03-29T19:24:33] Jan: One of the most beautiful scooters out there though
[2024-03-29T19:25:08] Jan: The aero problem is like 95% the driver shape issue and 5% scooter shape
[2024-03-29T19:25:24] Jan: A human is a fat brick with wrinkles everywhere
[2024-03-29T19:25:34] Steven: Only if they actually deliver to buyers. Aero means nothing if you don’t have the scooter
[2024-03-29T19:25:52] haku: im pretty aerodynamic. very round
[2024-03-29T19:26:02] Steven: The rider is essentially one big sail
[2024-03-29T19:28:34] Happy Giraffe: Selle Royale lol
[2024-03-29T19:30:00] Jan: When you press the air apart when moving through it, you want to smoothly put it back together behind you. Any disturbance and you lose energy
[2024-03-29T19:30:39] Paolo ⁭: Rion Is worst for aerodynamic
[2024-03-29T19:31:11] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_13931@29-03-2024_19-31-11.jpg>
[2024-03-29T19:31:35] Paolo ⁭: The frontal literally makes frontal goes upper, so less traction for the front wheel
[2024-03-29T19:31:44] Steven: <animation>
[2024-03-29T19:31:53] Jan: Yeah this
[2024-03-29T19:32:13] Jan: You can actually make a really blunt crappy front but whats behind you matters a lot
[2024-03-29T19:32:45] haku: my big belly adds downforce to the ride
[2024-03-29T19:32:49] Jan: See it follows the shape like a magnet but soon as it leaves the shape ity completely whack
[2024-03-29T19:33:15] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_13932@29-03-2024_19-33-15.jpg>
[2024-03-29T19:33:37] haku: thats cool. what is that?
[2024-03-29T19:33:39] Paolo ⁭: This the only with aerodynamic
[2024-03-29T19:33:53] Jan: Thats the williams f1 engineering scooter for ESkootr league
[2024-03-29T19:34:33] Jan: The scooter is a blunt smooth front to press air away from the rider
[2024-03-29T19:35:01] Jan: But its no where near a good aero in the end, you would need a suit and some aero stuff in the back
[2024-03-29T19:35:54] Jan: <photos/photo_13933@29-03-2024_19-35-54.jpg>
[2024-03-29T19:36:18] Jan: See the boxes on the back of the legs?
[2024-03-29T19:36:34] haku: even road bikes and riders are designed for less air resistance
[2024-03-29T19:36:39] Jan: Blunt front, pointy back shape
[2024-03-29T19:38:48] haku: what would be the ideal costume/uniform for scooter riders?
[2024-03-29T19:39:00] haku: for aerodynamics?
[2024-03-29T19:39:20] haku: while standing
[2024-03-29T19:41:06] Happy Giraffe: Propably should print some aerodynamic shapes to break wind when going maxspeed run at airfield😂
[2024-03-29T19:53:20] Yamal: What do you know about racing scooters? types of motors, batteries (cells), what controllers they use, suspensions, in my opinion this new little sport is very interesting.
[2024-03-29T19:54:20] haku: one thing they have in common is parts from china
[2024-03-29T19:56:51] Happy Giraffe: We have a racing team here but they cant share all the goodies with us sadly
[2024-03-29T20:03:57] Yamal: https://youtu.be/Zr-bbonedLA?si=eJtGFISh_UvJA7Y1
[2024-03-29T20:04:05] Yamal: Haku!!!!!‼️😂😂😂
[2024-03-29T20:05:50] Happy Giraffe: Damn influencers
[2024-03-29T20:09:10] Yamal: Haku your e-scooter is going to sink all voromotor scooters 2023 and 2024😂
[2024-03-29T20:09:54] haku: not my intentions hehe. i just want to do burnouts
[2024-03-29T20:13:08] haku: hmm maybe a good idea to make only fans. spot welding while naked might be a thing. you never know nowadays
[2024-03-29T20:19:54] sombre_enfant: Haku need to open a channel about spot welder
[2024-03-29T20:20:57] Happy Giraffe: Machining in a tight borat suit could be my thing
[2024-03-29T20:21:14] Paolo ⁭: @roscheeee
[2024-03-29T20:41:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://m.facebook.com/reel/1113145113067570/?mibextid=UalRPS You guys saw this one?
[2024-03-29T20:42:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What do you mean?
[2024-03-29T20:43:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔😁😏

[2024-03-29T20:45:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is flower mate
[2024-03-29T21:11:16] Mirono escooters: Did pulltest?
[2024-03-29T21:25:49] Yamal: The only thing I don't understand in these videos is why they don't use a full-face helmet.
[2024-03-29T21:26:27] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_13936@29-03-2024_21-26-27.jpg>
[2024-03-29T21:26:44] Paolo ⁭: @SibClimb this for ur next race
[2024-03-29T21:27:14] Yamal: Fast girld,,?🧐
[2024-03-29T21:30:23] Ion: @Happy_Giraffe what you think of that frame? Fits the bafang ultra motor, alu construction. But a friend said he thinks the suspension link looks weak on it
[2024-03-29T21:30:37] Ion: Found it used with battery, charger, shock, and wheels
[2024-03-29T21:43:58] Gabe Enzo: With the settings I used there? yeah it's impeccable. the problem is I'm unsure if it stuck to the nickel on the cells.
[2024-03-29T21:45:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz slippers protect more😅
[2024-03-29T21:45:20] Mirono escooters: Well do a pulltest on a cell
[2024-03-29T21:49:30] Gabe Enzo: Yeah but I mean I'm unsure if I aimed right
[2024-03-29T21:49:48] Gabe Enzo: Very hard to see where you're aiming with the tongs.
[2024-03-29T21:50:12] Gabe Enzo: The welds are fine.
[2024-03-29T21:51:40] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-03-29T21:52:01] Gabe Enzo: How did you get those circles there
[2024-03-29T21:52:12] Gabe Enzo: like that
[2024-03-29T21:52:59] Gabe Enzo: ohh
[2024-03-29T21:53:09] Gabe Enzo: right
[2024-03-29T22:03:57] Gabe Enzo: It's fine, I'm just paranoid. I aimed fine.
[2024-03-29T22:04:20] Gabe Enzo: I'll make sure to use your tip for the next sheets.
[2024-03-29T22:04:20] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-29T22:07:50] Gabe Enzo: once you use the probe to make the indentation, aka 2 holes; how do you make a circle then? do you use a compass?
[2024-03-29T22:08:12] Gabe Enzo: 2 indents*
[2024-03-29T22:37:05] Happy Giraffe: Is that a Dengfu frame?
[2024-03-29T22:37:48] Happy Giraffe: I wouldn't again use any 48v/52v stuff. Too much of a headache. BBSHD and Diy 72v setup is best
[2024-03-29T22:41:28] Happy Giraffe: A very low power setup with shimano geared hubs might work well if you dont need performance. Then again need some sort of speed limit for vesc thats not connected to rpm

[2024-03-29T22:46:38] Yamal: This better for this group,,!☝️
[2024-03-29T22:48:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is actually from this group
[2024-03-29T22:48:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2024-03-29T22:49:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its from @KenLawrence 🔥
[2024-03-29T22:51:28] Yamal: I still see the GT2 as a little plastic and not very moldable at the handlebar level, despite the good geometry it apparently has...
[2024-03-29T22:52:05] Yamal: Maybe you can tell us something first hand...
[2024-03-29T22:53:14] Yamal: the front suspension system I like the handlebars no
[2024-03-29T22:53:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bro read, its not mine @KenLawrence can tell you more from first hand but earlier he showed lot stuff and scooter is under build again
[2024-03-29T22:54:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In teory for me Good sus>any screen
[2024-03-29T22:55:02] Yamal: If I have read it, I am referring to him, not to you! Give that inokim a hard time, the good weather is here already!!
[2024-03-29T22:55:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also @roscheeee has GT2 but unsure if stock or what
[2024-03-29T22:56:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Inokim later ,for today using a mantis ,made some changes and testing ,but its nothing special,just work
[2024-03-29T22:59:54] Yamal: Nice ! What type mantis ,,?
[2024-03-29T23:00:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mantis 10 dual 18ah batt
[2024-03-29T23:01:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically shit battery, but riding is better than older ones ,what i dont line in these is the neck part
[2024-03-29T23:03:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It you put it on something to lift it from the ground, stand on it And try to bend handlebar sideways , not turning ,whole neck area moves and that's the metal part
[2024-03-29T23:03:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Video would explain better what i mean
[2024-03-29T23:04:19] Yamal: I like the mantis, it's very light!
[2024-03-29T23:04:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also charging port in half these is just glued in
[2024-03-29T23:05:18] Yamal: <photos/photo_13939@29-03-2024_23-05-18.jpg>
[2024-03-29T23:06:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The bolt is on it ,but they forget it and plug all shit together, and mantis side has a place for the bolt, if they didn't spin the port before installed controller than port only glued
[2024-03-29T23:06:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also lock part should be behind
[2024-03-29T23:07:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So thickest area stands against the folding direction
[2024-03-29T23:07:29] Yamal: This mantis is from this group, it seems to me that it is Italian
[2024-03-29T23:07:38] Yamal: 145kmh….
[2024-03-29T23:07:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On this i took neck to parts and all axles out and back with thread lock
[2024-03-29T23:09:02] Yamal: which is clear that it is not valid for the circuit, you would make parmesan with the flisky
[2024-03-29T23:09:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For me its just a scooter with cabling done like that , stock looks soldered to esc
[2024-03-29T23:10:37] Yamal: but once I caught a mantis gt3 as they call it here and I really enjoyed it, accustomed to the 50kg of the nami...
[2024-03-29T23:13:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know which you mean
[2024-03-29T23:13:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you know what is improved?
[2024-03-29T23:16:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean it has front light and different swich what i dont like Mantis riding is not that bad in some situations front fork fails by bending neck but not unstabil basically
[2024-03-29T23:20:36] Yamal: Well, I couldn't tell you here in Spain there is a distributor that is full of everything that has to do with kaabo and the mantis
[2024-03-29T23:21:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am in one of your local chats for Mantis
[2024-03-29T23:21:58] Yamal: https://www.javamba.es/patines-electricos/kaabo-mantis-gt3
[2024-03-29T23:22:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah Vamba is the owner of the chat
[2024-03-29T23:23:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know him, we had some conversations
[2024-03-29T23:24:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I also know Chao good but he is not doing mantis
[2024-03-29T23:27:22] haku: dam. i wish i did that. i had to measure with a caliper for every hole
[2024-03-29T23:42:43] cihan: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4jEJLmMpO1/?igsh=bjQ2aTNlYjF1OTgw
[2024-03-29T23:44:10] cihan: Do such riders exist outside of Turkey too?)
[2024-03-29T23:51:11] haku: that last weld is good
[2024-03-29T23:52:25] Ion: Don't think so, Dengfu were mainly carbon, no? this is from a "frey AM1000", but looks like some other Alibaba M620 frame
[2024-03-29T23:52:47] Ion: I could maybe repack the battery for higher voltage, and still have it look mostly stock tho
[2024-03-30T00:17:46] Happy Giraffe: BBSHD more power I think
[2024-03-30T00:18:12] Happy Giraffe: Also for modding I dont know if anyone made a 72v ultra
[2024-03-30T00:19:58] Happy Giraffe: Yeah if you can do something like 20s3p P42A/P45B it could be nice. Mainly the throttle is kinda issue. I dont know if your laws allow it with insurance. Torque sensor kinda one option (then you cant get bbshd) but I wouldnt want to ride high powers with that
[2024-03-30T00:20:41] Happy Giraffe: BBSHD still the best motor from bafang and its so old design lol
[2024-03-30T00:29:58] Happy Giraffe: I believe so but not sure, atleast the design is battle proven
[2024-03-30T00:30:14] Happy Giraffe: Wouldnt even look other models, BBSHD slaps ass
[2024-03-30T00:32:02] Ion: That's precisely what I'm trying to decide on. With the ultra + a specific frame I could get a basically "stock looking" ebike and torque sensor
[2024-03-30T00:32:29] Ion: Not having to worry about conversion and bottom bracket mounting/ fitting battery etc
[2024-03-30T00:34:04] Ion: Something like that. Stock pack is 78 cells of 18650 for that frame I think. Throttle not an issue (in EU it is, but Austria specifically not)
[2024-03-30T00:34:19] Ion: But no insurance and not able to go past 250W lol
[2024-03-30T00:36:51] Happy Giraffe: Vesc profile is easy stuff, you make 72v with 42T front 36T rear so you have never ending torque
[2024-03-30T00:37:04] Happy Giraffe: Problem is you can't pedal fast enough lol
[2024-03-30T00:37:36] Happy Giraffe: Dont know if it has cadence sensor
[2024-03-30T00:37:46] Ion: Yea, I'd want at least some gears to look legit and actually make use of torque sensing, not just throttle....
[2024-03-30T00:37:54] Ion: I think both, but would need to check
[2024-03-30T00:38:22] Ion: I considered an IGH (rear gears in hub), but they are either all weak or expensive AF
[2024-03-30T00:40:46] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but it will become hard to speed limit
[2024-03-30T00:41:18] Happy Giraffe: And its high rpm motor so you kinda cant pedal it properly
[2024-03-30T00:51:49] Happy Giraffe: Some 300€ shimano models can take 120Nm torque. Then you could even use stock batt I think
[2024-03-30T00:53:29] Ion: Isn't that also determined by rear gearing?
[2024-03-30T00:54:13] Ion: 😅 yea but M620 for stock power is really overkill, and 3kw+ is probably too much for the shimano
[2024-03-30T00:58:52] Happy Giraffe: Motor has same gears than your legs on single speed gearing so a gearing too long will damage motor and drivetrain
[2024-03-30T00:59:42] Ion: yea sure for single speed, true. I wonder if I can do a rear wheel speed sensor and use that for speed limiting
[2024-03-30T01:00:00] Ion: @roscheeee I think you said once that VESC can do external speed sensors
[2024-03-30T01:15:20] Happy Giraffe: Also there's the Lightning Rods "Cottonmouth" kit compatible with bafang motor install slot
[2024-03-30T01:15:52] Happy Giraffe: Not sure if it's a finalized product yet but that's pedal-able, don't know if it can house torque sensors
[2024-03-30T01:15:56] Ion: yea saw it on the discord :) thanks for pointing me in that direction btw, have already asked some stuff over there
[2024-03-30T01:16:43] Happy Giraffe: Torque sensing rear IGH would be nice
[2024-03-30T01:17:12] Happy Giraffe: Too bad ebike and bike component manufacturers hate the diy market
[2024-03-30T02:06:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Does any one tried to use blade box connections with vesc?
[2024-03-30T02:06:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_13864@27-03-2024_15-42-54.jpg>
[2024-03-30T08:45:13] Gabe Enzo: Yeah thats why I do about 5 welds.
[2024-03-30T09:05:43] haku: you should have all your welds be like the last one
[2024-03-30T09:08:57] Gabe Enzo: Back to practicing.
[2024-03-30T09:09:19] Gabe Enzo: I think a cause could be these used ass cells
[2024-03-30T09:09:46] Gabe Enzo: I might Dremel off the nickel bumps.
[2024-03-30T09:11:09] haku: just use flush cutters.
[2024-03-30T09:11:37] Gabe Enzo: mine are used up for that exact reason jej
[2024-03-30T09:17:52] Gabe Enzo: I was pressing down too hard.

[2024-03-30T10:06:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Finally Have to scoot today
[2024-03-30T10:33:57] Yamal: Good weather!

[2024-03-30T10:42:07] puneDir: Is 37c battery safe?
[2024-03-30T10:55:34] Gabe Enzo: That's hooman temperature
[2024-03-30T10:55:41] Gabe Enzo: think it's fine
[2024-03-30T11:04:34] puneDir: <photos/photo_13946@30-03-2024_11-04-34.jpg>
[2024-03-30T11:04:47] puneDir: I cruised with 200cc bike
[2024-03-30T11:14:02] Gabe Enzo: 10kw impressive for such low power cells
[2024-03-30T11:14:08] Gabe Enzo: you're running like 20s15p or something?
[2024-03-30T11:19:09] puneDir: 11
[2024-03-30T11:19:54] puneDir: They're packed very well
[2024-03-30T11:24:49] Gabe Enzo: almost 14HP.
[2024-03-30T11:25:06] Gabe Enzo: Crazy how much technology has advanced. 14 horses.
[2024-03-30T11:27:58] puneDir: actually 2 horses 🤓
[2024-03-30T11:28:40] puneDir: Horses are around 7 hp nominal
[2024-03-30T11:28:43] puneDir: 14 peak xD
[2024-03-30T11:29:21] puneDir: Yeah I can confirm that I raced with some bike (mondial drift l) (8hp) and it can't even keep up with me
[2024-03-30T11:29:29] NetworkDir: Very bad
[2024-03-30T11:31:28] NetworkDir: Big tyres for bad trail not gopd idea
[2024-03-30T11:32:02] NetworkDir: For 30 IR looks good
[2024-03-30T11:35:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Finally😊😊 On my way to a nice lake area to scoot
[2024-03-30T11:36:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically you have more warm all year
[2024-03-30T11:42:58] Gabe Enzo: You think that car horsepower is nominal? it's peak
[2024-03-30T11:43:17] Gabe Enzo: 100hp cars don't output 100hp constant.
[2024-03-30T11:43:54] Gabe Enzo: Bugattis with 1000hp or so can only drive for about 5 minutes while peaking, then the tank is empty.
[2024-03-30T12:36:00] Gabe Enzo: Hi guys, I'm selling this 800w speed miniblade. It's in pristine condition except one thread (1/6) that holds the stator is dead. Never got warm and never abused
[2024-03-30T12:37:48] Gabe Enzo: Comes with 10x2.5 cst and 2x 10x2.125 for free on top.
[2024-03-30T12:37:48] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Gabe Enzo has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-03-30T12:50:06] Yamal: It's raining here, I'm looking forward to taking the E-scooter, I hope this time to put it at speeds close to 140 with the speed motors
[2024-03-30T12:58:26] sombre_enfant: Hi
[2024-03-30T12:58:26] sombre_enfant: Did u ever happen to have aliexpress package marked as delivred but nothing in mail box ? They dont want to refund me...
[2024-03-30T13:45:13] Mirono escooters: Understandable
[2024-03-30T13:45:24] Mirono escooters: Maybe at neighbor or somewhere around mailbox?
[2024-03-30T13:45:38] Mirono escooters: Once I got a "delivered" package the next day
[2024-03-30T13:46:06] puneDir: <photos/photo_13949@30-03-2024_13-46-06.jpg>
[2024-03-30T13:46:12] puneDir: Holy shit 10.5 kw
[2024-03-30T13:46:24] puneDir: <photos/photo_13950@30-03-2024_13-46-24.jpg>
[2024-03-30T13:57:12] Gabe Enzo: Brother it may just be stolen.
[2024-03-30T13:58:23] puneDir: Call shipping company
[2024-03-30T13:59:59] sombre_enfant: Nah its a bot here
[2024-03-30T14:00:17] sombre_enfant: Been 3 days already...
[2024-03-30T14:01:00] puneDir: Visit the shipping company's branch
[2024-03-30T14:02:43] sombre_enfant: Bro its a 20 order... It was the arduino display and 6 wire cable and a cut switch for race... I wony bother but i need to reorder...
[2024-03-30T14:09:23] cihan: I never experienced it before. Open dispute and also open a dispute from your bank. Your bank will almost 100% pay you what you paid and solve the problem with aliexpress. In case your bank doesn't refund escalate the situation to mastercard, visa, etc. In such cases decision of mastercard, visa is the final decision.
[2024-03-30T14:10:35] sombre_enfant: Yeah i will contact my bank maybe
[2024-03-30T14:14:53] Mirono escooters: I doubt the bank will do anything. Credit cards yes, bank not And still, "can't find" and marked as delivered, no one believes Even if u dont lie
[2024-03-30T14:15:13] Mirono escooters: Youd need security camera proof..
[2024-03-30T14:27:45] sombre_enfant: Yeah thats the issue
[2024-03-30T14:41:59] cihan: I mean credit card issuer bank. They're responsible for the payment according to Turkish laws. These laws are fairly new, about 17 years old. And these laws were all legislated within European Union adoption programs. So I think these laws should also exist in European Union countries.
[2024-03-30T14:43:00] Mirono escooters: Yes but they won't refund for that reason With no proof
[2024-03-30T14:45:41] cihan: Credit card issuer bank can do this though. It will refund the amount of purchase but they always have the right to cancel the card. If they consider this activity as kind of fraud they can cancel the credit card. I had such situation before. However the customer should ask the bank to abolish the banking contract in such situation. Banks never want to lose customer from their portfolio so they will most likely reissue the credit card.
[2024-03-30T15:33:48] Yamal: It's a shame about the C-shaped hairpin…
[2024-03-30T15:34:16] Mirono escooters: Hairpin?
[2024-03-30T15:34:28] Mirono escooters: That stem looks thin af
[2024-03-30T15:34:41] Mirono escooters: Compared.to the whole scooter
[2024-03-30T15:37:04] Yamal: or rather suspension system...?
[2024-03-30T15:41:10] haku: always pay with paypal. this is common wisdom
[2024-03-30T15:41:10] Mirono escooters: Why shame?
[2024-03-30T15:41:12] Mirono escooters: Is good suspension
[2024-03-30T15:43:55] Yamal: Is just the google translate Mirono, some time become crazy

[2024-03-30T15:50:51] Yamal: If I try to write English on my part, I would look like a 3/4 year old child due to lack of grammar, vocabulary, and it is curious because in my house only English is spoken, hehe my 4 year old daughter already speaks English better than I

[2024-03-30T16:17:08] Happy Giraffe: I have a ptsd from all the snapped carbon parts. Also many companies lack skill to understand how to manufacture parts that are rigid in the correct dimension. Would definitely stick to alu parts😁

[2024-03-30T16:57:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Visited some places what you might like, near the 4 ponds and the creek
[2024-03-30T16:57:52] Yamal: There, what you can do in such cold countries is look for covered car circuits, and go with the modified E-scooters to hang out and train, at least you take off your driving suit.
[2024-03-30T16:58:26] Yamal: Are there bears there?
[2024-03-30T16:59:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If it was not abused ,than what happened with the thread 😁 Also probably price would be useful
[2024-03-30T17:01:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fun fact 1km far from me there is closed area for go-karts, but never visited Also this trip was about good weather and some mates and not speed
[2024-03-30T17:02:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes, in the zoo

[2024-03-30T19:42:32] Gabe Enzo: Nozzle dirty and stuck onto the print
[2024-03-30T19:42:36] Gabe Enzo: probably
[2024-03-30T19:42:58] Gabe Enzo: I always have to wipe my nozzle before it makes the first layer
[2024-03-30T19:43:00] Gabe Enzo: so annoying
[2024-03-30T19:43:30] haku: never cleaned my printer since i got it. its been printing non stop stupid stuff. i might need to do maintanance
[2024-03-30T19:44:39] Gabe Enzo: Probably needs calibration
[2024-03-30T19:44:47] haku: anyways. i might get an ams for my printer. need to waste more plastic
[2024-03-30T19:44:51] Gabe Enzo: have to clean the mechanical parts too.
[2024-03-30T19:45:00] Gabe Enzo: where the stepper motors are.
[2024-03-30T19:45:05] Gabe Enzo: It can impede the axis coordinates
[2024-03-30T19:45:26] Gabe Enzo: My printer is dirty as hell.
[2024-03-30T19:45:55] haku: i dont even knoe what that is. i bought cht ss nozzles though. i will do that while i change nozzle

[2024-03-30T19:54:12] haku: what does that mean. sorry im noob
[2024-03-30T19:54:32] Mirono escooters: A partial clog
[2024-03-30T19:54:37] Mirono escooters: See if it extrudes well in air
[2024-03-30T19:54:53] Mirono escooters: Manually push filament and feel for resistance, more then ususal
[2024-03-30T19:55:14] Mirono escooters: Maybe even a bad temp sensor? BCS the color changed Idk Start with extrusion
[2024-03-30T19:55:27] haku: im printing something atm. ill see if the print is messed up

[2024-03-30T23:03:38] deadword: Why doesn't it count the speed?
[2024-03-30T23:04:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tiny negative trail
[2024-03-30T23:07:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why?
[2024-03-30T23:10:00] deadword: My friend said not to use Hall sensor, so we set it to generic.
[2024-03-30T23:15:15] Gabe Enzo: Anyone know any reason why disc brakes just don't work? I've been at a client's disc brakes for over 4 Hours now, I've tried everything. The pads just don't lock onto the disc. I've cleaned the disc and pads, and rebuilt the brake calliper.
[2024-03-30T23:15:31] deadword: Can the Ninebot G30 screen be attached to a vesc with the throttle and brake connected?
[2024-03-30T23:15:33] Gabe Enzo: I thought it would be a shit brake caliper, but I have the exact same one in front and it's fine.
[2024-03-30T23:15:36] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2024-03-30T23:16:28] deadword: Is there a diagram on how to install it?
[2024-03-30T23:42:21] Yamal: Let's see if I can find a scooter model on the market that I like and that has good geometry.
[2024-03-30T23:43:37] Gabe Enzo: OK this is happening with another calliper too. this is pissing me the fuck off and this E-Bike is due to be picked up tomorrow
[2024-03-30T23:43:49] Gabe Enzo: It feels like god is pissing on me
[2024-03-30T23:44:17] Gabe Enzo: Fuck him anyway, tyrant piece of shit.
[2024-03-30T23:45:13] Gabe Enzo: Holy fuck I am so done told him it'll take another week, he said it's fine.
[2024-03-30T23:46:17] Happy Giraffe: You need the dryer box my friend...
[2024-03-31T01:03:36] haku: i need a dryer box for this asswipe.
[2024-03-31T01:07:20] Yamal: your dog has to be hot in summer with that long hair
[2024-03-31T01:07:50] haku: yep. i walk him late at night
[2024-03-31T01:08:08] haku: ac blasting all day
[2024-03-31T01:08:14] Yamal: I have had dogs all my life, since I got married only cats😂
[2024-03-31T01:08:59] haku: both are cool companion animals. cats a little more easy to maintain
[2024-03-31T01:09:11] Gabe Enzo: what does your wife think of the 50kw scooter.
[2024-03-31T01:09:17] Gabe Enzo: She probably thinks you're crazy
[2024-03-31T01:09:36] haku: she doesnt need to know shhh
[2024-03-31T01:09:58] Yamal: 50 kw ? Where?
[2024-03-31T01:10:13] Gabe Enzo: The video you posted of one? remember?
[2024-03-31T01:10:16] Gabe Enzo: the one with the custom frame.
[2024-03-31T01:11:15] Gabe Enzo: I assumed it was yours.
[2024-03-31T01:11:45] Yamal: I have no idea, I have seen a lot of videos or photos with a scooter, but as far as I know mine only reaches a peak of 21kw
[2024-03-31T01:12:33] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-03-31T01:12:38] Gabe Enzo: whose is this
[2024-03-31T01:13:34] Lisa: „Only 21Kw“ 😭😭😭😭😭😭
[2024-03-31T01:13:42] Yamal: That is not mine !! I wish!! I think it's from a French boy,
[2024-03-31T01:14:35] Yamal: In the end, reaching many kw is just about money...
[2024-03-31T01:15:42] Lisa: I won’t mind some spare change
[2024-03-31T01:15:46] Lisa: 🧑🏿‍🎤🤣
[2024-03-31T01:15:49] Gabe Enzo: You can say the same about cars
[2024-03-31T01:16:02] Lisa: You could say the same about women
[2024-03-31T01:16:04] Lisa: Men
[2024-03-31T01:16:09] Lisa: Just about everything
[2024-03-31T01:16:13] Lisa: Money is controlling
[2024-03-31T01:16:20] Yamal: Today I am doing well as I am, I have plenty to enjoy, and my battery is new with barely any kilometers,, but I do not rule out new projects for the future but this time with more knowledge,,
[2024-03-31T01:16:22] Lisa: Wake up
[2024-03-31T01:16:24] Lisa: 😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2024-03-31T01:18:26] Yamal: For women it is clear either you have a lot of money or you are a heartbreaker,, although the one who has money usually has a better end,,, but there we are surviving...😂
[2024-03-31T01:35:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: Single motor?
[2024-03-31T01:36:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: Only ninebot has good geometry @AJAJ1992 tells 🤣🤣🤣
[2024-03-31T01:39:41] Yamal: I like bronco extreme! Well, I'll find something with better geometry other than g30 or gt2.
[2024-03-31T01:40:47] Yamal: It makes me sad that Slack isn't perfect in terms of geometry until I find the perfect photo!
[2024-03-31T01:41:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: Bronco is just a clone of dualtron wit suspension
[2024-03-31T01:41:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: O never owned one
[2024-03-31T01:42:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes I bet I wanted a dualtron thunder chasis but I didn't find one
[2024-03-31T01:45:20] Happy Giraffe: Being married is the worst mistake a man can make, farewell brother🫡
[2024-03-31T01:56:04] Yamal: I am married to one and still single to three, so don't say it too loud!😂
[2024-03-31T03:00:29] deadword: In a bad way or in a good way?
[2024-03-31T03:06:00] Jan: This was never my statement, i took a long time and read quite a lot of papers about stability of two wheelers. Dont blow this up as a fanboy cult around the G30 platform for the wrong reasons. Ive already told you multiple times now what the intention about the g30 is but you wont listen.
[2024-03-31T03:06:27] Jan: And yes its another generic one. Not terrible but also not good
[2024-03-31T03:06:35] haku: @SibClimb did you fix your bambu x1c?
[2024-03-31T03:07:31] Yamal: Everyone is free to do whatever you want, I know that marriage can have difficult moments, annoyances, etc., but for me the family is sacred, and having children to accompany you, and not being alone in the future is wonderful, being able to teach them, being able to travel and enjoy with them,, It is priceless, for me it is a natural law, and scooters are the perfect complement or hobby, to escape and enjoy, and I assure you that I enjoy being away from home a lot, but when I return home, the family is there with all the good things. and how exhausting it can be sometimes
[2024-03-31T03:10:04] haku: agree with this 100% but both you and your wife have to be in it. same mindset 1 family.
[2024-03-31T03:13:49] haku: having a child is also exhausting. but i enjoy it.
[2024-03-31T03:15:16] haku: his mom told me not to make him a ebike. hehe.
[2024-03-31T03:23:25] deadword: ninebot G30 engine 72v lg 13 Ah battery help me if there is something wrong
[2024-03-31T03:36:25] Yamal: By the way, you still haven't said anything about weped's geometry, What do you think of the weped GTS, they'll trade me one for the Nami!😂
[2024-03-31T03:38:50] Yamal: Weped gts: Battery- 32ah 40t Stock motor Stock controller ( kelly ) 145kmh Pmt astradale 130 Magura mt5e
[2024-03-31T04:36:50] Happy Giraffe: It was just meant as a joke😁
[2024-03-31T04:37:51] Happy Giraffe: 20s8p 40T? Starting to sound like a decent battery😁
[2024-03-31T05:03:03] Rose: Hey there Adam, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-31T05:03:08] Rose: Hey there Adam, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-31T05:09:31] Yamal: I know ! I just wanted to give my opinion in these times!
[2024-03-31T05:10:45] Yamal: 21s🚀
[2024-03-31T05:15:36] haku: your battery is better than wepeds
[2024-03-31T05:21:23] Yamal: <photos/photo_13972@31-03-2024_05-21-23.jpg>
[2024-03-31T05:22:25] Yamal: each scooter has its own style and way, but I would keep them all!!!!
[2024-03-31T05:23:07] haku: i like the wepeds wide wheels. very cool
[2024-03-31T05:23:51] haku: that wide pmt can fit my rim. i kinda want to get one but i have to import it
[2024-03-31T05:24:20] Happy Giraffe: With weped/nami money I would buy a car and my planned bike build😂
[2024-03-31T05:24:51] haku: yes. me too. ide put all that money on tesla stock
[2024-03-31T05:26:53] Yamal: I would never change a scooter for a car, a motorcycle or a bicycle, they seem like different and boring vehicles to me, I like the scooter concept too much.
[2024-03-31T05:28:41] Rose: Hey there TSanchez, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-03-31T05:29:56] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-03-31T05:31:07] Yamal: This was my friend's weped! He took it when it was standard and it made a real rocket, 60 ah at 21 s
[2024-03-31T05:31:11] Yamal: 40t
[2024-03-31T05:31:13] Yamal: All
[2024-03-31T05:31:49] haku: i love scooters and ebikes too but i cant take my son to school on it.
[2024-03-31T05:32:27] Happy Giraffe: Damn fans🌚 Cheap and waterproof design for that area could be a heatsink shroud
[2024-03-31T05:34:03] Yamal: NUMO GTS🔥🚀❤️‍🔥⚡️‼️
[2024-03-31T05:34:05] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-03-31T05:43:13] Yamal: happy giraffe, those fans are not toys! They could cool a soft drink in summer with an ambient temperature of 40°C, in fact they did it, one puts air in and the other takes it out, (facing each other) I am a lover of powerful fans and a heatsink would not do that function even if I measured its fins one meter.
[2024-03-31T05:58:27] Yamal: Better geometry….
[2024-03-31T05:58:55] Yamal: Young brother
[2024-03-31T05:58:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-31T05:59:47] rosheee: we're soon sell the whole kit means ^^ monorim shizzl (NOT JREV FCKERIA PARTS) together with SPEEDFORK (FUCKERIA EVEN UR GF WILL ORGASM-PART)

[2024-03-31T06:04:12] Ion: Really cool. Maybe you could do kit with better axles and bearings too. After doing bearings on mine I can tighten everything and 0 side wobble
[2024-03-31T06:04:33] Ion: Got a link or more info? Does it need custom lisp stuff or nah
[2024-03-31T06:12:23] rosheee: @guys ^^ the old (shriveled egg sac guys like happy, james, face2pin aka girlsdealer, hero, francois aka the real fuckeria big dick 200kg will pwn ur mother, and the other oldsql AND new sql fuckers who know how the fuckeria goes guys i'm tired (not of the community and all the b00ns we (incl. me) bring into the vesc fuckeria BUT we (all mentioned oldsql farts and jan ofc and RAGE) should get a fcking REAL DEAL VESC wiki! i will share on OUR (OH TRAFFIC 2 JREV ^^) WIKI BUT if other fuckeria guys like (BAGUETTE CREW AKA FACEDEPIN or ELSE) will use it as well OR the REAL FUCKERIA (VEDDER) will use it just copy pase and let us link eachother but i'm a bit 2 tired and I (WE AS JREV FUCKERIA AND I THINK EVERYONE ELSE HERE if NOT U'RE NOT REAL) will BE THANKFL AF for this should do a REAL FUCKERIA BEST OF BEST (JREV OR ME AT LEAST WILL SHARE EVERYTHING THERE ((IF FOUND NEW FUCKERIA +1 RACE AFTER BASHED BAGUETTECREW))) A REAL VESC FUCKERIA WIKIPEDIA BECAUSE OTHERWISE (ppl like @francoise, @happy,@facedepin,@james,@....) CAN NEVER SEND #READ MANUAL we gathered so much knowledge and we're the true fuckeria guys atm and we sould share and CARE and should stop the STOCK situation... WE HAVE SOO MUCH KNWLEDGE ALL TGHETGHR HERE....so why not should SHARE (because VESC open source) AND get RID of these STOCK CRAP ESC'S and have time for other things than tellin' n00bs same over and over again? rly wanna build a fuckeria VESC wiki for all fuckeria crews here baguette crew (french wines) cheese crew (jrev) pizza crew (balsamico crew) and else the hungary crew (@Her0DasH gulyás) @jamessoderstrom (köttbullar) @Happy_Giraffe (Roggenbrot ROFL XD) I'M NOT WANNA PUT TRAFFIC ON https://jrev.group/my-account/ BUT IF THE REAL FUCKERIA GUYS REGISTER THERE I'LL GRANT THEM ACCESS TO THE WIKI
[2024-03-31T06:13:31] rosheee: u not need a script for physical parts xD
[2024-03-31T06:17:37] Ion: Just have never seen it done. Would be great for bike and speed limit with gearing
[2024-03-31T06:20:02] rosheee: AND OFC WE WILL SHARE (SHARED BRAKESTUFF FUCKERIA CONTACT WITH @SibClimb AND THX US THEY GOT THEIR DISCS FROM, THERE ...@Her0DasH ALWAYS GET BEST PRICE AND SO ON....) ALL PROFIT
[2024-03-31T06:21:14] rosheee: without @AJAJ1992 and me (sry to perform benis) https://rage-mechanics.com/disques/1519-disque-haute-performance-renforce-brakestuff-180mm-3mm.html never would have happened
[2024-03-31T06:21:53] rosheee: but PLS for OUR ALL SAKE (and then let's go wiki and take over all channels) LET US DO THIS WIKI
[2024-03-31T06:21:53] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-03-31T06:37:42] Yamal: WIKI 🤙 same Ali G
[2024-03-31T07:07:13] haku: what motors that weped?
[2024-03-31T09:25:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I knew who was that but I forgot (fun fact he says in the of the video that he is using only the rear motor there)
[2024-03-31T10:02:29] Gabe Enzo: Sorry I can't understand your message lol Like at all
[2024-03-31T11:04:24] Gabe Enzo: It has fans??? @Mirono_escooters BAN
[2024-03-31T11:04:46] Mirono escooters: F A N S ??!
[2024-03-31T11:19:32] Gabe Enzo: Today I will give the fiido VESC @Bradhaku
[2024-03-31T11:19:57] Gabe Enzo: Well not today, on paper it would be today but you know how that is
[2024-03-31T11:22:27] Yamal: 2 Fans 😁☀️
[2024-03-31T11:29:53] Yamal: They are the standard motors and we are a little disoriented with their winding, since the e-scooter has a lot of torque but also has a top speed of 146kmh
[2024-03-31T11:30:59] Gabe Enzo: 22x3 seems to fit right into this spectrum no?
[2024-03-31T11:31:10] Gabe Enzo: Torquey, 140 or so with 20s.
[2024-03-31T11:31:40] Yamal: With only one battery,,! Never try before with the 2 battery…………….
[2024-03-31T11:31:57] Yamal: 21s
[2024-03-31T11:32:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Not yet
[2024-03-31T11:32:58] Gabe Enzo: Algebraically 147kmh with 21s.
[2024-03-31T11:33:40] Gabe Enzo: does it have field weakening?
[2024-03-31T11:37:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Wtf x)
[2024-03-31T11:40:23] Yamal: Don’t know, stock controller , kryptonite 7218 destroyer and the more speed can see in the gps is 146kmh only with one battery
[2024-03-31T11:41:48] Gabe Enzo: Lmfao definitely not 22x3 then.
[2024-03-31T11:42:14] Gabe Enzo: Kelly doesn't have field weakening does it? no way it does.
[2024-03-31T11:58:54] Mirono escooters: Roschee, calm down, what is your point? 🤣
[2024-03-31T11:58:57] Mirono escooters: I'm not understanding
[2024-03-31T11:59:26] Gabe Enzo: Anti water damage packets
[2024-03-31T12:01:56] Mirono escooters: My scoot packed with it
[2024-03-31T12:09:53] Gabe Enzo: make sure to change out after each maintenance break
[2024-03-31T12:10:16] Gabe Enzo: You can also use rice
[2024-03-31T12:20:54] Mirono escooters: Better this
[2024-03-31T12:24:50] cihan: Is it worth getting a Ninebot g30 with gen1 motor for 350 usd to use with vesc controller ? Or better get a vsett 10 plus for long term? Somehow i have an urge to go faster lately but 60 km /h is all I need and not all the time, just when approaching lights to catch green and when starting from stop at lights.
[2024-03-31T12:33:28] Gabe Enzo: i wouldnt pay more than 200 for a used ninebot.
[2024-03-31T12:33:46] Gabe Enzo: Look harder. there has to be some cheaper on the flea market
[2024-03-31T12:51:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sad when you leave your self to be like that , money is only a tool
[2024-03-31T14:12:14] cihan: Thanks, seller claims it has only been used for 345 km in one summer but he bought it in 2021. I'm not sure he's telling the truth.
[2024-03-31T14:12:44] cihan: By the way new ones cost much more here in Turkey. About 600 usd.
[2024-03-31T14:16:33] Gabe Enzo: Dead cells.
[2024-03-31T14:33:05] Mirono escooters: Can ya buy a new g2?
[2024-03-31T14:33:09] Mirono escooters: It's 600-650€ here on sale
[2024-03-31T14:38:12] cihan: That's also cheap there. Here it costs about 900. Does g2 have advantage of fitting more cells inside comparing g30?
[2024-03-31T14:40:06] Mirono escooters: It's a little bit bigger inside
[2024-03-31T14:40:12] Mirono escooters: Barely tho
[2024-03-31T15:23:54] Happy Giraffe: What esc makes that much heat?😳
[2024-03-31T15:24:41] Mirono escooters: Fans useless
[2024-03-31T15:24:55] Mirono escooters: @AJAJ1992 tell em :D
[2024-03-31T15:27:36] Happy Giraffe: ASI BAC needs open air cooling haha even at lower powers
[2024-03-31T15:28:14] Jan: There is no need for a fan on scooter ever unless you have a really special purpose like ultra low speed uphill cargo pulling where the driving speed doesnt generate the required airflow
[2024-03-31T15:28:19] Happy Giraffe: But large heatsink and 80kmh wind is something🤔
[2024-03-31T15:28:33] sombre_enfant: Rosheee didnt gatekeep with trickstuff the design
[2024-03-31T15:28:42] Mirono escooters: Still saturating a scooter frame? 🥲
[2024-03-31T15:28:50] Mirono escooters: How does g2 frame even handle it? It's steel eh?
[2024-03-31T15:28:55] Mirono escooters: Guess alu bottom plate time
[2024-03-31T15:29:06] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2024-03-31T15:29:35] Jan: Nobody so far provided a use case for fan in my opinion
[2024-03-31T15:29:40] sombre_enfant: Anyway 170€ a disk hes trippin asf
[2024-03-31T15:29:43] Happy Giraffe: Damn I gotta see if I can order some bettee alu quality and mill the box for vesc😁
[2024-03-31T15:30:20] Jan: Steering dampers and fan is just to show incapability of understanding basic principles of engineering
[2024-03-31T15:31:10] Happy Giraffe: In PC world it helps if theres heatsinks missing from motherboard components. If cooler fan sits parallel to mobo😁
[2024-03-31T15:40:54] Yamal: Well, for vesc I see them very appropriate, when you know that low temperatures give better performance, I have seen some videos out there with peaks of 70/70 and few degrees
[2024-03-31T15:49:45] haku: well a has car radiator still needs fans when stopped. but when moving fans turn off. the thermostat decides when the fans kick in. maybe for esc thats the same principle.
[2024-03-31T15:50:20] haku: when it hits a certain temp fans should be used to cool fins
[2024-03-31T15:50:48] Jan: The engine runs when the car stands still, so i needs active cooling when the moving airflow of the car is zero
[2024-03-31T15:51:12] Jan: Electric motors dont produce heat when they dont run
[2024-03-31T15:51:20] haku: when doing burnouts no airflow
[2024-03-31T15:51:45] Jan: Also not really lots of power needed how people are doing it
[2024-03-31T15:53:46] Jan: I disagree, if your vesc reach anything beyond 50deg, your setup is just shit. A fan will only compensate for thr shitty setup that was the creators fault. Same with steering dampers. Dont bandaid fix crap, make it right tve first time
[2024-03-31T15:55:03] Jan: But are we standing still ?
[2024-03-31T15:55:46] Jan: People too much competing for fastest from 0-100°C controller times
[2024-03-31T15:59:26] Jan: Example of temps:
[2024-03-31T15:59:47] Jan: Lets say you hit it hard for 10minutes straight
[2024-03-31T16:00:11] Jan: Over a hill of course, not flat roads
[2024-03-31T16:00:59] Jan: And that is your Controller temp for the whole ride without a fan
[2024-03-31T16:01:43] cihan: Doesn't steering damper prevent tank slap at high speed for electric scooters?
[2024-03-31T16:03:14] Yamal: the nami of this group with spintend 85200, I have seen very high temperatures
[2024-03-31T16:05:21] Yamal: https://youtu.be/FIRvMWQFl6A?si=36Te-tO3dlrG0X05
[2024-03-31T16:05:35] Yamal: https://youtu.be/o3etWunxhSM?si=iP3n2P_VV6aB7oD1
[2024-03-31T16:05:53] Jan: Of course it does but ask differently, why do you have a tank slap in the beginning ?
[2024-03-31T16:06:35] Yamal: The truth is that these temperatures are usually below 60°C for all the power of these machines.
[2024-03-31T16:07:03] Jan: Can you show a link?
[2024-03-31T16:07:37] Jan: Rage Mechanics do race track only and use Shul controllers, the comparison is not 1:1 with street driving and spintend
[2024-03-31T16:09:41] Yamal: Is picture in this group from vesc tool
[2024-03-31T16:10:12] Jan: Then their cooling solution is not right
[2024-03-31T16:12:13] cihan: Probably bad road surface is the reason
[2024-03-31T16:13:18] Yamal: I have also seen that you have a scooter with tronic
[2024-03-31T16:14:34] Jan: So this provides the initial condition for it, but next is what does the steering geometry do with it.
[2024-03-31T16:15:01] Jan: <files/image (22).png>
[2024-03-31T16:15:02] Yamal: By the way, I am referring not only to racing but also to taking your machine to the limit and making sure it goes well, otherwise why mount such high discharge controllers...?
[2024-03-31T16:15:22] Jan: Shit steering geometry vs average steering geometry vs good steering geometry
[2024-03-31T16:36:09] Yamal: By the way, I have a screwed steering damper, it's the second one I've installed, it's the typical €30 Alliespress one, have you ever tried removing the oil and putting new oil in it?
[2024-03-31T16:40:44] cihan: I thought vsett 10 plus was a great scooter. :(
[2024-03-31T16:41:46] sombre_enfant: Well its a bad one
[2024-03-31T16:43:21] sombre_enfant: In 2024 better get teverun fighter 10 its cheaper, has display damper 142mm dropout a little bit smaller battery tray thats it but it come from same factory
[2024-03-31T16:43:55] sombre_enfant: If your goal is to upgrade...
[2024-03-31T16:44:08] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-31T16:44:20] puneDir: 80 on sidewalk
[2024-03-31T16:44:29] sombre_enfant: Idk the design seems good, anyway i go for ti pole
[2024-03-31T16:44:34] puneDir: actually supposed to be bicycle road
[2024-03-31T16:44:48] cihan: Even if Vsett 10 plus will need modification I'll probably settle on Navee n65 or maybe buy a g30 if I find cheap until I buy a Segway gt2 in future
[2024-03-31T16:45:18] sombre_enfant: Some folk say its flex...
[2024-03-31T16:45:34] sombre_enfant: So idk yet
[2024-03-31T16:45:39] Yamal: Enjoy ride !
[2024-03-31T16:45:44] puneDir: vsett 10+'s electronics are shit
[2024-03-31T16:45:55] puneDir: but good frame and motors
[2024-03-31T16:52:59] sombre_enfant: Cant go 11" no point
[2024-03-31T16:54:30] Gabe Enzo: In the future I set up a company with @nosoudoppi and we will produce various frames.
[2024-03-31T16:54:45] Gabe Enzo: As well as scooters.
[2024-03-31T16:54:48] Gabe Enzo: and they won't be shit.
[2024-03-31T16:54:59] puneDir: really?
[2024-03-31T16:55:06] puneDir: lol i did more on zero
[2024-03-31T17:04:24] Yamal: Vsett no can many P but yes many S battery?
[2024-03-31T17:05:40] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-31T17:07:10] Yamal: I miss my e-scooter ❤️‍🔥😩
[2024-03-31T17:07:58] puneDir: what happened to yours
[2024-03-31T17:13:54] Yamal: I am waiting to install the electronics, and also waiting for the hall sensors for my speed motors, in the meantime I am going to assemble the 60h 22/3 which I think will go very very well
[2024-03-31T17:14:13] Yamal: 130kmh? 😁🚀🔥❤️‍🔥‼️
[2024-03-31T17:14:27] puneDir: Around 80
[2024-03-31T17:14:54] Yamal: Wich vesc ?
[2024-03-31T17:15:00] Yamal: Just I forget..
[2024-03-31T17:15:05] puneDir: <photos/photo_13976@31-03-2024_17-15-05.jpg>
[2024-03-31T17:15:13] puneDir: 75100 modded as hell
[2024-03-31T17:15:52] Yamal: I go spintend for see
[2024-03-31T17:16:43] puneDir: I also have 84100hp but not installed it
[2024-03-31T17:19:22] Yamal: 6fet?
[2024-03-31T17:20:24] puneDir: Yes
[2024-03-31T17:20:32] puneDir: Pushing 140a phase
[2024-03-31T17:21:16] Yamal: <photos/photo_13977@31-03-2024_17-21-16.jpg>
[2024-03-31T17:24:30] sombre_enfant: His vesc has nothing similar to this spintend
[2024-03-31T17:25:07] Yamal: What spinted this is 75100
[2024-03-31T17:25:35] Yamal: I try fine 84100 no can fine
[2024-03-31T17:28:11] sombre_enfant: Its just not spintend.
[2024-03-31T17:33:41] Yamal: Look nice
[2024-03-31T17:36:58] Yamal: but the most powerful spintend at the moment is the 84200, right?
[2024-03-31T17:39:50] Jan: The big alubox
[2024-03-31T17:41:01] Yamal: Link?
[2024-03-31T17:46:50] Jan: ?
[2024-03-31T17:50:33] Кирилл: Check on the site: 85250 alu big one and 85150 alu small one
[2024-03-31T17:59:23] Yamal: <photos/photo_13979@31-03-2024_17-59-23.jpg>
[2024-03-31T18:01:32] Jan: Here you go
[2024-03-31T18:01:40] Jan: Its this controller
[2024-03-31T18:13:26] Yamal: <photos/photo_13980@31-03-2024_18-13-26.jpg>
[2024-03-31T18:13:29] Yamal: ?
[2024-03-31T18:52:06] cihan: How much continuous current can 12awg copper battery cable handle? Phase cables are also 12awg on Navee n65 but I'm worried about 12awg battery cable.
[2024-03-31T18:54:07] sombre_enfant: 80-100A
[2024-03-31T18:54:28] Yamal: ?😂🤙
[2024-03-31T18:57:41] cihan: Why is it scratched?
[2024-03-31T18:59:30] cihan: I don't know why current ratings are much more lower than they can be on tables on internet. I used to push 4A on a 0.6mm copper cable without problems and it was like 1 A on many tables I saw.
[2024-03-31T19:13:59] Gabe Enzo: Because the awg chart is a lie. It's made for PVC wires. Also length isn't a variable, + they aren't on 24/7.
[2024-03-31T19:15:36] Paolo ⁭: Fun fact: awg is a unit of measure and not a wire type
[2024-03-31T19:16:20] Paolo ⁭: and the insulation does not affect the performance of a cable
[2024-03-31T19:16:23] Yamal: https://youtu.be/ZwlCDfEYfI4?si=kRzxzTXH7yGIMKgJ
[2024-03-31T19:16:31] puneDir: isnt it called american wire gauge?
[2024-03-31T19:17:28] Gabe Enzo: Silicone is for up to 200°C cont. So silicone wires can transfer more current.
[2024-03-31T19:17:57] Gabe Enzo: Cause heat is what's produced when wires are loaded
[2024-03-31T19:19:43] Paolo ⁭: Rated current is for when the cable don't heat 🤣
[2024-03-31T19:20:28] Paolo ⁭: And so?
[2024-03-31T19:22:01] Mirono escooters: Ya wanna cook a wire at 200*
[2024-03-31T19:22:43] Mirono escooters: Safety and regulations lol
[2024-03-31T19:26:03] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-03-31T19:46:10] Yamal: What does it take to put 60h motors in a Xiaomi?
[2024-03-31T19:50:27] Gabe Enzo: On the rear you need major modification but for the front fork I'm pretty sure it just slides in, even with monorim
[2024-03-31T20:04:34] cihan: I think they're upto a certain temperature limit like 30 degrees over ambient temperature and that's the reason. I didn't measure but when I was pushing 4A on copper cable (I have no idea about insulation material but they are pure copper) they were only luke warm. Maybe 40-45 degrees at most, since insulation material is a bad heat conductive probably my finger still didn't hurt at 40-45 degrees.
[2024-03-31T20:05:00] cihan: And I pushed that 4A for like 20 hours at room temperature.
[2024-03-31T20:06:43] cihan: By the way how much battery current can I push on g30 Gen 1 motor for like 10 minutes in a cloudy day and like at 20 degrees outside temperature?
[2024-03-31T20:08:34] Gabe Enzo: Soon I will show the chat how to install a rear 22x3 on Pro 2.
[2024-03-31T20:22:04] haku: awg is the diameter of the copper cable isnt it?
[2024-03-31T21:06:19] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2024-03-31T21:08:57] haku: 10a charging?
[2024-03-31T21:09:21] haku: what cells. very nice
[2024-03-31T21:12:00] sombre_enfant: 50e
[2024-03-31T21:12:44] Paolo ⁭: Now discharge
[2024-03-31T21:12:47] haku: with that configuration would it fit a g30?
[2024-03-31T21:12:57] Paolo ⁭: It's for m365
[2024-03-31T21:25:34] Gabe Enzo: What peak current on that cell. Is that lishen
[2024-03-31T21:31:08] Paolo ⁭: 50e
[2024-03-31T21:31:10] Paolo ⁭: 15a
[2024-03-31T21:57:08] Yamal: 🔥
[2024-03-31T21:58:21] Paolo ⁭: 400w, actually is good
[2024-03-31T22:00:45] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: 4pcs 21700 wont fit m365 frame if it's cell vertical position
[2024-03-31T22:08:29] Paolo ⁭: M365 pro sry
[2024-03-31T22:10:20] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: okie
[2024-03-31T22:28:17] puneDir: Just ordered GoPro
[2024-03-31T22:28:23] puneDir: Finally getting rid of sjcam
[2024-03-31T23:37:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Goodnight
[2024-03-31T23:43:13] cihan: Navee motor has Xt60h connector for phases. I don't plan pulling more than 30A. Should I change the connector with a bullet connector or continue with xt60h?
[2024-04-01T00:29:12] cihan: Yes, it's such a Xt60h connector with 3 connections for phases and negative. I should check again, now I'm also confused now but that connector had 3 ends.
[2024-04-01T00:29:27] cihan: I also saw xt60h written on it.
[2024-04-01T00:29:28] Gabe Enzo: double
[2024-04-01T00:29:45] Gabe Enzo: I prefer taking the gold pins out and making my own plugs
[2024-04-01T00:29:48] Gabe Enzo: Cleaner.
[2024-04-01T00:29:54] Gabe Enzo: from the XT
[2024-04-01T00:30:23] cihan: I really got confused now. I should check it once more.
[2024-04-01T00:31:24] cihan: Thanks. I should probably plan what to do when I have the new controller. I'll probably have some hard times to fit things inside and having separate cables will let me arrange cables easier.
[2024-04-01T00:33:16] cihan: I got confused since I could have mixed battery, controller and phase cables. Now I felt strange about how it could wrote xt60 on phase connector. I'm sorry, I should examine it better next time I open it.
[2024-04-01T00:34:01] cihan: Do you leave the xt connector on wires or do you use a new bullet connector?
[2024-04-01T02:14:44] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: 3 contacts amass is maybe mr60 or mt60, did you sure it is XT?
[2024-04-01T05:09:04] haku: 2 options for my bms. both will require a small spacer unless i bolt on the big deck.
[2024-04-01T05:09:05] haku: <photos/photo_13985@01-04-2024_05-09-05.jpg>
[2024-04-01T05:09:42] haku: i think ill bolt the bigger deck so everything can be internal.
[2024-04-01T05:14:56] haku: big deck can fit another 2s if i wanted to extend it.
[2024-04-01T05:20:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's mr or mt common mixing of ppl who never had such before
[2024-04-01T05:21:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks better, in the other no space
[2024-04-01T05:22:58] haku: agreed. i just dont want to mess up the threads when i tap it. i might put a stainless steel plate bolted just to be sure
[2024-04-01T05:24:06] haku: also it makes the scooter really big wich i dont really like
[2024-04-01T05:26:11] haku: ill bolt this on then along with 5 fans and 3 steering dampers
[2024-04-01T05:28:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure why the plate you mean
[2024-04-01T05:28:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Idea good to fix neck and rear sus on body ,to reinforce
[2024-04-01T05:29:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would make body together first
[2024-04-01T05:30:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way that's good and bad ,good to have more space
[2024-04-01T05:31:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Body can look oversized,but when you have plenty space for your leg and even dog could sit at your leg wont be a problem
[2024-04-01T05:31:19] haku: thats true. it will be difficult to fit the scooter inside mcdonalds though
[2024-04-01T05:31:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Drive only 😁
[2024-04-01T05:32:00] haku: i always bring my scooter inside fast foods. 😭
[2024-04-01T05:33:29] haku: do you guys know the battery deck space for segway gt scooters? also the fork openimg
[2024-04-01T05:34:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why fans? I dont see the need also steering dampener sucks also but on lot laotie with c fork is needed
[2024-04-01T05:34:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also big body will change geometry a bit
[2024-04-01T05:35:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Battery space not too big
[2024-04-01T05:35:06] haku: just joking with that hehe. i kmow all the vesc lords are anti fans and dampers
[2024-04-01T05:35:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fork opening unsure
[2024-04-01T05:35:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @KenLawrence can tell you all these
[2024-04-01T05:36:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He remade his gt atleast once till now and second mod in progress
[2024-04-01T05:36:45] haku: ive never seen a modded gt. expt that video posted a few days ago
[2024-04-01T05:36:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Group has pictures in the backlog somewhere 😅
[2024-04-01T05:37:09] haku: and jrev gt ofcourse
[2024-04-01T05:37:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That gt was shown here down to naked body
[2024-04-01T05:37:54] haku: dam i prolly not a member when he showed that
[2024-04-01T05:49:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Was long Time ago when there where no topics ang gt2 was newish but he will tell
[2024-04-01T05:51:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I saved pictures somewhere to safe place but i dont find now
[2024-04-01T05:52:59] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: mr flat, mt triangle, xt is 2 contact
[2024-04-01T05:53:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know😅😅
[2024-04-01T05:57:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I can even tell ,that he is talking about the flat one
[2024-04-01T06:09:10] Yamal: The only thing I know is that every time I look at the Xiaomi that they gave me to go to work while mine is being fixed, it makes me want to cry, yes! very portable, it doesn't attract attention and goes unnoticed but it makes me cold just thinking about powering it up...
[2024-04-01T06:11:00] Yamal: with all due respect to him world to the lovers of this frame and the g30, but come on, the attractiveness is still not serious where you get it from
[2024-04-01T06:14:29] haku: well modded xiaomi and g30s isnt so portable anymore. alot heavier with big motors and big batteries. prolly hard to lift with 1 hand
[2024-04-01T06:15:44] Yamal: And best of all, we talk about the good geometry of these frames???? It makes you laugh so early, I prefer the wobble that can take you to a roadside ditch.
[2024-04-01T06:15:48] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-04-01T06:16:54] haku: the best looking modded g30 ive seen is the jrev one. but its super lowered might not be so portable anymore. idk im just talking out of my ass
[2024-04-01T08:19:40] Yamal: Xiaomi Attack!!!
[2024-04-01T08:21:08] Yamal: I have the car, but I haven't been able to resist for so many days without a scooter!!!🚀😂
[2024-04-01T08:21:56] Yamal: Everything is soaked but there is no more rain and the good weather is coming!
[2024-04-01T11:25:03] Rose: Hey there Marko, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-04-01T11:41:56] Rose: Hey there Marko, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-04-01T11:43:11] Marko Rendulic: Hello ppl. Thanks for accepting me to group.
[2024-04-01T11:45:06] Marko Rendulic: I need a little help. I have vsett 10+ that im upgrading to vesc and i wanna keep stock display. I have founde AK vsett lisp script bu when i load script to my vesc i get error about some variable not bound.
[2024-04-01T11:45:28] Marko Rendulic: Vsett
[2024-04-01T11:45:28] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Marko has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-01T11:45:34] NetworkDir: Hello welcome to vesc group. What version vesc are you using?
[2024-04-01T11:46:04] NetworkDir: The script DOES NOT WORK on 6.02. This is due to a bug with can-cmd in lisp present there. You MUST use at least the 6.05 beta, otherwisethe script will not be able to controll can-attached controllers.
[2024-04-01T11:46:32] NetworkDir: I think you should install 6.05 (beta) for using AK lisp
[2024-04-01T11:49:40] Marko Rendulic: I have mksesc 75100x2 I have upgraded formware to beta 6.05.
[2024-04-01T11:49:56] NetworkDir: Send screenshot from firmware tab
[2024-04-01T11:52:38] Marko Rendulic: Here it is
[2024-04-01T11:54:34] Marko Rendulic: And here is error i get when i load script
[2024-04-01T13:59:35] Marko Rendulic: I have found here beta 15 firmware and loaded it to vesc. Now script is working
[2024-04-01T14:04:11] NetworkDir: Nice
[2024-04-01T14:17:12] sombre_enfant: Do you know if on the script u can tune the voltage reading of display ? Do you use Throttle direct to the vesc adc port ?
[2024-04-01T14:18:30] sombre_enfant: I know a way my bro
[2024-04-01T14:19:32] sombre_enfant: Yeah but i bought 72v version idk how his script affect the reading or maybe it dont patch it ?
[2024-04-01T14:20:51] sombre_enfant: Yeah i'll do 1k 2k,u used stock vsett Throttle ? How can u remove the stock Throttle but keep the on off and gear selector ?
[2024-04-01T14:20:59] sombre_enfant: Ah should be fine then
[2024-04-01T14:21:23] sombre_enfant: Ah its so shit i prefer 270x
[2024-04-01T14:21:50] Marko Rendulic: Yes, wont work with new beta 28.
[2024-04-01T14:22:25] sombre_enfant: Or now i think i'll try two 130x the feeling seems even better
[2024-04-01T14:22:27] Marko Rendulic: No, i cant. Display reads voltage directly from battery.
[2024-04-01T14:22:52] sombre_enfant: About Throttle wich one u use ?
[2024-04-01T14:23:32] Marko Rendulic: You can actualy if you back hall sensor from magnet to get 3.3v on full throttle. I didnt use voltage devider.
[2024-04-01T14:24:29] sombre_enfant: Sorry i didnt understand at all u sure u not missing word ?
[2024-04-01T14:24:39] sombre_enfant: No its sketchy
[2024-04-01T14:24:48] Happy Giraffe: Any thumb throttle thats native 3.3v and doesnt suck? I would love the resolution from 0-3 instead of 0-2.1v
[2024-04-01T14:24:57] Marko Rendulic: That is posibility also. Mamby in future i will get thumb throttle but for now im gona use stock one
[2024-04-01T14:25:13] sombre_enfant: Get a 5v one and connect resistor, easy
[2024-04-01T14:26:03] Marko Rendulic: Yes sorry back off hall sensor further from magnet thill you get 3.3v on full throttle.
[2024-04-01T14:26:13] sombre_enfant: Then ?
[2024-04-01T14:26:43] sombre_enfant: No i wont connect my Throttle to dash again i had too much issue
[2024-04-01T14:42:24] Happy Giraffe: Maybe should do that, adc module tho somehow filters noise so it has its perks too

[2024-04-01T16:03:31] Marko Rendulic: Although i menaged to get script working on beta 15 firmware thare is another problem. Every time i turn off scooter and turn it on agin, scripts rewrites app setting to "no App" and my ADC input setup is not working anymore.
[2024-04-01T16:04:17] sombre_enfant: Time to connect Throttle to the controller
[2024-04-01T16:05:52] Marko Rendulic: It is connected to controller.

[2024-04-01T17:07:16] haku: for sure. im just finding a way to orient the the bms depending on the layout
[2024-04-01T17:07:20] Chris Culver: Use Arduino, pi is overkill
[2024-04-01T17:09:05] haku: dont run a bms yea?
[2024-04-01T17:09:35] Marko Rendulic: No but lcd throttle is connected directly to vesc. But that isnt problem. Problem is that app seting get rewriten so wont work after next power on
[2024-04-01T17:10:54] Marko Rendulic: It is checked by default.
[2024-04-01T17:11:13] Marko Rendulic: Dont know i dont think so. I will check

[2024-04-01T17:56:07] Thierry: Hi, is there a spinted expert in the group? We have an issue, at low throttle, the rear motor knocks (2 motors in can). Then at full throttle everything's good. Also some overcurrent error occurred at lower value than setting. Any idea?
[2024-04-01T17:59:00] rosheee: need logfile

[2024-04-02T00:10:56] BBC: Vesc USB act as a serial device. You can use that one instead of the pi gpio

[2024-04-02T00:49:42] Jan: LLM's are the future of everything. We are really close to the singularity.
[2024-04-02T00:51:40] haku: what is LLM sorry im a noob
[2024-04-02T00:52:10] Jan: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model
[2024-04-02T00:53:03] Jan: It was a matter of time until humanity figured out that the way to general intelligence starts at languages and communication
[2024-04-02T00:53:07] haku: AI is taking over
[2024-04-02T00:53:57] Jan: Yes
[2024-04-02T00:54:29] Jan: And its gonna replace all jobs pretty fast, starting at the IQ bottom
[2024-04-02T00:54:56] haku: crazy stuff
[2024-04-02T00:56:33] haku: imagine getting ticketed by a AI robot police.

[2024-04-02T01:29:46] Jan: I always feel like missing the boat already its moving so fast 😅
[2024-04-02T01:30:53] Jan: If you want just a quick impression where we are now (available info to the public) watch this: https://youtu.be/Sq1QZB5baNw?si=lbPCTpvVgrEaH6-t
[2024-04-02T01:33:51] haku: his voice is so raspy. like you can trust him
[2024-04-02T01:34:20] Jan: It has even programmed "uhg" in between to sound more human ^^
[2024-04-02T01:34:54] cihan: It's a peninsula in Northern Russia, some part of it is above Arctic circle probably.
[2024-04-02T01:34:59] haku: dam this will be the end of us. stock up on lithium batteries boys
[2024-04-02T01:36:05] Jan: Lithium is not a finite resource at one point when asteroid mining becomes available
[2024-04-02T01:36:33] Jan: Rather have digital scarcity
[2024-04-02T01:36:46] haku: cant believe i live to see this robots
[2024-04-02T01:37:19] Jan: We will be very likely experience the singularity
[2024-04-02T01:37:57] Jan: Either we will all stop to work or stop to exist
[2024-04-02T01:38:18] Jan: And its not our decision ^^
[2024-04-02T01:38:35] cihan: Somehow I feel like nuclear cells will replace lithium st one point.
[2024-04-02T01:38:40] haku: they even have nuclear batteries now ive heard
[2024-04-02T01:38:54] haku: no more charging robots
[2024-04-02T01:39:11] cihan: It exists but not something at consumer grade and cheap yet.
[2024-04-02T01:39:21] Jan: Radionucleid batteries are already now a thing but not for common electronics, its too dangerous
[2024-04-02T01:39:40] Jan: Rather have solid state batteries, no need for nuclear
[2024-04-02T01:40:04] haku: for robot soldiers
[2024-04-02T01:40:25] haku: i hope my son wont get drafted to fight them
[2024-04-02T01:40:57] Jan: I think for now its only small ai controlled drones with an explosive charge
[2024-04-02T01:41:10] cihan: Haha, it was being told a lot when I was in secondary school before 2000s. "we'll stop working and robots will do everything for us soon in a few decades." I think it will only happen for very limited people because it's nature of human to exploit other human and feel satisfied with it.
[2024-04-02T01:41:14] Jan: Super fast, cheap, efficient
[2024-04-02T01:42:03] Jan: True but all we care is to maximize profits which we always do over increasing efficiency. If a robot can do it better and cheaper, you wont use a human
[2024-04-02T01:43:02] cihan: I think using a human will always be more satisfactory until this culture changes
[2024-04-02T01:44:08] Jan: Hmm i dont believe in that as there is no gain
[2024-04-02T01:44:59] Jan: What will likely happen is control of the people. Nobody can own anything anymore and is constantly surveilled by Ai. A few control all Ai tools
[2024-04-02T01:45:21] haku: robot sex workers. i might spend my money on
[2024-04-02T01:45:30] cihan: I think feeling superior and controlling some other people with hegemony is still something very satisfactory for many people.
[2024-04-02T01:46:20] cihan: I'm in if they are biological robots.)
[2024-04-02T01:46:47] Jan: Its not using a human directly but more controlling it to some extent (who he votes for, what product he buys, etc) subtle brainwashing
[2024-04-02T01:47:32] Jan: But lets hope first not to have a nuclear war in europe
[2024-04-02T01:47:41] Jan: Then we can face the next challenge
[2024-04-02T01:47:50] haku: self driving cars is already here. available imagine what will.be here in 10yrs
[2024-04-02T01:48:00] cihan: I don't think it will ever happen, there's no benefit for anyone.
[2024-04-02T01:49:29] cihan: I used to eat lots of radioactive hazelnut in my childhood. I could be already resilient to it.)
[2024-04-02T01:50:22] haku: this is why bunker prices are insane.
[2024-04-02T01:55:28] Jan: You always need multiple people to fire a nuke, lets hope at least one is sane enough not to press the trigger
[2024-04-02T01:57:06] haku: dont worry boys. the real US president will be announced this fall and will stop all the wars and we can all ride or scooter to the sunset
[2024-04-02T01:57:24] cihan: Who's he? :)
[2024-04-02T01:58:21] cihan: Bernie Sanders? ❤️
[2024-04-02T01:58:23] haku: i cant say the name but he likes to golf and wear a red hat
[2024-04-02T01:59:50] cihan: Haha, Trump seems stronger now as I read. I never thought Bernie Sanders would be selected as president candidate but I really wished it.
[2024-04-02T02:01:02] haku: maybe years ago yes. but the US really need 45 back. the country is out of control now
[2024-04-02T02:02:58] haku: laotie used to cost 700 now its 1200 i blame inflation
[2024-04-02T02:04:22] haku: we need him more than ever.
[2024-04-02T02:05:22] cihan: Somehow US has seen biggest inflation in last 30 years probably. But it's not because of Biden, it's the monetary policy for so many years to print more and more money. There were signals for things going wrong before Covid started and Covid in fact created a great opportunity to print more money.
[2024-04-02T02:06:20] Paolo ⁭: Gold price jumped to 2300$📈
[2024-04-02T02:06:34] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: how good it is that you can look into tomorrow and live in peace, and not when you have 25% inflation and sometimes rockets in the sky🙄
[2024-04-02T02:07:29] cihan: People in developed countries with good economy feel very strange with inflation, inflation here is above 100% yearly for more than a year now. It was the same in my childhood too.
[2024-04-02T02:07:37] haku: sold all mine in 2008 😭
[2024-04-02T02:08:04] Paolo ⁭: I mean, u can as well invest on futures contract
[2024-04-02T02:09:18] cihan: I was expecting gold to rise to 2400-2500 usd long ago before it used to hit 1680 and made me stop out.))
[2024-04-02T02:10:07] cihan: Nothing feels better than physical gold. Or at most 3x leverage.
[2024-04-02T02:10:08] haku: my stuff is all on wish and gamestop stock
[2024-04-02T02:10:37] Paolo ⁭: Yes but with CFD we can use leverage lol
[2024-04-02T02:11:46] haku: all my assets is on my laotie
[2024-04-02T02:14:43] cihan: Rather than using leverage I prefer buying physical gold with 3 installment with credit card. I can buy with credit and buy more than I can pay. I prefer crating a leverage that way. I can sell early if prices increase soon after I buy and I can earn from interest. That way I can earn interest with money that I don't own.

[2024-04-02T11:13:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Anyway you could repalce that if you get a different, also unsure how tall you need ,btwin has some alternatives,but you need to put the old and new together Basically they have what is mounted the same way but rare to find
[2024-04-02T11:14:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why you dont set it🙈
[2024-04-02T11:20:03] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): maybe 4 kg heavier than stock but still the plastic ring is absolutely demolished for no reason at all, which makes the kickstand over-bend and the scooter fall over
[2024-04-02T11:23:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Still not sure what is 4 kg, If this battery weight, use to 7kg+ batts inside and didn't fuck it

[2024-04-02T12:17:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically all you need is allen 4 and 8/10 wrench
[2024-04-02T12:18:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Allen 4 is fine tune , 8 size bolt makes lock tight and 10 size just secure the setup of that
[2024-04-02T12:20:27] yoann tsobanoglou: It is for me and I think once @roscheeee has a bit of time, he will also try to see if it fixed his problem
[2024-04-02T12:21:30] yoann tsobanoglou: https://github.com/mark99i/vesc-display-install
[2024-04-02T12:24:56] yoann tsobanoglou: Am using mine with tcp connection as my screen uses my tx rx gpio ports on the raspberry pi zero 2 and am still trying to figure out how to reassign the two pins from the screen elsewhere.
[2024-04-02T12:52:33] Yamal: If the problem is that it did not have a through screw in the mast, they gave me the skate with the mast separated, then I had to take any screw, this afternoon they gave me theirs from the factory

[2024-04-02T13:04:45] Thierry: Does someone have ubox 85 200 firmware 6.02 no limit properly compiled? I have some doubt on the one provided by Spintend. I also noticed some typos on github repository.
[2024-04-02T13:07:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: To be honest not fully sure what you mean 😅
[2024-04-02T13:08:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is clone
[2024-04-02T13:08:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Am i right?
[2024-04-02T13:09:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Color strange and pin should be colored also ,or replacement already?
[2024-04-02T13:09:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_13997@02-04-2024_13-09-46.jpg>
[2024-04-02T13:12:17] Thierry: I quickly tried but got an error to compile 6.02, 6.05 beta no issue
[2024-04-02T13:12:23] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): i dunno maybe at some point i replaced it because it broke and now it broke again. red stuff is just some TPU i 3D printed to give it more grip. i also see that yours is way shorter which wouldn't work with suspension i.g.
[2024-04-02T13:13:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz this has no suspension
[2024-04-02T13:13:32] Thierry: <photos/photo_13998@02-04-2024_13-13-32.jpg>
[2024-04-02T13:13:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is another print what can Correct that ,but it goes between this and the body(can be found on thingy)
[2024-04-02T13:13:55] Thierry: Probably some cut and paste typos from single 80
[2024-04-02T13:13:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you need more
[2024-04-02T13:14:07] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): should i try getting an original G2 kickstand and fit it on the G30? it seems longer, might work
[2024-04-02T13:14:33] Thierry: Do not make me confident on the reliability of the fw, this is maybe the root cause of the issues we are facing
[2024-04-02T13:15:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Can be good idea ,if you can get one
[2024-04-02T13:16:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But first ask some who has to measure it for you , how long is that
[2024-04-02T13:17:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Other solution i only tried on xiaomi with monorim and konyk what makes it super tall
[2024-04-02T13:20:23] Jan: @SibClimb i think there is a mistake with the comma placement. 98.49€
[2024-04-02T13:21:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some time you can buy this in Decathlon with this type of base ,since its for small bikes and larger size "pedal" scooters This on pics is with xiaomi base Left size is how much open , right is how much is possible
[2024-04-02T13:35:58] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): thanks a lot, this looks like an interesting option
[2024-04-02T13:40:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha no, Smartdisplay is only available in limited quantity in pack with controllers so we limit with price and code for the right price
[2024-04-02T13:51:48] sombre_enfant: Money laundering glitch of today🥸
[2024-04-02T14:07:53] puneDir: Guys i normally use 35-35 amps and If I want to fly i set to 55-55 But sometimes some bikers try to race with me at red lights and I can't set my scoot to race mode that quickly Is there a way to add a button Like when I press the button it will set my scoot to 55-55 amps
[2024-04-02T14:14:16] Finn: A gpio board with uart comm would be def nice
[2024-04-02T14:14:27] Finn: So you could bind button or lights via lisp
[2024-04-02T14:41:20] Thierry: It would be nice if you can do it but typos are presents on vedder repo
[2024-04-02T15:43:46] Happy Giraffe: I'm in!
[2024-04-02T16:11:51] Thierry: Thanks
[2024-04-02T16:12:09] Thierry: Did you have to correct .h file?
[2024-04-02T16:12:47] NetworkDir: Ubox 80100 firmware with limits Can just do 150-160A phase i think ?
[2024-04-02T16:16:44] Thierry: You modified it or it was right on your data?
[2024-04-02T16:17:22] Thierry: I'm very surprised to find error on vesc github
[2024-04-02T16:18:09] Thierry: Many thanks
[2024-04-02T16:18:34] Thierry: So this firmware was already tested so if my issue remains it is not fw related
[2024-04-02T16:19:02] puneDir: Wtf
[2024-04-02T23:31:44] haku: what if someone pays that price?
[2024-04-02T23:32:33] haku: my friend needs his money washed
[2024-04-02T23:32:45] haku: irs comming for him
[2024-04-02T23:34:08] haku: do you use a heat gun for those chips?
[2024-04-02T23:34:27] haku: no way to remove it with just iron yea?
[2024-04-02T23:36:42] sombre_enfant: Oh u do vesc repair ?
[2024-04-02T23:36:47] haku: why does ant bms come with terminals? why do they have to put those. waste of cable length
[2024-04-02T23:36:55] sombre_enfant: Haku was right u a vesc lord
[2024-04-02T23:36:59] haku: <photos/photo_14000@02-04-2024_23-36-59.jpg>
[2024-04-02T23:37:30] haku: im a believer in the vesc lords.
[2024-04-02T23:38:02] sombre_enfant: 130A bms for your setup u sure its right ?
[2024-04-02T23:38:02] haku: @jamessoderstrom is a real one though
[2024-04-02T23:38:26] haku: i have no idea if i got the right bms tbh
[2024-04-02T23:38:42] haku: it peaks at 350 i think
[2024-04-02T23:38:55] Face de Pin Sucé: exactly haha
[2024-04-02T23:38:58] sombre_enfant: Yeah time to gaslight you😁
[2024-04-02T23:39:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Going for my best party
[2024-04-02T23:39:37] haku: theres always bypass. 😭
[2024-04-02T23:39:39] sombre_enfant: I really think you should have get 170A u got tge space, only my idea tho do what u want
[2024-04-02T23:40:00] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_14001@02-04-2024_23-40-00.jpg>
[2024-04-02T23:40:28] haku: i didnt know what i was doing. just hoping everything works out
[2024-04-02T23:40:54] haku: i also have the same bms but 22s
[2024-04-02T23:41:03] sombre_enfant: Yeah u should ship me that one also it seems suited for my build better than llt 100A
[2024-04-02T23:42:33] sombre_enfant: Yeah but since i do 20s6p i got plenty space now. Only issue is the time now... If i order it i will be late fs
[2024-04-02T23:42:51] sombre_enfant: The problem are the setting issue
[2024-04-02T23:43:11] sombre_enfant: Sometime u cant set stuff
[2024-04-02T23:43:23] sombre_enfant: Or all auth account dont work
[2024-04-02T23:43:54] sombre_enfant: Whats the new deal now to have all access ?
[2024-04-02T23:44:20] sombre_enfant: When u bind u can use other Phone ?
[2024-04-02T23:44:49] sombre_enfant: Nahh llt is also gatekeeping scooter community get crazier
[2024-04-02T23:45:31] sombre_enfant: Prob is if i sell the battery, can i unbind ?
[2024-04-02T23:46:44] sombre_enfant: I forgot if i put 200pA on each esc do i need to put 400- 450 abs ?
[2024-04-02T23:47:31] sombre_enfant: And on bms ? I cant kill vesc again i only have two pair
[2024-04-02T23:47:57] sombre_enfant: 100-80 per motor
[2024-04-02T23:48:48] sombre_enfant: I got one 60h 22x3 on rear and a classy 50h 16x4 vsett
[2024-04-02T23:49:16] sombre_enfant: The mix of motor might be shit
[2024-04-02T23:49:31] sombre_enfant: Or maybe a bit better than dual vsett
[2024-04-02T23:50:47] sombre_enfant: I plan getting another motor but i did too much expense on that scooter over 1.5 year and i only ride it for no more than 3 month in total....
[2024-04-02T23:52:16] sombre_enfant: I want to put 70h but the weight might be over 38kg...i need to double check everything and 6p might be inefficient with this
[2024-04-02T23:56:08] sombre_enfant: Theres a folk with 70h rear and 60h front 11in pmt on dualtron frame with a lot of carbon in less 38kg so it will be rude this year
[2024-04-02T23:58:00] sombre_enfant: Yeah
[2024-04-02T23:58:15] sombre_enfant: Way better for cornering and track
[2024-04-03T00:41:03] haku: this on g30 or vsett?
[2024-04-03T00:42:26] haku: 11 on a g30 would be nice. i really want to do that but my engineering so jank
[2024-04-03T00:46:10] sombre_enfant: Vsett
[2024-04-03T00:48:33] sombre_enfant: Its doable on g30 if no sus only
[2024-04-03T00:50:54] Jan: I think the frame is too small for 11inch, it falls out of proportions
[2024-04-03T00:52:31] sombre_enfant: 65h is great enough for it even 60h...
[2024-04-03T00:52:44] sombre_enfant: Just need better tire in market
[2024-04-03T01:06:36] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_14002@03-04-2024_01-06-36.jpg>
[2024-04-03T01:06:36] sombre_enfant: It dont fit on the vsett dualtron and kaabo ? Or dont bead right ?
[2024-04-03T01:06:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Just because I didn't show you anything for months now

[2024-04-03T01:41:40] haku: a pev version of this ruckus would be badass

[2024-04-03T21:56:08] haku: noob question. lets say your battery can pull the full 200a peak can you put on your vesc 100+100? or you need to put the continious one? 50+50?

[2024-04-04T01:04:18] haku: what pmt can fit this. maximum i see is for 70mm wide. the only one exeption is the wide stardale
[2024-04-04T01:10:36] Alin Ciobanu: <photos/photo_14021@04-04-2024_01-10-36.jpg>

[2024-04-04T01:24:50] Alin Ciobanu: Since two JK exploded at him 😂😂
[2024-04-04T01:26:09] haku: i think i made a mistake buying bms. you put a 325a bms on a 5p 40t. i might need a bigger one
[2024-04-04T01:27:30] Alin Ciobanu: 170/180A make 5p
[2024-04-04T01:27:36] haku: im using the same 325 bms on a 10p 40t. might be too small
[2024-04-04T01:27:45] Alin Ciobanu: Mmmm
[2024-04-04T01:28:20] Alin Ciobanu: You have at least 350A from the cells
[2024-04-04T01:29:17] haku: ive heard you can peak 40t to 45a
[2024-04-04T01:30:34] haku: i just play it safe for now
[2024-04-04T02:40:45] haku: thats possible yea? i hope that will work
[2024-04-04T02:42:24] haku: ill try that with my fake stardales first. then ill get the slicks once it works
[2024-04-04T02:44:20] haku: maybe someone in EU already stretched slicks. because of the racing scene im sure
[2024-04-04T02:47:16] Ion: alien rides closed? weren't they quite big/popular in the US for scooter things
[2024-04-04T02:47:26] haku: this size is what im looking at.

[2024-04-04T14:50:19] Yamal: I asked him a few days ago about his skate (project) with the tronic without finding an answer, About the skate, how does it develop, what battery does it have, what motors, are its temperatures good,? etc etc etc
[2024-04-04T14:51:25] Yamal: I just have to cut some of the garlic clove from the nami to be able to screw the controllers directly and I had thought that an iron would be good for it.
[2024-04-04T14:55:04] Paolo ⁭: You mean alienrides?
[2024-04-04T14:57:52] Yamal: NO I mean G30 tunning man
[2024-04-04T15:37:13] Yamal: Do you think that Field Weakening increases the temperature of the controllers?
[2024-04-04T15:37:39] Martin Kaktits: Someone here knows buck converters, LED's? I have this cc/cv buck and im powering a sst40 LED directly. It acts.. weird, idk. When messuring amps with multimeter and i complete the circuit, the little red led on the converter lights up bright and the sst40 too seems to be at its peak. But when i plug in the wire directly, without multimeter in the middle, the little red indicator light is dimmer and so is the actual sst40 light output dimmer. Even more - if the connection is bad as in i barely touch the wire, both are bright, but pushig the wire deeper makes them dim again
[2024-04-04T15:43:31] NetworkDir: 80100 can do 250A phase with good cooling But with no hw limit firmware

[2024-04-05T12:00:19] Yamal: burn tronic? But the entire board or some component that is very different...?
[2024-04-05T12:01:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah ,i think full,but they will tell
[2024-04-05T12:04:46] Jan: My suggestion dont, the controller (250 non R) has its issues and easy to blow
[2024-04-05T12:08:18] Mirono escooters: Insta xD
[2024-04-05T12:09:47] Yamal: I currently use a 250 and a 250r
[2024-04-05T12:10:59] Jan: Yes then leave it, else you blow it
[2024-04-05T12:11:08] Jan: We have a 1kg bag of controllers

[2024-04-05T14:16:30] Paolo ⁭: No
[2024-04-05T14:25:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its asi
[2024-04-05T14:37:54] cihan: How much imbalance should I expect if a battery is 60% depth cycled for 40 times? This is a 13S5P navee battery. Almost all groups are 3.75V but one cell group is 3.46V. Should I expect a dead cell in this group?
[2024-04-05T14:38:42] cihan: This BMS on the battery is known no not balance at all, not even passive.
[2024-04-05T14:49:35] Yamal: peculiar question.. Does anyone in this group know Benjamin Vedder personally?
[2024-04-05T14:55:01] puneDir: Or weak weld

[2024-04-05T16:08:07] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3 How do these cables work? Do they need to be grouded on the shielding material? Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! €5.64 27%OFF | 26AWG 24AWG 22AWG 2/3/4/5/6/7/8 core Shielded cable 5meters pure copper RVVP shielded wire control cable UL2464 signal wire https://a.aliexpress.com/_EHnFIMh
[2024-04-05T16:51:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on the GND signal, yes
[2024-04-05T17:03:05] Happy Giraffe: So I ground the tinfoil around it just to be clear I understood correctly?😅
[2024-04-05T17:03:38] Happy Giraffe: Also does it matter if its Batt GND or the specific throttle gnd?
[2024-04-05T17:04:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the thin foil, no, but the "small wires", yes
[2024-04-05T17:10:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ahh this your nice road near the highway
[2024-04-05T17:13:27] Happy Giraffe: Would you think removing the silicone cover from the small (GND) wire and soldering it to the foil is a good idea?
[2024-04-05T17:14:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no idea. never did that
[2024-04-05T17:14:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No need to ground shielding
[2024-04-05T17:14:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also that foil is not solderable
[2024-04-05T17:15:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What is the goal?
[2024-04-05T17:16:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For me the question is like welding 4mm inox sheet on 4mm inox plate
[2024-04-05T17:16:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just seal the ends and you good
[2024-04-05T17:26:05] Happy Giraffe: To make throttle signal have least amount of noise
[2024-04-05T17:26:27] Happy Giraffe: I kinda wanna try the resistor mod and skip adc module this time
[2024-04-05T17:26:48] Happy Giraffe: How does it work then? Like a faraday cage?
[2024-04-05T17:29:11] sombre_enfant: Adc module = 1k 2k, nothing will change
[2024-04-05T17:33:17] Happy Giraffe: ADC module outputs like 2.2v so DIY res I aim for 3.1v
[2024-04-05T17:37:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on cables also Like first thing usually wires spin inside and there is individual wrap and main wrapped , works like reflects noises
[2024-04-05T17:42:37] Happy Giraffe: The ones I linked from Ali
[2024-04-05T17:46:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This has double shielding ,two shields block other signals Shield foil here is alu

[2024-04-05T18:32:40] haku: for what drones? fpv or normal video drones? like dji mavic
[2024-04-05T18:36:35] Finn: Fpv
[2024-04-05T18:36:43] Finn: Normal video drones dont need 50a😁
[2024-04-05T18:36:57] Paolo ⁭: V3 was like tronic
[2024-04-05T18:36:59] Finn: Also you can mount a gopro onto a fpv and use it as a video drone
[2024-04-05T18:37:10] Paolo ⁭: Random mosfet explosion
[2024-04-05T18:37:20] Finn: Perfect😂
[2024-04-05T18:37:50] Paolo ⁭: Yes but was when we living in chip shortage
[2024-04-05T18:38:12] Paolo ⁭: So the only way to make esc cheap was mounting china shit fet
[2024-04-05T18:43:26] haku: can you use these little esc on a low powered ebike or scooter?
[2024-04-05T18:59:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably you could mount and see it burning 😁
[2024-04-05T19:00:57] Paolo ⁭: It works on small motor
[2024-04-05T19:01:09] Paolo ⁭: But low voltage
[2024-04-05T19:03:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: With load also? Iike a kid cart
[2024-04-05T19:03:58] Paolo ⁭: Electric scooter also
[2024-04-05T19:04:36] Paolo ⁭: Some vesc have the same mosfet
[2024-04-05T19:05:41] puneDir: Can i make the same ignition mod to 84100
[2024-04-05T19:06:18] Happy Giraffe: Thanks for the input, could you answer like if you were talking to toddler🤣 So I ground the surrounding alu mesh to the gnd wire that goes inside?
[2024-04-05T19:06:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2024-04-05T19:09:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In way yes and no Mesh is thinned copper ,inside foil thingy alu
[2024-04-05T19:10:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_14051@05-04-2024_19-10-09.jpg>
[2024-04-05T19:10:20] Happy Giraffe: Thanks a lot!
[2024-04-05T21:35:56] haku: this tiny one can power 2 low voltage motors?

[2024-04-05T22:14:57] Mirono escooters: No way it's vesc? O o
[2024-04-05T22:23:26] Finn: Clones work too but for how long💀
[2024-04-05T22:25:30] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-04-05T22:28:10] Finn: Is the pinout the same?
[2024-04-05T22:31:06] Paolo ⁭: It's same as STM , you can install without redoing library
[2024-04-05T22:31:15] Paolo ⁭: Just cheaper and worse
[2024-04-05T22:50:23] Mirono escooters: It can't be that much cheaper to be worth it right
[2024-04-05T23:01:53] Paolo ⁭: It cost like 1.5$ if you buy single unit, probably less than 1$ in multiple piece. Original one cost 2.7$ for big order, that's massive save if the company produces tons of them
[2024-04-05T23:03:44] Mirono escooters: Does flipsky sell that much
[2024-04-05T23:03:50] Mirono escooters: And the return peaks xD
[2024-04-05T23:30:04] Paolo ⁭: Lol they will not refund you
[2024-04-05T23:30:18] Mirono escooters: Alieexpress has a proper refund team
[2024-04-05T23:30:45] Paolo ⁭: Yes but the product is generally sold by third parts which pretends to be factory
[2024-04-05T23:31:24] Paolo ⁭: So only seller will loss
[2024-04-05T23:32:18] Mirono escooters: A
[2024-04-05T23:32:28] Mirono escooters: Well they shouldn't resell and pretend to be factory : D
[2024-04-05T23:41:53] Happy Giraffe: In the 6fet vs 12fet vescs, what other changes have to be made in design in addition to just putting 6 mosfets more?
[2024-04-05T23:42:41] Happy Giraffe: For sure need to make it bigger and have cooling to added fets but could you technically use almost same design? If so, why that big of a price increase
[2024-04-05T23:50:10] haku: good question. i want to know this too
[2024-04-05T23:51:12] haku: also why does flipsky/makerbase have big capacitors thingys and spintend has none?

[2024-04-06T01:01:24] Yamal: It's perfect, I admire each and every one of the scooters and I think that each one has its place and can be enjoyed, you already have the g30 for when you want to comb your hair back
[2024-04-06T01:04:27] rosheee: 😃
[2024-04-06T01:17:51] Yamal: What is clear is that one thing is when you get used to it, acceleration vs high performance is difficult to get off from there, and one thing even worse is that when you start running you get used to it and what seemed crazy before seems less and less crazy and you feel more comfortable, the sensation of speed or perception decreases and this is very very dangerous👻
[2024-04-06T01:20:09] Yamal: What do you mean by cooling? fans or heat sinks?
[2024-04-06T01:24:48] Jan: Lol fans

[2024-04-06T01:59:06] Jan: Yeah, dualtron has shitty steering geometry, not even 2 dampers can bandaid fix that
[2024-04-06T01:59:55] Jan: Manufacturer and People usually are not aware what it is to make it better, hence we see steering dampers
[2024-04-06T02:00:04] Jan: Its not gonna fix it for real
[2024-04-06T02:00:27] Jan: You would just need a tiny bit

[2024-04-06T08:49:33] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't agree, 150Kmh without steering damper here, but hey, if people doesn't understand how to place the arms to have something stable... Dualtron has the unique ability to let you change the geometry by removing 2 nuts

[2024-04-06T12:45:21] haku: he got a 2nd damper so its fixed now right,?
[2024-04-06T12:47:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not new , there blade gt2 has a similar feeling ,no need for max speeds to get it

[2024-04-06T12:50:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not really , what happens is dampeners fight with the wobble. I mean a fix would fix something This is like taking painkillers for a broken arm ,you cant feel it but its still broken 🤷‍♂
[2024-04-06T12:51:44] Paolo ⁭: double steering damper hahah
[2024-04-06T12:51:49] Paolo ⁭: @AJAJ1992
[2024-04-06T12:53:13] Paolo ⁭: thats more about dont know how to drive, not only geometry
[2024-04-06T12:53:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not to mention how they limit you , Wonder if any comes up with similar like a fuel bike ,hardens when you hit the throttle hard🤔 however cant say does cant fail sometimes
[2024-04-06T12:54:32] Paolo ⁭: If is stock motor it's impressive
[2024-04-06T12:54:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's like the small extra tires for kids bike than
[2024-04-06T12:54:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They get to not fall🤣🤣🤣
[2024-04-06T12:55:37] Paolo ⁭: My blade was much worse as geometry , but I reached 130 without die
[2024-04-06T12:57:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I just tried the teverun blades,but does, me no like
[2024-04-06T12:57:58] haku: some guys also change thier geometry by removing 2 nuts. now they identify as they/ them
[2024-04-06T13:06:03] Yamal: No stock motor, he say 75mm magnet also he need separate more the arms

[2024-04-06T13:53:35] haku: i dont have french interwebs
[2024-04-06T13:54:39] NetworkDir: Yes but problem still happend
[2024-04-06T13:56:35] haku: maybe add another 2 more
[2024-04-06T13:57:37] sombre_enfant: Just go on insta tf
[2024-04-06T13:58:32] haku: i dont have insta. and when i use google non have dampers
[2024-04-06T14:04:06] haku: the red nami and the dualtron doesnt use dampers i think
[2024-04-06T14:07:26] NetworkDir: Damper little bit can help to stability but can't fix bad geometry
[2024-04-06T14:13:40] sombre_enfant: Not my problem man
[2024-04-06T14:14:48] Happy Giraffe: GTA 5 star cops incoming
[2024-04-06T14:15:07] haku: i checked non had dampers
[2024-04-06T14:38:03] Paolo ⁭: So not that impressive at all :(
[2024-04-06T14:39:14] Yamal: If it has 85/200 it is from the club!!!

[2024-04-06T14:40:29] Paolo ⁭: 70mm motor
[2024-04-06T14:48:36] puneDir: I'm switching to dual 84100hp setup
[2024-04-06T14:48:42] puneDir: 200a phase time But I have to mod them to key somehow
[2024-04-06T14:49:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Interesting that what numbers he has compared to this ,like effiency and he did only 50
[2024-04-06T14:50:02] puneDir: wow this modded 75100 pushing some good current 😁
[2024-04-06T14:50:59] Yamal: Wau man , amazing just tell as all about this E-scooter
[2024-04-06T14:51:30] puneDir: this pic maded me think that I need another 5p
[2024-04-06T14:51:36] puneDir: 20S16P TIME
[2024-04-06T14:53:06] Happy Giraffe: Controller?
[2024-04-06T14:53:43] puneDir: 75100 for sure
[2024-04-06T14:54:07] Кирилл: Also more efficiency here i had a year ago with 40mm stock gt2 motors
[2024-04-06T14:56:21] Yamal: By the way, you have made me think,,, What scooter are you going to work on? the tabloids say that in a leger speedway,! Only you know the truth....
[2024-04-06T15:14:24] Yamal: Stock motor? 146kmh?
[2024-04-06T15:14:30] Yamal: Very serious things are being talked about here today.
[2024-04-06T15:17:46] puneDir: Guys i have a question Will my 50h zero motor burn if I use it on single mode for like 1-2 weeks?
[2024-04-06T15:18:08] puneDir: I will put 20-30 amps I have to use it untill my new vesc arrives
[2024-04-06T15:18:14] Yamal: Beautiful numbers, what battery and controllers did you have?
[2024-04-06T15:19:34] Yamal: In the end you buy new Vesc?
[2024-04-06T15:20:12] Кирилл: Only modded to better mm² and heat transfer
[2024-04-06T15:20:40] Кирилл: It was molicel battery and custom escs
[2024-04-06T15:22:26] puneDir: Already did But It will take 2 weeks to arrive
[2024-04-06T15:22:45] puneDir: Wish I ordered the Second 84100 before
[2024-04-06T15:23:03] puneDir: Amazing
[2024-04-06T15:24:10] Yamal: 21/22s?
[2024-04-06T15:24:17] puneDir: Anyways single means wheelies :D
[2024-04-06T15:24:25] Кирилл: Ye, 22
[2024-04-06T15:25:30] Yamal: there is a lot of desire to prepare an scooter All you need is the pasta!!!!😂
[2024-04-06T15:33:52] Yamal: you have your audience waiting
[2024-04-06T15:35:11] Paolo ⁭: Yes because it’s just 2km trip
[2024-04-06T15:35:55] Кирилл: I never saw more than 90wh/km, even with long trips
[2024-04-06T15:38:28] puneDir: <photos/photo_14061@06-04-2024_15-38-28.jpg>
[2024-04-06T15:38:30] puneDir: Beautiful
[2024-04-06T15:38:50] puneDir: 0ohm fuses everywhere Great job mks
[2024-04-06T15:40:00] Jan: Whats a 0ohm fuse?^^
[2024-04-06T15:40:02] Paolo ⁭: Ah yes if you mean this
[2024-04-06T15:40:02] puneDir: <photos/photo_14062@06-04-2024_15-40-02.jpg>
[2024-04-06T15:40:07] puneDir: I mean resistor
[2024-04-06T15:40:10] puneDir: Used as fuse
[2024-04-06T15:40:32] Paolo ⁭: My wolf is 30wh/km
[2024-04-06T15:40:34] puneDir: Really great esc That MOSFETs ignition built in bt phase filters etc etc
[2024-04-06T15:40:36] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_14063@06-04-2024_15-40-36.jpg>
[2024-04-06T15:40:58] Jan: But would 0ohm never blow no matter how much current goes through? Superconductor wont blow until quenching happens
[2024-04-06T15:40:59] Happy Giraffe: That also will change to 2x if heavy wind is against you😁 So need same weather, driver weight, tire pressure etc etc to compare😅
[2024-04-06T15:44:14] Yamal: Have wolf?
[2024-04-06T15:44:23] Paolo ⁭: mine yes
[2024-04-06T15:44:50] puneDir: No 0ohm resistors are meant to blow
[2024-04-06T15:44:55] puneDir: They protect circuit
[2024-04-06T15:45:20] Yamal: Could you occasionally post photos of your machines!
[2024-04-06T15:45:34] Yamal: General,,,
[2024-04-06T15:45:51] Кирилл: This for example, too much
[2024-04-06T15:45:58] Paolo ⁭: it's too heavy, i don't use it very much
[2024-04-06T15:47:33] Paolo ⁭: some parametrs are fucked, that's no possible
[2024-04-06T15:48:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah
[2024-04-06T15:48:24] Paolo ⁭: he said he have 50ah battery right @jamaludin_algarnati ? here's 70ah
[2024-04-06T15:48:51] Кирилл: Ye, maybe
[2024-04-06T15:50:21] Paolo ⁭: also the tire size i guess, 30kmh..
[2024-04-06T15:57:34] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_14064@06-04-2024_15-57-34.jpg>
[2024-04-06T15:57:45] Happy Giraffe: Nice weather🌚
[2024-04-06T15:57:54] Happy Giraffe: How do those reset?
[2024-04-06T16:00:45] Happy Giraffe: More documentation needed😁
[2024-04-06T16:04:48] Happy Giraffe: Vedder needs to hire a hot accountant to do paperwork
[2024-04-06T16:09:11] sombre_enfant: Can u stick them without case to a diff heatsink and lay flat the caps
[2024-04-06T16:15:09] Yamal: Never say how many (P)
[2024-04-06T16:15:36] Paolo ⁭: I thought you said 20s10p 50s
[2024-04-06T16:20:51] Yamal: I didn't just ask for voltage if it was 21 or 22, in any case a Gt2 is rather narrow, I don't think it can fit many (p)
[2024-04-06T16:21:15] Paolo ⁭: Ah it wasn't your
[2024-04-06T16:26:16] Кирилл: Is enough to make battery that will let you travel even 150-200km
[2024-04-06T16:30:47] Yamal: Nice⚡️ Just I miss my escooter
[2024-04-06T16:38:15] puneDir: Probably
[2024-04-06T16:38:30] puneDir: Anybody has no hw limit firmware for 84100?
[2024-04-06T16:46:42] puneDir: Done setting it up and it's so smooth compared to 75100
[2024-04-06T16:46:42] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-06T17:47:05] Yamal: Your area,,?
[2024-04-06T18:09:50] NetworkDir: Guys what values on vesc can change to current system. I mean for wheelie i want more torque wheen pressing (Flat)
[2024-04-06T18:10:13] NetworkDir: Now current slowly going to top
[2024-04-06T18:11:30] Unknown: Show
[2024-04-06T18:54:20] Yamal: ‼️
[2024-04-06T19:40:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahahahaha
[2024-04-06T19:41:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes too low
[2024-04-06T19:41:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Speedway Leger yes 😉
[2024-04-06T19:43:14] Face de Pin Sucé: @lBabacar no steering damper on this one
[2024-04-06T19:43:14] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_14066@06-04-2024_19-43-14.jpg>
[2024-04-06T19:43:21] Face de Pin Sucé: It only depends of the rider preference
[2024-04-06T19:43:56] Face de Pin Sucé: RM-X will come with steering damper because pilot prefer for cornering the feeling with steering damper But you can go full speed without it without wobbles

[2024-04-06T20:43:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This u ?
[2024-04-06T20:44:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And is it better then welding?
[2024-04-06T20:46:07] sombre_enfant: I seen a black dt maybe malo or manu one with a damper also...
[2024-04-06T20:59:08] haku: not me. but coudve been me. monkey see monkey do
[2024-04-06T20:59:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Gabolde gee
[2024-04-06T20:59:43] haku: battery lords blessed me with thier knowledge
[2024-04-06T21:01:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes Malo and Manu are using steering damprt
[2024-04-06T21:01:57] Jacob: Hey does anyone know why a mosfet woulndt show anything on multimeter using continuity? Its showing nothing on gate and source
[2024-04-06T21:02:03] sombre_enfant: Pm
[2024-04-06T21:02:46] sombre_enfant: Then its good but the middle leg source should beep with the metal end where u screw the mosfet
[2024-04-06T21:03:55] Jacob: Ah alright i'll check that, just weird the other mosfets are all showing 630
[2024-04-06T21:04:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Do you know what I referenced ?
[2024-04-06T21:04:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like the song haha
[2024-04-06T21:04:52] haku: yes. alice in wonderland yea?

[2024-04-06T21:06:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @Bradhaku
[2024-04-06T21:07:30] haku: lol wtf
[2024-04-06T21:07:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This is what rap sounds to not English speakers
[2024-04-06T21:08:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's a skit
[2024-04-06T21:08:48] sombre_enfant: Ah u test the ir ? I mean beep only to check short
[2024-04-06T21:09:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This is how rap sounded to me 3-4 years ago
[2024-04-06T21:10:39] haku: there are other rap songs in different language that goes hard. mexican for example.
[2024-04-06T21:11:16] haku: or puerto rican
[2024-04-06T21:11:42] puneDir: Anybody has link for nc ignition?
[2024-04-06T21:14:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ofc (maybe harder but you find out in the end that you don't know what you just sang)
[2024-04-06T21:34:59] Jacob: Ah its not shorted
[2024-04-06T21:35:54] Jacob: Hey anyone know whether this i a battery or esc problem?
[2024-04-06T21:36:27] Jacob: I hold the throttle and drives a bit before getting the error code for overvoltage (the system is original)
[2024-04-06T22:21:23] sombre_enfant: All i know is its not vesc
[2024-04-06T22:22:55] haku: its offtopic so all good yea? maybe someone knows sometging about it that can help
[2024-04-06T22:26:29] sombre_enfant: Bro aint nobody here is using this scooter, theres no troobleshooting for these...
[2024-04-06T22:36:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Partly true ,and also hard to say anything without knowing what that is after a dark wrong angle video
[2024-04-06T22:40:47] Gabe Enzo: Fans actually doesn't help to cooling
[2024-04-06T22:41:09] Gabe Enzo: Add a mini NO2 tank in the scooter frame
[2024-04-06T22:41:19] Gabe Enzo: That opens up with a servo via VESC
[2024-04-06T22:41:20] haku: has anyone tested this theory?
[2024-04-06T22:41:34] Gabe Enzo: It's factually correct, there is no air circulation inside the scooter frame
[2024-04-06T22:41:45] Gabe Enzo: The air will get used up (warm)
[2024-04-06T22:41:53] Gabe Enzo: this would work tho
[2024-04-06T22:42:09] Gabe Enzo: For emergency situations like a police chase lol
[2024-04-06T22:42:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In some races they used dry ice if i remember good
[2024-04-06T22:43:58] Gabe Enzo: Theoretically possible to inject NOX into the motor as well via a tube.
[2024-04-06T22:44:07] haku: i think of it like this. the scooter deck is like a pc case. maybe it will help to circulate cold air to it? just my bro science
[2024-04-06T22:44:25] Gabe Enzo: Sure it can work if you have a vent but that's just so much more issues lol
[2024-04-06T22:44:56] Gabe Enzo: Actually entirely possible to inject it into the stator lmfao, that would be absolutely bonkers.
[2024-04-06T22:45:06] Gabe Enzo: Gastards will be seething that electric can use nitrous LOL
[2024-04-06T22:45:53] Gabe Enzo: It would just look like another phase wire going in.
[2024-04-06T22:45:59] haku: i want 120mm noctua fans on my deck
[2024-04-06T22:46:12] Gabe Enzo: You would have to have an exhaust.
[2024-04-06T22:46:23] Gabe Enzo: and air intake valve but you'd have to make sure to clean it
[2024-04-06T22:46:28] sombre_enfant: Bro will have a smartwhip attached to the scooter, balloon might come in handy
[2024-04-06T22:46:30] haku: yes one blowing in and one out
[2024-04-06T22:46:35] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2024-04-06T22:46:39] haku: just an idea
[2024-04-06T22:47:01] Gabe Enzo: Exhaust and Nitrous on an EV would bring up the cool factor ⏫⏫⏫
[2024-04-06T22:48:43] Gabe Enzo: Imagine that paired with field weakening
[2024-04-06T22:48:50] Gabe Enzo: Pretty much unlimited abuse.
[2024-04-06T23:06:47] Jacob: Well agreed, aint mine just tryna help a friend

[2024-04-06T23:12:30] Gabe Enzo: Copper for less voltage sag 🗿
[2024-04-06T23:15:25] haku: ride the algo. keep making videos starboy
[2024-04-06T23:17:03] haku: how much watts can it charge?
[2024-04-06T23:17:21] Gabe Enzo: Can charge 3A.
[2024-04-06T23:17:32] Gabe Enzo: I think I can get a better board
[2024-04-06T23:18:03] Gabe Enzo: Nah nvm ultra fast chargers are 3a max, just checked my laptop charger
[2024-04-06T23:18:12] Gabe Enzo: there is nothing faster.
[2024-04-06T23:18:41] haku: my 40t flashlight gets hot af. too with high discharge cells
[2024-04-06T23:18:59] haku: <video_file>
[2024-04-06T23:19:06] Gabe Enzo: No way that light chugs 160w.
[2024-04-06T23:19:41] haku: it drains it fast and gets super hot when in brightest setting
[2024-04-06T23:20:14] Gabe Enzo: needs some smart whip and an exhaust.
[2024-04-06T23:20:14] haku: its 3 40t in parralel
[2024-04-06T23:20:24] Gabe Enzo: wtf
[2024-04-06T23:20:42] haku: china makes some crazy stuff.
[2024-04-06T23:21:21] Gabe Enzo: I gotta fix a customers ebike and it's genuinely due for pickup in the morning
[2024-04-06T23:21:28] haku: sofrin is the brand flashlight. they pretty good
[2024-04-06T23:21:30] Gabe Enzo: gonna have to stay up cause I've already kept it here 3 weeks
[2024-04-06T23:21:37] Gabe Enzo: Super high wattage
[2024-04-06T23:22:33] sombre_enfant: I want the doggo bro ik it pull all the mom
[2024-04-06T23:23:49] haku: he has his advantages but alot more disadvantages
[2024-04-06T23:24:06] haku: like dog hairs in all your stuff
[2024-04-06T23:48:45] Gabe Enzo: somebody wants me to fix their E lawn mower
[2024-04-06T23:48:59] Gabe Enzo: I'm pretty sure it's brushless. No way they're DC
[2024-04-06T23:52:36] Finn: Open it and find out
[2024-04-06T23:59:12] Finn: Could be anything. Maybe a hamster wheel powered lawn mower😲
[2024-04-07T00:00:23] Finn: <animation>

[2024-04-07T19:48:13] puneDir: Esc = resin Battery = shrink and tape and good batt
[2024-04-07T19:48:20] puneDir: But you can make the whole frame waterproof
[2024-04-07T19:48:34] sombre_enfant: Scrappable resin ?
[2024-04-07T19:48:38] puneDir: Yes
[2024-04-07T19:48:40] sombre_enfant: If so i need link
[2024-04-07T19:48:50] sombre_enfant: But easy removal ?

[2024-04-07T19:49:33] sombre_enfant: Link
[2024-04-07T19:55:02] puneDir: Why kill switch
[2024-04-07T20:03:13] sombre_enfant: Its needed for race, also a security if your Throttle die, but im more a hall Throttle brake but i dont know how to wire both to adc2 With 0-100% hall brake and 25% brake power kill switch if u can ask cenzig
[2024-04-07T20:03:30] puneDir: Use pulldown resistor on throttle instead
[2024-04-07T20:04:25] sombre_enfant: Uhh ?
[2024-04-07T20:04:53] puneDir: pulldown between and and adc1
[2024-04-07T20:04:54] sombre_enfant: Gas Throttle has pull down resistor.
[2024-04-07T20:05:09] puneDir: So if throttle dies it will pull to 0v
[2024-04-07T20:05:12] puneDir: And stop

[2024-04-07T21:02:35] sombre_enfant: Yeah it does where the wire come out of the axle and the side cover

[2024-04-08T08:35:09] haku: angus beef
[2024-04-08T08:37:38] sombre_enfant: Worse 10" high end...
[2024-04-08T08:38:59] Yamal: Well, I know a lot of people with the king mantis and they speak very highly of it and are happy, since you have the vsett 10, the rest are no longer valid, right?
[2024-04-08T09:11:34] sombre_enfant: Nope just that we seen a lot of broken one... Actually about 10in i prefer victor luxury + But anyway if your goal is to mod it all 10in scooter are a bad choice, yeah the strongest actually is the vsett 10
[2024-04-08T09:12:45] Paolo ⁭: Bro, vsett footrest not much better
[2024-04-08T09:12:56] Paolo ⁭: I don't know which one break more
[2024-04-08T09:13:54] sombre_enfant: They updated it no problem now, i had old was broken but had new footrest from warranty
[2024-04-08T09:14:09] Yamal: I agree 10 inch engines are not the best there is almost no repertoire compared to 11" there is a lot to choose from
[2024-04-08T09:15:24] sombre_enfant: Dualtron victor pole is shit but u can put titane one easily and also put 11 inch motor
[2024-04-08T09:15:46] sombre_enfant: Lighter also...
[2024-04-08T09:15:58] Rose: Hey there SEEK, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-04-08T09:23:40] Yamal: The dualtron suspension is great for high speeds, I miss it and I don't rule out seeing a thunder in the future

[2024-04-08T11:25:41] Yamal: battery on the mast is not cool, (main battery)
[2024-04-08T11:25:56] NetworkDir: F I have to clean my eyes
[2024-04-08T11:26:03] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_14092@08-04-2024_11-26-03.jpg>
[2024-04-08T11:26:42] puneDir: Shit
[2024-04-08T11:29:21] Yamal: But your top speed I think is less
[2024-04-08T11:30:23] puneDir: Around 120
[2024-04-08T11:49:21] Yamal: With FW?
[2024-04-08T12:13:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And also on the wrong side 😁
[2024-04-08T12:14:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah sub 13 Makes stuff for ino
[2024-04-08T12:16:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He his more like making custom parts for scoters but yes his biggest thing is the rugged clamp and steering damper for the ox
[2024-04-08T12:17:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mantis neck twists ,you can try just put scooter up on something, and try bend handlebar left or right, not turn And you will see neck parts twists 🙈
[2024-04-08T12:21:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Is the luxury Victor any better in wiring ,single victor is super bad in that, all motor cables forced to shit , it's a mess to change a disc and when you do cable will probably need to be changed coz you can hear broken wires from the inside what's kinda crazy
[2024-04-08T12:21:18] puneDir: 200a phase is a lot
[2024-04-08T12:21:24] puneDir: My motor cable desoldered itself
[2024-04-08T12:22:06] Gabe Enzo: You soldered it bad
[2024-04-08T12:22:11] Gabe Enzo: i saw the picture.

[2024-04-08T12:26:27] Yamal: Before I still have 230A phase infront and rear same
[2024-04-08T12:26:41] puneDir: 180a phase melted my mt60
[2024-04-08T12:26:48] Yamal: Next I think put max 200 rear 180 infront
[2024-04-08T12:27:53] Yamal: And I want to play with FW, before still have 37A and now I want to make less 17A , 0A/21A, don’t know just try…..
[2024-04-08T12:29:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes i know that product, actually i dont like it I mean i dont like dumpener at all ,not sure why you need it since it doenst wobble atleast for me Also reinforcing in some areas,move the force points , i actually Started to see some broken ones after that got populer , i never saw one irl

[2024-04-08T12:38:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I not a fan of raw meet either, i am more like well done 😁 When i want to "eat" pink raw meat that's pretty different 😁
[2024-04-08T12:39:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Any of what you send
[2024-04-08T12:39:58] Yamal: because it has a construction that is not at all normal, or different from what is on the market, it is not the first time I have seen it
[2024-04-08T12:40:08] Yamal: You don’t like Tv Raptor ?

[2024-04-08T12:49:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean the one they give with it when you buy cheapest victor ,sus bearly moves under 100 kg
[2024-04-08T12:54:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Did not see broken ones at all and im seeing those scooters everyday all do I hate them(I had one(inokim ox))
[2024-04-08T12:59:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's basically good ,i saw a few but not irl These you see daily are older models or the newer? New has a weld on the bottom area of handlebar, where it changes shape
[2024-04-08T13:01:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Did not check but seeing both on Daily basis
[2024-04-08T13:08:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I only saw one welded neck one irl ,does look so different for me 🤷‍♂

[2024-04-08T14:55:10] Yamal: weped sonic model,! The reason I am sending this video is because it is going or has arrived in Portugal! our neighboring European country (Spain), and it is a great event to find a model of this type so beautiful and so close!! questions that I still have unverified!! It uses its new electronics (fardrive) FOC technology, like vesc? I know many don't like the brand! if not it's a xiaomi! And if it weighs and is worth more than a Xiaomi! Greetings machines and have a splendid electric afternoon
[2024-04-08T14:55:38] Yamal: I have seen the entire video!!!!‼️‼️🫡😁
[2024-04-08T15:03:14] Face de Pin Sucé: It's been made only for straight lines

[2024-04-08T15:33:18] puneDir: Stock cable is so shit heats up ASF and it's around 1 meter long
[2024-04-08T15:33:41] puneDir: I'm losing power at there
[2024-04-08T15:42:36] sombre_enfant: Well its a waste of material then🤣
[2024-04-08T15:43:55] sombre_enfant: Proof or never happened highkey impossible on your setup
[2024-04-08T15:45:15] sombre_enfant: Yeah overall build on production scooter is shit a jungle of wire, i only meant a decent base for modding
[2024-04-08T15:45:21] puneDir: why tf it's impossible?
[2024-04-08T15:45:29] puneDir: I did 97 on gps and it was still accelerating
[2024-04-08T15:46:02] puneDir: Stock thunder 2 makes 110 with 10.8kw i have more
[2024-04-08T15:46:25] sombre_enfant: Kw dont mean speed i can do 30kw at 50kph
[2024-04-08T15:46:51] sombre_enfant: Thunder 2 dont do 110 even in optimal condition its hard
[2024-04-08T15:46:56] puneDir: I have 12 inch tires They make 120-130 without fwk on air

[2024-04-08T15:47:54] puneDir: I did 97 max to this day I can't do more because it's not stable
[2024-04-08T15:48:11] sombre_enfant: What shocks u have ?

[2024-04-08T16:57:40] Yamal: 🔥
[2024-04-08T17:22:40] Yamal: The reason for that last photo is that I found the hole!!! and it is so small that I see it very feasible that it will fit well by patching the chamber with a bicycle patch to get by while the king of the cobras arrives.
[2024-04-08T17:53:56] puneDir: Guys i want to make e bike

[2024-04-08T19:59:57] Rose: Hey there Benur, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-04-08T20:13:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Welded neck inokim all new has that weld
[2024-04-08T20:14:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Didn't know so no need in a rugged clamp?
[2024-04-08T20:14:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Where neck pole turns wide cubic shape from roundish, bit above folding stuff
[2024-04-08T20:15:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically there is no need at all ,since it's for wobble Also not famous from braking
[2024-04-08T20:15:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The clamp is not for wobble it's for not breaking the stem
[2024-04-08T20:16:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: When you runing rear ASI 2000 and front ASI 855 you have to strengthen that stem
[2024-04-08T20:17:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I run dual vesc
[2024-04-08T20:17:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also here you see what i mean
[2024-04-08T20:17:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Old type
[2024-04-08T20:18:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_14106@08-04-2024_20-18-02.jpg>
[2024-04-08T20:18:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am talking about that weld
[2024-04-08T20:19:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe they don't sell them here (but they are coming from here (the plans at least))
[2024-04-08T20:20:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think these new ones with the weld less good quality or made different place , even the handlebars rubber cover is different and cheapo type
[2024-04-08T20:20:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah i know plans from there
[2024-04-08T20:20:59] puneDir: Why inokims have single side arm
[2024-04-08T20:21:03] puneDir: Is it better
[2024-04-08T20:21:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I keep on forgeting the name who made it
[2024-04-08T20:21:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But half scooter industry copy that or even more than half
[2024-04-08T20:21:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure
[2024-04-08T20:22:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nah , but up to a usage lvl it works nice
[2024-04-08T20:22:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You could do double arm with different motors if you know the how
[2024-04-08T20:23:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Dualtron arms
[2024-04-08T20:23:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Change the suspension cartage and axles
[2024-04-08T20:24:06] puneDir: So it's just a design choice
[2024-04-08T20:25:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably
[2024-04-08T20:25:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes a poor design choice
[2024-04-08T20:26:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He didn't design it to hit 111 😁 Or such
[2024-04-08T20:26:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He ?
[2024-04-08T20:26:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: They are hitting more then that ahha
[2024-04-08T20:27:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Unless it's 111mph
[2024-04-08T20:28:03] puneDir: 111 big Macs
[2024-04-08T20:30:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Was kinda first video like that that was 111 in your area , afterwards upgrade that bitch posted a similar,for now i dunno what they or he reached,but didn't follow his work after swiching to bike
[2024-04-08T20:32:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: My area 😀 (he who....) 😂
[2024-04-08T20:33:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes he switched to the purple monster a long time ago
[2024-04-08T20:34:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure of who that was in the news
[2024-04-08T20:34:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah that was cool too
[2024-04-08T20:35:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I like his style basically
[2024-04-08T20:35:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wasn't me unfortunately 😭
[2024-04-08T20:37:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: You be like mom I want his bike for Christmas
[2024-04-08T20:38:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: All the bommers in the nwes need to mind their own business and not tell us how do we want to delete ourselves or we even allowed to
[2024-04-08T20:41:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure what you mean under that ,all i said that he did nice stuff
[2024-04-08T20:42:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't worry if we had Christmas I would ask for a bike like his also (not come to insult) 😔
[2024-04-08T20:43:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I meant the area hahaha not the guy I don't know the guy
[2024-04-08T20:50:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ahh ,i get it I am more like build my own type

[2024-04-08T21:01:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks liks Co gas catrige for gas pump
[2024-04-08T21:04:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont use such,tire so small ,you will feel it
[2024-04-08T21:04:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Slime would fix this size for sure
[2024-04-08T21:05:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Nitro (nos) 😹
[2024-04-08T21:05:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Air in case of emergency
[2024-04-08T21:07:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We use co gas like that
[2024-04-08T21:08:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Same like the you find in any bubble mineral water or coke or such
[2024-04-08T21:56:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It could be nitrogen gas also ,but not nos😁 Nitrogen lot times used in high performance cars ,coz doesnt heat up like air
[2024-04-08T22:10:35] JPPL: Just co2
[2024-04-08T22:17:57] Yamal: Just teverun lover no?
[2024-04-08T22:20:02] JPPL: Blade/teverun lover yes, Also 11x user
[2024-04-08T22:30:15] Yamal: The teverum fighter 11 looks nice, low compared to the distance to the ground, and this makes it agile and comfortable, from the beginning I saw it as very plastic or many plastic parts but every time I see it more beautiful looking at yours,, And of its older brother the 7260r with a good and powerful battery but I saw some videos that it is not very stable at high speeds,,?
[2024-04-08T22:36:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Of topic fow today https://youtu.be/stZpNO-ygh8?si=fzTvuAhTscQfnrUM
[2024-04-08T22:40:32] Yamal: owl😁
[2024-04-08T22:49:20] Yamal: I would like to try Hope brakes sometime in my life! but it is clear that they are not made for normal working people...
[2024-04-08T22:51:17] JPPL: I want to check that high speed behaviour, seems geometry fails here. About plástic on it is more about protection when scooter falls, it protects really well on teverun. Any Blade or teverun with proper inspection and good shocks(dnm for ex) is a good experiência escooter
[2024-04-08T22:54:10] Yamal: Every time my scooter receives an update I can't resist putting it to the max, to see how much it can deliver...
[2024-04-08T22:55:37] Yamal: My trick is to tell the wife - "I'm going to throw out the trash at night" and just fully loaded I release it on the highway
[2024-04-08T23:00:38] JPPL: My speed testS normally are arround 1am/4am, Alone, sometimes a tell My wife in case i dont get home
[2024-04-08T23:03:18] Yamal: those g300s in the 11x must feel powerful!
[2024-04-08T23:03:24] JPPL: But since i got +150 on 11x i upgrade from 20 to 22s and never tried again to see if ir GOES further (160❤️), Also didnt try This costum teverun to the limit(Will do soon) original GOES near 100 if i Remember
[2024-04-08T23:03:44] JPPL: I think i got little worried with time
[2024-04-08T23:04:14] JPPL: For me amazing deliciosa creamy powerfull
[2024-04-08T23:04:50] Yamal: When you do your speed tests, try to wear a full-face helmet and not wear sandals!
[2024-04-08T23:06:18] Yamal: And another thing that I miss is a good camera, these night tests should be recorded for history
[2024-04-08T23:07:02] JPPL: I have good/overall protection and when i do it Im 100% focus, the fear of fall GOES away.
[2024-04-08T23:08:02] JPPL: My last Ride test with 11x was 6 months ago, have to get back on track to regain confidence
[2024-04-08T23:08:26] Yamal: By the way, I would also love to do Portugal with my scope from north to south!
[2024-04-08T23:08:36] JPPL: Still Booking forward to see 160+ video
[2024-04-08T23:08:57] JPPL: I neber had that chance
[2024-04-08T23:09:16] JPPL: But is 100% amazing trip and possible
[2024-04-08T23:09:33] Yamal: For me the teverun is prettier, less heavy and not with a more sporty and playful look!
[2024-04-08T23:11:51] JPPL: Yes Who knows if One day i mount teverun with my 11x setup
[2024-04-08T23:12:45] Yamal: a lot of speed for 11", but who ever said ?? where I won't drink this water?
[2024-04-08T23:17:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Now you know where name came from😁
[2024-04-09T01:05:25] Yamal: Apollo Pro,,, Geometry?🧐
[2024-04-09T01:06:18] Yamal: https://apolloscooters.co/products/apollo-pro
[2024-04-09T01:46:47] haku: i like punk scooters more
[2024-04-09T03:33:27] haku: im glad ebike guy reviewing only the best.
[2024-04-09T03:34:06] haku: i dont expect nothing less from this guy
[2024-04-09T04:55:20] haku: another dui in the hood baby
[2024-04-09T08:45:31] Happy Giraffe: 😭
[2024-04-09T08:45:50] Happy Giraffe: Potholes after rain and snow
[2024-04-09T09:32:30] Yamal: You move in bicicle ?
[2024-04-09T10:09:13] Yamal: Yesssssssssszzzs
[2024-04-09T10:09:29] Yamal: <photos/photo_14114@09-04-2024_10-09-29.jpg>
[2024-04-09T10:24:55] Happy Giraffe: Yep😁
[2024-04-09T10:53:30] Yamal: Vesc bicycle?
[2024-04-09T11:37:03] haku: thats pretty thickboy. nice
[2024-04-09T11:37:31] haku: you fittimg 2 tronics in there?
[2024-04-09T11:38:09] Yamal: Yes !!!
[2024-04-09T11:38:22] Yamal: Only need know how,,, or the best way
[2024-04-09T11:39:17] Yamal: When arrive home I want ask with some photo what is the better way
[2024-04-09T11:39:28] haku: i was gonna use m4 bolts and thermal paste on mine
[2024-04-09T11:40:39] Yamal: Whether to cut a piece of sheet metal from the nami to screw the heatsink to its ends and have the tronics screw directly into the heatsink, which would be the most optimal, or directly install the heatsink under the sheet
[2024-04-09T11:46:27] haku: i think you can just install under sheet if you dont want to cut frame. i would sand it to bare metal though. i feel bad cutting up a nami. what ever you feel is best
[2024-04-09T11:47:09] haku: <photos/photo_14115@09-04-2024_11-47-09.jpg>
[2024-04-09T11:47:57] haku: this was how i wanted to do mine before. but ill just use a bigger deck
[2024-04-09T12:09:28] Happy Giraffe: Soon will be a mid-drive one aswell
[2024-04-09T13:26:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No time to draw now,work in progress
[2024-04-09T14:02:26] Yamal: Well, I am considering the possibility of cutting the bottom plate, and welding the heatsink underneath instead of screwing it on,,
[2024-04-09T15:05:53] Unknown: Just laying that in the frame? Then there's no transferring the heat outside. Vesc heats heatsink heatsink has small connection to frame and no air. Probably hurting the cooling.
[2024-04-09T15:23:39] puneDir: https://youtu.be/wxr1iXEf9lY?si=sJYsVKe1-l7oyhPP
[2024-04-09T15:23:54] puneDir: Anybody knows this guy? Why this happened? Bad battery build?
[2024-04-09T15:24:03] Yamal: Let's see what the engineers advise me
[2024-04-09T15:34:11] Jan: Make a drawing, side cut frame how you plan to mount it
[2024-04-09T15:46:38] Finn: Ah yes. The sound of Very sad Li Ion Cells
[2024-04-09T16:52:55] haku: this was my old plan. i was gonna mount heatsinks in fromt of stem.
[2024-04-09T16:55:19] haku: like a radiator. open air. i can also put it under the deck but i will need a printed case
[2024-04-09T17:02:54] haku: <photos/photo_14116@09-04-2024_17-02-54.jpg>

[2024-04-09T17:03:32] Yamal: <photos/photo_14119@09-04-2024_17-03-32.jpg>
[2024-04-09T17:04:55] haku: looks good to me. unless you ride in rain.
[2024-04-09T17:05:23] Yamal: Ideally, cut and have the controller screw into the heatsink.....
[2024-04-09T17:06:16] Yamal: I never drive in the rain, the electronics are very exposed, holes in the engines!
[2024-04-09T17:07:28] haku: same. i never do because i dont know how. too slippery😭
[2024-04-09T17:07:48] haku: i use my vsett for the rain
[2024-04-09T17:08:00] Yamal: Do you think I could weld the heatsink to the frame? to avoid having to make holes in the ends, to fix it
[2024-04-09T17:08:01] sombre_enfant: Put it over here
[2024-04-09T17:08:24] Yamal: No place brother
[2024-04-09T17:08:29] Yamal: Add 3cm
[2024-04-09T17:08:31] haku: have someone design you a 3d printed mount
[2024-04-09T17:08:40] sombre_enfant: Why weld just screw
[2024-04-09T17:09:02] sombre_enfant: Dont drill on the tube
[2024-04-09T17:09:18] sombre_enfant: Do a joint with another plater
[2024-04-09T17:18:40] Yamal: <photos/photo_14121@09-04-2024_17-18-40.jpg>
[2024-04-09T17:20:09] Yamal: The idea is to cut that marked piece that is what the controllers occupy and screw or weld to the sides and back, which is what I have left over from the plate.
[2024-04-09T17:24:58] haku: bypass bms i think
[2024-04-09T17:28:03] Yamal: <photos/photo_14122@09-04-2024_17-28-03.jpg>
[2024-04-09T17:29:08] Yamal: cut red line/screw or weld on the green.....
[2024-04-09T17:40:27] sombre_enfant: Measure twice cut 3 time
[2024-04-09T17:49:19] haku: @Happy_Giraffe look at this design easier to bolt a midrive directly at the shaft. https://youtube.com/shorts/fHmOZx7Gq0w?si=vbvdyPfjevQeZVRb
[2024-04-09T17:49:49] haku: for emoto would be good because of gearing
[2024-04-09T18:05:30] Happy Giraffe: Aah it's this one, crap😂
[2024-04-09T18:06:10] Happy Giraffe: Or just use a regular gearbox on moto if topspeed is needed?😂

[2024-04-09T19:04:44] Yamal: Slack ION is okay ,, ?
[2024-04-09T19:16:31] JPPL: Is small Angle but should BE fine
[2024-04-09T19:23:26] Кирилл: Hmm, i think the rake angle vector line looks like a little bit off. This line should go through the center of the bearing axis, not through the center of the suspension
[2024-04-09T19:26:23] JPPL: I Will remake, lines Will Touch on the ground
[2024-04-09T19:28:25] JPPL: <photos/photo_14128@09-04-2024_19-28-25.jpg>
[2024-04-09T19:28:49] JPPL: Still have room, but smaller angle
[2024-04-09T19:30:34] Кирилл: Ye, now its better👍 Will be very maneuverable, and this is even without load
[2024-04-09T19:31:48] JPPL: 👍 true
[2024-04-09T19:32:51] Yamal: The end I think the two brother is the same geometry ,,,,,,,

[2024-04-09T19:55:23] Jan: All terrible
[2024-04-09T19:58:38] Yamal: 😂 🥶 🫡

[2024-04-09T20:02:27] Yamal: Perfect trail and 130kmh
[2024-04-09T20:03:44] NetworkDir: Trail better with 145mm suspension but at all it's zero 10x and C suspension
[2024-04-09T20:03:56] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_14132@09-04-2024_20-03-56.jpg>
[2024-04-09T20:05:06] Yamal: 🔥
[2024-04-09T20:19:32] sombre_enfant: Am i cooked ?
[2024-04-09T20:31:50] haku: c type suspension bad then?
[2024-04-09T20:33:17] NetworkDir: Comport able But wobble on high soeeds
[2024-04-09T21:06:37] Yamal: Cooking soul 🔥‼️😂
[2024-04-09T21:29:23] Unknown: I slid my forks down on the vsett 11 and it made a decent difference. It was high in the rear so its level now and that added more steering angle.
[2024-04-09T21:29:49] haku: vsett 11 doesnt have c type yea?
[2024-04-09T21:32:59] Unknown: Only had slight wobble once on a full speed panic brake situation
[2024-04-09T21:37:27] haku: what color do you have? the captn america one?
[2024-04-09T21:37:34] haku: thats the one i want haha
[2024-04-09T21:37:41] Unknown: Grey
[2024-04-09T21:37:59] haku: thats the newest version yea
[2024-04-09T22:20:29] haku: murika F yea color is best imo
[2024-04-09T22:21:41] haku: @jamessoderstrom why did makuta never made a vsett 11 version? the only good vsett
[2024-04-09T22:22:22] haku: oh. thats the only onw with good geometry yea
[2024-04-09T23:22:19] Happy Giraffe: I'm loosing braincells
[2024-04-09T23:24:34] haku: i dont get it. why not higher than 84v. if the esc can handle it why not
[2024-04-09T23:29:29] Happy Giraffe: He's just stupid, he thought himself that increasing voltage is somehow always not efficient
[2024-04-09T23:43:07] Yamal: <photos/photo_14136@09-04-2024_23-43-07.jpg>
[2024-04-09T23:43:44] Yamal: these are not joking
[2024-04-09T23:44:25] haku: i didnt know those namis came with single arms
[2024-04-09T23:45:11] Yamal: ? Nami blast….
[2024-04-09T23:45:24] haku: yea that model
[2024-04-09T23:47:03] haku: i thought it was full axle.
[2024-04-09T23:52:23] Happy Giraffe: Around the world trip?
[2024-04-09T23:52:58] Happy Giraffe: Laundry basket could hold a decent 20s30p batteey
[2024-04-10T00:26:45] Jan: Is this germany?
[2024-04-10T00:35:36] haku: looks like it. they also wearing the colors
[2024-04-10T01:20:07] Happy Giraffe: But if we are talking the usual overvolt on 48 vs 72v then added speed before uphill already makes it run cooler😳
[2024-04-10T01:20:36] Happy Giraffe: And lets say 48v vs 72v bbshd the other burns at 3000w and other chilling at 5000w (ofcourse we use the higher volt rpm at advantage but thats the point of it haha)
[2024-04-10T01:30:33] Yamal: happy girafe, you who have a master's degree in metals! Do you think I can solder my heatsink to the frame without a problem?
[2024-04-10T01:40:46] haku: i have a degree in masterbaiting too
[2024-04-10T01:41:16] haku: just use thermal paste
[2024-04-10T01:43:25] Yamal: ?
[2024-04-10T01:44:42] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): my hope brakes is hoping the electric braking is enough planning to fix that tho
[2024-04-10T01:45:09] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): the xtech is leaking
[2024-04-10T01:48:53] haku: i misunderstood your question my bad. you prolly want to get that welded
[2024-04-10T01:49:12] Yamal: You want buy hope v4?
[2024-04-10T01:51:29] Yamal: Yeah! I hope to have it ready soon!
[2024-04-10T01:53:50] Yamal: I also want to drive with the hall, if it was smooth before, now it has to be smooth as silk! foc technology! like a wave came into your life😂
[2024-04-10T01:54:21] haku: you were not using halls before?
[2024-04-10T02:01:13] Yamal: Not with Tronic! For the front engine that needed to be fixed, I used hall in the nami with the original electronics and the kelly
[2024-04-10T02:04:45] Yamal: I hope to put it all together, and leave poor Nami alone once and for all! and of course the acceleration tests from 0 to 100 kmh are to come, This is where my scooter really stands out.
[2024-04-10T02:07:52] Yamal: Although there are some details left, such as the front axle, change it for the new steel one, since I have the old one and some breaks were seen in some users and the front shock absorber that is not the original and I have it leaking some oil a little more!
[2024-04-10T02:24:00] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): more like hopes and dreams
[2024-04-10T02:29:12] Yamal: I wear mt7pro and they are without a doubt the best brakes I have ever worn! a whole life braking with the shoe
[2024-04-10T02:30:44] Yamal: to be exact magura Mt7 pro carbotecture, German technology
[2024-04-10T02:32:10] haku: magura is german? good to know
[2024-04-10T02:32:33] haku: no wonder its so expensive
[2024-04-10T02:53:43] haku: mt5 and mt7 is 4 piston yea? what is the model that is 2 piston?
[2024-04-10T03:01:18] Yamal: Mt8 I think
[2024-04-10T03:04:15] Yamal: 😁
[2024-04-10T03:05:20] Yamal: also there are mt7 raceline

[2024-04-10T03:27:55] haku: what is a good brand skinny brakes
[2024-04-10T03:28:25] haku: i dont have much space in the front for even spacers
[2024-04-10T03:52:49] haku: met a dude in the park that was playing remote control cars with his son. he recommended ali express. my ears perked up hearing someone in person reccomend that site
[2024-04-10T05:43:09] rosheee: aliexpress best
[2024-04-10T06:02:00] haku: i tattoo in my chest 2023. the year i discovered aliexpress
[2024-04-10T06:05:51] haku: is it possible to clean excess ferofluid on magnets?
[2024-04-10T06:05:59] haku: like to remove it
[2024-04-10T06:14:21] Unknown: If the shipping wasn't so long it'd beat out Amazon on deals
[2024-04-10T06:14:54] Unknown: Oh those panasonic batterys sold out
[2024-04-10T06:19:36] haku: dam i knew it.
[2024-04-10T06:22:55] haku: with stuff like that if you need it get it right away. dont procrastinate.

[2024-04-10T07:22:29] Yamal: My old thunder , collect the chiken food 😁
[2024-04-10T07:29:25] Yamal: Nice picture!!! What do you think,,?
[2024-04-10T07:56:51] haku: no idea what those mosfets are. only the vesc lords know whats best
[2024-04-10T07:57:31] haku: ubox 85/200 has max amps of 750 wtf
[2024-04-10T07:58:08] haku: more than the x12 24s crazy
[2024-04-10T07:59:17] haku: amy must have made this chart
[2024-04-10T08:22:41] Happy Giraffe: No, I'm just learning them😁 I think it depends on the materials but usually heatsink is alu and frame steel?🤔
[2024-04-10T08:29:44] Happy Giraffe: I think brazing is kinda hardcore stuff to do, maybe you can use thermalpaste and bolt it on?
[2024-04-10T08:33:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What's that laundry box 🤣🤣
[2024-04-10T08:33:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They are more like a joke
[2024-04-10T08:36:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also woman has a face shape of Schumacher
[2024-04-10T08:38:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure if he has any 😅 not to dis ,just saying Also answer is no ,surly for soldering Since not possible
[2024-04-10T08:41:36] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-04-10T08:41:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Eve is in g30? Not sure what you guys talking about 😅
[2024-04-10T08:43:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You cant hard solder Alu bro that only made for steels
[2024-04-10T08:44:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He needs tig if alu / alu , But would be more easY to bolt it🤷‍♂
[2024-04-10T08:46:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Good morning to you too ,i could say i am fine ,just got up And i have funny feeling that my back has some sunburn,what is cool in april in mid EU 😁
[2024-04-10T08:58:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also what a gentleman in the morning 👌 and thanks for the comment 😊
[2024-04-10T08:59:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Should have been answering helmet
[2024-04-10T08:59:48] Happy Giraffe: I think he meant brazing
[2024-04-10T09:00:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Jep
[2024-04-10T09:00:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats so called hard soldering
[2024-04-10T09:00:32] Happy Giraffe: Should be possible tho but surely special materials needed and not easy😳
[2024-04-10T09:01:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brass , heat and borax needed
[2024-04-10T09:01:08] Happy Giraffe: Electro corrosion could happen tho
[2024-04-10T09:01:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure
[2024-04-10T09:01:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also to mix brass with alu ,since its a copper thingy ,not a good idea basically
[2024-04-10T09:02:10] Happy Giraffe: Me too, never brazed anything but after some googling people think its very possible
[2024-04-10T09:02:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean i am unsure if possible
[2024-04-10T09:02:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I brazed lot of things
[2024-04-10T09:03:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is always something mountly what we weld with that
[2024-04-10T09:03:09] Happy Giraffe: Our teachers cant teach it, only the motorcycle guy knew how to do it
[2024-04-10T09:03:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Great for some things
[2024-04-10T09:03:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Can teach flame welding?
[2024-04-10T09:03:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its the same thing just more easy
[2024-04-10T09:04:02] Happy Giraffe: Unsure, they can barely say anything on my TIG welds as they havent done it either that much haha
[2024-04-10T09:04:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if you weld something with flame and doesnt stick you go brass
[2024-04-10T09:04:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I see
[2024-04-10T09:04:25] Happy Giraffe: Flame you mean silver soldering?
[2024-04-10T09:04:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brazing done with flame welder
[2024-04-10T09:05:12] Happy Giraffe: Would be interesting to try that
[2024-04-10T09:05:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Really fun to learn in a way
[2024-04-10T09:05:35] Happy Giraffe: So far only done MIG/MAG, TIG and MMA stick
[2024-04-10T09:05:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also f... Ing dangerous too
[2024-04-10T09:06:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Oxigen is a motherfucker, acetilen is overrated in danger
[2024-04-10T09:08:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you reallly really pro ,you can flame weld alu ,now that's something what is also super dangerous,coz making welding and get whole on fire is a close thing
[2024-04-10T09:09:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably some peak number
[2024-04-10T09:11:03] Happy Giraffe: Paul Brodie stuff😂
[2024-04-10T09:11:56] Happy Giraffe: If I won in a lottery I would just move to live next to him and just drink beers and build eMoto frames with him. Life would be perfect
[2024-04-10T09:17:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure
[2024-04-10T09:18:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I only know or saw one guy able to do that and you cant pay enough for him to do it again ,coz its shit hard
[2024-04-10T09:18:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And only comes up in some situations
[2024-04-10T09:18:51] Happy Giraffe: Check him on Youtube, really cool and skilled guy who builds frames
[2024-04-10T09:19:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If he would exept you 😁
[2024-04-10T09:19:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know the guy
[2024-04-10T09:19:44] Happy Giraffe: Haha, true
[2024-04-10T09:20:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Gotta make some coffe and smoke to get the day Started
[2024-04-10T09:24:55] Happy Giraffe: I changed summer tires finally and going for first ride with them in a while haha
[2024-04-10T09:31:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Imagine we had 27c yesterday and literly you see my watch on my wrist without the watch, i am having better vibes from the sun ,me sunpowered in a way ,makes better mood. Basically Sun and warm does it ,but hey it's me So let us not forget ladies look much better without winter clothes 😁
[2024-04-10T09:43:28] Gabe Enzo: what dimensions are those
[2024-04-10T09:45:27] Jan: Very made up numbers, i look at the ones we used and tested and its all wrong by far
[2024-04-10T10:16:16] Paolo ⁭: What u mean?
[2024-04-10T10:16:56] Paolo ⁭: Honestly looks correct (based on the datasheet)
[2024-04-10T10:19:57] Jan: Tronic 250 and Alubox 85250
[2024-04-10T10:20:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Damn ,should have made pictures Made some weld on some small fuel bike frame , unsure what it was ,only frame before painjob and harley front fender What was more fun coz they fucked it up packing the other two 😅
[2024-04-10T10:21:01] Paolo ⁭: The claimed currents looks right
[2024-04-10T10:21:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Jan talking tested current
[2024-04-10T10:21:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hope he shares numbers for now to compare
[2024-04-10T10:27:23] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): can someone recommend me honeycomb-style 21700 spacers with a total cell distance less than or equal to 2mm? most seem to be 1,2 each segment and therefore 2,4 when linked together
[2024-04-10T10:29:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure if you find such
[2024-04-10T10:29:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @Mirono_escooters and @jamessoderstrom could make it for you ,draw and print both
[2024-04-10T10:40:13] sombre_enfant: I received James spacer 2 day ago perfect fit and fast build and ship
[2024-04-10T11:35:23] Mirono escooters: Print it, buying will always have bad tolrances
[2024-04-10T11:59:00] Yamal: I understand they told me, that for example the A phase are the recommended vs maximum to put, to obtain good returns? We know that the tronic 250 come with 250 A phase but it is not correct, the best thing is to put 200A maximum, in other words I had 230 A front and rear and the scooter sometimes on very strong rides at full gas (it cut me off)"(in strong output)””because you have to take into account that those 230A come with their spikes""" so it is better to put less,,,, correct me if I'm wrong
[2024-04-10T12:08:02] Yamal: This time I would like to put 200A at the back and 180A at the front with half the field weakening, to try it out to see how it goes,
[2024-04-10T12:12:01] haku: agreed. printed holders good stuff. no wasted space.
[2024-04-10T12:14:46] haku: whats wrong with 85/200. they put too op or underpower?
[2024-04-10T12:18:15] Paolo ⁭: Yes tronic is over rated
[2024-04-10T12:24:37] haku: love ali baby
[2024-04-10T12:25:59] Paolo ⁭: Pay attention with your review, Amazon could ban you
[2024-04-10T12:26:29] haku: i never buy there anymore anyway haha
[2024-04-10T12:27:53] Paolo ⁭: I thought American love Amazon
[2024-04-10T12:28:49] haku: i found the light. ali is the way
[2024-04-10T12:29:37] haku: i only need amazon if its a emergency.
[2024-04-10T12:45:32] Yamal: Paolo, I can tell you about my experience with Tronic and that of my friend in his Rion: When he went at 72v with tronic 250, he did not have any type of problem, I have seen him use FW and reach 140kmh with 22/3, doing tests * Today and with 24 s it is around 130kmh without using FW, with an acceleration that takes your arms off and is scary! I have not really had any problems in "street" use, hitting it hard at times, as you have seen, it has been on the circuit when I have seen higher temperature peaks, This time I want to put rubber anti-dust plugs on the type C ports of the tronic, because as you know I live in the countryside and I get a little dust/sand in one of them, a little more,,, only 6 fet for the small ones, I will give you data and information on how to proceed.
[2024-04-10T12:47:30] Paolo ⁭: my opinion is based on people in this group and my friend, since i never tried it i can't conclude any fact
[2024-04-10T12:49:13] Paolo ⁭: @AJAJ1992 and rosche fucked all 10 of their tronic, my friend only when pushed throttle on uphill it was gone, another guy with bike also with very short time the tronic gone
[2024-04-10T12:50:06] Paolo ⁭: but according to the datasheet of components, i can say their claimed specs is absolutey unsafe for it.
[2024-04-10T12:51:04] Yamal: I don't understand, maybe bad installation or bad programming?
[2024-04-10T12:53:13] Yamal: I'll tell you about my personal experience, what I've seen and what I've tried, nothing more.
[2024-04-10T13:01:24] Yamal: nice memories of last summer
[2024-04-10T13:11:29] Paolo ⁭: Does your friend use 120a battery , 250 phase, and 300 absolute?
[2024-04-10T13:19:24] Yamal: NO
[2024-04-10T13:19:59] Paolo ⁭: So that's what I mean, that was their claimed specs
[2024-04-10T13:20:28] Paolo ⁭: I don't mean controller isn't good, but simply the claimed specs are wrong
[2024-04-10T13:36:20] haku: the vesc or the heatsink,?
[2024-04-10T13:37:22] puneDir: According to this 84100 is better than ubox
[2024-04-10T13:59:37] yoann tsobanoglou: Hey guys, friend got his new vesc’s. They are setup in master/slave. One displays a weird FET temp : -73degrees while the other vesc shows the temp correctly. Is there a way to check parameters on FET sensor used ?
[2024-04-10T14:02:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sure you guys not mixing with motor temp? , that usually - something
[2024-04-10T14:07:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Show screenshots of both pls if not
[2024-04-10T14:26:31] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_14142@10-04-2024_14-26-31.jpg>
[2024-04-10T14:26:58] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_14143@10-04-2024_14-26-58.jpg>
[2024-04-10T14:27:04] Jesús: 120a battery 180A front 200A rear and 300A absolute, and 24S battery
[2024-04-10T14:28:10] yoann tsobanoglou: Never seen this before
[2024-04-10T14:56:38] Paolo ⁭: Yes, no not 250a phase
[2024-04-10T14:59:02] Yamal: What you don't know, James! No one in this group knows!!!😁🤪
[2024-04-10T15:03:03] haku: i think green is the best color then orange then red. that means 84/200 has the best rel rds. whatever that means.
[2024-04-10T15:05:00] haku: where did you find this @jamaludin_algarnati
[2024-04-10T15:05:13] NetworkDir: Looks total rds on 12 fet version the RDS 1/2 than 6 fet
[2024-04-10T15:11:25] Yamal: a friend gave it to me
[2024-04-10T15:14:21] Jesús: Rds is a parameter of the mosfet that determines the loss of driving
[2024-04-10T15:25:06] Yamal: okay haku my colleague just told me the origin of the graphic
[2024-04-10T15:25:48] Yamal: "That graph is from an engineer from the esk8 group"
[2024-04-10T16:10:14] puneDir: 84100'S on off system sucks
[2024-04-10T16:10:20] puneDir: I'm making resistor mod to it
[2024-04-10T16:26:29] Mirono escooters: Explain
[2024-04-10T16:26:54] puneDir: It's controlled via stm
[2024-04-10T16:27:30] Paolo ⁭: And so why is bad?
[2024-04-10T16:27:50] puneDir: You need resettable NC switch
[2024-04-10T16:27:53] puneDir: Which is useless
[2024-04-10T16:28:14] puneDir: They could make ubox like ignition system with just 2 resistor and it would be easier than this
[2024-04-10T16:29:01] Mirono escooters: And
[2024-04-10T16:29:27] Gabe Enzo: Who has a used JREV V1 Front suspension set? i am willing to pay full price
[2024-04-10T16:30:21] puneDir: And you can't use key like normal esc
[2024-04-10T16:30:36] puneDir: = easily stolable scoot
[2024-04-10T16:33:30] Mirono escooters: Fair point
[2024-04-10T16:36:15] Paolo ⁭: Bullshit
[2024-04-10T16:36:45] Gabe Enzo: 150% of the normal price. willing to negotiate.
[2024-04-10T16:37:05] Gabe Enzo: This the final thing i need to use PMTs on my pro 2.
[2024-04-10T16:37:45] Gabe Enzo: occasion for someone to make some easy bread here.
[2024-04-10T16:38:54] Jan: Only 3 sets exist
[2024-04-10T16:39:05] Gabe Enzo: Who has them.
[2024-04-10T16:39:08] puneDir: Not bulshit I'm serious
[2024-04-10T16:39:34] Gabe Enzo: Why make something capable of 11inch and then stop making it lmfao
[2024-04-10T16:39:35] Gabe Enzo: ugh
[2024-04-10T16:39:52] Jan: It was never planned for 11inch
[2024-04-10T16:39:53] Paolo ⁭: i mean it dont depends if is controlled by stm or not, depends by circuit
[2024-04-10T16:40:04] Paolo ⁭: @punedir
[2024-04-10T16:40:04] Jan: The difference to the now version is 5mm
[2024-04-10T16:40:09] Jan: for axle position
[2024-04-10T16:40:31] Gabe Enzo: Do you know the people who have it? would you kindly DM them and ask if they would like to make some bread?
[2024-04-10T16:40:43] Gabe Enzo: I dont need to know their name cause customer privacy bla bla bla
[2024-04-10T16:42:04] Jan: Yes i know where all 3 are currently
[2024-04-10T16:42:23] Gabe Enzo: Fucking. Awesome. lmk what they say :)
[2024-04-10T16:42:45] Jan: I need to quickly write them to see if i can post their names
[2024-04-10T16:42:52] rosheee: 1 is on his way 2 le mans
[2024-04-10T16:43:03] rosheee: and he will receive it (he ridin' 11")
[2024-04-10T16:43:08] rosheee: he should receive it today
[2024-04-10T16:43:18] rosheee: but DHL failed (2-3 days they said...8 days and still nothing)
[2024-04-10T16:43:21] Gabe Enzo: How did he order it if its not made anymore?
[2024-04-10T16:43:32] Gabe Enzo: UPS only.
[2024-04-10T16:43:41] rosheee: it was my private one
[2024-04-10T16:43:52] rosheee: and i send it him for testing with 11"
[2024-04-10T16:44:33] puneDir: Can i make it work with key
[2024-04-10T16:44:33] puneDir: Without resistor mod
[2024-04-10T16:45:40] Paolo ⁭: It depends by code not hardware
[2024-04-10T16:46:27] puneDir: I will review and try to make it normal
[2024-04-10T16:46:44] Jan: I wrote the people who have them, one is using it for 11inch the other two for 10inch
[2024-04-10T16:47:42] Jan: If they sell i dont know yet, they will contact you if they sell
[2024-04-10T17:02:21] puneDir: <photos/photo_14144@10-04-2024_17-02-21.jpg>
[2024-04-10T17:02:32] puneDir: 84200 on off but should be same with 84100
[2024-04-10T17:03:24] Paolo ⁭: probabily the fet ntc is missing or gone
[2024-04-10T17:05:10] Gabe Enzo: awesome then the 2 for 10 inch will definitely consider.
[2024-04-10T17:11:29] Gabe Enzo: We got a sale
[2024-04-10T17:12:01] Gabe Enzo: All of my parts are coming from @jamessoderstrom
[2024-04-10T17:12:50] Gabe Enzo: even the v1 lol
[2024-04-10T17:57:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True And kinda shitty coz it's a lie in this way , kinda scam🤷‍♂
[2024-04-10T18:05:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Interesting, me either, what brand is this?
[2024-04-10T18:05:30] yoann tsobanoglou: 3sshull latest batch
[2024-04-10T18:07:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Geometry everyone?(strange bike)
[2024-04-10T18:08:13] Yamal: But what is the problem ?
[2024-04-10T18:08:25] yoann tsobanoglou: Don’t you see
[2024-04-10T18:08:28] Yamal: Wou cool👍
[2024-04-10T18:08:40] yoann tsobanoglou: Slave vesc shows -76 degrees
[2024-04-10T18:08:48] JPPL: Motor temp?
[2024-04-10T18:08:53] yoann tsobanoglou: No

[2024-04-10T18:09:16] yoann tsobanoglou: They are new out of the box
[2024-04-10T18:09:28] JPPL: Só bad temp motor choice
[2024-04-10T18:09:42] yoann tsobanoglou: Not motor temp
[2024-04-10T18:09:47] yoann tsobanoglou: Vesc temp
[2024-04-10T18:09:55] yoann tsobanoglou: Motor temp is on the right
[2024-04-10T18:09:59] yoann tsobanoglou: Not configured
[2024-04-10T18:10:01] JPPL: Sorry sorry my fault, mistake, if is vesc ctrl itself, something wrong
[2024-04-10T18:10:37] yoann tsobanoglou: No way to find firmware, client has to wait
[2024-04-10T18:11:20] JPPL: True, this was previous discussed, maybe someone can help soon
[2024-04-10T18:12:29] JPPL: Ahah its a new! Never saw crazy system
[2024-04-10T18:13:22] JPPL: G300 missing
[2024-04-10T18:17:25] Yamal: but the number it shows is negative, right?
[2024-04-10T18:18:12] yoann tsobanoglou: Yes, but we tried to apply heat, it looks like it variates
[2024-04-10T18:21:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's transformative 😉😉
[2024-04-10T18:29:42] Yamal: have you mounted 3shull?? on what frame?🕺🕴
[2024-04-10T18:30:52] Yamal: Maybe this is not the appropriate channel to talk about it? I'm already lost,,,,,
[2024-04-10T18:34:57] Yamal: Geometry still bad!!!!! 🫣😭
[2024-04-10T18:38:07] JPPL: Yes, lower shocks mounted it seems
[2024-04-10T18:42:37] R3VOLT: Hi , i've no clue about most anything on these cables , i m tryna setup Ubox v2 75v 100A dual for a Vsett
[2024-04-10T18:43:29] R3VOLT: Got the Adc adapter too with the brake thingie i forgot what was that for think it was some compatibility stuff i ve read
[2024-04-10T18:43:33] Yamal: Yes, 150mm, the standard ones being 165mm, the bad thing is that with those on the circuit you touch with the frame on the ground,, I tried that measurement quite a while ago
[2024-04-10T18:44:41] R3VOLT: Have soldered few times , no tinning the wire or adding solder into bullet connectors like i d need soon
[2024-04-10T18:45:04] R3VOLT: Can anyone clear up some things for me ( the whole journey if possible )
[2024-04-10T18:46:32] Yamal: <photos/photo_14147@10-04-2024_18-46-32.jpg>
[2024-04-10T18:46:39] R3VOLT: Which cable is which and how could i hook everything up , got sent a horn but no cables came with it too
[2024-04-10T18:47:54] R3VOLT: Also , i d love to have the Spin Y e brake function for a while till disc brakes arrive to convert to 160 mm and On off function and single dual motor from this :

[2024-04-10T18:59:51] sombre_enfant: Maybe look up on the site since u got the full kit its plug and play, just bad vesc choice and fuse not required
[2024-04-10T19:05:34] R3VOLT: yeah i already been there , nothing to explain the layout of those pins
[2024-04-10T19:05:53] R3VOLT: the adc adapter v2 product page on the other hand been helpful to explain cable color codes though
[2024-04-10T19:05:54] R3VOLT: <photos/photo_14150@10-04-2024_19-05-54.jpg>
[2024-04-10T19:06:26] sombre_enfant: Tell me what u missing ?
[2024-04-10T19:06:53] R3VOLT: spin y momentary buttons back cables
[2024-04-10T19:07:05] R3VOLT: idk which one should i get and where from
[2024-04-10T19:07:31] R3VOLT: and also which cable for the bluetooth module and where does it hook to , CAN slot ?
[2024-04-10T19:07:42] sombre_enfant: Ah u should asked it pre wire for adc v3...
[2024-04-10T19:07:54] sombre_enfant: No to comm2
[2024-04-10T19:08:18] sombre_enfant: Or uart2, but uart is better to use for lcd stuff
[2024-04-10T19:09:18] R3VOLT: <photos/photo_14151@10-04-2024_19-09-18.jpg>
[2024-04-10T19:09:24] R3VOLT: the only compatible cable for it
[2024-04-10T19:09:56] R3VOLT: is this one which fits only on 2nd adc port
[2024-04-10T19:18:10] haku: what version spinny is that?
[2024-04-10T19:18:56] haku: for spinny version 2 you need 4 wires to hook up to adc2
[2024-04-10T19:22:08] R3VOLT: V1
[2024-04-10T19:22:35] haku: <photos/photo_14152@10-04-2024_19-22-35.jpg>
[2024-04-10T19:22:35] haku: <photos/photo_14153@10-04-2024_19-22-35.jpg>
[2024-04-10T19:22:49] haku: this is how i wired dual ubox and adc
[2024-04-10T19:22:56] sombre_enfant: Its directly on the vesc
[2024-04-10T19:23:32] sombre_enfant: Idk why u get spin y if u have adc module
[2024-04-10T19:23:49] sombre_enfant: Best is xiaomi type thumb and 2 resistor
[2024-04-10T19:24:06] haku: idk if its the same wires for spinny v1 and v2. but those are the only 4 wires you need
[2024-04-10T19:24:35] haku: spinny is great. good for regen braking. imo
[2024-04-10T19:25:03] R3VOLT: I had spin y since long time ago , never soldered in place
[2024-04-10T19:27:08] haku: look at the diagram for the adc2 module
[2024-04-10T19:32:28] Unknown: I have a v1. V2 I believe he made easier to set cruise and program. Also more travel for knob. Seems like you would have to set 2 adjustments for throttle or bypass circuit board in spiny

[2024-04-10T19:42:53] puneDir: @fungus93 maded normal ignition to 84100 HP and it's super easy
[2024-04-10T19:42:59] puneDir: <photos/photo_14155@10-04-2024_19-42-59.jpg>
[2024-04-10T19:43:10] puneDir: You only need 1 megaohm resistor
[2024-04-10T20:03:09] R3VOLT: Got that , have watched a Scoota Gang video on his wiring
[2024-04-10T20:06:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you know what it's ment for?
[2024-04-10T20:15:38] R3VOLT: My main concern is why they did not send cabling for those buttons
[2024-04-10T20:15:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean purpose could explain things, I am not really sure it would survive dh tho There is zero pedalling in the video , just moves sus If you stick with pedalling it's common to have sus what you can set stop, atleast in rear part coz sus eats the power you push into the pedal . Not to mention no possible place for a fender , but interesting
[2024-04-10T20:16:03] R3VOLT: Which i ll sure need to hook power on and dual motor functions
[2024-04-10T20:16:16] R3VOLT: Also these for the horn
[2024-04-10T20:16:26] R3VOLT: <photos/photo_14156@10-04-2024_20-16-26.jpg>
[2024-04-10T20:20:05] haku: i used the button for power and headlights
[2024-04-10T20:25:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: its not really made for one device and they dont know if build a skateboard, a boat or a scoot, all kinda needs different stuff ,but all gets what you say around this
[2024-04-10T20:35:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Near, newer spiny you find info on there site , didn't wired just the First type unsure if @jamessoderstrom did or not

[2024-04-10T23:44:15] Yamal: It's cool to have both brake discs on the same side
[2024-04-10T23:52:33] haku: class baby
[2024-04-10T23:53:41] haku: do you know where he put his esc?
[2024-04-10T23:56:28] Paolo ⁭: You can do that only with Chinese brakes, all bike brakes are at left side
[2024-04-10T23:57:37] Yamal: No , never say
[2024-04-10T23:59:01] Yamal: There are scooters with disc brakes on the same side, but not many
[2024-04-10T23:59:35] Paolo ⁭: All of them are like zoom and nutt... Magura hope and similar only for left
[2024-04-11T00:00:04] Yamal: I didn't know James had a king gt,,,
[2024-04-11T00:00:19] haku: i think it might be possible to put it on the right. it will just look wonky
[2024-04-11T00:06:17] Yamal: Let's see, I'm not referring to the right, left, well, but I'm referring to the same side, they look cooler, everything like with more balance, will it influence the driving?
[2024-04-11T00:06:37] Yamal: <photos/photo_14168@11-04-2024_00-06-37.jpg>
[2024-04-11T00:07:28] Yamal: Same side
[2024-04-11T00:07:53] Yamal: <photos/photo_14170@11-04-2024_00-07-53.jpg>
[2024-04-11T00:08:32] Paolo ⁭: Yes as I said, left possible , right only Chinese brakes
[2024-04-11T00:09:50] Yamal: Any scooter that you know with the discs on the same side? factory scooter,,,?
[2024-04-11T00:10:42] Paolo ⁭: Every zero/vsett scooter
[2024-04-11T00:11:50] Paolo ⁭: Kaabo Wolf series and many of no brand scooter like laotie and similar
[2024-04-11T00:12:33] sombre_enfant: U can reverse it anyway...
[2024-04-11T00:12:35] haku: laotie is a brand baby. the best

[2024-04-11T00:13:43] Paolo ⁭: I mean it's actually not a registered brand , only a Banggood name...
[2024-04-11T00:14:01] Paolo ⁭: The factory name isn't laotie
[2024-04-11T00:14:07] haku: stuntin on my laotie, stuntin on my laotie, ill be stuntin on my laotie -lil wayne

[2024-04-11T00:15:37] haku: what is the factory is it geofought scooter or inax or something like that?
[2024-04-11T00:16:01] Paolo ⁭: Yes but you need a special adaptor + the look is not good (my opinion)
[2024-04-11T00:16:43] sombre_enfant: On vsett zero and teverun its all same adapter u can put in each 4 arm
[2024-04-11T00:16:45] Paolo ⁭: I don't know, but the factory is the common of all scooter with the same look
[2024-04-11T00:17:36] haku: you can buy the parts everywhere. do you know the main supplier?
[2024-04-11T00:17:54] Paolo ⁭: You need this no?
[2024-04-11T00:19:05] haku: what size tire is that? 11? and what size disc?

[2024-04-11T00:22:52] Yamal: You need dualtron X limited with Vesc 18 fet

Imo its the perfect base for undercover vesc since they get smaller every month.
[2024-04-11T00:28:54] Yamal: What country?
[2024-04-11T00:29:01] Jonas: Has anybody tried the nodded vescs from aliexpress? I am professional at destroying them would be cool if they are from good quality
[2024-04-11T00:29:20] Jonas: Only germany needs license plate and dual brake right?
[2024-04-11T00:29:32] Jonas: For the autobahn
[2024-04-11T00:29:53] Yamal: Here in Spain “””(license start 2027)”””

[2024-04-11T00:37:29] sombre_enfant: Just choose the option when buying
[2024-04-11T00:38:06] puneDir: You're connecting the module to RS something port
[2024-04-11T00:38:11] sombre_enfant: I will put rechargeable sim tracker in mine idk where tho
[2024-04-11T00:38:24] puneDir: In battery shrink
[2024-04-11T00:38:53] haku: whats a good sim gps module?
[2024-04-11T00:38:58] sombre_enfant: No its a big one and i need to recharge... Maybe i put a induction charger

[2024-04-11T00:49:40] Jonas: The g30 i built is just to much
[2024-04-11T00:50:16] Jonas: I have the feeling the battery is more weight then the whole pro 2 was
[2024-04-11T00:51:00] Jonas: Is it allowed to post if i sell the stuff which will happen soon?
[2024-04-11T00:51:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jonas has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-04-11T13:02:46] NetworkDir: Vesc profile really nice
[2024-04-11T13:03:14] NetworkDir: But need something for changing profile with button
[2024-04-11T13:08:30] Paolo ⁭: @kawaiinekololis lisp
[2024-04-11T13:08:42] sombre_enfant: Ayo display code and 3dp file i pay ofc ?
[2024-04-11T13:10:35] NetworkDir: Yes i know
[2024-04-11T13:11:18] NetworkDir: I share anything on github
[2024-04-11T13:31:51] sombre_enfant: Can you switch off spintend at like 20kph ?
[2024-04-11T13:32:06] sombre_enfant: If so i use remote relay like dualtron
[2024-04-11T13:32:21] NetworkDir: Why switch off at 20km/h ?
[2024-04-11T13:39:26] sombre_enfant: So u can reboot arriving at the policeman
[2024-04-11T13:47:05] NetworkDir: Ah i understand
[2024-04-11T13:57:39] puneDir: We will share after making it nice
[2024-04-11T13:57:40] sombre_enfant: I have it but i need to design a mount for 22 mm handlebar
[2024-04-11T13:57:54] puneDir: Its in folder called yarrak rn :(
[2024-04-11T13:58:36] sombre_enfant: Also need to understand the switch on display and switch on command if i can use them but not the wired Throttle and how to wire that
[2024-04-11T13:59:17] sombre_enfant: No i dont got a stem with handlebar its a full pole with bar
[2024-04-11T14:00:16] sombre_enfant: But for my Throttle ? How do i remove the bundled one and wire mine ?
[2024-04-11T14:00:53] sombre_enfant: I'll design a mount tomorow maybe i forgot to take the mesurement today at work
[2024-04-11T14:02:54] sombre_enfant: I buyed the 6 wire cable so i need to teardown it solder it and seal the display
[2024-04-11T14:04:24] Paolo ⁭: Bought*
[2024-04-11T14:07:50] sombre_enfant: No look crap
[2024-04-11T14:08:23] sombre_enfant: @S1m0n_x know how to open and seal if i remember
[2024-04-11T14:32:59] S1m 0n: How to Open what? Display or Throttle from what? Vsett? Display is not made for opening... A small hole must be drilled in the corner, levered open and then carefully glued back together with a good adhesive (2K or similar). Trottel is simply a sticker... You can easily remove it with warm air and then unscrew it
[2024-04-11T14:37:15] S1m 0n: The photo is all I have left. The pin assignment can be easily deduced from this and is also shown on the PCB

[2024-04-11T15:49:30] Finn: Nice my Ferrofluid arrived👌
[2024-04-11T15:51:05] sombre_enfant: Wich corner u drill it ?
[2024-04-11T16:01:46] S1m 0n: bottom right or left, but I don't think it matters. is completely closed (melted not glued).
[2024-04-11T16:09:22] puneDir: Link?
[2024-04-11T16:10:18] Finn: Amazon😒
[2024-04-11T16:10:51] Finn: https://amzn.eu/d/8TWLSet
[2024-04-11T16:18:43] rosheee: ^^
[2024-04-11T16:20:35] rosheee: question is
[2024-04-11T16:20:38] rosheee: i it the legit one ^^
[2024-04-11T16:20:58] rosheee: Ferrotec APG1110 is the real legit one
[2024-04-11T16:27:06] Yamal: And this is applied as maintenance for the magnets, right?
[2024-04-11T16:28:39] Finn: There is no real one
[2024-04-11T16:29:30] Finn: Ferrofluid is the name of the material and not a trademark
[2024-04-11T16:31:11] rosheee: https://ferrofluid.ferrotec.com/
[2024-04-11T16:32:57] Mirono escooters: Yes but there r types of ferrofluid
[2024-04-11T16:33:11] Mirono escooters: And statorade is made to be for motors : D
[2024-04-11T16:34:17] Finn: Sure. The effect is still the same
[2024-04-11T16:34:52] puneDir: Can statorade make my motor unburnable?
[2024-04-11T16:35:11] puneDir: Or just helps with heat
[2024-04-11T16:35:24] Finn: Sure different manufacture mix different stuff in it to improve heat transfer
[2024-04-11T16:35:35] Mirono escooters: Yes, but it's better..
[2024-04-11T16:36:00] Mirono escooters: Some ferrofluid has super low flash temperature That being said I don't buy the official stuff either. Just read datasheets and compare to ur needs.
[2024-04-11T16:36:03] rosheee: yep
[2024-04-11T16:36:23] rosheee: i hope it is sucé
[2024-04-11T16:36:35] rosheee: ^__^ share data then pls

[2024-04-11T16:37:34] Gabe Enzo: what amps are needed for 65h
[2024-04-11T16:37:41] rosheee: 10 euro difference to statorade
[2024-04-11T16:37:46] Finn: Ok
[2024-04-11T16:37:56] rosheee: i thought about that as well +1-2years ago
[2024-04-11T16:37:57] Gabe Enzo: at 20s
[2024-04-11T16:37:59] rosheee: but tehn yah ^^'

[2024-04-11T16:43:20] Mirono escooters: The ferrofluid of supermagnete.de works beautifully
[2024-04-11T16:43:24] Mirono escooters: Only other i tested
[2024-04-11T16:49:17] sombre_enfant: @roscheeee the diff from 60 to 65h same winding ?
[2024-04-11T16:53:50] rosheee: 65h less kv
[2024-04-11T16:53:56] rosheee: depends on stator as well
[2024-04-11T16:54:28] rosheee: what i can say is that 16s6p m50lt 60a bms 65h torque motor (single) -> fucks my 16s 50h with p42 dual m0t0r 0-30
[2024-04-11T17:08:13] sombre_enfant: But the 65h with 22*3 or 33x2 ? Should have a bit less speed than the 60h in same winding but bit more torque on ground right ?
[2024-04-11T17:22:18] Unknown: That one? https://www.supermagnete.de/schul-magnete/ferrofluid-10-ml_M-FER-10
[2024-04-11T17:24:47] Mirono escooters: Yes been using for ages
[2024-04-11T17:27:43] puneDir: What does ferrofluid does
[2024-04-11T17:31:38] Gabe Enzo: heats magnets.
[2024-04-11T17:31:53] Gabe Enzo: which have less tolerance than the windings.
[2024-04-11T17:38:03] sombre_enfant: Bro is chat gpt advice
[2024-04-11T17:41:59] Mirono escooters: ??!!!!
[2024-04-11T17:42:08] Gabe Enzo: lol
[2024-04-11T17:42:47] Mirono escooters: Get the heat to your magnets and so motor casing quicker to dissapate into the air Between stator and magnets is tiny airgap. Air conducts heat bad. We replace with more thermal conducting liquid, so it allows for more amps before overheating
[2024-04-11T18:29:32] Gabe Enzo: who has a pic of a 70h motor vs a 65/60h?
[2024-04-11T18:42:29] puneDir: Whats the thickest suitable wire for zero motor
[2024-04-11T19:00:28] Rose: Hey there Sto cazzo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-04-11T19:14:30] Sto cazzo: Hi there does anyone know a way to mount a different display on 200A vesc flipsky and also a way to turn off and on the controller without using a switch between the controller and the battery???
[2024-04-11T19:14:47] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-04-11T19:18:23] Happy Giraffe: This or Grintech
[2024-04-11T19:23:07] Sto cazzo: Can you explain?or dm me
[2024-04-11T20:07:27] haku: heating magnets is bad for magnets right?
[2024-04-11T20:14:24] Mirono escooters: Depending on quality. Above 80* can permanently demagnetize them
[2024-04-11T20:14:31] Mirono escooters: Or best quality 120*
[2024-04-11T20:14:46] Mirono escooters: Guess when u race short u dont need Or just holes in side xD
[2024-04-11T20:24:40] Unknown: 248°
[2024-04-11T20:24:56] Unknown: 120° is an Arizona summer
[2024-04-11T20:46:36] haku: thats what we have here too. 120 or 48c
[2024-04-11T20:46:45] haku: gotcha thanks
[2024-04-11T20:48:46] haku: ferro fluid does it really make a difference in temp or is it marketing bs?
[2024-04-11T21:04:27] Unknown: Uses your motors rim as a heatsink. Otherwise the airgap between magnets and coil insulates the heat and stays inside
[2024-04-11T21:13:51] Unknown: It seems odd as your motor feels hotter but that's because it's pulling heat out
[2024-04-11T21:41:57] Rose: Hey there Daniel, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-04-12T06:05:13] Yamal: good morning ,! The manufacturer confirms to me that the frame is made of happy giraffe aluminum, so I think it could be welded well, any professional recommendations? greetings
[2024-04-12T06:07:30] Yamal: This morning I was able to receive a message from SHA TAO himself 🐍❤️😂
[2024-04-12T06:43:49] Yamal: Just ride ‼️‼️‼️😂
[2024-04-12T06:44:39] haku: is that the nami or xiaomi?
[2024-04-12T06:45:54] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-04-12T06:46:26] Yamal: Is Xiaomi man ! Look the handlebar
[2024-04-12T06:47:48] Yamal: I also think that a person could be walking next to me recording the video!😂

[2024-04-12T07:15:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-12T07:34:01] Happy Giraffe: Nowhere near professional but a regular weld cant penetrate that deep inside the middle of heatsink. I would still just bolt it down with thermal paste
[2024-04-12T07:34:51] Happy Giraffe: If welded with TIG/MIG the contract area will stay small between frame and heatsink
[2024-04-12T07:41:14] Yamal: thank you happy giraffe, But you wouldn't cut the piece that the controllers occupy to screw them directly to the heatsink either? And said heatsink screwed by the edges to the frame?
[2024-04-12T07:44:44] Happy Giraffe: Not sure what you are trying to achieve, controller heatsink?
[2024-04-12T07:47:39] Yamal: I mean that to optimize heat dissipation, you should screw the controllers directly to the heat sink with thermal paste
[2024-04-12T07:51:12] Happy Giraffe: Yeah if you cool down esc, I thought you had some other setup. Anyway most controllers shouldnt need a heatsink, only being bolted to frame with paste

[2024-04-12T08:45:14] yoann tsobanoglou: Hello, anyone tried to push spintend 85/200 controllers ? Am pushing things a bit, got a few abs-overcurrent errors thrown at me with 515 phase amps peak surge. And was wondering if I can increase the absolute maximum current to 500A ( keep in mind my motor current max is set at 320a)
[2024-04-12T08:49:38] Yamal: What frame…?
[2024-04-12T08:50:14] yoann tsobanoglou: Scooter you mean? Nami !
[2024-04-12T08:50:47] Yamal: Ah yea I remember
[2024-04-12T08:50:58] Yamal: Your from 🇬🇷,?
[2024-04-12T08:51:17] Yamal: Motor 22/3 for Now
[2024-04-12T08:51:56] yoann tsobanoglou: For now, will upgrade soon to something a bit bigger
[2024-04-12T08:52:07] Yamal: with a little more temperature than the data you sent, you have a heatsink above and below with air inlets
[2024-04-12T08:53:23] Yamal: pass some screenshots of your latest tests with the beast🫣🤩
[2024-04-12T08:54:00] yoann tsobanoglou: Tested on the dyno
[2024-04-12T08:54:05] yoann tsobanoglou: Only rear wheel
[2024-04-12T08:54:29] Yamal: I am learning this and I like to see the data that is returned, such as discharges, temperatures, voltage that drops, etc.

[2024-04-12T09:02:49] Yamal: Fire 🔥 ! Just I like see the numbers!!!! Big Nami!!!!
[2024-04-12T09:08:27] Yamal: Ideal temperatures this time, right?
[2024-04-12T09:10:18] Yamal: How many horsepower has it given?
[2024-04-12T09:12:01] yoann tsobanoglou: Shows on the dyno paper : 12.21 hp and vesc tool showed 14357watts
[2024-04-12T09:12:28] yoann tsobanoglou: Top speed was the same
[2024-04-12T09:12:33] yoann tsobanoglou: 125+
[2024-04-12T09:13:07] Paolo ⁭: Yes but teorically u missed the most important factor, which is air resistance
[2024-04-12T09:13:41] yoann tsobanoglou: The roller on a dyno does exactly that
[2024-04-12T09:13:45] Yamal: With your electronics shouldn't you have higher peak watts?
[2024-04-12T09:14:09] yoann tsobanoglou: Creates huge resistance to simulate outside elements
[2024-04-12T09:14:54] yoann tsobanoglou: This dyno is known to be strict in terms of hp
[2024-04-12T09:15:10] yoann tsobanoglou: Used for drag motorcycles
[2024-04-12T09:16:25] yoann tsobanoglou: And @PaoloWu still waiting on motor question I sent you on messenger !🥳
[2024-04-12T09:16:54] Paolo ⁭: Yeah sorry I don’t use very much
[2024-04-12T09:17:02] Paolo ⁭: Will reply you later
[2024-04-12T09:18:42] yoann tsobanoglou: By the way, couldn’t be happier with those motors from Paolo. It’s a daily driver and abusing it every chance I get!
[2024-04-12T09:19:31] Yamal: Which type..? Just I die with 22*3, no can use other type
[2024-04-12T09:19:35] Paolo ⁭: You did that in single or dual?
[2024-04-12T09:20:01] yoann tsobanoglou: Single
[2024-04-12T09:20:13] yoann tsobanoglou: From the video
[2024-04-12T09:21:07] Paolo ⁭: 600a with single motor?
[2024-04-12T09:21:25] yoann tsobanoglou: No 515 surge
[2024-04-12T09:21:49] yoann tsobanoglou: The 600+ numbers are both
[2024-04-12T09:22:16] Paolo ⁭: Wait so you tested single or dual I didn’t understand
[2024-04-12T09:23:11] yoann tsobanoglou: The two first screenshots are from road test. With both motors
[2024-04-12T09:23:48] yoann tsobanoglou: The video and the dyno paper and the fault code screenshot are from Dyno session only rear motor
[2024-04-12T09:24:13] Paolo ⁭: Do you have vesc data too?
[2024-04-12T09:25:30] yoann tsobanoglou: I was sharing with @roscheeee with tcp hub. We are going again next week better prepared to test
[2024-04-12T09:26:03] yoann tsobanoglou: Because we were getting weird behaviour
[2024-04-12T09:26:23] yoann tsobanoglou: We will log everything with vesctool
[2024-04-12T10:49:53] Yamal: 85/200 pretty performance…
[2024-04-12T10:51:55] Yamal: Can't you use it with more than 85v? I would be the only one (but) but very similar to the Shull, right?
[2024-04-12T10:54:06] haku: very nice! this is with how much battery amps?
[2024-04-12T10:55:35] Yamal: Your ESC Haku‼️😁🫣

[2024-04-12T11:10:15] yoann tsobanoglou: or vesc logs
[2024-04-12T11:11:02] Yamal: No, I have the references for the battery in the "Xmatic" application
[2024-04-12T11:17:44] Yamal: 286A I think
[2024-04-12T11:18:09] haku: it would possie to just tack weld it yea?

[2024-04-12T20:03:21] haku: that price aint bad for a set
[2024-04-12T20:03:37] haku: i thought magura costs more
[2024-04-12T20:04:40] Mirono escooters: Not really
[2024-04-12T20:04:41] haku: i want to keep doing that. i wonder if thats bad for the vesc
[2024-04-12T20:05:26] haku: what you mean papi
[2024-04-12T20:06:24] haku: the price or what he said for scooter?

[2024-04-12T20:13:35] Yamal: Mt5e
[2024-04-12T20:14:43] yoann tsobanoglou: yes with 70mm magnet height
[2024-04-12T20:15:21] yoann tsobanoglou: no , 11
[2024-04-12T20:28:04] Mirono escooters: Not really expensive
[2024-04-12T20:28:30] haku: okay richie rich
[2024-04-12T20:29:01] Mirono escooters: Compared to others 😔😭
[2024-04-12T20:31:20] haku: in my mind i always thought of maguras as expensive brakes. idk why
[2024-04-12T20:35:33] yoann tsobanoglou: i need fatter phase wires
[2024-04-12T20:36:08] Yamal: If your intention was really to do that with the scooter and not reach an unusual top speed, motors with 22/3 windings would have been ideal,
[2024-04-12T20:36:19] haku: what batteries do you have again is it 20s10p p42?
[2024-04-12T20:36:42] yoann tsobanoglou: the unconventional 50s
[2024-04-12T20:36:45] yoann tsobanoglou: 20s10p
[2024-04-12T20:37:55] yoann tsobanoglou: i have old style lonnyo
[2024-04-12T20:38:05] yoann tsobanoglou: with phase wires from axle shaft
[2024-04-12T20:38:11] yoann tsobanoglou: so not 10mm
[2024-04-12T20:38:17] yoann tsobanoglou: 7/8 max
[2024-04-12T20:38:49] yoann tsobanoglou: and since I run vss, i will remove phase wires and install bigger phase cables
[2024-04-12T20:40:39] Yamal: Regarding whether it is good or bad for vesc, from my point of view"" everything depends on the temperatures, you wear large controllers, however in summer try to do it more at night, do it from time to time on your outings I don't think there will be any problem, but of course doing it over and over again with a high ambient temperature may or may not be bad, having in front of you the temperature of your electronics to see that it does not exceed 60 degrees for safety, I think it is fine....
[2024-04-12T20:40:44] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_14203@12-04-2024_20-40-44.jpg>
[2024-04-12T20:40:52] yoann tsobanoglou: This is when I got them
[2024-04-12T20:41:09] haku: wow. thats crazy you can get these batteries to pull this much power. gj
[2024-04-12T20:41:26] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_14204@12-04-2024_20-41-26.jpg>
[2024-04-12T20:42:15] yoann tsobanoglou: Opened them to install new cables for temp sensor
[2024-04-12T20:43:15] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_14205@12-04-2024_20-43-15.jpg>
[2024-04-12T20:43:41] yoann tsobanoglou: And separated phase with extra sleeves to help with heat
[2024-04-12T20:43:45] haku: those phase wires already too thick wow
[2024-04-12T20:44:39] yoann tsobanoglou: They look 40% thicker than what they are
[2024-04-12T20:45:24] haku: yea. i dont really care for top speed. im too scared to go fast on a scoot. specially on a laotie haha
[2024-04-12T21:02:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Would need a more clean version ,if we can ask
[2024-04-12T21:02:57] puneDir: I will draw a better one

[2024-04-12T21:50:27] Yamal: https://youtube.com/watch?v=3r7Fi3p5gak&feature=shared
[2024-04-12T21:50:29] haku: set means just 1 caliper and brake levers?
[2024-04-12T21:50:56] haku: i never connected ebrakes for my china scooter
[2024-04-12T21:51:58] haku: this one comes with e brake sensors? the one i linked?
[2024-04-12T21:52:26] Paolo ⁭: No I mean a pair
[2024-04-12T21:52:47] haku: not a pair
[2024-04-12T21:53:10] Paolo ⁭: So the price is normal
[2024-04-12T21:53:23] haku: Magura MT5e eBike Disc Brake | Jenson USA https://www.jensonusa.com/Magura-MT5e-eBike-Disc-Brake

[2024-04-12T22:04:21] Unknown: Well I get an answer here in 2 min, 8 hrs nothing with Nuc think I made up my mind. 2 controllers 1 Bluetooth 1 light board and do I need wire connectors?

[2024-04-12T22:04:56] Unknown: And a used cell phone for a display
[2024-04-12T22:06:26] haku: if only 1 ill use it as rear and use dual piston on front
[2024-04-12T22:07:29] haku: i dont need to connect ebrake in front anyway for burnout reasons
[2024-04-12T22:13:52] Yamal: I don't have brake sensors, turn signals, lights or anything connected to the battery other than the controllers. I chose to remove everything.
[2024-04-12T22:13:58] haku: idk if i can fit thick maguras in front. clearance is tight
[2024-04-12T22:16:18] haku: whats that?
[2024-04-12T22:16:45] haku: if they send me one ill tell them they bamboozled me and ask for another.
[2024-04-12T22:16:56] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-04-12T22:16:59] Unknown: Have xt150 on my wires already so I'll just swap vesc side. Why dual xt90 can I use one as power out if I keep it on lower power for now? I have their switch for lights already. It's 12v signal to the light board or 5v shit.
[2024-04-12T22:16:59] puneDir: Only gas (rwd mode)
[2024-04-12T22:17:00] haku: gotcha
[2024-04-12T22:17:04] puneDir: Not pulling stem
[2024-04-12T22:17:10] puneDir: Insane power
[2024-04-12T22:17:42] Unknown: Because I'm about to press buy lol

[2024-04-12T22:23:08] haku: someday i want that too
[2024-04-12T22:24:04] Yamal: ah! but what you want to buy are brake discs, I thought it was the set of calipers and levers...
[2024-04-12T22:26:04] Unknown: I'm officall
[2024-04-12T22:27:56] haku: nice bro!
[2024-04-12T22:29:06] Unknown: (2) 85V 250a
[2024-04-12T22:30:12] Unknown: They're thinner so when I go bonkers I can put them under the scoot in a skid pan and fill the battery tray. That's 20s max?
[2024-04-12T22:30:48] haku: ill definetly wait for you to connect yours first so i can be lazy and just ask you how
[2024-04-12T22:31:09] Unknown: Then 20s so can make an extended battery for scoot or segway from my stock battery.
[2024-04-12T22:31:11] Yamal: https://youtu.be/rtP2HbZBS9I?si=qfV-82dkc7wDmiYW
[2024-04-12T22:31:32] haku: still get those nuculars fixed.
[2024-04-12T22:31:40] Unknown: Trickle down I'll be asking James technical and you asking me wiring
[2024-04-12T22:32:15] Unknown: Yeah and sell them, keep the 24f on the segway just because I don't want to redo it
[2024-04-12T22:33:44] Gabe Enzo: jesus that is massive for 11
[2024-04-12T22:40:06] haku: @jamessoderstrom is it possible to use mt5e on the back and regular mt5 in front?
[2024-04-12T22:41:09] haku: i know dumb question but mt5 is the same brakes without the ebrake yea?
[2024-04-12T22:41:25] haku: same levers too?
[2024-04-12T22:41:35] haku: oh ok i see
[2024-04-12T22:41:46] haku: gotcha
[2024-04-12T22:43:47] haku: dam i dont want to pay full price for another mt5. i guess ill wait for another sale
[2024-04-12T22:44:19] haku: maybe use zoom brakes infront for now till i get another one 😭
[2024-04-12T22:45:46] Unknown: Idk inside for now but we will see mabey make a bigger deck.
[2024-04-12T22:46:03] haku: what is a fair price for mt5e or mt5 with levers?
[2024-04-12T22:46:37] haku: that would be badass
[2024-04-12T22:47:21] haku: you can also jank ot and mount it infront of dual stems
[2024-04-12T22:48:06] Unknown: I don't know if they even gonna fit inside now lol
[2024-04-12T22:48:45] Unknown: Let me do some metric to freedom wizardry
[2024-04-12T22:50:36] Unknown: Like a bug in a rug to the mm or .0 something

[2024-04-12T22:58:08] haku: idk how @AJAJ1992 fit that on a g30.
[2024-04-12T22:59:10] Unknown: How do you afford these things
[2024-04-12T22:59:16] haku: even dual 100/100 need to cut ears to fit it
[2024-04-12T22:59:28] haku: i get it on sale bro.
[2024-04-12T23:00:05] haku: i never bought anything at full price
[2024-04-12T23:02:22] Unknown: Can't take it with you and they can't have it back when your gone
[2024-04-12T23:03:48] haku: also these are spintends not like how much nucular and tronics are lol
[2024-04-12T23:05:09] Unknown: I paid double for the unicorns I killed
[2024-04-12T23:06:10] haku: i think your the only one that has those in the US. dont know anyone with it
[2024-04-12T23:06:15] Unknown: Rare birds with absolutely no stock anywhere. I think they're heading downhill supposed to be released this year but nothing still. Only surron shit
[2024-04-12T23:06:44] Unknown: My CT buddy sold me on them. Only modder I knew 3 yrs ago
[2024-04-12T23:36:29] Jan: You only need 1year of trying and believe in it or hydraulic press 😬
[2024-04-12T23:37:47] Jan: 20S6P 550A bms + 2x 85250 all internal g30, but needs 30mm spacer

[2024-04-13T00:04:14] Jan: Worst lever ive ever had
[2024-04-13T00:04:32] Jan: Plastic threads and plastic screws
[2024-04-13T00:08:06] haku: caved in and got the ams. gonna make multicolred rainbow battery holders 😂
[2024-04-13T00:08:59] haku: how does it perform though?
[2024-04-13T00:10:20] haku: daym. thats all engineering to fit all that
[2024-04-13T00:11:11] haku: @AJAJ1992 is it easy to connect an ams?
[2024-04-13T00:12:30] Jan: Its good

[2024-04-13T01:49:12] haku: fixed my pump baby. penny saved is a penny earned 😂
[2024-04-13T01:50:07] haku: nice to see qs8 on that
[2024-04-13T01:56:43] Yamal: nice engines, how many months do you have left to get it running?
[2024-04-13T02:06:42] Yamal: When you finish it you will think, Why haven't I finished it before...? I've been without the escooter for a month and it seems like I've had it for a year 😂
[2024-04-13T02:20:25] haku: lol. idk bro. working on it slowly. getting distracted witg other stuff
[2024-04-13T02:21:33] haku: i dont even know why im inflating the tire. im not using it haha
[2024-04-13T03:01:27] Unknown: It's only flat on the bottom
[2024-04-13T07:14:37] Yamal: I hope that in the remainder of the month it will be ready, the good weather is here and we have to take advantage, the routes, the kilometers on the road and the adventures begin!!! Tomorrow I remove the battery and controller and start to consider everything around the heatsink.
[2024-04-13T07:17:57] haku: i need to make these keychains first then ill finish battery then scooter hehe
[2024-04-13T07:18:20] haku: important for the scooter to have a keychain
[2024-04-13T07:19:53] haku: i also need to make this. it will give scooter +500 watts
[2024-04-13T07:23:33] Yamal: but is your 3D printer ok? A few weeks ago you mentioned any problems...?
[2024-04-13T07:24:01] haku: yea its fine now. its just some bad filaments
[2024-04-13T07:24:24] Yamal: When are you going to print some miniature scooters? that would be good
[2024-04-13T07:25:23] haku: hehe if i find some files. i cant design yet
[2024-04-13T07:30:29] Yamal: The truth is that I miss many things about scooters
[2024-04-13T07:31:24] haku: hehe same. i want to finish mine already but making sure everything is perfect.
[2024-04-13T07:32:26] Yamal: Sometimes I think, there is no movie or game yet,, They could do a fast and furious thing but it would be great for escooteer! a movie where the main theme is racing and e-scooter preparation!!!
[2024-04-13T07:33:13] Yamal: Maybe one day you can get involved in Hollywood and propose it to the industry!!!
[2024-04-13T07:36:09] Yamal: Many movies could come out on this topic, likewise one focused on the industry and manufacturing in China,😂🚀
[2024-04-13T07:37:28] Yamal: I'm tired of hearing about series,,, I saw the rings of power last year and I haven't watched TV since then,, waiting for the second season,, I'm moving on from TV😂
[2024-04-13T09:39:06] Gabe Enzo: is that 11x4?
[2024-04-13T09:39:08] Gabe Enzo: tyres
[2024-04-13T10:13:01] yoann tsobanoglou: 110x6.5 pmt B tire
[2024-04-13T10:22:14] Gabe Enzo: 6.5 inch wide?
[2024-04-13T10:29:41] yoann tsobanoglou: https://fastride.fr/fr/pmt-pneu/240-pneu-pmt-11055r65-slick-b-radial.html
[2024-04-13T10:30:30] Gabe Enzo: that is very cheap. do they send to EU?
[2024-04-13T10:30:38] Gabe Enzo: I will order my 11x4s from there
[2024-04-13T10:31:42] yoann tsobanoglou: Yes, I buy from there and they send to Greece.
[2024-04-13T10:32:06] puneDir: man why the inside space of zero 10x is so small
[2024-04-13T10:32:17] yoann tsobanoglou: B is hard compound because in summer we get 35+ degrees and t41 last only 1000km
[2024-04-13T10:32:17] puneDir: I can't find a way to cool my 84100s
[2024-04-13T10:32:38] Gabe Enzo: show
[2024-04-13T10:37:19] puneDir: <photos/photo_14215@13-04-2024_10-37-19.jpg>
[2024-04-13T10:37:19] puneDir: <photos/photo_14216@13-04-2024_10-37-19.jpg>
[2024-04-13T10:37:46] puneDir: Old pic but I only have this much of space With 75100s i was able to get well cooled escs cuz MOSFETs we're on the sides
[2024-04-13T10:37:58] puneDir: But with 84100 MOSFETs are on the back so I can't keep them cold
[2024-04-13T10:38:03] Gabe Enzo: you shouldve built the cell a different shape
[2024-04-13T10:38:36] puneDir: I wanted to put biggest battery i can into frame
[2024-04-13T10:38:44] Gabe Enzo: why no bag?
[2024-04-13T10:38:49] puneDir: There's also bag
[2024-04-13T10:39:08] puneDir: 20s11p total (thinking about another 5p)
[2024-04-13T10:39:12] Gabe Enzo: how do you pull 10kw with fucking nickel
[2024-04-13T10:39:31] puneDir: 4x nickel 70a internal 40a external
[2024-04-13T10:39:36] Gabe Enzo: then you have to rebuild everything
[2024-04-13T10:39:47] Gabe Enzo: to make 20s16p
[2024-04-13T10:39:54] puneDir: No
[2024-04-13T10:40:12] puneDir: 20s9p on stem with custom mountings 20s7p inside
[2024-04-13T10:40:34] Gabe Enzo: couldve dropped the 2p on the bag cause it makes no sense anyway
[2024-04-13T10:40:39] haku: how wide are your ly rims?
[2024-04-13T10:40:52] puneDir: I have 4p rn not 2p
[2024-04-13T10:40:58] puneDir: 4+5+7
[2024-04-13T10:41:20] Gabe Enzo: I would rebuild the cell, plan it accordingly and possible mount the BMS in such a spot that doesnt use up too much space.
[2024-04-13T10:41:25] puneDir: I want to beat up Yamaha Mt25 that's why I'm pushing so hard
[2024-04-13T10:41:27] Gabe Enzo: BMS external of the cell.
[2024-04-13T10:41:45] Gabe Enzo: plan where to put escs before building the cell
[2024-04-13T10:41:47] puneDir: I did that and it's this battery
[2024-04-13T10:42:03] puneDir: Bro elshan did that He only have 20s5p internal 😔
[2024-04-13T10:42:25] yoann tsobanoglou: Don’t remember exactly , quite wide 85mm
[2024-04-13T10:42:42] yoann tsobanoglou: 145mm dropout
[2024-04-13T10:42:59] puneDir: @mrstealyogirI maybe i can put the escs under battery
[2024-04-13T10:43:16] puneDir: Or to the upper cover
[2024-04-13T10:43:34] Gabe Enzo: I was just about to say that.
[2024-04-13T10:43:44] Gabe Enzo: Yeah you can but you need a metal plate for the top no
[2024-04-13T10:43:51] puneDir: I already have
[2024-04-13T10:44:03] Gabe Enzo: im thinking of putting my escs on top and batt on bottom. more logical vhere
[2024-04-13T10:44:09] Gabe Enzo: OK then its a project
[2024-04-13T10:44:12] puneDir: Yes also good idea
[2024-04-13T10:44:20] puneDir: Time to open up zero again :D
[2024-04-13T10:44:29] Gabe Enzo: hopefully you can manage with no rewelding
[2024-04-13T10:44:50] Gabe Enzo: im finishing off my 20s8p weld rn
[2024-04-13T10:45:22] Gabe Enzo: batt on top provides protection against a bottom plate collision tho, so im a bit stuck on choice.
[2024-04-13T10:45:32] Gabe Enzo: escs on top should provide better cooling.
[2024-04-13T10:45:41] haku: very nice thanks. im glad pmt fit that rim
[2024-04-13T10:46:09] puneDir: I'm never touching that beautiful battery :D
[2024-04-13T10:46:25] yoann tsobanoglou: Not for track, as turning is quite more difficult
[2024-04-13T10:54:47] Gabe Enzo: you shouldve done honeycomb so its compressed vertically, for more space for the escs. But either way the other method will work
[2024-04-13T10:55:03] haku: those kind of slicks isnt too soft. wont melt in the summer heat yea?
[2024-04-13T10:55:15] Gabe Enzo: the B version is more rough he said
[2024-04-13T10:56:15] haku: summers here are brutal 48c
[2024-04-13T10:58:01] Gabe Enzo: we got 26
[2024-04-13T10:58:11] Gabe Enzo: 30 absolute maximum one day a year
[2024-04-13T10:58:23] Gabe Enzo: thats asking for alot
[2024-04-13T10:58:31] Gabe Enzo: its moreso the sun that is here in summer, thats it.

[2024-04-13T11:38:55] puneDir: How can i push it without drilling
[2024-04-13T11:44:42] Gabe Enzo: springs, or foam
[2024-04-13T11:44:57] Gabe Enzo: you mean push the fets?
[2024-04-13T11:48:48] puneDir: Nevermind I'm drilling
[2024-04-13T11:49:24] puneDir: Won't be reliable otherwise
[2024-04-13T14:10:28] Rose: Hey there Jay, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-04-13T14:14:53] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-04-13T14:15:28] GABE: I have a session on my computer but apparently I need to get the code on a phone
[2024-04-13T14:15:34] GABE: so I'm fucked cause that number doesn't exist
[2024-04-13T14:15:47] GABE: It wasn't like this 6 months ago, they changed it. used to be no issue

[2024-04-13T14:20:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-13T14:31:26] GABE: Yeah that's how my pro 2 build is going at the moment as well.
[2024-04-13T14:31:43] GABE: Lucky.
[2024-04-13T14:32:10] puneDir: How does phase amps work I set 180a phase Vss Bemf decoupling And it's wheeling with only throttle (I'm 90 kg!)
[2024-04-13T14:32:21] GABE: Would a copper tab here, for absolute minus be enough for 360a?
[2024-04-13T14:32:23] puneDir: Never seen something that powerfull
[2024-04-13T14:32:35] GABE: Lmao
[2024-04-13T14:32:40] puneDir: 360a?
[2024-04-13T14:32:51] GABE: Well, peak, but I like to assume everything is constant
[2024-04-13T14:32:55] GABE: Safer.
[2024-04-13T14:33:08] GABE: Robuster build, less worries
[2024-04-13T14:33:20] puneDir: Bro 360a is not something usefull for Xiaomi your frame will turn into 100 pieces
[2024-04-13T14:33:38] GABE: Nah I'll only be cruising at 70kmh bro
[2024-04-13T14:33:45] puneDir: Ah yes good thing I do that too
[2024-04-13T14:33:47] GABE: I'll barely be pulling 5kw 247
[2024-04-13T14:34:05] puneDir: Wish I also done copper Less work
[2024-04-13T14:34:17] GABE: U can send me cells and I'll weld them lol
[2024-04-13T14:34:19] GABE: whatever
[2024-04-13T14:34:28] GABE: Yeah but expensive equipment to weld
[2024-04-13T14:34:39] puneDir: My welder can do it
[2024-04-13T14:34:48] GABE: Why did you go for it lmfao
[2024-04-13T14:36:09] puneDir: Idk :D
[2024-04-13T14:36:11] GABE: The peak will only be used to get out of red lights.
[2024-04-13T14:36:17] GABE: So I can get to uni faster
[2024-04-13T14:36:21] GABE: so I'm going for 65h.
[2024-04-13T14:36:23] GABE: more torque.

[2024-04-13T14:36:33] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jay has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-13T14:36:37] puneDir: 360a will make cables dance
[2024-04-13T14:37:02] Mirono escooters: Why do y'all hate math so much??
[2024-04-13T14:37:38] puneDir: Maybe he doesn't have ir tester
[2024-04-13T15:09:13] Mirono escooters: Ir tester? For copper?
[2024-04-13T15:09:18] Mirono escooters: Do math..

[2024-04-13T15:22:54] GABE: <photos/photo_14224@13-04-2024_15-22-54.jpg>
[2024-04-13T15:23:02] GABE: damnit
[2024-04-13T15:23:05] Mirono escooters: Its literally just resistance of copper wich is found online and the surface area of ur copper
[2024-04-13T15:23:21] Mirono escooters: Lol I made same mistake. That's for fixing drywall
[2024-04-13T15:23:31] GABE: Not really
[2024-04-13T15:23:38] GABE: it's sticky I guess
[2024-04-13T15:23:50] GABE: I might just use 100% kapton
[2024-04-13T15:24:01] GABE: I have a butt load
[2024-04-13T15:24:06] deadword: Thanks

[2024-04-13T15:29:09] GABE: .l
[2024-04-13T15:29:28] haku: whats that?
[2024-04-13T15:29:43] GABE: 2x copper
[2024-04-13T15:29:48] GABE: 0.1
[2024-04-13T15:30:10] haku: with nickel on between?
[2024-04-13T15:30:15] GABE: iron
[2024-04-13T15:30:29] GABE: <photos/photo_14226@13-04-2024_15-30-29.jpg>
[2024-04-13T15:30:34] GABE: this is how I do it. I draw over it
[2024-04-13T15:31:24] haku: wait its battery then copper then plated steel then another copper then played steel?
[2024-04-13T15:31:45] GABE: Yeah
[2024-04-13T15:32:17] haku: cool
[2024-04-13T15:32:19] GABE: <photos/photo_14227@13-04-2024_15-32-19.jpg>

[2024-04-13T15:32:29] haku: nice
[2024-04-13T15:32:43] GABE: Now have to do it without shorting the cell
[2024-04-13T15:32:44] GABE: imagine
[2024-04-13T15:32:50] GABE: I'm stoned as hell too
[2024-04-13T15:33:00] haku: idk about that double sandwich though
[2024-04-13T15:33:11] GABE: James said it's fine. Trust the battery lords.
[2024-04-13T15:33:57] haku: oh my bad.
[2024-04-13T15:34:31] Finn: First try of ferrofluid
[2024-04-13T15:34:43] Finn: Padh motor is cooked
[2024-04-13T15:35:16] haku: this looks good.
[2024-04-13T15:35:42] haku: i was hoping to have the prettiest battery build dammit
[2024-04-13T15:36:36] GABE: We saving copper out here boys
[2024-04-13T15:36:44] GABE: making two parts out of 1 cut
[2024-04-13T15:40:28] haku: what happened?
[2024-04-13T15:43:45] Finn: 80A Phase + 15A fw
[2024-04-13T15:44:09] Finn: On modified ninebot controller 72V 4kw
[2024-04-13T15:44:53] haku: did the windings cook or just that blue stuff?
[2024-04-13T15:46:25] haku: good to know that stock ninebot can take that power
[2024-04-13T15:50:47] GABE: could be halls
[2024-04-13T15:51:39] Finn: Halls?
[2024-04-13T15:53:22] GABE: Yea
[2024-04-13T15:53:29] GABE: windings look fine
[2024-04-13T15:53:37] GABE: they should be black
[2024-04-13T15:59:46] haku: thats used for old school casts. save it you might need it after you build this scooter
[2024-04-13T16:01:20] Happy Giraffe: HopeV4🔥
[2024-04-13T16:03:56] haku: hope i can afford that. i got these because on sale lol
[2024-04-13T16:05:00] haku: $97 for levers and caliper. i hope thats not too bad
[2024-04-13T16:08:35] Happy Giraffe: Brake calipers the best investment as good ones will work for many years😁
[2024-04-13T16:09:16] Happy Giraffe: Tho idk if 3mm discs are made in 160/180 sizes for scooters
[2024-04-13T16:09:20] haku: when i upgrade to something seated someday ill consider hope
[2024-04-13T16:09:46] Happy Giraffe: Its worth saving one more month for best brakes on the planet
[2024-04-13T16:09:49] Yamal: England vs Germany!!!
[2024-04-13T16:10:05] Happy Giraffe: CNC alu vs Plastic (my 20 year old hopes smoke my maguras)
[2024-04-13T16:10:32] haku: zoom china brakes never gave me a hard time honestly. i just bought maguras because of the hype.
[2024-04-13T16:10:58] haku: but the vsett mechanical brakes is a different story
[2024-04-13T16:11:13] Yamal: 500€ vs 200€
[2024-04-13T16:11:39] haku: shimano is also good
[2024-04-13T16:11:43] haku: japan baby
[2024-04-13T16:12:29] Happy Giraffe: Yeah well worth it if you ask me👀
[2024-04-13T16:13:29] Happy Giraffe: 80kmh+ speeds I dont let any critical parts to have plastic
[2024-04-13T16:13:32] haku: moto brakes on scooter should be a thing by now. with how fast scooters are getting it needs proper moto brakes
[2024-04-13T16:14:05] Yamal: Mt7 pro better
[2024-04-13T16:14:30] Happy Giraffe: Those are quite expensive haha, might aswell get hope v4
[2024-04-13T16:14:31] Yamal: at least the handle is less plastic
[2024-04-13T16:14:56] Yamal: Brembo 👌
[2024-04-13T16:16:38] Yamal: <photos/photo_14230@13-04-2024_16-16-38.jpg>
[2024-04-13T16:16:51] Yamal: 🤯
[2024-04-13T16:17:29] haku: that should be a standard for high power builds imo
[2024-04-13T16:18:24] haku: its the most reliable way to stop real fast. specially on a scooter
[2024-04-13T16:19:47] GABE: <photos/photo_14232@13-04-2024_16-19-47.jpg>
[2024-04-13T16:21:06] haku: can i see both sides?
[2024-04-13T16:21:14] Yamal: I directly believe that happy giraffe is a millionaire

[2024-04-13T16:21:29] GABE: <photos/photo_14234@13-04-2024_16-21-29.jpg>
[2024-04-13T16:21:50] haku: good job. now you gonna double the copper yea?
[2024-04-13T16:22:18] GABE: Yeah, then I wrap with kapton, then I make a box prototype and send @Happy_Giraffe the measurements
[2024-04-13T16:22:35] GABE: So quite some stuff to do.
[2024-04-13T16:22:45] GABE: Hopefully finished by evening
[2024-04-13T16:23:02] GABE: Then after this I do alll my uni work and study for my exams
[2024-04-13T16:23:53] haku: are you doing dual motor or single?
[2024-04-13T16:25:46] GABE: If I don't do the uni online work I don't pass.
[2024-04-13T16:25:51] GABE: dual 65h
[2024-04-13T16:25:57] haku: he is finlands #1 gun smuggler
[2024-04-13T16:26:00] GABE: I just realized I now possess a cell capable of 360a
[2024-04-13T16:26:01] GABE: that's wild.
[2024-04-13T16:26:37] haku: more than my 10p battery
[2024-04-13T16:26:51] haku: i need a bigger bms
[2024-04-13T16:27:07] GABE: Get a jbd 230a
[2024-04-13T16:27:10] GABE: that's mine
[2024-04-13T16:27:11] haku: what esc you using? 6fet?
[2024-04-13T16:27:19] GABE: double 6 fet
[2024-04-13T16:27:30] Yamal: Frame ?
[2024-04-13T16:27:35] GABE: Pro 2 tee-hee.
[2024-04-13T16:27:36] haku: dual 100v100?
[2024-04-13T16:27:42] GABE: 80v100a
[2024-04-13T16:28:25] haku: i thought you got ant 500a bms
[2024-04-13T16:28:52] Yamal: Anyway, I suppose you are more of a lover of the m365 and g30👍🚀
[2024-04-13T16:28:56] GABE: 575a peak.
[2024-04-13T16:29:00] GABE: 230a constant
[2024-04-13T16:29:08] GABE: Which I will never be able to achieve while constant anyway
[2024-04-13T16:29:16] GABE: Motors and escs will never overheat.
[2024-04-13T16:29:30] haku: what? thats bro science
[2024-04-13T16:29:42] Yamal: America you say before ?
[2024-04-13T16:29:44] GABE: I've lots of leeway
[2024-04-13T16:29:49] GABE: Ireland
[2024-04-13T16:30:01] GABE: Hmm? wym
[2024-04-13T16:30:16] GABE: it's impossible to pull 20kw constant
[2024-04-13T16:30:27] Yamal: I think there are another men from there in this group also with Xiaomi 🧐
[2024-04-13T16:31:34] Yamal: These are the active restrictions there and you have to go unnoticed
[2024-04-13T16:31:39] haku: 360a constant? thats peak for your pack
[2024-04-13T16:32:12] GABE: 45a is constant but needs cooling
[2024-04-13T16:32:18] GABE: 40 is fine
[2024-04-13T16:32:25] GABE: Need temp sensor
[2024-04-13T16:32:31] GABE: which I have
[2024-04-13T16:32:41] haku: ask the battery lords but even p42 cant pull 45a constant
[2024-04-13T16:32:56] GABE: I'm not worried at all cause I'll be only peaking it anyway
[2024-04-13T16:33:59] haku: theres.a.you tube video explaining p42. its by battery mooch.
[2024-04-13T16:34:48] haku: on scooters you dont need constant.
[2024-04-13T16:35:19] haku: its only for boats and planes that require constant energy
[2024-04-13T16:36:38] GABE: kek i just shorted the cell
[2024-04-13T16:36:42] GABE: that was scary as fuck
[2024-04-13T16:36:45] GABE: and im stoned
[2024-04-13T16:41:41] Yamal: Mijia scooter‼️
[2024-04-13T16:42:13] NetworkDir: i have a same problem like this: https://forum.esk8.news/t/focbox-unity-low-starting-torque/45509/34 my starting torque poor, looks something prevent to give torque at low speeds i use decoupling BEMF Punedir have a same setup (same current voltage phase) but he dont have a problem like me
[2024-04-13T16:44:17] NetworkDir: sensorless - vss
[2024-04-13T16:44:30] NetworkDir: yes
[2024-04-13T16:44:55] NetworkDir: phase is 180A - 60A battery current
[2024-04-13T16:44:57] Yamal: It would be nice to see one with 75h speed engines on a highway at 160kmh.
[2024-04-13T16:45:16] NetworkDir: pos ramp time 0.15s neg ramp time 0.05s
[2024-04-13T16:45:28] GABE: Let's hope 65 is enough
[2024-04-13T16:45:43] GABE: Doubled up
[2024-04-13T16:45:44] NetworkDir: ok w8
[2024-04-13T16:46:43] Yamal: you have to modify to be able to mount them..
[2024-04-13T16:46:55] GABE: All sorted out.
[2024-04-13T16:46:56] haku: i dont understand the science of double sandwich. will the current use both paths?
[2024-04-13T16:47:20] Yamal: I was surprised with the g30 that could last up to 65 h
[2024-04-13T16:47:24] GABE: It will use both paths, but to a lesser extent because of the resistance of the iron
[2024-04-13T16:47:40] GABE: But it's an alloy when welded so I can count on it mixing
[2024-04-13T16:48:23] haku: the middle layer plated steel will get really hot yea and cause alot of resistamce?
[2024-04-13T16:48:41] haku: like a bottleneck?
[2024-04-13T16:49:17] NetworkDir: do you have a access to pc?
[2024-04-13T16:49:45] NetworkDir: if possible you can connect over vesc bridge(TCB Hub) ? or anydesk
[2024-04-13T16:50:00] GABE: It will also disperse heat
[2024-04-13T16:54:19] haku: i thought electricity uses the shortest path of least resistance.
[2024-04-13T16:54:43] haku: idk this science stuff tbh.
[2024-04-13T16:56:15] GABE: That's why most of it will flow on the bottom
[2024-04-13T17:02:27] Yamal: This is where serious things are talked about, right?
[2024-04-13T17:06:16] Unknown: What is that switch button?
[2024-04-13T17:10:57] Yamal: What button are you referring to?
[2024-04-13T17:12:14] Unknown: Blinker switch
[2024-04-13T17:13:23] Yamal: Do you mean that this model has a flashing button?
[2024-04-13T17:17:20] Yamal: https://youtu.be/Qb3P2-FUM1M?si=bkGHDbqRQ9ahlyON
[2024-04-13T17:19:18] Yamal: It will have worse electronics but these people are not kidding I think,,, Best of all, someone will come and say that this scooter sucks! The diversity of opinion is wonderful!!!
[2024-04-13T17:23:32] Unknown: Where did you purchase?
[2024-04-13T17:25:03] Finn: The magnets are fucked
[2024-04-13T17:25:14] Finn: They got too hot
[2024-04-13T17:30:32] Yamal: That escooter is not mine man!
[2024-04-13T17:31:21] Yamal: You should ask the Koreans…….
[2024-04-13T18:10:22] Mirono escooters: You got it already?

[2024-04-13T18:11:18] Unknown: Hey is thermal paste better than the pads
[2024-04-13T18:11:42] Unknown: <photos/photo_14238@13-04-2024_18-11-42.jpg>
[2024-04-13T18:12:01] GABE: Better maintenance top.
[2024-04-13T18:12:03] GABE: too
[2024-04-13T18:12:06] GABE: I'll order some rn
[2024-04-13T18:12:27] Paolo ⁭: Yeah 0.5 best
[2024-04-13T18:12:48] Paolo ⁭: I tried 0.3 too but no good if board is bend
[2024-04-13T18:12:55] Unknown: Just seems less messy
[2024-04-13T18:12:59] GABE: What's thinner, thermal paste or 0.5mm
[2024-04-13T18:13:30] Unknown: I just bought these for other things
[2024-04-13T18:23:41] Unknown: Paste is 1.93 w/mk this pad is 13
[2024-04-13T18:24:23] Unknown: Is that just absorption and not transfer
[2024-04-13T18:24:28] Happy Giraffe: That is a very bad paste then, also no pad is that good in reality. They are just marketing numbers
[2024-04-13T18:24:46] Unknown: Show me the best paste please
[2024-04-13T18:38:37] Paolo ⁭: The number is real
[2024-04-13T18:40:44] Happy Giraffe: Hard to believe a thick pad is so much better than a 0.05mm layer of best Noctua paste🌚
[2024-04-13T18:40:55] Happy Giraffe: Someone should do 3rd party tests
[2024-04-13T18:45:37] GABE: Giant 9v battery looking ass
[2024-04-13T18:47:27] Mirono escooters: No
[2024-04-13T18:54:11] Unknown: OK so Noctura nt-h2 it is 10g enough for 2 vesc's?
[2024-04-13T19:00:52] puneDir: Bro wtf
[2024-04-13T19:01:04] puneDir: Add some fishpaper between + - Or epoxy sheet
[2024-04-13T19:01:20] puneDir: Under them
[2024-04-13T19:02:27] Mirono escooters: Looks fine tho
[2024-04-13T19:03:34] Paolo ⁭: you missed the meaning of w/mk
[2024-04-13T19:05:29] Paolo ⁭: you have to multiply the conductivity for the thickness
[2024-04-13T19:08:25] Paolo ⁭: w/mk is only the compound conductivity capabilities
[2024-04-13T19:12:11] puneDir: Fine but that tape won't be enough
[2024-04-13T19:12:17] puneDir: Otherwise perfect
[2024-04-13T19:15:26] JPPL: <photos/photo_14241@13-04-2024_19-15-26.jpg>
[2024-04-13T19:15:37] JPPL: Happy saturday
[2024-04-13T19:18:07] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, there's no suchs numbers available
[2024-04-13T19:18:31] Paolo ⁭: whut
[2024-04-13T19:19:59] Paolo ⁭: do w/mk * mm and you have a comparision, for example a pad with 8 w/mk 0.2 thickness will perform more or less like 4w/mk 0.1 for example
[2024-04-13T19:31:46] GABE: of course.
[2024-04-13T19:33:47] haku: idk it should be fine i think. theramal paste spreads really thin
[2024-04-13T19:35:59] haku: wow last time there was 3 when did the other 2 come in?
[2024-04-13T19:37:09] haku: i think wepeds use qs motors like. yours
[2024-04-13T19:37:31] GABE: <photos/photo_14242@13-04-2024_19-37-31.jpg>
[2024-04-13T19:37:38] GABE: It splits into the exact amount I need for my external
[2024-04-13T19:37:40] GABE: call that luck
[2024-04-13T19:43:26] haku: lets see some beautiful bms wiring
[2024-04-13T19:43:52] haku: you are a contender for prettiest battery award
[2024-04-13T19:49:26] Jesús: <video_file>
[2024-04-13T20:05:56] GABE: Do I have to glue the separate battery spacers?
[2024-04-13T20:07:16] Yamal: The short masts are nice, by the way it gives the feeling that the 11 x has it cut
[2024-04-13T20:10:55] GABE: I'll weld it together and then use glass fiber tape for it.
[2024-04-13T20:11:05] GABE: I'll use clear tape beforehand so it holds while I weld it
[2024-04-13T20:11:08] GABE: then I take it off after
[2024-04-13T20:17:21] Lisa: Hello Guys, is it possible to get a turn off or something ressistor or so like with the 75100 also possible on the 75200 MKS
[2024-04-13T20:22:05] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2024-04-13T20:22:22] puneDir: Yes
[2024-04-13T20:22:30] puneDir: You only need 10k and 100k

[2024-04-13T20:22:55] puneDir: He can use
[2024-04-13T20:26:55] puneDir: It was because of that alupcb was shit
[2024-04-13T20:27:13] puneDir: Never had problems with others (used 1000 ish KMS)
[2024-04-13T20:27:57] puneDir: really
[2024-04-13T20:28:24] puneDir: Could be
[2024-04-13T20:28:31] puneDir: 84100 is fine too
[2024-04-13T20:30:52] JPPL: 1blade original them costumes 1blade fully build/assembly by me 1 11x build/assembly by me 1 original teverun Supreme 1 teverun Supreme costume build/assembly by me
[2024-04-13T20:31:01] NetworkDir: I use resistor mod on 75100 box never i see problems with canbus
[2024-04-13T20:32:05] NetworkDir: Hmm maybe
[2024-04-13T20:32:19] haku: is that 2nd teverun 12" or 11? in the photo
[2024-04-13T20:40:29] Lisa: Yes but where do I solder? I ain’t know nothing about this stuff
[2024-04-13T20:42:56] puneDir: .
[2024-04-13T20:45:00] Paolo ⁭: Lol
[2024-04-13T20:45:12] Paolo ⁭: I've 5 alu PCB with on off mod , no one died
[2024-04-13T20:48:11] Lisa: This the right one?
[2024-04-13T20:48:11] Lisa: <photos/photo_14244@13-04-2024_20-48-11.jpg>
[2024-04-13T20:48:16] Lisa: Or are these the right one
[2024-04-13T20:50:20] haku: ho ho ho
[2024-04-13T20:51:12] haku: made 4 of these. used 16g of fillament and 6g of wasted fillament. 😭
[2024-04-13T20:54:35] Happy Giraffe: Aah you meant that
[2024-04-13T20:54:56] Happy Giraffe: I was thinking of paste and how those are calculated
[2024-04-13T21:03:03] Lisa: Hello any idea how I can get of thermal glue from makerbase factory?
[2024-04-13T21:03:08] Lisa: Heat
[2024-04-13T21:07:35] Jesús: <video_file>
[2024-04-13T21:09:27] haku: cool. what scooter is that? vsett or zero?
[2024-04-13T21:16:31] puneDir: Probably rion
[2024-04-13T21:25:09] Lisa: Hello guys again, any idea of how I can get the cover off without scratching everything? I think it’s sealed for water… Want to put ferofluid in it and it is a 22x3 if it does any good
[2024-04-13T21:28:22] Yamal: Little Focer attack ‼️😂
[2024-04-13T21:33:53] Paolo ⁭: 105 top speed not bad
[2024-04-13T21:41:56] Jesús: Are you sure?
[2024-04-13T21:46:24] haku: is fast like teveruns. 65mph or 105kph. what scooter? and what components?
[2024-04-13T21:46:36] Jesús: 🤫
[2024-04-13T21:47:05] haku: my 60v laotie did 55mph once
[2024-04-13T21:47:08] Jesús: I did that acceleration in 100 meters.
[2024-04-13T21:48:21] GABE: cell will be finished today
[2024-04-13T21:48:25] haku: 130kmh? pretty fast
[2024-04-13T21:48:26] GABE: Fully
[2024-04-13T21:48:55] GABE: Put heat shrink over a metal pryer
[2024-04-13T21:49:02] GABE: and open from both sides
[2024-04-13T21:49:02] haku: its like inmotion RS speeds
[2024-04-13T21:49:25] GABE: what setup ?
[2024-04-13T21:49:27] Jesús: And that video is when I had a 72v 20s battery, now it’s at 100v 24s
[2024-04-13T21:50:00] haku: stock everything lol. it actually slowed a bit when i changed to vesc
[2024-04-13T21:50:02] Lisa: But where should I start got no way to stick a metal plyer in
[2024-04-13T21:50:16] Lisa: That’s crazy ☠️😭
[2024-04-13T21:50:17] GABE: Same with my setup
[2024-04-13T21:50:28] GABE: Bounce it off the tyre
[2024-04-13T21:50:49] haku: what is top speed now and what scooter and components?
[2024-04-13T21:50:56] GABE: pry it open like a pro 2 motor
[2024-04-13T21:51:04] Lisa: @PaoloWu did you open a 22x3 once?
[2024-04-13T21:51:06] haku: can it do burnouts is the main question
[2024-04-13T21:51:17] Lisa: There I just scratched everything:(
[2024-04-13T21:51:52] GABE: insane
[2024-04-13T21:52:26] Paolo ⁭: Wtf I was not attacking you
[2024-04-13T21:52:34] GABE: Paolo what's your top speed
[2024-04-13T21:52:47] Paolo ⁭: But if u like, is actually slower than our mantis😂
[2024-04-13T21:53:18] haku: oh snap!
[2024-04-13T21:53:43] haku: mr. wu with the facts
[2024-04-13T21:54:00] Jesús: It’s a Rion now with 24s I haven’t been able to put it to the full at 120kmh it still skids the front wheel gives a lot of respect
[2024-04-13T21:54:41] haku: very nice
[2024-04-13T21:54:52] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2024-04-13T21:55:02] Paolo ⁭: @jtecnocool Kaabo mantis
[2024-04-13T21:55:50] Jesús: I’m happy for you👌
[2024-04-13T21:56:01] haku: i dont even want to finish my scooter seeing that. thats just pure dangerous
[2024-04-13T21:56:26] Unknown: Nobody can push the throttle but you.
[2024-04-13T21:57:09] haku: it takes big balls to do that on a standing scooter
[2024-04-13T21:57:16] GABE: and no gear
[2024-04-13T21:57:18] Jesús: My Rion is not rigged that mantis if it is.
[2024-04-13T21:57:33] GABE: I suppose it's having a connection with your vehicle
[2024-04-13T21:57:44] GABE: Mutual trust
[2024-04-13T21:58:20] Lisa: That helmet won’t safe you hahaha
[2024-04-13T21:58:43] haku: no matter if its a weped or a laotie. thats just nuts going those speeds
[2024-04-13T21:59:06] haku: its the burnouts that the girls like to see
[2024-04-13T21:59:18] GABE: Hopefully how fast I go in a month
[2024-04-13T21:59:21] GABE: Lmao
[2024-04-13T21:59:24] GABE: Ye
[2024-04-13T21:59:28] Unknown: You and burnouts lol gotta impress the Betty's
[2024-04-13T22:00:18] Unknown: Paid for pmt and I stopped doing that, well a lot less
[2024-04-13T22:01:03] Unknown: Women are---
[2024-04-13T22:03:03] Yamal: 33*2😂😭
[2024-04-13T22:04:40] Jesús: Let him put the 22x3 engines on that nami to see ...
[2024-04-13T22:04:50] Yamal: paolo with my respects it seems incredible that at this point you make that comparison man
[2024-04-13T22:05:24] Jesús: When it is compared, it has to be equal.
[2024-04-13T22:06:59] Jesús: Then he says he doesn’t attack 😂😂😂
[2024-04-13T22:08:26] haku: what esc can do 24s? fardriver?
[2024-04-13T22:09:06] haku: 24s on a scooter is crazy
[2024-04-13T22:10:56] Jesús: Rion only rides tronic, I have the tronic 250R
[2024-04-13T22:11:55] Paolo ⁭: Lol i Just saw its a good speed, but he answered me with " 🤫"
[2024-04-13T22:12:16] haku: you young bloods are the future. please be careful out there
[2024-04-13T22:14:29] haku: what does this emoji mean? ❤️ is it you like what you see or im inlove with you. i always use it.
[2024-04-13T22:14:29] Jesús: Paolo, I don’t know how old you are, but you look like a little boy. You started commenting on my video saying that it was a maximum speed that wasn’t bad, come on, man, stop fucking, we already know each other.
[2024-04-13T22:15:15] haku: you guys should do a track meet.
[2024-04-13T22:15:45] haku: only way to settle who jas the biggest dick
[2024-04-13T22:16:30] Paolo ⁭: Bro come on i said is good speed , but even my mother doesn't say me shut up
[2024-04-13T22:16:44] Jesús: I’m going over that
[2024-04-13T22:17:03] Paolo ⁭: Don't be offended for nothing
[2024-04-13T22:17:32] Jesús: Your mother tells you and you know it.
[2024-04-13T22:18:05] haku: cmon guys we brothers in vesc we all have big dicks
[2024-04-13T22:18:20] Paolo ⁭: Not anymore since I don't live more with my parents 🤣
[2024-04-13T22:18:54] Jesús: Sure?
[2024-04-13T22:19:22] Paolo ⁭: Come to check
[2024-04-13T22:30:19] haku: insta 360 have a built in speedometer like gopro?
[2024-04-13T22:33:10] Yamal: 😎, just arrive home now!!😂

[2024-04-13T23:02:25] deadword: How to adjust torque? There is speed but no torque.
[2024-04-13T23:05:15] Yamal: -First of all, we are here to learn and share from those who know the most to those who know the least. -second, this owner of Rion who by the way is a friend of mine and a brilliant person who has helped me and continues to help me with the scooters selflessly since minute "0" of which they barely talk about anything in the group has only shared some video on this case of acceleration reaching 105kmh. - Third, you have mentioned its "top speed"... this is not proof. - and finally I have not stopped hearing criticism about Rion in this group, which being constructive criticism seems good and respectable to me, but no one likes being told that your e-scooter is shit, right? Finally, I wanted to say that this Rion user (Jesus) is someone very close to the manufacturer and Rion group and you can see new features and interesting aspects of said e-scooter! so nothing we learn to respect and value what others have, after all that's what we're here for!
[2024-04-13T23:11:11] Paolo ⁭: okay i understand, so if people dont know ur top speed, and say "good top speed", you take it as offensive message
[2024-04-13T23:12:27] Paolo ⁭: just tell me and i will no answer anymore, anyway i dont play with escooter since 1 years so who cares
[2024-04-13T23:14:14] Paolo ⁭: that's why i'm so confused
[2024-04-13T23:14:47] Unknown: Phase amps are torque
[2024-04-13T23:17:08] deadword: Max motor 35A. Absolute 45A
[2024-04-13T23:17:09] Paolo ⁭: maybe he mean i hate tronic, but it's fact not hate. Goal is avoid people to buy bad quality controllers with high fail rate in this group
[2024-04-13T23:17:30] deadword: Battery 100A. - 0A
[2024-04-13T23:17:52] deadword: Motor allow brake fslse

[2024-04-13T23:19:49] deadword: 👍👍🙏
[2024-04-13T23:25:52] Yamal: I'm not saying it's good or bad, Maybe he is a little "defensive" because of how many times Rion has been criticized, I don't know, without going any further, recently you said that the model was not aerodynamic, that the front fender made you take off? I don't remember.. but come on, I heard here until the carbon chassis makes it better at home,, In the same way, Paolo Wu himself, conqueror of continents with his engines, connoisseur of vesc electronics and discharge batteries, is speaking to me, Do you really think that an e-scooter with 100.8v has a top speed of around 100kmh? Please call me stupid! My most sincere respects to all the users of this group, here I am the novice, and I am eager to learn and for everyone to share their exploits with this fabulous hobby!
[2024-04-13T23:26:22] Yamal: ❤️‍🔥
[2024-04-13T23:27:12] Paolo ⁭: bro i dont go to study people's configuration, i've many others thing to do
[2024-04-13T23:27:50] Paolo ⁭: and yes technically it's not aerodynamic, and also the engineer working in the f1 (jan) confirmed
[2024-04-13T23:28:22] Paolo ⁭: and again, saying it's not aerodynamic means hate?
[2024-04-13T23:28:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Before more words , Re read your nonsense guys You get offended from a not bad 😅 Than other is kid ,than fuck and Mom comes in the sentences I will put an end to it
[2024-04-13T23:30:34] haku: i dont have a dog in this cat fight. lets all just talk about 3d printing
[2024-04-13T23:36:18] haku: i did not know folks paid upfront to be in a waitlist. thats crazy
[2024-04-13T23:37:33] haku: tesla cybertruck only asking for $100 to be on the waitlist. not pay full price
[2024-04-13T23:43:46] haku: thats horrible practice.
[2024-04-13T23:48:29] Happy Giraffe: eBike riders - Big dick energy as we are chill😁
[2024-04-13T23:48:46] Happy Giraffe: Unsure why scooters always make the drama
[2024-04-13T23:49:18] haku: wow!
[2024-04-13T23:49:46] Yamal: It is clear that one thing does not take away from the other, with this there has been a lot of controversy and it has been wrong, the construction of so many orders with manufacturing periods of 6 to 8 months was too great for them, Some Apex has reached some of those on the waiting list, my hope is that everyone finally receives their e-scooter sooner rather than later.👍
[2024-04-13T23:49:58] haku: true ebike guy is chill AF.
[2024-04-13T23:49:59] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, sad world has become to this nowadays. People better hire a bounty hunter to collect some unpaid "tax" lol
[2024-04-13T23:50:37] Happy Giraffe: Usually😁 but there are some exceptions and nobody in finland can build and sell decent bikes atm
[2024-04-13T23:51:03] haku: you are that hero finns arw waiting for
[2024-04-13T23:53:00] Happy Giraffe: I lack the skill and money to start the business. Also legal problems would arise if people ride fast bikes built by me and die with them
[2024-04-13T23:53:51] haku: true. legality is the problem. you should just sell custom frames not full ebikes. they wont be able to sue
[2024-04-13T23:56:10] Unknown: 99% kits you buy your own fuses
[2024-04-13T23:58:31] Happy Giraffe: Thats even more challenging haha
[2024-04-13T23:58:44] Martin Kaktits: Dont the vesc (ubox specifically) have some kind of programmable output? Like, for example, I would be interested in making the rear brake light either blink or activate stronger intensity when braking, but my hydraulic levers dont exactly have sensors in them. And even if they did, thats a lot more wires to route from handlebars😅
[2024-04-14T00:00:27] Jan: To clarify on aero, all scooters so far have about zero aerodynamic bodywork on them. Mostly because the rider is like 90% of the drag. The only scooter with minor aero is the one from Williams F1
[2024-04-14T00:00:56] Paolo ⁭: Exactly
[2024-04-14T00:00:59] Martin Kaktits: Yeaaaaa, but thats with regen throttle input. Doesnt do anything with just normal hydro brake lever
[2024-04-14T00:01:17] Konstantin: 20/300 works well too. All how I'm doing few ears...!) Just open datasheet;) Pull down gnd-en pin, then for turning on, apply +Voltage on en pin... Magic!!! 🪄
[2024-04-14T00:01:31] Martin Kaktits: Complex
[2024-04-14T00:01:36] Martin Kaktits: No more wires 🙈
[2024-04-14T00:03:43] Martin Kaktits: I see a fan pin. Can programmatically controll that?
[2024-04-14T00:04:29] Martin Kaktits: Sad
[2024-04-14T00:05:31] Yamal: well and out of curiosity Rion's chassis is not aerodynamic (chassis), more or less than another e-scooter, I have been able to take it at speeds of 130 without a steering damper and it is stable, nervous but stable
[2024-04-14T00:06:50] Paolo ⁭: But that doesn't depends by aerodynamic
[2024-04-14T00:07:19] Paolo ⁭: They do 130 with ninebot g30 as well without steering damper
[2024-04-14T00:07:53] Paolo ⁭: Also the mantis was without steering damper (I want to make sure I'm not offending anyone)
[2024-04-14T00:09:36] haku: mr. wu what are components in the mantis of you dont mind me asking?
[2024-04-14T00:10:15] haku: 150kph is fast AF
[2024-04-14T00:11:23] Paolo ⁭: 100$ controller 😂
[2024-04-14T00:12:20] haku: but motors and battery prolly top shelf
[2024-04-14T00:12:35] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-04-14T00:13:27] haku: my guess is 20s10p p45 and 80h33x2
[2024-04-14T00:13:49] haku: maybe 22s
[2024-04-14T00:13:59] Paolo ⁭: Battery 21s6p (with some very bad cells) , 60h motor
[2024-04-14T00:14:20] haku: wow. dam. thats some advanced tuning
[2024-04-14T00:14:26] Yamal: We'll see when I ride the BACC 8000 I'm going to have to go out in the astronaut suit.
[2024-04-14T00:16:11] haku: jank it on a laotie haha
[2024-04-14T00:16:30] haku: right on the forks
[2024-04-14T00:16:42] Paolo ⁭: Rion was coming out with bac2000
[2024-04-14T00:17:16] haku: has anyone done that? put asi esc on a scooter?
[2024-04-14T00:17:44] haku: can you even connect 2 asi bac for dual motors?
[2024-04-14T00:18:03] Paolo ⁭: Rion
[2024-04-14T00:18:16] Paolo ⁭: Just put in parallel throttle signal side
[2024-04-14T00:23:34] Happy Giraffe: BAC needs to be mounted outside for air cooling?
[2024-04-14T00:26:22] Jesús: Rion mounted only the bac 4000 in the thrust model then everything was tronic they never mounted the bac 2000
[2024-04-14T00:28:03] haku: how many models does rion have? and where can you buy one. i need to investigate
[2024-04-14T00:28:18] Happy Giraffe: Just get a rear light with acceleration sensor (mine will get brighter when braking), I got one for ebike for 9€ that consumes 0.5-1w and works with 12v output😁
[2024-04-14T00:31:07] Paolo ⁭: Yes so is 4000 just confusion
[2024-04-14T00:33:31] Martin Kaktits: Interesting. Got link?
[2024-04-14T00:34:12] Martin Kaktits: I did actually think about something like that, but figured it would be too complex and unrekiable so ? 🤷🏻‍♀️
[2024-04-14T00:34:21] Martin Kaktits: Disnt know they make such thing
[2024-04-14T00:40:42] Yamal: People, the thing about the bacc 8000 was a joke, right now I don't even have money for flysky
[2024-04-14T00:43:01] Unknown: Temp controlled relay or something
[2024-04-14T00:44:15] haku: i ordered this in febuary its been stuck in customs. you think they lost or confiscated it?
[2024-04-14T00:44:55] haku: i need this to widen my rear a bit.
[2024-04-14T00:45:11] Unknown: Just eat cupcakes
[2024-04-14T00:45:12] haku: ok gotcha
[2024-04-14T00:45:22] haku: lol
[2024-04-14T00:45:57] Unknown: + traction
[2024-04-14T00:46:33] Yamal: Would a motor with fat phases from the new ones from LY hold up to those controllers?
[2024-04-14T00:47:37] Happy Giraffe: It's from a local store that rebrands Chinese stuff, very hard to find what it is
[2024-04-14T00:48:07] Happy Giraffe: So far worked flawlessly for a year in rough conditions like heavy rain and -20°c snow etc etc
[2024-04-14T00:48:22] Yamal: more than €2000 in controllers…..
[2024-04-14T00:48:37] Unknown: What's the max of a bac8
[2024-04-14T00:50:18] Yamal: BACC VADER
[2024-04-14T00:51:27] Happy Giraffe: If we had stainless rods at school I could make you these. Wonder how much would the shipment be if sent in a letter
[2024-04-14T00:51:34] Martin Kaktits: Does it not just turn on when dowhill ?
[2024-04-14T00:51:51] haku: i remember hearing something here that 3shul can match bac8k
[2024-04-14T00:52:00] Happy Giraffe: And some motors they cant properly drive like the CYC ones in example
[2024-04-14T00:52:14] Happy Giraffe: They changed to vesc lately
[2024-04-14T00:55:55] Happy Giraffe: It always has a weaker light but when speed goes rapidly down it uses the extra led to make it brighter for 2~seconds. Havent tested how long it keeps it on if braking continues
[2024-04-14T00:56:23] haku: i joined a 3d printing telegram channel and all they do is print guns wtf haha
[2024-04-14T00:56:37] haku: im not even allowed to take screenshots
[2024-04-14T00:57:52] Happy Giraffe: Some stl for machining purposes would be...😂
[2024-04-14T00:58:10] sombre_enfant: Invite me bro i ll machine them
[2024-04-14T00:58:52] Happy Giraffe: Could have also printed some holders for optics in my rifle when in army
[2024-04-14T00:59:05] Happy Giraffe: Would have been hilarious with some 5€ alie scope
[2024-04-14T01:33:33] haku: dam got jipped its only 1 set of brakes not a pair.
[2024-04-14T01:34:39] haku: dammit. its a hit or miss with these sales. got bamboozled for sure
[2024-04-14T01:43:24] haku: should i buy another one or return it?
[2024-04-14T01:46:45] Yamal: I told you haku! The price of the couple is around €200 +-
[2024-04-14T01:47:56] Yamal: $90 a couple didn't make sense.
[2024-04-14T01:49:21] haku: its 150 in amazon for 1. and the store i got it from is back ordered
[2024-04-14T01:54:22] Yamal: haku you are always the last to go to sleep because you live 9 hours in the past but don't forget that we celebrate new year 9 hours from the future!😂🫡
[2024-04-14T01:56:34] Unknown: That was fast
[2024-04-14T01:56:43] Yamal: It's similar to "interstellar"
[2024-04-14T01:57:24] haku: yea. arrived overnight. they really trying to get rid of these
[2024-04-14T02:20:14] haku: anyone have the dual piston maguras? do you guys know the width from the pad to the back part?
[2024-04-14T02:37:09] haku: this one.
[2024-04-14T03:30:11] haku: yes ofcourse. never ever full price 😁
[2024-04-14T03:31:00] haku: mt5e will not fit the front. its too fat
[2024-04-14T03:31:36] haku: i need something around 14mm from the back pad to the end close to the rim
[2024-04-14T03:32:36] haku: i shouldve listened when you said dont buy the mt5e. i really thought was for a pair
[2024-04-14T03:47:39] puneDir: 84100?
[2024-04-14T03:56:18] haku: cant already pushing it.
[2024-04-14T03:56:19] haku: <photos/photo_14256@14-04-2024_03-56-19.jpg>
[2024-04-14T03:56:37] haku: only way is to get the thinner profile rim
[2024-04-14T03:57:34] haku: zoom brakes already too tight.
[2024-04-14T03:58:52] Unknown: 12" tires 👀
[2024-04-14T04:08:20] haku: yep i think that was a mistake choosing a 12"rim.
[2024-04-14T04:08:50] haku: can always get the skinny rims
[2024-04-14T04:20:50] Chris Culver: Dude what the shit: Wolf Warrior 11 worked perfect yesterday. Touched only external LED lights... Today, front motor jerking on full power but get this, it happens when I'm not pressing the throttle at all... Wtf?
[2024-04-14T04:45:36] Chris Culver: Why bad vesc choice?
[2024-04-14T05:05:38] rosheee: ^^'
[2024-04-14T05:17:16] haku: @jamessoderstrom if i grind these down you think it would be okay. i can grind and add a 2mm spacer.
[2024-04-14T05:20:31] haku: i can always get it replaced if i make a mistake. these forks are like $10
[2024-04-14T05:33:47] rosheee: rofl
[2024-04-14T05:33:52] rosheee: but then use flex
[2024-04-14T05:33:54] rosheee: instead grinder
[2024-04-14T05:50:54] Unknown: Instead of so mabey a dremel flex shaft thing. You can see more using a small burr bit than a 4" wheel.
[2024-04-14T05:51:15] Unknown: He'll start looking for bench top.milling machines soon
[2024-04-14T05:52:55] rosheee: <photos/photo_14259@14-04-2024_05-52-55.jpg>
[2024-04-14T05:52:57] rosheee: Flex
[2024-04-14T05:53:12] rosheee: Grinder
[2024-04-14T05:53:50] Unknown: Ass backwards
[2024-04-14T05:56:15] rosheee: and what is flex?
[2024-04-14T05:56:52] rosheee: XD WHAT
[2024-04-14T05:56:53] rosheee: rofl
[2024-04-14T05:56:57] rosheee: we say flex
[2024-04-14T05:56:59] rosheee: to grinder
[2024-04-14T05:57:07] rosheee: XD

[2024-04-14T06:09:56] rosheee: 8mm plugs > as/xt150
[2024-04-14T06:13:49] Unknown: Just need to get it running. Big motors next season.
[2024-04-14T06:14:34] rosheee: when ur mother sends me 50 euros for service +8h on ur rion?
[2024-04-14T06:17:00] rosheee: <animation>
[2024-04-14T06:26:57] haku: so proud of my work. sorry ikea dont need you anymore.
[2024-04-14T06:27:25] haku: proud ally of the lbgtqpetgpla community

[2024-04-14T07:10:36] haku: @jamessoderstrom have you used this tape before? is it like capton?
[2024-04-14T07:11:38] haku: gotcha.
[2024-04-14T07:12:32] haku: this is the linkJust found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $1.42 | 33M/Roll Green PET Film Tape High Temperature Heat Resistant PCB Solder SMT Plating Shield Insulation Protection https://a.aliexpress.com/_mPVm2IK
[2024-04-14T07:13:03] haku: maybe just for pcb
[2024-04-14T07:17:37] haku: theres even black capton used for ugly bms wires
[2024-04-14T07:58:50] rosheee: ^^
[2024-04-14T08:21:22] rosheee: ^_^
[2024-04-14T08:29:21] GABE: Props to Jiabada for soldering these in the weirdest way possible.
[2024-04-14T08:29:24] GABE: More work for me.
[2024-04-14T08:29:34] rosheee: 😆what a bms
[2024-04-14T08:32:57] GABE: This could not get any more expensive. literally worth its weight in gold
[2024-04-14T08:34:43] rosheee: idk why heatshrink ^^
[2024-04-14T08:36:07] GABE: I wanna rewrap My internal entirely because it's not flush enough.
[2024-04-14T08:36:14] GABE: Also will be reprinting the internal spacers

[2024-04-14T09:35:18] Gabe Enzo: lmfao it seems the cheap second fork dealer i found actually has a v1
[2024-04-14T09:35:24] Gabe Enzo: so im getting 2x v1 suspensions XD
[2024-04-14T10:00:06] Rose: Hey there oOo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-04-14T10:00:38] Rose: Hey there oOo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-04-14T10:03:18] GABE: These phase wires need to be scaled down and soldered at a 45° angle bcs they take up so much Goddamn space @Bradhaku It's looking like I'll only need a 55mm spacer Ll
[2024-04-14T10:09:02] GABE: <photos/photo_14268@14-04-2024_10-09-02.jpg>
[2024-04-14T10:10:26] GABE: @jamessoderstrom it's not possible to take off the bottom heatsink, is it? Seems I've unscrewed the PCB but it's still stuck
[2024-04-14T10:26:31] rosheee: thermalpaste
[2024-04-14T10:26:40] GABE: technically possible to lower the entire ESC down, if I find a way to modify these little plugs. But high risk of damage so nah
[2024-04-14T10:26:46] GABE: So it comes off?
[2024-04-14T10:26:53] GABE: I'm scared of damaging the board
[2024-04-14T10:27:03] rosheee: which esc is it?
[2024-04-14T10:27:10] GABE: 80100 spintend 80v100a
[2024-04-14T10:27:19] rosheee: normally there is thermalpaste under it
[2024-04-14T10:27:25] rosheee: thermal pad
[2024-04-14T10:27:27] rosheee: which holds t
[2024-04-14T10:27:31] GABE: I'll try pry it with something soft
[2024-04-14T10:27:32] rosheee: btrw what u doing?
[2024-04-14T10:27:39] GABE: Trying to make the ESC thinner.
[2024-04-14T10:27:46] GABE: So it can fit with a smaller spacer
[2024-04-14T10:28:20] GABE: If I can shave off 2mm here and there, I have more leeway for the Battery, as it'll have double copper itll be pretty chunky
[2024-04-14T10:29:20] GABE: It's so hard to take off that I feel it's risky to snap the board. @Mirono_escooters will know I think
[2024-04-14T10:29:47] rosheee: ^^'
[2024-04-14T10:29:52] rosheee: i took many of them out

[2024-04-14T11:37:51] GABE: if I use an alu brick between my esc and frame, will it transfer heat the same way?
[2024-04-14T11:38:00] haku: i see

[2024-04-14T11:42:21] haku: that rider leans like crazy
[2024-04-14T11:44:03] sombre_enfant: Lharer killian miniwalker brand but running on a dualtron 🤣
[2024-04-14T11:45:28] Face de Pin Sucé: No we didn't won, 3 fail race start, driver starting from P4 to P20+ and then trying to come back But we didn't had the level to win
[2024-04-14T11:46:23] sombre_enfant: U know what ambrosini use as esc ?
[2024-04-14T11:48:54] haku: all good. was really cool.to see
[2024-04-14T11:49:14] GABE: I can attach these directly to the frame lmao
[2024-04-14T11:49:18] GABE: I'm saving so much space

[2024-04-14T12:59:36] Yamal: I'm referring to Killyan's miniwalker, I remember a few months ago seeing him talk about his preparation and I don't know if he was riding 3shull and mentioning rage mechanic,, What about Ambrosini? Plme it seems that Aymard is with him now?

[2024-04-14T14:56:17] Happy Giraffe: Pls don't say hub motor
[2024-04-14T15:02:53] puneDir: No
[2024-04-14T15:19:22] sombre_enfant: What up with hub motor ?
[2024-04-14T15:20:51] Mirono escooters: Oh god, not again
[2024-04-14T15:20:54] Mirono escooters: Hub ❤️
[2024-04-14T15:21:13] puneDir: Mid drive in runners are better in e bikes
[2024-04-14T15:21:18] puneDir: <photos/photo_14286@14-04-2024_15-21-18.jpg>
[2024-04-14T15:25:23] puneDir: Idk if is this good Can't find qsmotor in my country
[2024-04-14T15:35:49] Happy Giraffe: Lmao, order from ali. But bicycle frames too small for even QS90
[2024-04-14T15:37:10] Happy Giraffe: No gearing advantage and creates lot of heat on low speeds. On large wheels the stress is insane on the motor when accelerating
[2024-04-14T15:38:41] Happy Giraffe: 12" wheel is a good size but 29" just heats up too much on a hub. Also unsprung mass and harder maintenance as you gotta take away torqu arms etc etc
[2024-04-14T15:41:36] puneDir: I can't order from Ali because of customs
[2024-04-14T15:41:53] puneDir: Is there any good mid drive for under 150?
[2024-04-14T15:46:25] Happy Giraffe: Hell no
[2024-04-14T15:46:47] Happy Giraffe: What frame do you plan to use?
[2024-04-14T15:47:29] puneDir: I'm going to design something Or MTB with some custom stuff Or Some motocross bike
[2024-04-14T15:48:26] Happy Giraffe: Design?😅 MTB only for very low power motors and motocross you will have fun with cops😁
[2024-04-14T16:00:48] Jacob: Hey if i use a xiaomi dash with a g30 esc should i flash a ninebot firmware or a xiaomi firmware for them to work together?
[2024-04-14T16:05:38] puneDir: Cops don't care
[2024-04-14T16:08:11] Jacob: Thanks James thats a very good idea, ill do so :)
[2024-04-14T16:19:48] Happy Giraffe: Interesting, then might go for a moto style frame with QS138 70H then😁 but thats out of the budget sadly
[2024-04-14T16:20:25] puneDir: <photos/photo_14287@14-04-2024_16-20-25.jpg>
[2024-04-14T16:20:28] puneDir: Maybe i can turn a normal bike to this
[2024-04-14T16:20:52] puneDir: Would using a hub motor give big disadvantages?
[2024-04-14T16:21:17] puneDir: This guy is really cheap and I believe it has good power
[2024-04-14T16:26:47] GABE: Nag

[2024-04-14T16:27:28] puneDir: So I can also go for hub

[2024-04-14T16:43:07] Happy Giraffe: Turn normal bike into a thicker steel frame bomber?😅
[2024-04-14T16:43:57] Happy Giraffe: Well you gotta know what you are doing, not easy to mount these and line up drivetrain etc
[2024-04-14T16:44:26] haku: you starting to sound like an american teen with those wheelies and ebike projects

[2024-04-14T16:56:38] puneDir: Yeeeeeessss
[2024-04-14T16:56:49] puneDir: Maybe i can do from steel profiles because easy to weld

[2024-04-14T18:44:07] Paolo ⁭: It's crazy idea to do two BMS in series
[2024-04-14T18:44:33] Paolo ⁭: Would be better to do parallel
[2024-04-14T18:46:06] Mirono escooters: For ppl to steal lol
[2024-04-14T18:46:15] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_14298@14-04-2024_18-46-15.jpg>
[2024-04-14T18:46:17] puneDir: yes especcialy china
[2024-04-14T18:46:20] Mirono escooters: Pretty sure @jamessoderstrom uses this
[2024-04-14T18:47:20] GABE: It's single bms
[2024-04-14T18:50:17] puneDir: puneron will be based on this
[2024-04-14T18:50:18] puneDir: <files/puneron v0_.step>
[2024-04-14T19:10:23] Paolo ⁭: Wtf
[2024-04-14T19:40:03] haku: this is why we need cheap mills
[2024-04-14T19:40:48] Yamal: <photos/photo_14299@14-04-2024_19-40-48.jpg>
[2024-04-14T19:44:38] haku: start em young.
[2024-04-14T19:46:48] Unknown: So they can be broke from day 1
[2024-04-14T19:47:10] haku: daddy will pay the bills haha
[2024-04-14T19:48:02] haku: i mean @jamaludin_algarnati
[2024-04-14T19:50:04] Unknown: Ran into an old guy on a scooter in my neighborhood. 1st person I've seen here it was a Yume or some jank thing
[2024-04-14T19:50:34] haku: lots of those here in vegas. very rare to see brand name scooters
[2024-04-14T19:50:44] haku: lots of surrons though
[2024-04-14T19:50:58] haku: and g30s
[2024-04-14T19:51:24] Unknown: Fuck surrons they're fucking things up here. The new dirtbike gangs
[2024-04-14T19:51:55] haku: agreed. they really fucked up the trails and grass in our parks
[2024-04-14T19:52:42] haku: surrons on road tires i have no problem
[2024-04-14T19:52:46] Unknown: No trails just city riders doing wheelies and messing with the public. Giving everyone a bad name
[2024-04-14T19:52:50] Happy Giraffe: Looks good but the rear swing mount way too weak for any qs motor
[2024-04-14T19:53:15] haku: true. kinda used to it by now
[2024-04-14T19:53:52] Yamal: <photos/photo_14300@14-04-2024_19-53-52.jpg>
[2024-04-14T19:53:52] Yamal: <photos/photo_14301@14-04-2024_19-53-52.jpg>
[2024-04-14T19:54:52] haku: i really want to get a surron someday though or something seated. standing has been really tough on my old legs
[2024-04-14T19:55:33] haku: specially riding after working out legs. its a challenge
[2024-04-14T19:56:10] haku: nice fitment
[2024-04-14T19:56:46] haku: and nice table
[2024-04-14T19:57:30] Unknown: Yep. There's street legal ones now. Put a plate on it and take your driving to endanger charge when you pull stupid shit.
[2024-04-14T20:01:56] puneDir: Build PuneRon when I finish it

[2024-04-14T20:11:33] Yamal: Other option
[2024-04-14T20:15:09] haku: looks good. you just have bent fins.
[2024-04-14T20:15:31] haku: it doesent really matter unless you have ocd
[2024-04-14T20:20:31] Yamal: Just cut this can..
[2024-04-14T20:20:31] Yamal: Just cut this can..
[2024-04-14T20:28:26] Finn: Do it like this. Otherwise if you put it on an angle it creates wind resistance.
[2024-04-14T20:28:52] Finn: If you want to cover it anyways at the angle it doesnt matter
[2024-04-14T20:29:34] Yamal: The other option is to cut the sheet and have the heatsink come out from below, the complicated thing is the anchoring...
[2024-04-14T20:32:37] Finn: Drill holes into the heatsink and cut threads in
[2024-04-14T20:33:10] Finn: You will loose stability when you remove the sheet
[2024-04-14T20:49:19] R3VOLT: can somebody advise on how to properly solder the bullets from vesc to the female Amass banana
[2024-04-14T20:50:32] R3VOLT: looking at the bullet connector having that heatshrink up to the neck makes me nervous , not sure if i should trim it just enough to be able to dip the tip into the banana connector
[2024-04-14T20:50:56] R3VOLT: i've looked up on youtube but can't seem to find anything on this
[2024-04-14T20:52:40] R3VOLT: also , is white winegar good for cleaing a small corrosion on my battery xt60
[2024-04-14T20:52:49] R3VOLT: followed by a bit of oil ?
[2024-04-14T20:52:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. R3VOLT has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-14T20:58:10] sombre_enfant: No replace it
[2024-04-14T20:59:22] Unknown: 2 wire into 1 connector? What about shrink tube makes you nervous?
[2024-04-14T21:00:39] Unknown: Heat the connector only. If you can't get the cover slid over the wires you can warm the cover and slide on after but it's a bit of a pain. I did it backwards 1st time.
[2024-04-14T21:00:52] sombre_enfant: Take one shrink connect the bullet. Pull the shrink and heat it
[2024-04-14T21:04:26] R3VOLT: Was thinking it s meant to stay as close to the banana edge as possible
[2024-04-14T21:08:28] Unknown: Cover hides about 3mm end of bananna
[2024-04-14T21:12:58] R3VOLT: bullet bananas is it
[2024-04-14T21:13:15] R3VOLT: the ones on the controller
[2024-04-14T21:23:26] Yamal: <photos/photo_14306@14-04-2024_21-23-26.jpg>
[2024-04-14T21:25:55] Jan: How does the air move over the fins?
[2024-04-14T21:26:36] sombre_enfant: Whatever shrink so no short can happen
[2024-04-14T21:31:17] Yamal: Well, ideally it would be below the chassis so that the air would pass through them and always be in circulation... but this is the easiest way...
[2024-04-14T21:31:18] haku: you need to cut that bottom to get airflow to the fins yea
[2024-04-14T21:32:13] haku: if you doing that just bolt vesc straight to frame and put thermal pase under it
[2024-04-14T21:32:40] haku: you can also sandwich heatsink
[2024-04-14T21:45:25] Jan: "Easiest way" to install maybe but its just not going to work, no airflow means you will not get the heat away from the scooter.
[2024-04-14T22:03:19] puneDir: <photos/photo_14307@14-04-2024_22-03-19.jpg>
[2024-04-14T22:03:25] puneDir: Cheap as fuck also I can rework on it
[2024-04-14T22:04:20] haku: thats a good frame to mess with
[2024-04-14T22:05:15] haku: how much is it in $ if you dont mind me asking
[2024-04-14T22:10:53] haku: @james @roscheeee is this what you guys call flex in europe? we call this impact wrench drill thingy in the US
[2024-04-14T22:11:27] Jan: The temp will not drop anymore while driving, the heat is in the heatsink, but doesnt leave the scooter
[2024-04-14T22:11:44] haku: i only use this for removing lug nuts back then. how do you use this as a grinder
[2024-04-14T22:16:57] puneDir: He's selling for 250 euro
[2024-04-14T22:17:01] puneDir: It even has suspension
[2024-04-14T22:17:07] Chen Simhony: That's pro 2 frame ?
[2024-04-14T22:17:07] puneDir: İt literally had eveything
[2024-04-14T22:17:53] Yamal: maybe like raphael, the It looks like he's holding it with a 3D piece
[2024-04-14T22:17:57] Mirono escooters: Looks, weak?
[2024-04-14T22:18:00] Mirono escooters: Or am I wrong
[2024-04-14T22:19:02] haku: ask him if he take 150 euro cash money
[2024-04-14T22:19:18] Yamal: <photos/photo_14309@14-04-2024_22-19-18.jpg>
[2024-04-14T22:19:54] Yamal: <photos/photo_14310@14-04-2024_22-19-54.jpg>
[2024-04-14T22:20:12] Unknown: Roshee- flex is grinder, grinder is dremel. James- flex is brand That's a milwaukee impact drill. Football is soccer And some men were men but now women and also same for women
[2024-04-14T22:21:16] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-04-14T22:21:45] puneDir: I will rework on it And it's probably ok
[2024-04-14T22:21:49] puneDir: I will xd
[2024-04-14T22:24:22] haku: thats a short stem. he must be 4feet tall
[2024-04-14T22:24:58] haku: that setup is badass though
[2024-04-14T22:25:22] haku: and why is his ly rims so skinny.
[2024-04-14T22:45:03] Yamal: that e-scooter is worth millions of dollars
[2024-04-14T22:47:31] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha
[2024-04-14T22:47:36] Mirono escooters: It really is
[2024-04-14T23:04:22] haku: frodo baggins zooming to mordor
[2024-04-14T23:10:38] Yamal: I can give you about 50 e-scooters for circuits, different models, all with very short masts.
[2024-04-14T23:27:13] haku: i will also try to do this. i wonder what size bullet connectors they used
[2024-04-14T23:27:36] haku: easier to manage cable but idk of adds resistance
[2024-04-14T23:42:31] Mirono escooters: Barely anything
[2024-04-14T23:42:34] Mirono escooters: Problably 8mm
[2024-04-15T00:08:12] sombre_enfant: Custom rim to have better tire shape and tubeless bead no tire fall mid ride, yesterday one guy lodt because of his rim
[2024-04-15T00:08:20] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Amass 8mm bullet
[2024-04-15T00:08:43] Yamal: What I don't understand is why not lower the heatsink further and leave the fins more exposed to the air, instead of so high, almost flush...
[2024-04-15T00:12:33] Yamal: I think I almost have the idea, I'm going to do the same but letting the base of the heatsink fall onto the sheet metal, I think I'm going to remove 4 fins from each side so that it can sit well, and the heatsink is 20cm wide by 10cm long, well I plan to cut sheet metal 17cm by 10.5 long.....
[2024-04-15T00:15:02] Yamal: <photos/photo_14312@15-04-2024_00-15-02.jpg>
[2024-04-15T00:15:45] haku: what custom rim ly only sells 3 kinds of tubeless rims. actually just 2 now. the 11" and the 13" the difference is just the width
[2024-04-15T00:17:05] haku: thanks and congrats to your podium finish
[2024-04-15T00:18:17] haku: thats probably what hes done
[2024-04-15T00:20:30] haku: get someone to custom.make you 3dprinted or machined mounts
[2024-04-15T00:22:33] sombre_enfant: Check RFP website and buy, theres no only china bro
[2024-04-15T00:25:03] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2024-04-15T00:25:14] haku: whats the rfp website
[2024-04-15T00:34:07] haku: cant find it. stop gatekeep opensource this stuff.
[2024-04-15T00:37:02] Yamal: rfp-performance.com
[2024-04-15T00:44:54] sombre_enfant: Pm him if u want to order maybe bit better deal
[2024-04-15T01:44:24] Yamal: today's winner
[2024-04-15T01:45:02] Yamal: The world of modifications is simply fascinating.
[2024-04-15T01:48:42] haku: never heard of that brand? any good?
[2024-04-15T01:48:59] haku: looks like a zero
[2024-04-15T01:53:32] haku: is that the scooter that won the el trott racing league?
[2024-04-15T01:56:38] Yamal: I mean I think this is the e-scooter Kilian Larher
[2024-04-15T01:58:08] Happy Giraffe: Thats an impact driver
[2024-04-15T01:58:17] haku: thats the winner yea? crazy how folks can turn any scooter into a beast. its just like cars. can get the jankiest one and slap a big motor then there she blows
[2024-04-15T01:59:36] Unknown: How its got stock throttle and display on it
[2024-04-15T02:00:00] Unknown: Does the bell add 20hp?
[2024-04-15T02:00:38] Happy Giraffe: This bell does
[2024-04-15T02:02:59] Yamal: Vesc performance
[2024-04-15T02:02:59] Yamal: Vesc performance
[2024-04-15T02:04:44] haku: thats crazy. doesnt even have a big deck
[2024-04-15T02:04:54] haku: wtf did he use. nmc batteries
[2024-04-15T02:05:31] haku: my vsett 9+ has a chance then
[2024-04-15T02:06:56] haku: skilled racers plays a big part too
[2024-04-15T02:11:41] Yamal: In the race the miniwalker ran very very well, it looked quite fast on the straight and in general, in the end in a race you don't need as much battery, of course the bigger the battery the less voltage drop you will have and the more discharge, but also more weight, and the driver is clear that it is very important, and having trained on the circuit and knowing it too...
[2024-04-15T02:12:22] haku: how many kilometers is the track in total?
[2024-04-15T02:12:32] haku: if you add up the laps
[2024-04-15T02:13:24] Yamal: I don't know that circuit and its distance,
[2024-04-15T02:14:41] Yamal: https://youtu.be/e2J51RaaY4Y?si=rnj3cO63fSAAKPvD
[2024-04-15T06:20:41] rosheee: she never send ;-/
[2024-04-15T07:13:41] haku: spintend da boss
[2024-04-15T07:19:34] Yamal: If I had money I would send you a Nami frame complete with standard 70h motors or speed of your choice so that a work of art could be assembled... half of Europe would shake😁
[2024-04-15T07:23:48] Yamal: complete chassis €1200 engines €800 €2000 % 352 group members = €5.6 who are encouraged ? 😁
[2024-04-15T07:24:32] haku: nami frame $1200 where?
[2024-04-15T07:24:41] Yamal: 🚀rocket james🚀
[2024-04-15T07:25:01] Yamal: From Nami I don’t know now if is more cheap
[2024-04-15T07:25:12] haku: lord james.
[2024-04-15T07:25:15] Yamal: But is complete only out motor controller and baterry
[2024-04-15T07:26:12] haku: i didnt know they sell just frames. comes with stem forks and suspension?
[2024-04-15T07:30:27] haku: james a lowkey baller with alot of knowledge he shares.
[2024-04-15T07:31:26] Happy Giraffe: Nami true police magnet in most EU countries😁
[2024-04-15T07:40:41] Jesús: Nor will he ever do it.
[2024-04-15T07:42:14] rosheee: yes
[2024-04-15T07:42:22] rosheee: even if he said
[2024-04-15T07:42:36] rosheee: after ppl showed him 10x same stuff 😞
[2024-04-15T07:42:51] rosheee: but they hope he now able to ❤️ do it
[2024-04-15T07:43:36] rosheee: but ppl knew he will never....but he had no balls to tell them..and asked again and played "my friend"
[2024-04-15T07:43:36] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-15T07:45:42] Yamal: Let's see, once I spoke with Michael (he manufacturer) made this possibility, selling the complete frame, for you to place your motors, esc and battery and told me that without a problem
[2024-04-15T07:45:51] rosheee: i would bang nami becaues was worst ride in my life
[2024-04-15T07:45:55] rosheee: <sticker>
[2024-04-15T07:46:09] GABE: 90h?
[2024-04-15T07:46:29] Yamal: 75h
[2024-04-15T07:46:34] GABE: it's fine
[2024-04-15T07:46:39] GABE: Nice
[2024-04-15T07:46:51] rosheee: 6-7h help werent enough
[2024-04-15T07:47:57] Yamal: but for those engines you need to separate the swingarms, from the factory they fit up to 70h
[2024-04-15T07:49:27] Yamal: do 100 kilometers in a Nami vs your g30 to see which is more comfortable😁
[2024-04-15T07:50:32] Jesús: No, it always went wrong and on top of that you took and disfigured the whole scooter in bad faith, friend?
[2024-04-15T07:50:52] Yamal: We need 350 more likes for this to be possible..
[2024-04-15T07:50:56] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-04-15T07:53:42] rosheee: it went wrong ^^?
[2024-04-15T07:54:03] rosheee: everytime when i set it up it went good and u were happy and tested ^^ and send me logfiles and had fun...then u changed stuff then u did this and that ^^ u never said that i did something wrong 😊 wanna see chat? i did a backup of the config(because u said 2nd time u will pay because u penetrated me so hardcore 😃 even when i was sick..no respect and asked soo many times the same questions...i showed u how to setup for hours..and u never watched the screen or took notes...but anyway hope u can do it now 😉 and don't talk about his mama

[2024-04-15T07:58:19] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-15T07:59:38] Jesús: It always ends badly with cuts and shitty noises, and what did you do, you came in by deceiving me and you misconfigured the whole scooter that people don’t do that bad people do, if you want money work and stop writing what you have to tell me tell me don’t be a little boy anymore
[2024-04-15T08:00:27] rosheee: Yes and why? remember after we lowered the phase (Which u instantly put to max of esc again after 24h) then it worked..no stress no sounds nothing
[2024-04-15T08:01:11] rosheee: u were happy
[2024-04-15T08:05:29] rosheee: i work ^^ and u said u pay ^^ u were the 1ST EVER i asked under pressure of other persons..because it was 2 much riding a rion and not having 40 euro for 6-8h work for someone..promise that u send the money but idk tbh 😆it is just a joke because if ppl would read the chat.... anyway..like i said..after the 4..5th..idk i even WROTE IT DOWN FOR YOU ^^ and u were still unable to do it..that made me rrly sad and yah.. i blocked u and u wrote me @ fb...and played the nice guy and u're so happy that we can write again 2gether and congraz to my birthday and then playin' the same game again.

[2024-04-15T08:06:09] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-04-15T09:09:09] Yamal: But did you agree with him before starting the work that he had to pay you?
[2024-04-15T09:12:32] rosheee: Nooo xD I helped him for so many hours..ofc free xD But ..i needed some time to write that he has to pay xD i felt so bad just writing it..because i showed him the whole setup part sooo many times..then ppl told me..he should pay..maybe THEN he wanna learn..i wrote each step down..dis screen recording..did it via teamviewer...and for hours..even when i had fever AF and he knew (bit egoistic)...and i still helped cuz passion...but i charge 20 euro for the chat :-P
[2024-04-15T09:13:52] rosheee: Anyway..old fart ...move on ..so did he and now he can setup vesc
[2024-04-15T09:14:04] Yamal: So Rochee with my respects you haven't said anything before...
[2024-04-15T09:15:19] Yamal: If you are helping someone out of vocation or to help them out and suddenly you tell them: you have to pay me!! without warning is not acceptable either, on the one hand
[2024-04-15T09:16:46] Yamal: and then passing screenshots in a public chat is not my opinion willingly either, I am not defending anyone, I just say that you have to be men and say things clearly! I don't know, these things make me sad
[2024-04-15T09:17:06] rosheee: XD i said it clearly
[2024-04-15T09:17:09] Jesús: I have to pay him because I have a Rion and a G30 so he has to take the money out of me
[2024-04-15T09:17:28] rosheee: Ok now it gets personal
[2024-04-15T09:18:06] rosheee: I am out ^^ yes because i habe a g30..
[2024-04-15T09:18:39] Yamal: good vibes please
[2024-04-15T09:18:51] rosheee: I would never charge for help..never..it was just a blocker that he use google..and read cprrectöy
[2024-04-15T09:19:01] rosheee: I just wanted to help him
[2024-04-15T09:19:21] rosheee: Why else should i spend days..even at hospital
[2024-04-15T09:19:51] rosheee: Disrespect is when u not listen..not read what someone (manual)..wrote for u...and like i said..and wrote..i wpuld have instantly returned it if he send
[2024-04-15T09:21:14] rosheee: Anyway drama
[2024-04-15T09:21:14] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-04-15T10:17:59] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Thx you
[2024-04-15T10:48:38] haku: 9h of labor no matter if its free or paid if you still tip the person for his hard work. just my opinion. unless the worker really refuses
[2024-04-15T10:51:32] haku: thats the las vegas way. sex worker industry knows this
[2024-04-15T10:55:48] Yamal: we agree
[2024-04-15T10:59:43] haku: peoples time is not free unless the person really refuses to get paid. specially this kind of work.
