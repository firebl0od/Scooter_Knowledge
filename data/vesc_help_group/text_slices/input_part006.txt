[2023-11-19T23:18:24] Mirono escooters: Here, these and kotto are by far the most motorbike grade you can find.
[2023-11-19T23:18:41] Mirono escooters: Because brake manufacturers love to make it lightweight and fragile Fuck that, make it sturdy, overengineered and big.
[2023-11-19T23:19:43] haku: i agree. for scooters it should have big master cylinders like motorcycles.
[2023-11-19T23:19:43] Face de Pin Sucé: The R version is 28S, don't know much more than 75H and big battery
[2023-11-19T23:19:54] Mirono escooters: Kotto is great, very chonk
[2023-11-19T23:20:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Sadly nope
[2023-11-19T23:20:07] Mirono escooters: And for magura lovers, my screenshot one has a lot of power.
[2023-11-19T23:20:14] Face de Pin Sucé: But I heard that first version is using Kelly

[2023-11-19T23:21:25] Paolo ⁭: Looks the most reliable even unefficient and shit hahs
[2023-11-19T23:22:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Where did you hear about kelly 28S for this one ?
[2023-11-19T23:22:15] Кирилл: Kelly has 144v one
[2023-11-19T23:22:20] Кирилл: But they are so big
[2023-11-19T23:22:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2023-11-19T23:22:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Very big
[2023-11-19T23:22:51] Face de Pin Sucé: That's why I'm not sure about it
[2023-11-19T23:23:35] Paolo ⁭: They claimed power rating is same as kelly
[2023-11-19T23:23:51] Paolo ⁭: They always do peak voltage x peak current
[2023-11-19T23:23:56] Кирилл: Ahahah, okay
[2023-11-19T23:24:03] Paolo ⁭: Like slack does
[2023-11-19T23:24:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Okay interesting, I haven't checked that much
[2023-11-19T23:24:17] Paolo ⁭: And its exactely the power rating of kelly
[2023-11-19T23:24:18] Кирилл: Then never true about power
[2023-11-19T23:24:41] Paolo ⁭: The 144v 200a is big as 7230
[2023-11-19T23:29:53] haku: @PaoloWu do you know who makes the inmotion rs motor?
[2023-11-19T23:31:31] Paolo ⁭: Maybe same factory which makes ninebot motor
[2023-11-19T23:31:40] Paolo ⁭: Design looks so similar
[2023-11-19T23:33:35] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2023-11-19T23:46:13] haku: this scooter $500 in the US
[2023-11-19T23:46:46] haku: ive never heard of it though
[2023-11-19T23:47:10] Mirono escooters: That's, a deal, if real hahaha
[2023-11-19T23:47:56] haku: never heard of this brand. im not buying it. im just testing if the coupon works
[2023-11-19T23:48:33] Mirono escooters: Link? 🤷
[2023-11-19T23:49:41] Mirono escooters: Isn't that just a clone of the Segway g2 / Xiaomi pro 4?
[2023-11-19T23:50:11] haku: no idea. it looks like the same frame but different suspension
[2023-11-19T23:56:32] haku: 29 kilos. more weight than a vsett 9
[2023-11-20T00:05:53] Happy Giraffe: There was a time Vsett 10+ were sold at 149,99-199,99$ and people were falling to it😂
[2023-11-20T00:08:40] haku: my first scooter was a vsett 9 paid retail for it. big mistake
[2023-11-20T00:09:03] cihan: Why?
[2023-11-20T00:09:10] cihan: Why is it bad?
[2023-11-20T00:09:34] haku: mechanical brakes. tubed 8.5 inch tires.
[2023-11-20T00:11:19] haku: i always have to tinker with the brakes or it will be noisy. tires are really tiny for the speed it does. thats my opinion
[2023-11-20T00:12:27] cihan: Thanks
[2023-11-20T00:14:08] Happy Giraffe: Not sure if you understood, it was a scam to sell scooters at 10% of normal price from fake store
[2023-11-20T00:14:54] haku: also sometimes when doing top speed and when you let go of the throttle it will e brake sometimes. i have to brace for it. very unpredictable
[2023-11-20T00:15:31] haku: its hard to coast.
[2023-11-20T00:16:54] Happy Giraffe: Less leverage so easier to stop the wheel, tho disc size is limited
[2023-11-20T00:17:15] Happy Giraffe: On bikes same brakes behave very differently😁
[2023-11-20T00:18:07] cihan: Sorry, I misunderstood it.)
[2023-11-20T00:18:30] haku: i dont know i just got spoiled on my $700 laotie haha.
[2023-11-20T00:19:02] cihan: You mean dental braces?
[2023-11-20T00:19:22] haku: yes you will need it when it throws you over
[2023-11-20T00:20:06] cihan: I'm sad about it as someone who lost some teeth with bicycle accident.
[2023-11-20T00:20:34] haku: sorry to hear that. i also have chipped tooth
[2023-11-20T00:20:59] haku: dam where did you put battery
[2023-11-20T00:21:23] Mirono escooters: S count no matter Can make 22s1p, just 22 cells
[2023-11-20T00:21:49] haku: voltage sag tho
[2023-11-20T00:22:04] haku: i see. pretty cool
[2023-11-20T00:22:15] Jan: => drill hole, make a thread then titanium screw in and zirconia tooth on it, done
[2023-11-20T00:25:00] haku: thats crazy.
[2023-11-20T00:25:07] NetworkDir: Also don’t forget loctite 😂
[2023-11-20T00:25:51] haku: would epoxy work? loctite might come off.
[2023-11-20T00:26:08] Mirono escooters: Noooo
[2023-11-20T00:26:13] Mirono escooters: Loctite made for it hahahah

[2023-11-20T00:50:14] Mirono escooters: Man is living his best life. Jealous
[2023-11-20T00:51:44] Jan: I grew up with airline parents, else that spontanious would not be possible
[2023-11-20T00:52:10] haku: lucky guy
[2023-11-20T00:52:26] Jan: Also i can only do this because i get the flight very cheap, im not shitting money

[2023-11-20T00:53:12] Jan: Yeah
[2023-11-20T00:53:20] Jan: ^^
[2023-11-20T00:53:24] Mirono escooters: Flying to Japan is €€ usually

[2023-11-20T00:53:37] Mirono escooters: 2 weeks planning or forget it haahha
[2023-11-20T00:54:05] Jan: Paid 250€ for a business class ticket
[2023-11-20T00:54:10] cihan: Not so easy when sockets are broken.) And it means being toothless for more than 8 months.
[2023-11-20T00:54:14] Mirono escooters: Steal
[2023-11-20T00:54:17] Mirono escooters: Have fun bud!

[2023-11-20T00:57:25] Jan: But at least it has free wifi
[2023-11-20T00:58:55] cihan: Best age of electric scooter or any other 2 wheel could be when stem cell tooth regeneration will be commercially available.)
[2023-11-20T01:33:52] haku: this fake pmt lost its roundness. its flatening out. 😂
[2023-11-20T01:35:21] haku: oh ok. its just in the rear that this is happening to.
[2023-11-20T02:48:51] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Wanda p1237? Shittiest tire ever

[2023-11-20T05:55:04] Happy Giraffe: I had to sometimes pay more for Helsinki Copenhagen, and no scooter allowed😡
[2023-11-20T05:55:49] Happy Giraffe: Train was best to take scooter with me, had 13s6p and 13s7p batteries so could ride all day in different city

[2023-11-20T07:33:17] Gabe Enzo: it is. iscooting tyres are shit. and I paid 50€ for them.
[2023-11-20T07:34:58] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: WTF
[2023-11-20T07:35:18] Gabe Enzo: Yes. They made me pay 20 for post. then taxed me on the post price too.
[2023-11-20T07:35:32] Gabe Enzo: Then like 30% tax on the actual tyres
[2023-11-20T07:37:39] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Deli sa-206, Wanda p1069 and p1237 for 5-6€ but seller doesn't give guarantee and recommends ulip's or xuanchengs
[2023-11-20T07:38:22] Gabe Enzo: yeah they were 5€ each too
[2023-11-20T07:38:36] Gabe Enzo: They molded the tyres wrong
[2023-11-20T07:38:40] Gabe Enzo: too

[2023-11-20T07:43:55] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: 154, fits fine

[2023-11-20T07:49:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Look back Denis's chat, you find it was trash two years ago
[2023-11-20T07:49:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Inner ring rips
[2023-11-20T07:52:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You could slice salami and fry it same time
[2023-11-20T07:59:29] rosheee: XD
[2023-11-20T08:01:18] Mirono escooters: Ulip👍
[2023-11-20T08:03:33] rosheee: true was just a test to see what's possible regarding temp. of caliper, pads, brake fluid and all brake adapters + hose front is a 100euro disc rear 18 euro front 4 piston caliper rear 2 front has more brake performance but leaked cuz brake fluid reached boiling point of +360degrees C rear less performance (cuz disc) didn't jizzed and not reached boiling point pads still work perfect discs as well last time both calipers lost their magnetism this time not also front has our x partner brake lever and rear has saint
[2023-11-20T08:07:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Rear always boils less Same was in dh , different amount of oil also helps it
[2023-11-20T08:07:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What pads they are?
[2023-11-20T08:09:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dh life made me use semi ,so one dh ride ends with some rest and pad change coz nothing left almost
[2023-11-20T08:09:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Irl easier to change pad than disc
[2023-11-20T08:10:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also with a shit disc or weared down one is dangerous, i saw one broke around 60 kmh on the road
[2023-11-20T08:11:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In the Next spin disc ripped scooter arm off 😅 and flying began
[2023-11-20T08:18:03] haku: that is wild. what brand calipers and rotors are those?
[2023-11-20T08:29:49] rosheee: the ones i send u 😃 kool stop copper sinter why should rear boil less?
[2023-11-20T08:31:26] rosheee: rear one is just cuz *i fucked the "old" disc up ^^' front is brakeSTUFF punchout disc with magura mt7 caliper kool stop sinter copper pads, trickstuff bionol, goodridge banjo + adapter, xlc steelflex small hose and our soon released brake lever
[2023-11-20T08:31:54] rosheee: rear is trickstuff dächle hd + magura mt8 caliper + kool stop sinter copper pads and same fluid + hose and shimano saint lever
[2023-11-20T08:37:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is more oil in the System since its longer
[2023-11-20T08:43:55] rosheee: True dat But it spitted out right @the banjo. Also preasure increase. Oil wasnt rly hot half way
[2023-11-20T09:02:22] francois schempers: because xesc's cfw compensate in the background, when you put 7A fw, they actually put more Amps to compensate for the loss of torque, Vesc does exactly what you asked, so you don't get the same boost
[2023-11-20T10:28:27] Happy Giraffe: So vesc keeps max battery amps and just offsets the stator angle more?🤔
[2023-11-20T10:28:49] Happy Giraffe: I havent seen FW pull more watts so thats why Im wondering
[2023-11-20T10:43:05] Gabe Enzo: so it's true field weakening in essence.
[2023-11-20T10:45:22] Gabe Enzo: because it doesn't break the laws of the battery. I was always wondering why my cells kept shutting down when I clearly calculated the correct amperage with XESC and of course motors burning XESC so shit 😂
[2023-11-20T10:57:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: as it gets hot the volume grows , usually that's why lever part should be not full ,but after a certain lvl all you can do is grow size off all

[2023-11-20T17:44:26] haku: and is this a track specifically for scooters or any vehicle?
[2023-11-20T17:44:57] Face de Pin Sucé: They organise open trackdays almost everyweek, we just call the day before to tell we come

[2023-11-20T19:30:59] puneDir: Done
[2023-11-20T19:31:35] Mirono escooters: Wich resistor did u end up using
[2023-11-20T19:32:40] puneDir: 270k
[2023-11-20T19:32:50] puneDir: The ones i bought for g30 esc
[2023-11-20T19:37:28] Mirono escooters: Instead of 10k?
[2023-11-20T19:37:42] puneDir: No
[2023-11-20T19:37:44] puneDir: Instead of 100
[2023-11-20T19:37:47] puneDir: 10k works now
[2023-11-20T19:38:46] Mirono escooters: Why didn't it in beginning?
[2023-11-20T19:39:25] puneDir: maybe lotfett
[2023-11-20T20:22:55] puneDir: <photos/photo_11054@20-11-2023_20-22-55.jpg>
[2023-11-20T21:11:44] haku: very nice! how much?
[2023-11-20T21:43:36] puneDir: <photos/photo_11055@20-11-2023_21-43-36.jpg>
[2023-11-20T21:46:40] Paolo ⁭: Seems still to be original stm
[2023-11-20T21:46:48] puneDir: Yes it is
[2023-11-20T21:48:21] Mirono escooters: Maybe 1 store does?
[2023-11-20T21:48:53] Paolo ⁭: Actually flipsky uses them
[2023-11-20T21:49:42] Paolo ⁭: Seems reliable too, but i prefer original one
[2023-11-20T22:02:52] Mirono escooters: No way they did all that.
[2023-11-20T22:03:46] puneDir: and dual works
[2023-11-20T22:03:49] puneDir: ignition too
[2023-11-20T22:05:34] Jhinzuo ~~: The Alu and the box I had both genuine stm32
[2023-11-20T22:07:37] Jhinzuo ~~: The box is back alive tho but My duty cycle jumps to 160% doing nothing I guess I still have 1 fault left 👀
[2023-11-20T22:08:58] puneDir: <photos/photo_11056@20-11-2023_22-08-58.jpg>
[2023-11-20T22:09:02] puneDir: How can i mount it
[2023-11-20T22:09:20] puneDir: I dont have thermal glue Also cant screw it
[2023-11-20T22:13:46] Mirono escooters: Not
[2023-11-20T22:13:57] Mirono escooters: Thermalglue
[2023-11-20T22:31:24] puneDir: im going to squish it until i find some thermal glue
[2023-11-20T22:52:37] Happy Giraffe: It didn't have any mounting designed?
[2023-11-20T22:53:46] Happy Giraffe: Could do a clamp like that
[2023-11-20T22:54:58] puneDir: Im going to do it weekend
[2023-11-20T22:55:05] puneDir: I just need to go school tomorrow
[2023-11-20T22:55:15] Happy Giraffe: Bicycle😂
[2023-11-20T22:55:38] puneDir: its flooding outside
[2023-11-20T22:55:49] Mirono escooters: Why do people keep rushing because they need scoot quickly Do when time or backup scoot.
[2023-11-20T22:56:16] puneDir: i will take care of it
[2023-11-20T23:01:58] Happy Giraffe: I broke my vesc like this, was in a hurry to pack things at school as they wanted to end day early. 12v like got twisted somehow and vesc didnt live after that. Not fun pushing heavy bike 8km😂
[2023-11-20T23:02:35] Happy Giraffe: And barely could pedal as it was so hard without any power
[2023-11-20T23:19:02] Mirono escooters: Hahahaahah, yee
[2023-11-20T23:26:34] Gabe Enzo: Who can recommend me a good 20s smart BMS
[2023-11-20T23:27:00] Gabe Enzo: For 7kw
[2023-11-20T23:27:06] Mirono escooters: Llt

[2023-11-20T23:28:19] puneDir: This is flying
[2023-11-20T23:28:30] puneDir: Im 95 kg and it makes auto wheelies 😃
[2023-11-20T23:28:41] Mirono escooters: Does your motor detection work and is the motor smooth under load? Wich power.
[2023-11-20T23:28:44] puneDir: No more wheelie for sure
[2023-11-20T23:28:49] puneDir: No it readed 400 uf
[2023-11-20T23:28:52] puneDir: I set to 310
[2023-11-20T23:29:01] puneDir: 100 phase 35 battery dual
[2023-11-20T23:29:36] puneDir: Tomorrow im going to fly
[2023-11-20T23:30:11] Mirono escooters: Same as mine
[2023-11-20T23:30:18] Mirono escooters: What are your motor settings now
[2023-11-20T23:31:05] puneDir: Resistance 87 uf thingy 310
[2023-11-20T23:31:11] puneDir: Front sensorless rear hall
[2023-11-20T23:31:35] puneDir: its teleporting 💀
[2023-11-20T23:32:09] Mirono escooters: Show all
[2023-11-20T23:32:31] Mirono escooters: Yee I test this when not raining
[2023-11-20T23:32:41] puneDir: My front box detecs same
[2023-11-20T23:33:12] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters i feel like alupcb gives 3x more current
[2023-11-20T23:33:41] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-11-20T23:33:46] Mirono escooters: Then he's at 300a phase
[2023-11-20T23:34:11] puneDir: but motor doesnt shakes like front
[2023-11-20T23:34:21] puneDir: No im sure im getting true thing
[2023-11-20T23:34:41] puneDir: Cant wait to see how 6600 watts feel
[2023-11-20T23:34:46] Mirono escooters: Tune front
[2023-11-20T23:34:54] puneDir: maybe my front motor dead
[2023-11-20T23:35:09] puneDir: its fine i have another gen1
[2023-11-20T23:35:35] puneDir: its 3c outside
[2023-11-20T23:35:40] Mirono escooters: He did hit good speeds
[2023-11-20T23:36:16] puneDir: Yes
[2023-11-20T23:36:21] puneDir: Its untouchable
[2023-11-20T23:37:05] puneDir: Maybe it feels slower because of its colder
[2023-11-20T23:37:52] puneDir: is this a thing
[2023-11-20T23:38:16] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-11-20T23:38:21] Mirono escooters: I'm at 3. Whatever kw
[2023-11-20T23:38:30] puneDir: also my battery drains faster on cold
[2023-11-20T23:38:38] Mirono escooters: Obv
[2023-11-20T23:38:53] puneDir: <photos/photo_11058@20-11-2023_23-38-53.jpg>
[2023-11-20T23:39:01] puneDir: my friend did that with ai xD
[2023-11-20T23:39:40] puneDir: that ignition was weird
[2023-11-20T23:39:55] puneDir: it kept randomly opening for some time
[2023-11-20T23:39:58] puneDir: Than got normal
[2023-11-20T23:40:22] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-11-20T23:47:58] haku: nice scenery where you ride
[2023-11-20T23:48:27] puneDir: Its ai generated 😂
[2023-11-20T23:48:38] puneDir: But yes scenery is nice
[2023-11-20T23:48:42] haku: oh. lol
[2023-11-20T23:49:36] haku: what app can do this ai generated?
[2023-11-21T00:04:04] Gabe Enzo: does anyone know if it's possible to get a cheap Xiaomi clamp?
[2023-11-21T00:04:08] Gabe Enzo: Monorim is a ripoff.
[2023-11-21T00:08:25] Gabe Enzo: Do cells always drop in voltage or are some cells resilient to it?
[2023-11-21T00:08:28] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters
[2023-11-21T00:23:59] Jhinzuo ~~: what clamp
[2023-11-21T00:27:17] haku: for battery wiring what is better pvc or silicone sleeve?
[2023-11-21T00:27:18] haku: <photos/photo_11060@21-11-2023_00-27-18.jpg>
[2023-11-21T00:30:39] haku: im thinkimg pvc but due to fire retard proof? but please correct me
[2023-11-21T00:34:32] Oreo huzky: Always silicone
[2023-11-21T00:34:43] Gabe Enzo: shit so you can't fold the scooter anymore
[2023-11-21T00:34:49] haku: ty
[2023-11-21T00:35:23] Oreo huzky: Silicone is more heat resistant and bendable
[2023-11-21T00:37:48] Jhinzuo ~~: Ah the xlock thing
[2023-11-21T00:38:32] haku: its still copper yea? but finer strands?
[2023-11-21T00:39:27] Gabe Enzo: Correct
[2023-11-21T00:39:45] Gabe Enzo: Copper, the essence of electronics
[2023-11-21T00:39:50] haku: thanks fellas.
[2023-11-21T00:48:02] haku: wow that was fast! took less than a week to arrive here from china.
[2023-11-21T00:49:10] haku: @PaoloWu how do i test this without buying the batteries?
[2023-11-21T00:52:23] NetworkDir: Empty nikel strip maybe
[2023-11-21T00:53:24] haku: i will mess with it after my workout. i have a few copper sheets and nickel sheets. bit i dont have batteries yet
[2023-11-21T00:56:32] Gabe Enzo: How much was it?
[2023-11-21T00:56:44] haku: what are battery negative/positive made of? nickel or stainless steel
[2023-11-21T00:56:46] Gabe Enzo: got a link?
[2023-11-21T00:56:50] Gabe Enzo: Nickel.
[2023-11-21T00:56:55] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2023-11-21T00:57:02] Gabe Enzo: idk how I know this
[2023-11-21T00:57:24] haku: its from aliexpress
[2023-11-21T00:57:42] Gabe Enzo: I don't mind
[2023-11-21T00:59:05] haku: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $461.47 20%OFF | Glitter 811H 811H Battery Aluminum to Copper Battery Spot Welding Machine Large Unit Aluminum to Nickel Welding Equipment https://a.aliexpress.com/_m0ab3Qk
[2023-11-21T00:59:44] haku: i hope i dont burn my house lol my old spot welder is seesii from amazon. cant spot weld .2
[2023-11-21T01:02:51] haku: ill be the guinnea pig and see how this performs compared to kweld+lipo
[2023-11-21T01:15:15] NetworkDir: 42kW☠️
[2023-11-21T01:15:44] NetworkDir: Be careful and be safe 🥰
[2023-11-21T01:16:12] haku: thank you. i will try
[2023-11-21T01:17:32] NetworkDir: In first try with nikel pure And watch youtube tutorials And buy shitty cheap battery’s And try with cheap batts
[2023-11-21T01:18:03] NetworkDir: After successful battery pack and without problem try with expensive cells
[2023-11-21T01:19:25] haku: i have made a pack before but with nickel only. i bought this to try copper+nickel. yes i agree i will start with dead cells first so i dont blow holes thru them
[2023-11-21T01:20:43] haku: i am a noob though. i did not even put a bms on that pack lol
[2023-11-21T01:24:27] haku: from what vesc lords are saying nickel plated steel will work well with copper
[2023-11-21T01:46:26] FOCforever: Hi everyone, I'm De-bodgery on youtube. Probably many of you are familiar with my tear down channel EV Components Review.
[2023-11-21T01:46:52] Gabe Enzo: Hi
[2023-11-21T01:49:04] haku: hey bud. i love your videos. you should sell mr. snippy
[2023-11-21T01:54:10] cihan: I didn't know I was following your channel, probably I found useful things in past. Welcome :)
[2023-11-21T01:55:35] FOCforever: Ha! Actually making plans to do just that!
[2023-11-21T01:56:04] FOCforever: I jsut found out about this forum like 10 minutes ago.
[2023-11-21T01:58:12] FOCforever: I thought I was already part of all the VESC channels in various forms.
[2023-11-21T02:02:53] FOCforever: Not everything will be VESC, but does anyone think it's a problem to post my tear down videos here? I can jsut post the VESC stuff if that's a problem...you know in the future as I make them.
[2023-11-21T02:16:20] FOCforever: Nice...better to ask than assume!
[2023-11-21T02:42:16] Ion: Hi, I just looked at your channel, really cool stuff, 😁
[2023-11-21T03:31:41] Jhinzuo ~~: Just looked up something and found out I've been watching ur videos for days, you helped me resurrect 75100 box ESC 👀
[2023-11-21T06:35:06] haku: these spot welder leads are thick.
[2023-11-21T07:44:34] Mirono escooters: LifePo4 has a extremely flat discharge curve
[2023-11-21T07:45:09] Mirono escooters: Only negative is price and it's thiccer then pvc
[2023-11-21T07:45:16] Mirono escooters: And tears easier
[2023-11-21T07:52:37] haku: it can do .2copper and .2nickel fine.
[2023-11-21T07:53:16] haku: i dont think im doing it right. its blowing holes on the nickel
[2023-11-21T07:54:11] haku: <photos/photo_11064@21-11-2023_07-54-11.jpg>
[2023-11-21T07:55:23] haku: back sife after tearing
[2023-11-21T07:57:35] Mirono escooters: Too powerful
[2023-11-21T07:59:13] haku: it is. i need to find the right power. its blowing thru the nickel but the copper sticks pretty well
[2023-11-21T07:59:23] FOCforever: This many...
[2023-11-21T08:00:24] FOCforever: How did I do that?
[2023-11-21T08:01:48] haku: are leads suppose to be sharp @Mirono_escooters?
[2023-11-21T08:01:54] FOCforever: What spot welder are you using?
[2023-11-21T08:02:10] haku: glitter 811h
[2023-11-21T08:02:49] Mirono escooters: Sharp enough yes
[2023-11-21T08:02:53] FOCforever: Do you have .3mm nickel?
[2023-11-21T08:03:23] haku: no. most i have is .2nickel and .2copper
[2023-11-21T08:03:44] haku: too dull?
[2023-11-21T08:03:45] FOCforever: Well I guess you need to turn down the power a little.
[2023-11-21T08:04:01] haku: gotcha! thanks
[2023-11-21T08:05:04] Mirono escooters: Fine
[2023-11-21T08:06:18] FOCforever: I have a KWELD and a super cap bank I built.
[2023-11-21T08:08:01] haku: nice! i was originally going to get that. some guy in fb marketplace was selling one. he said we would meet up on thanksgiving because i live 1 state away. the guy sold it instead. i cant blame him those are hard to get here
[2023-11-21T08:08:24] FOCforever: These are KWELD tips and 8mm OD so it doesn't look the same, but this is as sharp as I ever do for mine.
[2023-11-21T08:09:17] FOCforever: I bought mine in 2019. some of the BEST money I've ever spent!
[2023-11-21T08:09:22] haku: thats a nice setup you have. im still learning to spot nickel+copper.
[2023-11-21T08:09:59] haku: yes. huge community too. if this doesnt work out ill just have to cough up the $$ and get one.
[2023-11-21T08:10:00] FOCforever: I cheat! I use nickel plated copper.
[2023-11-21T08:18:17] FOCforever: I had to cut this back some. This many super caps in parallel delivered more current than the KWELD can handle. It would display OVER CURRENT. I had to reduce it to 4 in parallel to finally get past the over current message. When I put this together, I figured I'd use all the super caps I had. My thinking was, "how can there be too much current delivery?" Well that's wrong...LOL!
[2023-11-21T08:27:12] FOCforever: This is how I charge the super caps. It's dual Meanwell LRS-350-4.2 power supplies in series to get 8.1v. The rocker switch on top switches in and out the resistor bank under the heat sink. They let me slowly charge the super caps while under the current limits of the PSU's. Once they get to mostly charged, I bypass them and the PSU's feed direct into the caps. You can see a yellow wire. This lets me use those same resistors to slowly discharge the caps when I'm done with the KWELD.
[2023-11-21T08:28:19] FOCforever: <photos/photo_11071@21-11-2023_08-28-19.jpg>
[2023-11-21T08:29:22] FOCforever: These PSU's can deliver 60 amps. It's rare that I ever spot weld faster than the PSU's can keep up.
[2023-11-21T08:31:45] haku: wow thats one heck of a setup there
[2023-11-21T08:32:14] Mirono escooters: Cool resistor bank
[2023-11-21T08:33:22] FOCforever: when I'm building a pack, I want to get it done and not wait for anything. I have one other thing to add to it when I get around to it. I bought the copper and never made the new pens. I want to add liquid cooling to them. If you weld like I do, they get bloody hot!
[2023-11-21T08:35:21] haku: im sure. so much power that spot welder. tbh im a spot welding noob. ill be building my 1st copper nickel build after thanksgiving.
[2023-11-21T08:36:10] FOCforever: I have 7 layers of heat shrink on the factory weld pens and even with that, they get too hot after a while. I drop them in a bowl of water to cool them down for now. Active water cooling will solve that problem!
[2023-11-21T08:37:11] FOCforever: We all start somewhere. I'm jsut glad that you are building your first pack! Lots and lots of people never even get to thinking about doing that much.
[2023-11-21T08:38:16] haku: thank to videos like yours. its very encouraging to diy.
[2023-11-21T08:38:59] FOCforever: Hell yeah!
[2023-11-21T08:40:27] FOCforever: OF course I've never done a pack build video. Just my opinion, but watching someone spot weld is seriously boring!
[2023-11-21T08:44:44] haku: your komoto teardowns are the best haha
[2023-11-21T08:45:14] FOCforever: OR the worst...lol
[2023-11-21T08:51:41] Mirono escooters: Liquid cooling 😆😛
[2023-11-21T08:51:49] FOCforever: I have to admit that I don't mind ripping Chrissy a new one for all his BS and hype marketing for crap controllers!
[2023-11-21T08:52:47] haku: thats good. let the folks know the truth about the quality. thats a favor to the community
[2023-11-21T08:53:07] Mirono escooters: So you find ko moto bad? : D
[2023-11-21T08:53:56] FOCforever: Nah...they are the BEST thing there is. I rag on them for the click bate! hahaha! NOT!
[2023-11-21T08:54:20] haku: 😂
[2023-11-21T08:57:32] FOCforever: do you guys know who Toose is? Kilovolt on everywhere. His words in the KO Moto Discord support forum: "VESC is home brew shit." I took him to task over that and never mentioned KO even once. Got banned...what a shocker!
[2023-11-21T08:59:02] haku: i used to watch him too. he stopped making videos lately.
[2023-11-21T08:59:32] haku: lol home brew shit. wow
[2023-11-21T09:00:34] FOCforever: I never watch his garbage. But jsut looked at his YT video list. 6 months...damn! I thought I took a massive break at 2 months!
[2023-11-21T09:01:49] Mirono escooters: Looks like a serious, reasonable person😂
[2023-11-21T09:02:02] Mirono escooters: I stopped discussing with morons long ago, saves mental health
[2023-11-21T09:02:41] FOCforever: couldn't agree more! He is definitely a moron!

[2023-11-21T09:04:41] FOCforever: Here, let me help you... 1. Buy a KO controller 2. Ask Toose to set it up for you 3. Whatever brain cell you still had is now burned out.
[2023-11-21T09:05:26] haku: alright gents ima head to bed. i need to pick up my son tomorrow at 7am
[2023-11-21T09:05:50] FOCforever: Ha! 1am my time
[2023-11-21T09:05:59] FOCforever: Same...
[2023-11-21T09:06:04] FOCforever: jsut no kid
[2023-11-21T09:06:58] Mirono escooters: Hahahah, man my day just started.
[2023-11-21T09:09:09] NetworkDir: Max chinese squarewave and Kelly fan🤡
[2023-11-21T09:10:19] FOCforever: 8080n series is pretty good, but it's no VESC.
[2023-11-21T09:11:18] NetworkDir: Too big & shitty software/firmware
[2023-11-21T09:11:46] NetworkDir: But (72V-168V) (300A-1200A) nice
[2023-11-21T09:13:26] NetworkDir: Lol for basic options you should pay more money
[2023-11-21T09:52:38] Happy Giraffe: If you want retard proof get a protective cover for the silicone cabel against scratches or cuts.
[2023-11-21T09:53:34] Happy Giraffe: I usually always put one extra layer of protection for batt wiring that carries main voltage
[2023-11-21T11:49:33] rosheee: Yo
[2023-11-21T11:50:45] rosheee: Anyone one ordered directly from pmt and never received amswer? Or email?
[2023-11-21T11:52:49] JPPL: Ordered yes but always good delivery, beber try to contact aftersale or before
[2023-11-21T11:54:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope, I'm reseller so always receive my orders hah
[2023-11-21T12:04:18] Oreo huzky: Worked fine for me but I live in Germany so might be different for you
[2023-11-21T12:05:39] rosheee: I caol3d them Switzerland even cliser to these bombaclats. Waiting since 2 weeks...wrote 4 emails Called 6x never answer...seems normal italian..more spaghetti than workoni
[2023-11-21T12:08:07] rosheee: I write always italian cuz they are like the swissfrench/italian ^^
[2023-11-21T12:13:56] Happy Giraffe: Lmao, like there aint one italian speaking english
[2023-11-21T12:14:07] Happy Giraffe: Sales would skyrocket lol

[2023-11-21T12:22:33] Happy Giraffe: Li-ion cell gives always more energy from 4.2-3.6 than 3.6-3.0v
[2023-11-21T12:23:04] Mirono escooters: Never
[2023-11-21T12:23:14] Happy Giraffe: That's why you need to expect less range below 50% than before
[2023-11-21T12:25:14] Mirono escooters: Obviously there's voltage drop
[2023-11-21T12:25:24] Gabe Enzo: How much is usual for 20s.
[2023-11-21T12:25:25] Gabe Enzo: ?
[2023-11-21T12:25:32] Mirono escooters: Only LifePo4 is super flat. So flat you need a coulomb counter instead of relying on v
[2023-11-21T12:25:39] Mirono escooters: There's nothing ususal..

[2023-11-21T12:25:55] Mirono escooters: You calculate it using ESR and expected amp draw. Its basics. You should know it
[2023-11-21T12:26:12] Mirono escooters: Cool brakes
[2023-11-21T12:26:25] Gabe Enzo: and what's ESR
[2023-11-21T12:26:31] Mirono escooters: Then you just calculate BMS esr and wires too, and nickel
[2023-11-21T12:26:40] Mirono escooters: Oh god Equivalent series resistance
[2023-11-21T12:26:51] JPPL: <photos/photo_11078@21-11-2023_12-26-51.jpg>
[2023-11-21T12:26:53] Gabe Enzo: Wow this is new to me
[2023-11-21T12:26:54] Gabe Enzo: wtf
[2023-11-21T12:27:14] Mirono escooters: How 💀
[2023-11-21T12:27:25] Mirono escooters: You can't calculate series/ parallel resistance and vdrop?
[2023-11-21T12:28:43] Gabe Enzo: I didn't know resistance had anything to do with it
[2023-11-21T12:28:50] Gabe Enzo: I just calculated with nominal voltage X amps
[2023-11-21T12:29:03] Gabe Enzo: Right?
[2023-11-21T12:29:10] Happy Giraffe: Bro
[2023-11-21T12:29:32] Happy Giraffe: Ohm is very sad in his grave right now
[2023-11-21T12:29:59] Mirono escooters: What..
[2023-11-21T12:30:08] Mirono escooters: Are you joking
[2023-11-21T12:30:16] Gabe Enzo: No I'm not
[2023-11-21T12:30:30] Mirono escooters: Resistance is the base of everything
[2023-11-21T12:30:32] Mirono escooters: Well ohms law
[2023-11-21T12:30:41] Gabe Enzo: I know that but why does it play part
[2023-11-21T12:30:45] Gabe Enzo: in cells
[2023-11-21T12:31:17] Happy Giraffe: Resistance=heat=losses? Rings any bells?😂
[2023-11-21T12:31:21] Mirono escooters: Oh god
[2023-11-21T12:31:29] Gabe Enzo: That's not even barely any watts
[2023-11-21T12:31:35] Mirono escooters: 😔
[2023-11-21T12:31:38] Mirono escooters: Its hopeless
[2023-11-21T12:31:42] Gabe Enzo: With high voltage you get less losses
[2023-11-21T12:31:45] Mirono escooters: 😔
[2023-11-21T12:31:54] Gabe Enzo: I turned on one of the escs
[2023-11-21T12:31:56] Gabe Enzo: it exploded
[2023-11-21T12:31:59] Gabe Enzo: Btw
[2023-11-21T12:32:04] Mirono escooters: Not surprise
[2023-11-21T12:32:05] Gabe Enzo: I thought they had covers on the back
[2023-11-21T12:32:11] Happy Giraffe: Expected
[2023-11-21T12:32:14] Mirono escooters: No, not all Not even needed
[2023-11-21T12:32:43] Mirono escooters: I told you I just sended some random Escs from long ago, I'd expected you to test em carefully😧

[2023-11-21T15:43:40] Face de Pin Sucé: It helps x)
[2023-11-21T16:03:09] JPPL: But there was drivers skills
[2023-11-21T16:27:01] puneDir: is it possible to canbus die itself?
[2023-11-21T17:37:18] puneDir: It happened itself
[2023-11-21T17:37:29] puneDir: nothing was shorting or etc
[2023-11-21T17:37:34] puneDir: + vescs wasnt even on
[2023-11-21T17:43:16] haku: this is nice. which teverun is this and are these 10 inch tires or 11?
[2023-11-21T17:44:16] FOCforever: What is PMT?
[2023-11-21T17:45:01] haku: imported premium italian tires
[2023-11-21T17:46:41] haku: i dont own one so i cant speak. for the quality but folks say its great. i have the aliexpress version 😭
[2023-11-21T17:48:30] FOCforever: If you saw the pic I posted on my forum in Facebook of the Tronic 2000, that's 54 TOLT mosfets. I have direct involvment in this development. this is version 1.0 and the first "built" prototype. This side of the board won't change much and this is all I can show for now.
[2023-11-21T17:48:56] Face de Pin Sucé: You working with Lukas ?
[2023-11-21T17:52:11] FOCforever: Electronic Speed Reducer (jk)
[2023-11-21T17:55:34] Mirono escooters: you work with tronic?
[2023-11-21T17:55:49] Mirono escooters: ps isnt TOLT crazy expensive? good concept tho
[2023-11-21T17:56:04] FOCforever: thx
[2023-11-21T17:56:11] puneDir: perfect for g30
[2023-11-21T17:56:20] FOCforever: No, but he knows about it
[2023-11-21T17:57:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Okay, so Lukas only working on 250, 400 and 750 ?
[2023-11-21T17:58:26] FOCforever: That is getting worked on...at least 60 mosfets is...which is just insane! The buss inductances at 54 mosfets are a significant issue to overcome.
[2023-11-21T17:58:53] FOCforever: yes
[2023-11-21T18:01:38] FOCforever: TOLT is made by only Infineon for now. They have no competition in this package as of yet. So yeah...they can charge for it. It does have the best thermals of any mosfet pack I've seen and probably one of the easiest to mount to a board without having to go back to TO-220. No need for IMS. Everything can be done on a single multi-layer PCB. I really like this package.
[2023-11-21T18:02:19] Mirono escooters: wich and what that cost
[2023-11-21T18:02:38] FOCforever: AFAIK
[2023-11-21T18:02:41] Mirono escooters: totally agree, such cool mos. sad, no competion
[2023-11-21T18:02:48] Mirono escooters: doesnt need alupcb too, score
[2023-11-21T18:02:51] Mirono escooters: can mount more
[2023-11-21T18:05:31] Mirono escooters: patents can be so fucking annoying
[2023-11-21T18:05:36] Mirono escooters: no competition allowed
[2023-11-21T18:06:10] FOCforever: These controllers are rediculous. I haven't seen inside one to see what compromises they made, but there is invariably plenty of them. Gate drive being a big one. The Tronic 2000 is jsut 54 mosfets and gate drive is already at the upper limits of the best driver IC's. How FD is doing even more parallel mosfets is unlikly to be from a single gate chip. They are probably pulling the same stunt as KO in the Rush and using 2. It's a pretty awful solution to do that as gate drive timing gets seriously sloppy when you do.
[2023-11-21T18:06:29] Mirono escooters: xD
[2023-11-21T18:06:40] Mirono escooters: fardriver never dissapoints
[2023-11-21T18:06:59] Mirono escooters: how would you do it?
[2023-11-21T18:07:48] FOCforever: This will happen after a while. There is a few VESC options that use TOLT in their current development. Demand for this package is only growing.
[2023-11-21T18:08:27] Mirono escooters: cool :D
[2023-11-21T18:10:19] Mirono escooters: bomber with mp2 sweating rn
[2023-11-21T18:10:58] Mirono escooters: wtf
[2023-11-21T18:11:40] puneDir: How to tell if motor is burn with vesc tool
[2023-11-21T18:11:55] Mirono escooters: no drive, kaput
[2023-11-21T18:12:03] puneDir: it drives but Slow
[2023-11-21T18:12:11] Mirono escooters: lol
[2023-11-21T18:12:20] puneDir: the same place i was making 60 now im making 30
[2023-11-21T18:12:25] Mirono escooters: things toast, demagnetised magnets
[2023-11-21T18:12:39] Mirono escooters: we warned you, but "gen1 is invincible"
[2023-11-21T18:12:46] puneDir: im going to disassamble it
[2023-11-21T18:12:51] Mirono escooters: and "my motor is crazy hot" rings a bell?
[2023-11-21T18:12:59] puneDir: maybe it got water in
[2023-11-21T18:13:09] Mirono escooters: i fail to see how that influences.
[2023-11-21T18:13:21] puneDir: yesterday it was flooding outside
[2023-11-21T18:13:32] NetworkDir: 35A 72V with gen1 stupid value
[2023-11-21T18:13:40] NetworkDir: also 35A FWK
[2023-11-21T18:13:41] Mirono escooters: he didnt listen..
[2023-11-21T18:13:58] Mirono escooters: especially single, fwk, i told fwk on 30h stupid, but no, lets drive 80 for long
[2023-11-21T18:14:05] Gabe Enzo: motors are waterproof in theory
[2023-11-21T18:14:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Okay nice
[2023-11-21T18:14:20] puneDir: time to swap motors
[2023-11-21T18:14:22] Mirono escooters: my boats e foil motors are underwater, no issue.
[2023-11-21T18:14:31] FOCforever: TBH...go with a bigger mosfet probably. TOLT amperae isn't maxed out in the few Infineon offerings that are available so far. I have to admit that I never thought 48 mosfets would ever happen in a controller, but that's done and here I am part of developing a 54 fet controller and it works pretty darn well. but we've also discovered things that only very few others have seen in 150v parts and these current ranges. It's all rather new territory. Gate drive at this many parts is getting challenging to do well. Inductances in the busses is something to constantly watch out for and combat.
[2023-11-21T18:14:31] Mirono escooters: start listening or stop bothering, punedir
[2023-11-21T18:14:32] NetworkDir: also 95kg driver
[2023-11-21T18:14:33] NetworkDir: LOL
[2023-11-21T18:14:40] puneDir: or maybe its because of way too cold
[2023-11-21T18:14:43] Mirono escooters: rofl
[2023-11-21T18:14:44] Mirono escooters: suure
[2023-11-21T18:14:48] NetworkDir: hahaha
[2023-11-21T18:14:56] puneDir: because when it gets hotter it drives better
[2023-11-21T18:15:06] puneDir: but still not like before
[2023-11-21T18:15:06] Mirono escooters: wich bigger one?
[2023-11-21T18:15:08] NetworkDir: Diesel motor?
[2023-11-21T18:15:23] puneDir: i will get zero motors someday

[2023-11-21T18:15:50] Mirono escooters: 54 fets is crazy. i understand how random inductances become a biig issue.
[2023-11-21T18:16:02] FOCforever: What motor does he have on there?
[2023-11-21T18:16:07] Mirono escooters: your gen1 survived literally 5ish days..
[2023-11-21T18:16:19] puneDir: Thats a fact 😂
[2023-11-21T18:16:26] puneDir: still better than i expected
[2023-11-21T18:16:28] NetworkDir: Gen1 quality
[2023-11-21T18:16:31] Mirono escooters: omfg
[2023-11-21T18:16:35] NetworkDir: Also your gen1 used motor
[2023-11-21T18:16:39] NetworkDir: at 30k km
[2023-11-21T18:16:40] NetworkDir: lol
[2023-11-21T18:16:42] puneDir: It was a 350w motor
[2023-11-21T18:16:50] puneDir: I pushed nearly 5kw
[2023-11-21T18:16:57] puneDir: No 3700 km
[2023-11-21T18:16:58] Mirono escooters: its a 30h, and is a good motor. just not for punedir.
[2023-11-21T18:17:05] NetworkDir: Rental
[2023-11-21T18:17:11] puneDir: Rear has snsc Front has original g30 with yellow ring
[2023-11-21T18:17:15] Mirono escooters: the ban button looking cute rn
[2023-11-21T18:17:19] NetworkDir: No i mean quality nice
[2023-11-21T18:18:20] puneDir: i will swap stators Because housing is machined
[2023-11-21T18:18:33] Mirono escooters: stators?..
[2023-11-21T18:18:39] puneDir: windings
[2023-11-21T18:18:44] puneDir: the thing that stays still
[2023-11-21T18:18:53] Mirono escooters: i know what it is
[2023-11-21T18:19:01] Mirono escooters: i dont understand why you are doing that.
[2023-11-21T18:19:02] puneDir: i dont think magnets are dead
[2023-11-21T18:19:03] NetworkDir: But maybe your magnets rip
[2023-11-21T18:19:09] NetworkDir: +100 C
[2023-11-21T18:19:23] Mirono escooters: windings pretty simple, burn and dead, or not and fine
[2023-11-21T18:19:23] puneDir: well i cant do something another
[2023-11-21T18:19:30] Mirono escooters: lol
[2023-11-21T18:19:39] Mirono escooters: man killed it already and no plan B
[2023-11-21T18:19:45] Mirono escooters: you have too much time
[2023-11-21T18:19:51] puneDir: plan b is zero motor
[2023-11-21T18:20:01] Mirono escooters: anyway, end chat, it was interesting vesc esc talk till you came with your stuff
[2023-11-21T18:20:07] puneDir: maybe someone will trade z10x motor with g30
[2023-11-21T18:20:20] FOCforever: Hand spin the motor. Does it feel like it;s full of honey inside? If it does, the windings are shorted. Not much mystery to a burned out winding!
[2023-11-21T18:20:39] Mirono escooters: it still drives, answers the question kinda
[2023-11-21T18:20:58] Mirono escooters: or its at the end and some windings burned (doubt) kv would be crazy high (he can check airspeed)
[2023-11-21T18:21:48] FOCforever: check the throttle output voltage.
[2023-11-21T18:22:02] Mirono escooters: fair point, but failing throttle is rare
[2023-11-21T18:22:34] Mirono escooters: once i pulled sensor out of throttle, thing went full power. fun. id expect it give 0 output when away from magnet, but sadly, no
[2023-11-21T18:22:45] Mirono escooters: never crossed my mind it would happen
[2023-11-21T18:23:12] FOCforever: Magnets would also be 90H...aka 90mm tall
[2023-11-21T18:24:41] FOCforever: Interesting...so your position sensor is operating slowly or missing positions and that's slowing commutation.
[2023-11-21T18:25:22] FOCforever: Oh...lol
[2023-11-21T18:26:10] Mirono escooters: Hmm?
[2023-11-21T18:26:15] Mirono escooters: My throttle wire,
[2023-11-21T18:26:26] Mirono escooters: I pulled my hall sensor out of twist throttle, accidentally
[2023-11-21T18:26:37] Mirono escooters: Thing gave 100% power and shot off. Did wheelie, landed safely.
[2023-11-21T18:26:47] FOCforever: I have 2 burnt QS273 50H motors. Burnt of course. I've got a stupid idea of sliding those stators together and reworking the magnet rings into a 100H motor for a drag bike.
[2023-11-21T18:26:54] Mirono escooters: You burned qs273? Congrats
[2023-11-21T18:27:03] Mirono escooters: 100h hahaha, so cool.
[2023-11-21T18:27:33] Mirono escooters: The margins so tiny, machining it would be work of art
[2023-11-21T18:27:45] FOCforever: 2 of them...lol
[2023-11-21T18:28:11] Mirono escooters: How hahahahaha
[2023-11-21T18:28:25] Mirono escooters: That sounds very hard hahaahah
[2023-11-21T18:28:45] Mirono escooters: I didn't quite get to test Mine, but thing took power.
[2023-11-21T18:28:50] FOCforever: I have a lathe...won't be a problem really.
[2023-11-21T18:28:54] Mirono escooters: Didn't u use temp sensor?
[2023-11-21T18:29:01] Mirono escooters: Still would be quite a challenge hahaha
[2023-11-21T18:29:08] Mirono escooters: I'd love to see that abdomination
[2023-11-21T18:29:13] FOCforever: How? You have to ask?
[2023-11-21T18:29:26] Mirono escooters: Mucho power, boom
[2023-11-21T18:29:34] Mirono escooters: But temp sensor?
[2023-11-21T18:29:38] puneDir: i was gonna do the same with gen1s
[2023-11-21T18:29:44] Mirono escooters: Or just fucked around and found out
[2023-11-21T18:30:55] FOCforever: i'll probably get stronger magnets in 100mm for it. QS only uses N35 I think and while I'll increase cogging, I think the limiting factor once done will be magnet strength. Ive done this before and replaced N35 with N50 and got some serious torque advantages.
[2023-11-21T18:38:57] FOCforever: I'll be moving to a new location soon and have a 12,000 sq foot shop space. All my EV stuff in one place and near by. Should be doing some pretty amazing stuff that I can't currently do thanks to space constraints at my house. Setting up to rework the magnet rings on the QS273 motors isn't hard, jsut got to do it once in the new space. I have a few other motor abominations in mind as well that ought to achieve some pretty impressive numbers. Should have a prototype new motor that fits the ultra bee sometime in the spring or summer that dethrones everything else. IPM isn't where its at.
[2023-11-21T18:43:18] Mirono escooters: Sad they use n35
[2023-11-21T18:43:37] Mirono escooters: Not exactly cheap motors
[2023-11-21T18:44:23] Mirono escooters: Very cool stuff tho I'm interested in the ultrabee motor.
[2023-11-21T19:08:48] FOCforever: Yeah...I'm super curious to see how it does too! It's an idea right now, but I don't see why it won't beat out anything inrunner for this type of platform.
[2023-11-21T19:38:57] puneDir: anybody knows how can i solve the can issue?
[2023-11-21T19:39:16] Mirono escooters: Can can solve issue
[2023-11-21T19:39:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Can can can can
[2023-11-21T19:39:48] puneDir: can
[2023-11-21T19:40:04] puneDir: I guess i bricked my front vesc
[2023-11-21T19:40:24] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2023-11-21T19:40:32] puneDir: yep
[2023-11-21T19:40:34] puneDir: Gg
[2023-11-21T19:40:54] puneDir: The one that i dipped in resin
[2023-11-21T19:41:43] Mirono escooters: Oh boy..
[2023-11-21T19:41:46] puneDir: Its back to life somehow
[2023-11-21T19:41:59] puneDir: But still no canbus
[2023-11-21T19:45:11] Jhinzuo ~~: Atleast im not alone w my problems 🙈
[2023-11-21T19:45:38] Jhinzuo ~~: I would say check components around canbus but u said its in resin
[2023-11-21T19:48:52] puneDir: Im going to take a look with multimeter
[2023-11-21T19:52:37] puneDir: Yep Weird
[2023-11-21T19:52:48] puneDir: It was working before
[2023-11-21T19:52:50] FOCforever: Do you have some other canbus device that works with VESC such as a VESCexpress?
[2023-11-21T19:52:56] puneDir: Sadly no
[2023-11-21T19:53:02] Jhinzuo ~~: Can I use Xiaomi Dashboard BLE Module for vesc👀
[2023-11-21T19:53:03] puneDir: Yep no can
[2023-11-21T19:53:42] FOCforever: Intermittent shit...the worst!
[2023-11-21T19:54:11] puneDir: It was working I closed the scoot Come back after 30 mins Andd no can
[2023-11-21T19:54:30] FOCforever: Well yo ustill have UART
[2023-11-21T19:54:40] puneDir: yes but how can i link 2 vesc
[2023-11-21T19:56:02] FOCforever: you need another canbus device. Is your can cable jsut canH and canL or do you have ground and +v in it as well?
[2023-11-21T19:56:56] FOCforever: How about termination got that?
[2023-11-21T19:58:04] puneDir: Front vesc White can And gnd 3.7v Black can and gnd 1.9v
[2023-11-21T19:59:39] puneDir: Rear vesc White can and gnd 0v Black can and gnd 0v
[2023-11-21T19:59:48] puneDir: What to do in this situation
[2023-11-21T20:00:32] puneDir: it should give some voltage @Mirono_escooters
[2023-11-21T20:00:41] puneDir: 75100 v2 6.02
[2023-11-21T20:01:05] Mirono escooters: Yee I was confused with the other thing, uart
[2023-11-21T20:01:10] Mirono escooters: Rip can
[2023-11-21T20:01:16] Mirono escooters: Maybe overheating with resin haha
[2023-11-21T20:01:19] puneDir: the reason why its rip?
[2023-11-21T20:01:28] puneDir: This is the brand new one
[2023-11-21T20:01:29] puneDir: Alupcb
[2023-11-21T20:01:41] puneDir: It didnt even pass 10c anytime
[2023-11-21T20:02:04] puneDir: No
[2023-11-21T20:02:08] puneDir: But rear gives 0v
[2023-11-21T20:02:12] puneDir: Bet its broken
[2023-11-21T20:02:26] Mirono escooters: Ay I actually won the bet
[2023-11-21T20:03:00] puneDir: Congrats
[2023-11-21T20:03:10] puneDir: Why it could be dead
[2023-11-21T20:03:16] puneDir: Makes zero sense
[2023-11-21T20:03:31] Mirono escooters: I guessed 1 day : D
[2023-11-21T20:03:31] puneDir: impossible
[2023-11-21T20:03:35] Mirono escooters: Why
[2023-11-21T20:03:46] puneDir: i dont want shit cable mess and 2 esp32
[2023-11-21T20:04:05] puneDir: Any thoughts why it could be dead
[2023-11-21T20:04:19] Mirono escooters: Canchip gone
[2023-11-21T20:04:25] Mirono escooters: Can can't can
[2023-11-21T20:04:25] puneDir: Reason of it ?
[2023-11-21T20:04:36] Jhinzuo ~~: Cold solder joint on 1 of the pins
[2023-11-21T20:04:43] puneDir: bro cant can
[2023-11-21T20:04:52] puneDir: I have some dead 75100
[2023-11-21T20:05:09] puneDir: well Free vesc time
[2023-11-21T20:06:55] puneDir: @jamessoderstrom is there any settings that can make can work
[2023-11-21T20:07:34] puneDir: maybe theres something closed
[2023-11-21T20:07:43] puneDir: Did that
[2023-11-21T20:08:11] puneDir: <photos/photo_11081@21-11-2023_20-08-11.jpg>
[2023-11-21T20:08:16] puneDir: Ok
[2023-11-21T20:09:23] puneDir: changing the can chip can help maybe?
[2023-11-21T20:09:29] FOCforever: sounds possibly blown.
[2023-11-21T20:09:38] puneDir: whats the reason
[2023-11-21T20:09:46] puneDir: its less than 24hr old
[2023-11-21T20:10:04] puneDir: No
[2023-11-21T20:10:06] puneDir: New alupcb
[2023-11-21T20:10:18] puneDir: Yep
[2023-11-21T20:10:24] puneDir: <photos/photo_11082@21-11-2023_20-10-24.jpg>
[2023-11-21T20:10:42] puneDir: why tf
[2023-11-21T20:10:48] puneDir: sometimes life plays with me
[2023-11-21T20:12:17] FOCforever: User error
[2023-11-21T20:12:22] puneDir: Problem fixed
[2023-11-21T20:12:41] puneDir: <photos/photo_11083@21-11-2023_20-12-41.jpg>
[2023-11-21T20:12:45] puneDir: This connector sucks
[2023-11-21T20:13:13] puneDir: it works when i press on it
[2023-11-21T20:13:23] puneDir: :) nice save
[2023-11-21T20:13:33] FOCforever: reflowing a new can chip isn't hard with a hot air station.
[2023-11-21T20:15:18] FOCforever: OK...so you need to get more of them and crimp a new cable. That's good to know that its those crap connectors. I have a bunch of them and they are crap. MUCH prefer JST!
[2023-11-21T20:17:45] FOCforever: Any connector sub 2mm is somewhat unreliable IMHO
[2023-11-21T20:19:25] puneDir: im just going to solder
[2023-11-21T20:32:48] francois schempers: @punedir stop spamming this chat pls, if someone help you, go in private, but no dialogue here, and please, come back when you have something to ad, when you keep saying this or that doesn't work, it's don't help anything
[2023-11-21T20:58:01] haku: would this be enough to replicate a battery connection .2 nickel over .2 copper over .2nickel
[2023-11-21T20:58:36] haku: i cant find dead cells
[2023-11-21T20:58:54] Mirono escooters: Calculate the surface compared to wires
[2023-11-21T22:03:00] puneDir: Does 75100 v2 box and alupcb uses the same can chip? My alupcb has mcp2551 but i cant find same chip on the v2 box
[2023-11-21T22:04:49] Mirono escooters: Problably

[2023-11-21T22:22:15] Gabe Enzo: What speed is usual with 7kw on a 1kw motor?
[2023-11-21T22:22:22] Gabe Enzo: @LizardDoggo
[2023-11-21T22:24:35] francois schempers: it all depends on the kv of the motor and the voltage used, kW doesn't really change the top speed
[2023-11-21T22:28:01] puneDir: I replaced the can chip with working one but theres still no can. Unit is makerbase 75100 alupcb Nothing is shorted or something Any help would be appreciated :)
[2023-11-21T22:29:36] puneDir: No It gives voltage sometimes but no canbus Im stuck now,would be amazing if someone with more knowledge guides me
[2023-11-21T22:29:40] Paolo ⁭: You using dual vesc configuration ?
[2023-11-21T22:29:50] puneDir: Yes
[2023-11-21T22:29:57] Paolo ⁭: And with on off button right?
[2023-11-21T22:30:45] puneDir: Yes Resistor mod for ignition

[2023-11-21T22:31:10] Paolo ⁭: Yes but was not related on the product, it was just fault because when I bought were chip shortage, then they bought used
[2023-11-21T22:31:17] Paolo ⁭: Show me how you connected the button
[2023-11-21T22:31:43] puneDir: Like this
[2023-11-21T22:32:10] puneDir: Old and new chip I also removed the resistors to see if its related to that but still nothing

[2023-11-21T22:32:51] puneDir: Also heres the button
[2023-11-21T22:33:57] Paolo ⁭: You connected the positive of both vesc in common?
[2023-11-21T22:34:15] puneDir: Yes
[2023-11-21T22:34:20] Paolo ⁭: The negative was in common before you connected them to the battery?
[2023-11-21T22:34:27] puneDir: No
[2023-11-21T22:35:00] Paolo ⁭: So the negative just passed throught the can bus and burned the can chip
[2023-11-21T22:35:22] Paolo ⁭: Remove the positive of one from vesc to button
[2023-11-21T22:35:26] puneDir: It worked nicely I closed the scooter, went to school After school i opened the scooter and noticed rear motor is not working
[2023-11-21T22:35:41] puneDir: Yes but it still doesnt work with new can chip
[2023-11-21T22:36:24] puneDir: also i guess yes Xt60 connects them in same moment
[2023-11-21T22:36:53] Paolo ⁭: If you repeat the error, is obviously. So do what I told you and change the can chip again, then letr know
[2023-11-21T22:37:24] puneDir: It has new can chip now I didnt connected the button yet But can is still not working
[2023-11-21T22:40:59] Paolo ⁭: Your shorted regulator maybe
[2023-11-21T22:41:31] puneDir: but how it gives 3.3 and 5v then

[2023-11-22T01:24:08] Jhinzuo ~~: I'm using 75100 and I'm trying to use Xiaomi lisp, does the resistor need to be close to vesc or close to dash connector ? (Does it matter at all)
[2023-11-22T02:17:49] Unknown: When the lever snaps it sometimes damages the piston housing where the lever connects. It’s plastic. The mt5e has aluminum levers. The magnetic reed switch is very easy to install.

[2023-11-22T04:15:54] haku: what would guys say is better quality. makerx g300 or 3shul equivalent?
[2023-11-22T04:26:45] haku: this 3shul
[2023-11-22T04:36:04] Jan: Whats with this shul hype recently?
[2023-11-22T04:40:53] haku: i dont know. im just jumpimg in. you guys are ahead of the curb. just want to please the lords
[2023-11-22T04:42:05] Jan: For me its too big but im also building 10inch scooter so 🤷
[2023-11-22T04:44:13] haku: the website doesnt show the measurements im asuming its g300 size
[2023-11-22T08:01:10] Oreo huzky: It’s really small let me see if I have size somewhere but it can basically fit in your hand
[2023-11-22T08:01:50] Oreo huzky: CL/C350 size Size: L 135mm * W 75mm * H 45mm
[2023-11-22T08:02:22] haku: nice. thats smaller than the spintend 85/200
[2023-11-22T08:03:57] Oreo huzky: Yes and it has really big bottom plate to mount it to something be sure to put thermal paste between vesc and frame when you mount hit it’s a day and night difference

[2023-11-22T10:33:16] NetworkDir: Mirono says fixed Just test if you have a smart bms or clamp meter
[2023-11-22T10:39:07] Mirono escooters: If you read 3× less amps And lower shunt value 3× It should be fixed I'm not responsible if it blows up
[2023-11-22T10:40:25] NetworkDir: But for me i think read 2x less amps
[2023-11-22T10:40:44] NetworkDir: On 100A battery current

[2023-11-22T14:40:33] Happy Giraffe: If James buys bulk for europe and gets company tax etc it could best😁 (Tho its slavery if he has to open every vesc and clean it)😂😂😂😂
[2023-11-22T14:40:55] Mirono escooters: Jaaaames
[2023-11-22T14:41:25] Ion: clean it?
[2023-11-22T14:42:19] Happy Giraffe: Yeah Spintend before had loose solderballs etc mess inside their escs. My first one died because one loose ball shorted a cap😅
[2023-11-22T14:42:57] Happy Giraffe: Now they say they do better but I dont trust then with the excuses alupcb soldering is hard. They should be pros🌚
[2023-11-22T14:43:05] Ion: oh yeah I've heard about that, hope they fixed it
[2023-11-22T14:43:16] S1m 0n: Very big ball 😄
[2023-11-22T14:43:39] Happy Giraffe: It was like 1mm diameter😂
[2023-11-22T14:44:18] S1m 0n: 1mm is big for n solder ball 😄
[2023-11-22T14:45:11] S1m 0n: I would have thought tin would melt away in the event of a short circuit
[2023-11-22T14:48:11] Happy Giraffe: It melted but it bouncing around caused the short
[2023-11-22T14:55:04] Mirono escooters: They are a Factory. They can make it.
[2023-11-22T14:55:35] Mirono escooters: I never liked em BCS of solder balls But maybe i buy 2. I don't know yet.

[2023-11-22T17:27:05] Gabe Enzo: wtf my charger sparked
[2023-11-22T17:27:08] Gabe Enzo: this isn't normal
[2023-11-22T17:27:55] Gabe Enzo: Should I plug it in again??
[2023-11-22T17:27:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-11-22T17:28:45] Luis Magalhaes: Is that your conection to battery for charge? 😅
[2023-11-22T17:31:08] Mirono escooters: Bot was quicker then me Electron, please, you can see how those msg could be into 1. Anyway, be more specific. Spark where, spark how much, spark when.
[2023-11-22T17:32:41] Luis Magalhaes: If he plugs the battery to charger before the charger to the wall it should spark i think
[2023-11-22T17:33:14] Luis Magalhaes: And i dont like that conection 😅
[2023-11-22T17:34:47] Mirono escooters: No one does, but it's electron. Yes, order matters Even a small spark is fine, but you can't get any useful information out of that chat.
[2023-11-22T17:37:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Love you beb
[2023-11-22T17:39:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: don't insult Rose, she'll kick you ass 😁

[2023-11-22T17:47:50] Mirono escooters: Plug wall first Then batt Some spark always happen
[2023-11-22T17:48:08] Mirono escooters: My adjustable charger has a relay for the charging output, handy Plug in first, then safely enable.
[2023-11-22T17:49:23] Gabe Enzo: The charger told me to do that but I ignored it. Chinese stuff comes with such wierd warnings my last kugoo manual Said "never charge inside"
[2023-11-22T17:50:07] Mirono escooters: "ignored it" Funny. This is like, basic knowledge Basic of basic
[2023-11-22T17:50:40] Mirono escooters: Think, try it Voltage potential between charger and battery max When plugged in, its way, way less.
[2023-11-22T17:50:50] Gabe Enzo: I thought but what if the voltage comes out of the other end and my house shuts down
[2023-11-22T17:51:02] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-11-22T17:51:10] Mirono escooters: <sticker>

[2023-11-22T19:06:42] Mirono escooters: (Belgium moment)
[2023-11-22T19:08:51] haku: taxes no. we keep a hush hush we never get bothered for small purchases
[2023-11-22T19:09:15] Mirono escooters: Europa had that, until recently
[2023-11-22T19:09:33] haku: if it something big like a motorcycle or a car we get taxed like cray cray
[2023-11-22T19:10:19] haku: +import fees
[2023-11-22T19:11:06] haku: thats why whn i had to order my bomber it had to say oregon and nevada. because oregon doesnt get taxed
[2023-11-22T19:11:53] Mirono escooters: That's.. very handy.
[2023-11-22T19:38:40] haku: also not being taxed from chinese sellers hurt the local retailers and resellers because US to US purchases have taxes. ive just learned this recently. when buying a scooter thru bangood. i was shocked no taxes. i really feel bad for the buissneses but i am too cheap 😂
[2023-11-22T19:42:02] Mirono escooters: 🤷 thats what made eu change stuff Not much changed. Only their pockets got bigger : D
[2023-11-22T19:42:30] Happy Giraffe: Spintend should include vat on order, would save our time so much as package arrives twice as fast and no need to pay additional fees. But its small extra work for them so they dont do it👀
[2023-11-22T19:42:54] Mirono escooters: I've been telling em for over a year to join the IOSS system They refuse to, idk why.
[2023-11-22T19:42:59] Mirono escooters: Reason nr1 I don't usually buy from em
[2023-11-22T19:43:31] Gabe Enzo: Huh my scooter stopped working after charging. but it spinned while charging it
[2023-11-22T19:43:49] haku: thats a battery issue i believe
[2023-11-22T19:44:22] Mirono escooters: Overvoltage settings, if they still exist?
[2023-11-22T19:44:35] Mirono escooters: Do you have a error?

[2023-11-22T19:45:26] Mirono escooters: Small stuff works fine
[2023-11-22T19:45:42] Mirono escooters: That's why t I bought no spiny yet
[2023-11-22T19:46:00] Mirono escooters: Uhu
[2023-11-22T19:46:07] Gabe Enzo: it worked literally 10 min ago so it's weird it's saying it now. almost as if it reset itself
[2023-11-22T19:46:40] Gabe Enzo: no motor calibration on startup either.
[2023-11-22T19:47:14] Mirono escooters: Never ending story.
[2023-11-22T19:47:39] Gabe Enzo: Why would I want to reset it if it worked fine? If I do it nothing works. I'll try now tho.
[2023-11-22T19:47:56] Mirono escooters: Do you have Bluetooth? Can you connect?
[2023-11-22T19:49:34] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2023-11-22T19:51:27] Gabe Enzo: Hah, it did this by itself, and max input voltage 72v.

[2023-11-22T19:54:41] Gabe Enzo: Yes. Btw the only thing I changed was Motor amps 50-70a
[2023-11-22T19:55:01] Gabe Enzo: Swear to god it was literally working 10 min ago before the charger cut
[2023-11-22T19:55:03] Mirono escooters: Defenitely pressed a wrong button mate Next time dont tell you did nothing, because you clearly did something
[2023-11-22T19:55:14] Mirono escooters: James savior
[2023-11-22T19:59:43] haku: sorry let me correct myself i dont want to mis inform. aliexpress does taxes. bangood doesnt for some reason.

[2023-11-22T20:44:00] Jhinzuo ~~: Is the cell dead?
[2023-11-22T20:44:04] Gabe Enzo: Then I give her SHFW and my old dash which I'm not using
[2023-11-22T20:44:15] Gabe Enzo: nah just the cell protection worked, but the bmS takes the hit

[2023-11-22T20:45:14] Gabe Enzo: even more than without an esc for a month
[2023-11-22T20:45:26] Mirono escooters: How..
[2023-11-22T20:45:47] Gabe Enzo: No idea, I'll measure the leads to make sure it's not a wire fault.
[2023-11-22T20:46:01] Gabe Enzo: it sparked hard, harder than connecting 10s
[2023-11-22T20:46:40] Mirono escooters: 🤦

[2023-11-22T20:47:57] Gabe Enzo: :P
[2023-11-22T20:48:18] Gabe Enzo: I would've checked it before I put it in the case anyway

NOTE 1) Always reinforce copper traces if current over 15A is used on traces, if phase current exceeds 30A then use heavy reinforcements like in the pictures. Also reinforce traces from e to the big C0 capacitor. 2) when first connecting the battery to the board use a current limiting device, such a DIY precharge cable with a 120ohm 1W resistor or something like that, don't connect the battery directly to the board without precharge!

[2023-11-22T21:21:21] Happy Giraffe: Motor Behaviour in relation to Voltage, Phase Current and Battery Current: Here is what happens if you only change battery current limit: Battery consumption won’t change up till same rpm(speed) because phase current is the limit. Fast = full phase amp acceleration will continue up till higher rpm. Max power will be higher because - example, at previous max speed 60kmh voltage was 45v and phase current was limited by battery limit obviously. So by increasing battery limit we now have more room for phase amps at those same 45v (60kmh) meaning we can get to higher max speed

For R2 10s-20s works with 100K Resistor . For lower or higher voltages, you should check https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/voltage-divider-calculator/ The output voltage with your lowest voltage should not be below 1.5V, otherwise it will not work For R1 resistor gnd I'm not sure, but I think I had connected it to BE for GND, You can connect to any GND After this, if you give the battery voltage to R2, the vesc will turn on. So you can turn it on and off with any key By @fungus93 :)

[2023-11-22T21:27:12] sombre_enfant: Well ig i cant program my scoot then, vesc desktop is so shitty
[2023-11-22T21:27:33] Mirono escooters: What's wrong with vesc desktop lol
[2023-11-22T21:28:33] francois schempers: is your phone rooted ? you have the knox thing from Samsung?
[2023-11-22T21:29:03] sombre_enfant: Nope, i dont know bout knox
[2023-11-22T21:29:49] sombre_enfant: I always forget wich write button i should use
[2023-11-22T21:30:34] francois schempers: it's a security feature from Samsung that get batshit crazy when you root your phone, you can't install certain app, can't use credit card, etc
[2023-11-22T21:31:47] sombre_enfant: @francois_schempers how u will use your turn signal with vesc on the g2 ?
[2023-11-22T21:33:01] francois schempers: i have to hack that little board that comes with the ble, don't know yet how i may do it, maybe i just throw it all and use custom board with relay and blinkers
[2023-11-22T21:33:45] francois schempers: i don't know, maybe maybe not, i don't have the Vesc yet x)
[2023-11-22T21:34:18] Mirono escooters: And that stops you from configuring vesc? 🙈
[2023-11-22T21:34:28] francois schempers: yes but you know ninebot, maybe there things preventing you from hijacking it x)
[2023-11-22T21:37:48] Gabe Enzo: My brother said my scooter is insane 😂
[2023-11-22T21:40:40] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-11-22T21:40:59] sombre_enfant: Yeah its boring tok type 10 time the value u want just to find out it didnt write
[2023-11-22T21:41:36] sombre_enfant: Can you explain wich write option choose for wich opération ?
[2023-11-22T21:44:52] Happy Giraffe: Yeah everybody wants to talk women, money and sex on the vesc channel anyway
[2023-11-22T21:44:53] Mirono escooters: Bruh
[2023-11-22T21:45:47] sombre_enfant: Aye i try. Pls someone call vedder to fix my issue
[2023-11-22T21:46:26] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-11-22T21:49:12] Happy Giraffe: sadly you cant have any text on the topic header, would make it less confusing. Archive icon/emoji makes sense but for others its hard. Maybe people get used to it. Hashtag could be a vesc logo if possible xD
[2023-11-22T21:52:04] haku: what about questions about components soldering 3dprinting and stuff do i ask here?
[2023-11-22T21:52:09] sombre_enfant: I cant manage to do the detection
[2023-11-22T21:52:43] JPPL: Should be

[2023-11-22T21:54:41] haku: soldering, spot welding questions aswell?
[2023-11-22T21:54:46] sombre_enfant: I used the networkdir file on the beta tool,maybe he compiled later....i try download the last vesc tool
[2023-11-22T21:54:50] Mirono escooters: Papa is back
[2023-11-22T21:55:11] francois schempers: as long as you don't spam the general chat im fine with it
[2023-11-22T21:56:29] haku: whoa. those pouch cells?
[2023-11-22T21:56:37] sombre_enfant: No its not right amps reading

[2023-11-22T22:09:03] sombre_enfant: So how i should offset in my setting to have what i need
[2023-11-22T22:09:16] haku: im a history nerd 😂
[2023-11-22T22:12:49] sombre_enfant: French story made by american...
[2023-11-22T22:15:14] haku: lol. i was gonna say
[2023-11-22T22:16:59] Mirono escooters: Setup recommendations are always off..
[2023-11-22T22:17:04] Mirono escooters: Qs273 is 70a xD
[2023-11-22T22:18:01] NetworkDir: Just try and feel power with riding Any change of power or .. ?
[2023-11-22T22:18:20] NetworkDir: Or clamp meter also smart bms best way 😁
[2023-11-22T22:18:35] sombre_enfant: I cant try i cant use old lisp somehow with 6.05...
[2023-11-22T22:19:07] NetworkDir: Interesting
[2023-11-22T22:20:40] sombre_enfant: Izuna adc is fix for m365 ?
[2023-11-22T22:26:24] sombre_enfant: Yeah last time i tried i had issue ig you remember
[2023-11-22T22:26:36] Rose: Hey there Orhan, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2023-11-22T22:30:36] sombre_enfant: U dont use with dual...
[2023-11-22T22:36:12] Mirono escooters: Mb 👍
[2023-11-22T22:36:21] Mirono escooters: The issue wasn't with dual tho. It was a line issue
[2023-11-22T22:39:23] Happy Giraffe: With a lil bit of Texas and Freedom
[2023-11-22T22:40:16] haku: like braveheart huh
[2023-11-22T22:40:56] haku: i felt scottish after watching it
[2023-11-22T22:42:56] Unknown: Cool
[2023-11-22T22:50:27] haku: anyone here mess with EUCs? i wonder what the range on those things. ive seen vesc powered ones pretty cool
[2023-11-22T22:50:43] Gabe Enzo: They're literally the most dangerous thing there is.
[2023-11-22T22:51:00] Gabe Enzo: you can't even grab onto anything when you lose control temporarily
[2023-11-22T22:51:11] sombre_enfant: What was the fix ?
[2023-11-22T22:51:33] Gabe Enzo: Nobody here likes them
[2023-11-22T22:51:40] haku: ive rode a onewheel pretty different experience.
[2023-11-22T22:52:03] Gabe Enzo: It looks sketchy.
[2023-11-22T22:52:30] haku: yea.
[2023-11-22T22:52:41] Gabe Enzo: can't put much cells into them for sure
[2023-11-22T22:53:31] haku: im sure. i dont even know how some folks run 72v on those. 20s 1p maybe lol
[2023-11-22T22:57:04] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11130@22-11-2023_22-57-04.jpg>
[2023-11-22T22:57:08] Mirono escooters: Hehe boy. Qs273.
[2023-11-22T23:00:53] haku: im just a ev fan in general anything with controllers and batteries
[2023-11-22T23:02:58] Happy Giraffe: 10mOhm?😂😅
[2023-11-22T23:04:41] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-22T23:04:45] Mirono escooters: Idk why.
[2023-11-22T23:05:11] Mirono escooters: Paolo deleted old chat.. So I can't re find old MP2 detection.
[2023-11-22T23:51:19] Paolo ⁭: What?
[2023-11-22T23:51:30] Paolo ⁭: I don't delete nothing lol

[2023-11-22T23:52:28] Mirono escooters: Its not like we were doing super secret discussions hahaha
[2023-11-22T23:52:28] Paolo ⁭: Ah maybe yes I had auto delete function
[2023-11-22T23:52:32] Mirono escooters: Problably
[2023-11-22T23:52:35] Paolo ⁭: Now is off
[2023-11-22T23:52:41] Mirono escooters: Wasn't meant bad Just informational
[2023-11-22T23:52:53] Mirono escooters: The thing drives, very well. So no issue 10mohm sound low
[2023-11-22T23:53:18] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2023-11-22T23:53:20] Mirono escooters: My garden is too tiny Tomorrow more 😉

[2023-11-22T23:57:23] Mirono escooters: Oh god, double the resistance
[2023-11-22T23:57:30] Mirono escooters: I wonder why.
[2023-11-23T00:15:20] NetworkDir: Put 10 mohm resistor to phases 😂😂😂
[2023-11-23T00:16:10] Mirono escooters: Fixed ezpz
[2023-11-23T00:16:11] Mirono escooters: 10mohm*
[2023-11-23T00:23:24] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/olPRpabjZQE?si=1uDKl0o6ZgRORdZo
[2023-11-23T00:23:34] haku: need this
[2023-11-23T00:26:47] Rose: Hey there 66673, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-11-23T00:51:14] Rose: Hey there 66673, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-11-23T02:52:35] haku: this was my idea. doing this to a g30.
[2023-11-23T02:53:29] haku: and why is it germany standard? is this a thing there?
[2023-11-23T02:56:48] haku: 🤣
[2023-11-23T02:58:35] haku: is this a german trend though?
[2023-11-23T02:59:22] Ion: Wide tires? I don't think so lol
[2023-11-23T03:03:35] haku: i should keep my ideas to myself.
[2023-11-23T03:04:19] Ion: Lol you building that 😅 does it even fit?
[2023-11-23T03:04:57] haku: im gonna stretch the dropouts. or bolt and aluminum one.
[2023-11-23T03:05:47] Ion: Oh that's 11" too. Well if you like the look...? I'd still probably do 10 Inch with 10x3 tire tho
[2023-11-23T03:06:45] Paolo ⁭: Doing that because you want recycle the motor or because you want a good motor?
[2023-11-23T03:06:50] haku: i agree. but this will be a spare motor once i get the new ones for my 11" scooter. hopefully i can get this done
[2023-11-23T03:06:56] Paolo ⁭: Because there's betters motor which fit without mods
[2023-11-23T03:06:59] haku: recycle
[2023-11-23T03:08:04] haku: i cant afford buying new 10 motors for this. i just wanted to mess with it. no suspension just bolted on 11 motors
[2023-11-23T03:09:13] Ion: What controller, battery? curious about specs
[2023-11-23T03:09:54] haku: i will use the 100/100 spintend i i have right now. and i will repack my laotie battery lol
[2023-11-23T03:11:08] haku: i know its dumb but i will make it a fun project. i have to finish my laotie first
[2023-11-23T03:12:09] Ion: I'm also doing a G30 currently. Single motor tho and quite tiny 13s 10ah battery for now 😅
[2023-11-23T03:12:22] Ion: But I may upgrade that in the future
[2023-11-23T03:13:04] haku: according to james. can fit 6p 20s. my laotie battery will has a 16p 8s so i will have enough
[2023-11-23T03:13:55] Ion: With spacer I'm guessing? Should have good ground clearance with that motor lol.
[2023-11-23T03:14:30] haku: i agree. seeing the g30 builds here making me want one too
[2023-11-23T03:15:18] Ion: Yeah, same 😁. I have a Vsett 10+ with Vesc already but want a G30
[2023-11-23T03:16:18] haku: here where im from i never see souped up g30.
[2023-11-23T03:16:58] Ion: Well I've also never seen another one irl, just here lol
[2023-11-23T03:17:17] Ion: But I really like them. Even Stock it's very stable and portable
[2023-11-23T03:17:36] haku: yea. crazy what folks do.
[2023-11-23T06:00:09] Jan: Easy 20s6p + 2 internal controllers 😅😅
[2023-11-23T06:00:34] Jan: Had 30mm spacer with short bottom plate
[2023-11-23T06:00:57] Jan: Takes only your sanity to build this
[2023-11-23T06:18:29] Happy Giraffe: That's very clean👍
[2023-11-23T06:21:43] Jan: Rebuilt that thing 8 times until it was how i wanted
[2023-11-23T06:34:39] Happy Giraffe: Paint on the front shock especially matches nicely, a stealthy look (minus the blue😂)
[2023-11-23T07:00:52] Jan: I wanna get rid of the front suspension completely
[2023-11-23T07:01:22] Jan: Yeah the 30mm is still suspicious
[2023-11-23T07:11:07] haku: yep very awsome scooter. so clean
[2023-11-23T07:12:47] Finn: What controller are you using?
[2023-11-23T07:13:35] haku: seeing these g30s make me want to make my own. but my dreams are memes for now until i make one
[2023-11-23T07:14:08] Finn: Same
[2023-11-23T07:14:23] Finn: Got a frame here but everything else is just a dream
[2023-11-23T07:15:06] Finn: Also my dual 1s needs to be build first
[2023-11-23T07:16:37] haku: same. waiting on parts on my part. and making sure i build the battery properly
[2023-11-23T07:17:02] Happy Giraffe: Rather the motors😂 Danish cop that stopped me knew immediately it's a tuning motor
[2023-11-23T07:18:35] Finn: Yeah. Also i need to sell the controller and motor. But noone wants it😂
[2023-11-23T07:20:37] haku: atleast its easy to sell in europa right? pevs very new here. very rare i see modded scooters. alot of ebike modders though
[2023-11-23T07:21:00] haku: ebikes and surrons.
[2023-11-23T07:21:03] Finn: Yeah its okay
[2023-11-23T07:21:58] Finn: In europa you have a whole new problem and thats the strict rules about scooter
[2023-11-23T07:22:07] Finn: With licensing shit etc.
[2023-11-23T07:24:34] haku: i see. i can see us getting restrictions too. right now wild west here. surrons trashing the park trails. sharing the road with cars at 45mph traffic due to no bike lanes. its crazy. earlier i just saw a ebiker got hit
[2023-11-23T07:25:26] haku: some states have regulations others dont. im lucky to be one without
[2023-11-23T07:26:28] Finn: Really wanna drive my scooter on the road. Also surron is the next project
[2023-11-23T07:27:59] haku: i would love one too. but way too out of my budget
[2023-11-23T07:29:05] Finn: I think everyone with a scooter would do it if they got the budget for it.
[2023-11-23T07:29:23] Finn: Also rebuilding the surron battery would be a pain but very powerfull
[2023-11-23T07:29:58] Yamal: The problem is that more than one person doesn't get the stories, among those who rule,,,, e-scooter, zero expenses and battery charges for just a few cents,,
[2023-11-23T07:30:33] haku: i bet. i was going with the ebike trend once but the bomber i ordered took way too long so i asked for refund. now scooters are just so fun. i also have a 700w ebike 😭
[2023-11-23T07:31:57] Yamal: but we are the perfect vehicle to decongest cities and great for rural areas too
[2023-11-23T07:32:06] haku: i am really fascinated with evs. i dont know why some folks are against it
[2023-11-23T07:32:34] haku: i agree. gas prices here is insane
[2023-11-23T07:33:34] haku: 13 cents to charge a tesla that will get 200miles. vs $5.00 a gallon
[2023-11-23T07:38:37] Yamal: They talk and talk about climate change and drought, they restrict access to certain cities (center) to cars prior to 2007 in some cities in my country, and then they get angry if they see you on a e-scooter...😂
[2023-11-23T07:39:22] Finn: Yeah some things doesnt make sense
[2023-11-23T07:41:43] haku: here its about politics wich i will not talk about. i was on the side that pro natural fuel but i feel like evs will be the future. people should just get educated on it
[2023-11-23T07:42:59] Finn: Ev will not be the clima neutral future that people are expecting
[2023-11-23T07:43:25] haku: sorry i meant we will see.
[2023-11-23T07:44:43] Finn: And all the ev people doesnt think about how an ev is made they just care about the status and hype of it
[2023-11-23T07:45:01] Yamal: I still don't see it in cars, you fill up my car tank and you do a thousand kilometers
[2023-11-23T07:46:14] haku: actually here evs are starting to be the norm. not like in 2016 when evs are overpriced. now everyone can mostly afford it
[2023-11-23T07:46:31] Finn: Also ev cant even last as long as a fuel car. Car batteries have obv its limit in charge discharge.
[2023-11-23T07:47:11] haku: lots of tesla fast charging stations here. and ev charging stations
[2023-11-23T07:47:51] haku: specially when next gen batteries arrive
[2023-11-23T07:50:57] haku: i use to like the sound of car shifting/down shifting now that i am older its different.

[2023-11-23T10:49:28] Izuna 生活: Might try changing your VESC ID in App Cfg to something else.
[2023-11-23T10:49:34] Izuna 生活: No, its too old.
[2023-11-23T10:49:38] Izuna 生活: and its stupid

[2023-11-23T10:49:52] Thierry: I don't retrieve any picture but really space optimized
[2023-11-23T10:50:14] Izuna 生活: Yes, you can use it, but with older VESC version? But not on VESC 6.05
[2023-11-23T10:50:17] Thierry: I'm finalizing a second one with 200A vesc
[2023-11-23T10:50:38] Izuna 生活: The new one works perfectly as well on VESC 6.05 BETA 15. But it IS BETA SOFTWARE. It changes... a lot... and breaks my shit every time.
[2023-11-23T10:50:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice

[2023-11-23T13:47:53] Finn: <photos/photo_11139@23-11-2023_13-47-53.jpg>
[2023-11-23T13:48:50] Finn: G30 sleeper🙊
[2023-11-23T13:51:48] JPPL: Top much specs to tell, One is daily use, other Confort/, other high performance, teverun is original in specs, others use both vesc, ubox100v100a and g300, 20 and 22s, Ly motors and hm5000 motores
[2023-11-23T13:52:58] Yamal: The brown teverum have vesc?

[2023-11-23T13:54:44] Yamal: The frame look same teverum
[2023-11-23T13:55:42] JPPL: This later pic is a mix between teverun and Blade arma, stays lower
[2023-11-23T13:59:12] Oreo huzky: I believe that this black hentai stuff inside ninebot tires comes from the pits of hell once you get it on your skin you are black for life I hate it
[2023-11-23T13:59:13] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_11143@23-11-2023_13-59-13.jpg>
[2023-11-23T13:59:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤣🤣
[2023-11-23T14:01:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its simple gap filler basically no magic , shit to work with it afterwards, if you want to get it off the rim ,it takes time but can be done ,kinda easy way without using anything plus
[2023-11-23T14:02:59] puneDir: They sent New vesc for free
[2023-11-23T14:04:25] puneDir: i will fix the broken one with new can chip.
[2023-11-23T14:04:37] sombre_enfant: What did u say ?
[2023-11-23T14:04:59] sombre_enfant: The can was working before ?
[2023-11-23T14:05:22] Oreo huzky: I hate it I am able to clean my hands at the end with brake cleaner
[2023-11-23T14:07:16] puneDir: It was but i told them exactly what happened (and they wanted a video) And they said sorry for the issue we will send you the new one
[2023-11-23T14:07:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I ment the rim bro , basically this material sticks to it self ,so if you get a piece off ,you can sponge (push pull) the rest down with it ,even from your hands
[2023-11-23T14:08:37] puneDir: They created new order for 50 cents and they sended it I think this issue wasnt releated to me Otherwise they would say its user error Btw i ordered some new can chips so im also going to fix bad one and will keep the new one as spare
[2023-11-23T14:11:12] Gabe Enzo: @PaoloWu pm
[2023-11-23T14:15:19] Oreo huzky: It tears apart like gooey hentai stuff
[2023-11-23T14:34:05] Mirono escooters: Hey @PaoloWu I really can't get this Bluetooth connection to fail. I rode 250a, with the Bluetooth inside my metal bike. Still great connection and pretty quick RT data. Maybe your wires were too long? Vedder warned against this. Add a filtering cap maybe But mine works super : D 2€ Bluetooth brt
[2023-11-23T14:37:05] puneDir: Esp also would be a good solution if you cant find nrf locally (used it for 2000+ km
[2023-11-23T14:38:58] Happy Giraffe: How is the performance? (Of vehicle not BT)😂
[2023-11-23T14:46:17] Mirono escooters: Ive got a stock of like 50 nrf now
[2023-11-23T14:46:26] Mirono escooters: Plenty power, hahahaha
[2023-11-23T14:46:37] Mirono escooters: I'll ride when I find time in evening
[2023-11-23T14:49:36] sombre_enfant: Make tutorial
[2023-11-23T14:50:52] Mirono escooters: Yes, when I have time
[2023-11-23T14:55:50] puneDir: If changing can chip doesnt helps Can i use some module like this to have working canbus?
[2023-11-23T14:57:15] Gabe Enzo: what's the sweet spot wattage for an 800w motor?
[2023-11-23T14:57:28] haku: the ly motors what maget size did you get?
[2023-11-23T14:58:56] Mirono escooters: Oh god, the vesc app is so buggy Now I can't even scroll down.
[2023-11-23T14:58:57] haku: you dont daily your performance build lol?
[2023-11-23T15:00:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably hentai was not included when they made it ,but material and lets say his brothers are common in car industry
[2023-11-23T15:02:02] haku: wish i was in the eu.
[2023-11-23T15:03:23] Oreo huzky: Feels like it though
[2023-11-23T15:03:51] haku: isnt that bead sealant?
[2023-11-23T15:05:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For some things its good to be here ,but also where you are
[2023-11-23T15:14:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: the real nice part what he said has even several stages Offering help is cool But he even went to a school for this After he finished the other ,coz was was interested in metal things I kinda even proud ☺️
[2023-11-23T15:15:30] Paolo ⁭: I don't added nothing, just tested on shitsky
[2023-11-23T15:15:39] Paolo ⁭: Maybe board issue too
[2023-11-23T15:17:03] Mirono escooters: I am on makerbase so
[2023-11-23T15:17:07] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11146@23-11-2023_15-17-07.jpg>
[2023-11-23T15:17:19] Mirono escooters: MP2 testing My rear does weird stuff. Maybe because I'm cornering in garden hahahaha
[2023-11-23T15:17:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically it's a sealent for cars , i could explain the purpose,but probably naming is different here and there And if you think around this ,you do know what that is basically has nothing to with tires ,just a thick layer
[2023-11-23T15:18:22] puneDir: what device can have canbus chip
[2023-11-23T15:18:42] Paolo ⁭: Yes but what current
[2023-11-23T15:19:05] Paolo ⁭: My 75200 runs both at 27kw
[2023-11-23T15:20:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would have some questions
[2023-11-23T15:21:02] Mirono escooters: Thats out of my league..
[2023-11-23T15:21:23] Mirono escooters: I don't expect any Bluetooth to work with that noise For 99% of users, especially those who buy the cheapest, itll be fine
[2023-11-23T15:22:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Was a hell of terrain ? Lot amps on slow m Also why Dist and dist abs has such a difference
[2023-11-23T15:22:24] Mirono escooters: It was my garden
[2023-11-23T15:22:39] Mirono escooters: I can only go on the road at night. For.. obvious reasons..
[2023-11-23T15:22:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Big garden
[2023-11-23T15:22:44] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2023-11-23T15:22:58] Mirono escooters: I'm just seeing phase amps, what's possible, it's fun

[2023-11-23T15:23:11] Mirono escooters: MP2 😛
[2023-11-23T15:23:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Makes difference if you just play ,so it's not trip, let's say
[2023-11-23T15:23:42] Mirono escooters: I already told, I only do drag races
[2023-11-23T15:23:57] Mirono escooters: Not a trip no, just testing
[2023-11-23T15:24:19] Mirono escooters: Speed do be off, was faster Can't calibrate it now
[2023-11-23T15:25:26] Mirono escooters: 46 magnets can't be correct, or 15kmh feels like 500
[2023-11-23T15:25:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you like was just asking
[2023-11-23T15:25:33] Mirono escooters: No problem ;)
[2023-11-23T15:25:40] Mirono escooters: I can do maybe 500m trips, no more
[2023-11-23T15:25:43] Mirono escooters: Too risky..
[2023-11-23T15:25:48] Happy Giraffe: When I start in a job my next project will surely be a mini cross bike fitted with the "1kw" QS mid drive😂 That thing will rip and tear using the MTPA vesc feature.
[2023-11-23T15:26:03] Mirono escooters: Yee
[2023-11-23T15:26:15] Mirono escooters: What's the benefit of mtpa? I only hear bad stuff..
[2023-11-23T15:26:24] Mirono escooters: But my qs273 should take that, I guess But I don't see the point
[2023-11-23T15:26:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dunno your engine for sure , that's why i always make lot pictures when i open something,when you did ,did you make pics
[2023-11-23T15:26:54] Mirono escooters: Qs273 8kw
[2023-11-23T15:27:02] Mirono escooters: I opened it someday, but can't find photos
[2023-11-23T15:27:11] Mirono escooters: I never removed stator tho.. so..
[2023-11-23T15:27:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🙈🙈
[2023-11-23T15:27:46] Mirono escooters: I only ferrofluid and seal I don't want to lose fingers.

[2023-11-23T15:28:14] sombre_enfant: 10kph boost on scooter with mtpa
[2023-11-23T15:28:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is like million things using canbus
[2023-11-23T15:29:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But non will be the same probably what you need ,just the specific u already have
[2023-11-23T15:29:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You tested it bro?
[2023-11-23T15:29:31] puneDir: What is mtpa and how to activate it? I cant find it on internet
[2023-11-23T15:30:09] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2023-11-23T15:30:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need to learn bro ,as you see not a lot off us tried to setup
[2023-11-23T15:31:22] puneDir: how can i try it?
[2023-11-23T15:34:06] sombre_enfant: Put iqtarget thats it
[2023-11-23T15:38:15] Paolo ⁭: With 1cm thermal pad?
[2023-11-23T15:40:00] Mirono escooters: Kapton+ thermalpaste for mos
[2023-11-23T15:40:05] Mirono escooters: But very funny
[2023-11-23T15:40:23] Mirono escooters: As I said Paolo, I only do drag races. I don't need cooling. The alu block is sufficient. Why do you bother.
[2023-11-23T15:40:36] Mirono escooters: Its more used as shock absorbing then cooling.😗
[2023-11-23T15:42:45] Paolo ⁭: Lol
[2023-11-23T15:42:54] Paolo ⁭: Just asking, didn't told nothing hahha
[2023-11-23T15:43:02] Mirono escooters: You keep asking and in a judging way
[2023-11-23T15:43:08] Mirono escooters: Maybe it just looks like this
[2023-11-23T15:43:27] Mirono escooters: I could problably even use no cooling to mos at all, I drive 20m hahaha
[2023-11-23T15:43:35] Paolo ⁭: No because the temperature didn't increase even by 1C
[2023-11-23T15:43:54] Mirono escooters: Logical, with the meters I did
[2023-11-23T15:43:57] Paolo ⁭: And the motor yes
[2023-11-23T15:45:35] Mirono escooters: Wonder if mtpa makes sense for me
[2023-11-23T15:45:51] Mirono escooters: Because I hit low power at low speed
[2023-11-23T15:47:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Do you have IPM motor ?
[2023-11-23T16:00:17] Mirono escooters: I have qs273 8kw
[2023-11-23T16:03:25] Happy Giraffe: It optimizes the magnetic field for IPM motors. Guy said it was a big boost in performance and efficiency
[2023-11-23T16:03:54] Happy Giraffe: Dont, not for hub drives
[2023-11-23T16:03:59] Mirono escooters: Ah, woops, don't have ipm.😗
[2023-11-23T16:04:56] sombre_enfant: It works tho
[2023-11-23T16:14:23] Mirono escooters: By pumping a lot of amps into it and ignoring values szt
[2023-11-23T16:14:29] Mirono escooters: It totally ignores batt amps values
[2023-11-23T16:17:51] puneDir: Why?
[2023-11-23T16:19:43] Кирилл: 10 meters? Did you even try to ride?😅
[2023-11-23T16:20:18] Кирилл: Thats like .5 sec of full throttle

[2023-11-23T16:52:23] Paolo ⁭: You've the 50h one right?
[2023-11-23T16:54:11] puneDir: Does it have downsides
[2023-11-23T16:55:31] puneDir: What if we cant set more amps Any way to make it more faster with just settings
[2023-11-23T16:55:35] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_11150@23-11-2023_16-55-35.jpg>

[2023-11-23T16:55:47] JPPL: Yeahh
[2023-11-23T16:55:54] JPPL: Nice ride
[2023-11-23T16:56:10] JPPL: Câmera was little down?
[2023-11-23T16:56:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2023-11-23T16:56:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Need to be a little bit upper
[2023-11-23T16:56:41] JPPL: Ok, way back i do it, cigarret to chill
[2023-11-23T16:57:58] puneDir: oh ok than I cant set more amps bcs of battery limitations (80a)
[2023-11-23T16:59:16] puneDir: Yes obviously
[2023-11-23T17:07:38] Happy Giraffe: Who tested it and what they found with it?
[2023-11-23T17:09:57] Happy Giraffe: I would buy a known brand/just a quality soldering iron. If you get 2-in-1 kit the components are worse and lesser of a quality. Also you sacrifice some power. I would only look 80w and up
[2023-11-23T17:10:11] sombre_enfant: Me 10kph more
[2023-11-23T17:10:52] sombre_enfant: I add it too
[2023-11-23T17:12:14] Happy Giraffe: Also to test something like this it needs to be as controlled environment as possible like James said about field weakening. All other settings "stock like"
[2023-11-23T17:14:17] Happy Giraffe: It's interesting as it makes IPM motors run cooler and have more torque tho😂 A guy with Lightning Rods mid drive made those conclusions
[2023-11-23T17:16:35] Happy Giraffe: I gotta ask him again if he tested more, also really hard to measure temp production of a motor as core, side cover etc absorb the heat and it cant be measured by just the winding temp🤔
[2023-11-23T17:18:48] Mirono escooters: Bröder, I can't go on road at day
[2023-11-23T17:19:06] Mirono escooters: Works super
[2023-11-23T17:19:36] Mirono escooters: Due to increased amps
[2023-11-23T17:20:50] Mirono escooters: And my steering fork is loose af. I need to fix this first.. So this weekend, maybe, we see 100kmh+ 😏
[2023-11-23T17:37:31] sombre_enfant: What was the condition to remove speed limit at boot with lisp script ?
[2023-11-23T17:40:20] NetworkDir: What version ?
[2023-11-23T17:44:29] Gabe Enzo: Can molicel actually do 45a constant
[2023-11-23T17:44:36] Gabe Enzo: does that mean it's like 55a peak?
[2023-11-23T17:45:24] sombre_enfant: Its peak
[2023-11-23T17:45:47] Gabe Enzo: ugh that's kinda misinformation lol
[2023-11-23T17:45:54] Gabe Enzo: So like what 30a constant?
[2023-11-23T17:46:27] sombre_enfant: No
[2023-11-23T17:46:44] sombre_enfant: 15-20
[2023-11-23T17:47:02] Gabe Enzo: Then would the lishen LR that says 12a be close to the 15a molicel range?
[2023-11-23T17:47:18] Gabe Enzo: Still alot.
[2023-11-23T17:47:57] sombre_enfant: No lishen lr dont compare to 40t p42 p45

[2023-11-23T19:31:12] NetworkDir: why g30 dash :(
[2023-11-23T19:32:35] haku: is the dual 100/100 v2 the same components as the 100/100 single but just in dual form factor?
[2023-11-23T19:35:45] haku: i dont know about my feller american hype. but europa scooters are the fastest ive seen

[2023-11-23T19:40:22] Happy Giraffe: 50€ sale from local marketplace, would 1150A be enough to weld copper on batt?😂
[2023-11-23T19:40:27] sombre_enfant: Its handy
[2023-11-23T19:48:53] gil guy: I USE
[2023-11-23T19:49:20] haku: ive been practicing copper welds and its a little challenging. too much power on my welder blowing holes on the copper even at 25%

[2023-11-23T19:50:35] gil guy: I use old stables lipo 4s in parralel . they cans stay at ~3.7V/cell and 1000A too ..
[2023-11-23T19:53:08] haku: what spot welder do you use?
[2023-11-23T20:00:26] haku: different mosfets?
[2023-11-23T20:00:53] Mirono escooters: 1150A is debatable
[2023-11-23T20:01:05] Mirono escooters: But check what kweld or so says during Cali
[2023-11-23T20:01:27] haku: gotcha. i thought it was the same and spintend just jipped me.
[2023-11-23T20:01:36] Mirono escooters: Such shit
[2023-11-23T20:01:48] sombre_enfant: Too expensive
[2023-11-23T20:02:50] sombre_enfant: It was the china type display...
[2023-11-23T20:02:52] haku: i recently got the 80/100 on sale from spintend. would that be better to use cooling wise than the 100/100 dual? ill be using 72v and max amps i can give
[2023-11-23T20:03:16] sombre_enfant: Yes its the best out of 75100 yet
[2023-11-23T20:04:51] sombre_enfant: Its a ugly display
[2023-11-23T20:15:49] Paolo ⁭: As I told you, you shouldn't weld nickel on copper
[2023-11-23T20:15:57] Paolo ⁭: Just copper on copper or copper on cells

[2023-11-23T21:38:30] Paolo ⁭: Current sense, stepdown etc everything in one chip
[2023-11-23T21:38:37] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-11-23T21:38:40] Mirono escooters: Practical

[2023-11-23T21:38:47] Mirono escooters: "it's dead" 1 chip to replace
[2023-11-23T21:39:01] Mirono escooters: Wonder why more vescs no use? Problably because completely shit
[2023-11-23T21:39:18] Mirono escooters: Mine died, and i am not fix it
[2023-11-23T21:39:21] Paolo ⁭: No because is not good for big power
[2023-11-23T21:39:35] Mirono escooters: I got 4.2, makerx single, SPintend, all ded, me no repair
[2023-11-23T21:39:45] Mirono escooters: Who has the biggest pile of dead vescs? Must be @SibClimb
[2023-11-23T21:40:12] Paolo ⁭: I'm here with 22 vesc dead , but yeah probably he killed more than me
[2023-11-23T21:40:33] Face de Pin Sucé: 🙈
[2023-11-23T21:42:10] Happy Giraffe: You are all horrible people
[2023-11-23T21:42:44] haku: why do you not fix it? is it burnt pcb?
[2023-11-23T21:46:28] haku: just curious why not fix it and re use.
[2023-11-23T22:07:30] Mirono escooters: So much work
[2023-11-23T22:07:34] Mirono escooters: 😛😛
[2023-11-23T22:08:19] Paolo ⁭: Less than half saved
[2023-11-23T22:08:23] Paolo ⁭: 2 spingendo dead

[2023-11-23T22:20:04] Paolo ⁭: Flipsky box
[2023-11-23T22:35:06] puneDir: Anybody knows if this things are supposed to short on alupcb?
[2023-11-23T22:56:18] puneDir: Also is it supposed to boot if i give 5v and gnd from hall socket?
[2023-11-23T23:15:13] haku: my 12" tires arrived. just waiting on lonnyo 😁
[2023-11-23T23:19:46] haku: ofcourse my scoot will not look good like @XgunaX. it will be a 12" laotie like this 😂

[2023-11-23T23:20:43] Mirono escooters: Be more specific..
[2023-11-23T23:20:53] Mirono escooters: You mean the pads?
[2023-11-23T23:29:13] Jan: My own development
[2023-11-23T23:30:18] Jan: <video_file>
[2023-11-23T23:30:55] haku: wow. you even made the leds?
[2023-11-23T23:31:31] Jan: Yes
[2023-11-23T23:31:46] Jan: Its a neopixel
[2023-11-23T23:31:47] haku: amazing job bro
[2023-11-23T23:31:54] Jan: Wrote the code sequence
[2023-11-23T23:32:10] S1m 0n: Ist that a ws2812b Ring ?
[2023-11-23T23:32:30] Jan: 🤷
[2023-11-23T23:33:02] S1m 0n: How can you not know that if you designed it? 😄
[2023-11-23T23:33:05] haku: looks like a nissan gtr tail light
[2023-11-23T23:33:15] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_11168@23-11-2023_23-33-15.jpg>
[2023-11-23T23:33:29] S1m 0n: Yes, but better Version, with more leds
[2023-11-23T23:38:19] haku: do you guys always wear a camera while riding? like a gopro?
[2023-11-23T23:39:15] NetworkDir: yes Insta 360 best for scooter
[2023-11-23T23:40:33] haku: im kinda considering it. just incase. like a dash cam
[2023-11-23T23:43:57] haku: what affordable insta 360 would you recomend? i will be using like a dashcam
[2023-11-23T23:44:24] NetworkDir: insta 360 x3 can record 360 video's and price same with gopro
[2023-11-23T23:44:33] NetworkDir: wide record range
[2023-11-23T23:45:12] haku: gotcha. i will try to find a black friday sale on one
[2023-11-24T00:09:13] Paolo ⁭: Flipshit fixed
[2023-11-24T00:49:15] haku: 12" compared to stardale knockoffs. im hoping it fits
[2023-11-24T01:13:30] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): cool as hell what about the front light on the ninebot behind?
[2023-11-24T01:17:38] Jan: <photos/photo_11170@24-11-2023_01-17-38.jpg>
[2023-11-24T01:18:59] Jan: <photos/photo_11171@24-11-2023_01-18-59.jpg>
[2023-11-24T01:19:02] Jan: Same system
[2023-11-24T01:22:36] Ion: Is it noticably brighter than the stock one? Also, there is no cutoff?
[2023-11-24T01:29:20] Jan: I just wanted the same design style as in the back. The light is just for day drive regulations, its less bright than the original
[2023-11-24T01:30:42] Ion: alright, it does look cool. And looking closer I also see a proper bike light on the right scooter
[2023-11-24T01:47:46] Jan: Yeah, roger is driving a lot at night, i dont
[2023-11-24T02:34:23] haku: why is spintend advertising this as 20/150 when its label says 80/100? how much batter amps can it really pull?
[2023-11-24T02:36:11] haku: false advertising? or it can really do 150a
[2023-11-24T03:14:46] Paolo ⁭: 150 rated phase amps
[2023-11-24T03:35:11] haku: oh ok. dam my understanding on vesc is all messed up. i thought my dual 100/100 can pull 100 battery amps and can give the motor more amps
[2023-11-24T07:18:42] Rose: Hey there Ayberk, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-11-24T08:44:44] heimdler: That's a good point. I was searching for previously recommended soldering iron and I lost it. Not sure which channel it was discussed it. What would be your recommendation?
[2023-11-24T09:00:35] Happy Giraffe: I only tried cheaper Amazon ones and now have a ryobi cordless iron. However you should look at the Weller etc brand instead of random Chinese rebranded stuff
[2023-11-24T10:43:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Doesnt look bad ,but real knowledge will show irl
[2023-11-24T10:43:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice vid ,area and your attitude 😊 i like it
[2023-11-24T10:44:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And yes i was About to say
[2023-11-24T10:45:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I was having the same thing what comes from our basic standing and what we do when acceleration happens
[2023-11-24T10:46:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can buy a small adapter for go pro what makes you able to turn cam more backwards ,i am just guessing that it was fully back
[2023-11-24T10:49:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Weller can be nice ,but basic stuff they sell is more shit than 10$ ali ones , tips are pretty shitty
[2023-11-24T10:56:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on which, insta is more expensive here mostly
[2023-11-24T11:04:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Can i ask where was this ? Also would say ,if you dont mind ,i hope to see more, but in more gear like protective gloves and such
[2023-11-24T11:04:53] NetworkDir: hmm
[2023-11-24T11:21:03] JPPL: This is Porto in Portugal, good sunny days but cold, today i Will make little live later, camera Will be better position
[2023-11-24T11:28:47] Yamal: We are near 👍, Granada Spain⚡️
[2023-11-24T11:30:13] Yamal: How are the laws in Portugal for e-scooters? Can you drive on interurban roads?
[2023-11-24T11:30:49] JPPL: Just not on highways
[2023-11-24T11:31:00] JPPL: Still ok to Ride any costum escooter
[2023-11-24T11:31:18] JPPL: Everyday Police and just not their mission
[2023-11-24T11:31:40] Yamal: 👍
[2023-11-24T11:32:05] JPPL: Granada must BE more dificult
[2023-11-24T11:34:49] Yamal: Well here you can only circulate on urban roads, but we make routes outside the city, connecting towns... at the moment they leave us alone and tell us nothing
[2023-11-24T11:37:24] JPPL: So same its ok for now :) if i would listen all The critiziens i would not Ride for The last 3 years, but still ok , in 3 years Will be harder
[2023-11-24T12:01:41] Yamal: A lot can happen in three years.
[2023-11-24T12:45:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is possible trip there for me next year
[2023-11-24T12:48:11] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11173@24-11-2023_12-48-11.jpg>
[2023-11-24T12:48:16] Mirono escooters: Cl1400 😏
[2023-11-24T12:48:54] Mirono escooters: I quote: Jeremy Maddox oh he did its been great. Im at 800 battery amps and 1300 phase currently. Just not enough phase amps, This controller is great for mid power setups. I wanted to get my feet wet with vesc, when he drops his new controller ill be back on vesc. Went with a 962600 fardriver for now. 1400 battery amps and 2600 phase. Hackey Babel says down the road he will make a 2000+ phase amp controller. Ill jump on that almost instantly.
[2023-11-24T12:53:44] Mirono escooters: I fail to understand how fardriver drives them mos properly 😂
[2023-11-24T12:53:55] Mirono escooters: And wich wires you need for those curents
[2023-11-24T13:47:59] Unknown: <photos/photo_11174@24-11-2023_13-47-59.jpg>

[2023-11-24T13:50:45] sombre_enfant: Dont
[2023-11-24T13:53:48] Oreo huzky: Put 2000+phase amp controller in Xiaomi 1s
[2023-11-24T13:59:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Solder the needed connectors, but plan before,how you mount them inside the scooters body, probably you will need to make a reverse kinda y wire
[2023-11-24T14:08:08] Unknown: Y wire i need
[2023-11-24T14:08:38] Unknown: Because my battery have 2x cable to 2 controllers
[2023-11-24T14:09:46] puneDir: Yes Wait im going to ask again when i get home
[2023-11-24T14:16:22] Rose: Hey there 66673, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-11-24T14:33:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If it has already two cables you may only need to make them reach the contoller,but you are there two see only
[2023-11-24T14:35:03] puneDir: Is this a fuse?
[2023-11-24T14:41:52] Mirono escooters: Such a vague pic
[2023-11-24T14:43:19] puneDir: 75100 alupcb Removed component is 12v regülatör I just wonder whats the red circled component
[2023-11-24T14:43:44] puneDir: <photos/photo_11176@24-11-2023_14-43-44.jpg>
[2023-11-24T14:45:45] Mirono escooters: Oh great , same pic just zoomed in
[2023-11-24T14:45:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks like an Smd ceramic capacitor
[2023-11-24T14:46:13] Mirono escooters: 99% of ceramic caps r yellow tho
[2023-11-24T14:46:36] Mirono escooters: I'd guess a (e)fuse But flipsky and fuses. Its a unnecessary component hahaha
[2023-11-24T14:46:48] puneDir: resettable fuse?
[2023-11-24T14:47:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Chip caps silverish
[2023-11-24T14:47:52] Paolo ⁭: White Is generally fuse
[2023-11-24T14:50:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you say it's white for sure
[2023-11-24T14:56:04] Mirono escooters: Sure looks to be
[2023-11-24T14:56:45] Mirono escooters: Punedir why not look at schematics
[2023-11-24T14:57:33] puneDir: Schematics doesnt claim anything on there
[2023-11-24T15:04:56] Paolo ⁭: There's schematic for 75100?
[2023-11-24T15:05:04] Paolo ⁭: I thought flipsky never published it
[2023-11-24T15:08:56] puneDir: burnt regulator guys

[2023-11-24T15:09:18] puneDir: Boots when i give external 12v
[2023-11-24T15:10:32] Mirono escooters: Makerbase
[2023-11-24T15:10:42] Mirono escooters: A week.. not even..
[2023-11-24T15:11:11] haku: usa loves these groms. i dont get it. but its cool. love his projects though
[2023-11-24T15:11:21] puneDir: can + regulator Nice Im going to replace can chip now to see if it works
[2023-11-24T15:11:43] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2023-11-24T15:11:56] Unknown: From battery is is 2 cable go to 2 controllers
[2023-11-24T15:29:05] puneDir: Update on 75100 Canbus Issue Issue: No Canbus on 75100 alupcb Also no voltage output on canH and canL Reason: No reason caused this,it just stopped working Fix 1: Reflash both Vescs Fix 2: Check the 100k resistor between mcp2551 can chip Fix 3: Replace the canbus chip with Mcp2551 I SN (this fixed my issue) ;) Fix4: Check the stm and replace if needed
[2023-11-24T15:31:16] puneDir: Can chip is located on here And yellow mark is the resistor Hope this would be usefull
[2023-11-24T15:38:02] puneDir: Whats the sct2a23a voltage regulator alternatives for 75100?
[2023-11-24T16:00:28] Mihail: sy8501 I think
[2023-11-24T16:33:46] Gabe Enzo: Think it would be safe to add 10x cells to a 10s3p pack and just make it 4p like that? just add a cell on each p
[2023-11-24T16:33:55] Gabe Enzo: The Mah are the same. idk what's in the m365 cells. maybe @Mirono_escooters knows. I have ninebot es2 cells here.
[2023-11-24T16:36:01] Paolo ⁭: Nothing die randomly
[2023-11-24T16:36:06] Paolo ⁭: There's always a reason
[2023-11-24T16:36:55] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-11-24T16:37:16] Mirono escooters: Bak or eve
[2023-11-24T16:37:25] Mirono escooters: But just adding is soo sketch and not worth it
[2023-11-24T16:38:00] puneDir: What could it be?
[2023-11-24T16:38:36] Gabe Enzo: I can do 4s. would that harm the MCU? the cells are so old im pretty sure the max voltage will be like 13s worth cause the cells are so fucking old.
[2023-11-24T16:38:45] Paolo ⁭: I don't know, only you know
[2023-11-24T16:38:53] Gabe Enzo: I'm guessing 200mv drop And I know I should've asked this in m365 chat but oh well haha
[2023-11-24T16:39:11] Paolo ⁭: I listed you possible reason, but isn't nothing of them you said. So I've no idea
[2023-11-24T16:39:23] Mirono escooters: It doesn't work like that..
[2023-11-24T16:39:35] puneDir: Can you say it again? Messages got deleted
[2023-11-24T16:39:37] Mirono escooters: A 14s voltage won't "be like 13s"
[2023-11-24T16:39:40] Gabe Enzo: Learned something new today ig
[2023-11-24T16:39:45] Mirono escooters: Stationary, all sees 14s still
[2023-11-24T16:39:51] Mirono escooters: And old cells hate ebrake, even worse
[2023-11-24T16:40:06] Gabe Enzo: My pro 2 cells don't seem to care.
[2023-11-24T16:40:13] Gabe Enzo: Haha, then I'll go with 3s.
[2023-11-24T16:48:38] Gabe Enzo: They literally never overheat at 40a 😂
[2023-11-24T17:00:57] Mirono escooters: Tis not about overheat..
[2023-11-24T17:04:50] puneDir: Im going to make external 12v dc dc from old adapter for 75100
[2023-11-24T17:50:09] Mirono escooters: Oh god..
[2023-11-24T18:39:29] puneDir: Does float means dont connect to anywhere?
[2023-11-24T19:02:07] Jhinzuo ~~: Also when floating it could act as antenna recieving weird signals
[2023-11-24T19:25:14] Gabe Enzo: Yo @PaoloWu
[2023-11-24T19:25:21] Gabe Enzo: U sent my motor yet
[2023-11-24T19:25:31] Gabe Enzo: need it bad
[2023-11-24T19:38:00] Mirono escooters: What???
[2023-11-24T19:38:24] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse it does Floating means , load it at any capacity, it drops. It holds no power.
[2023-11-24T19:43:20] sombre_enfant: He's making it rn
[2023-11-24T21:05:20] Mirono escooters: Ubox V2, max recommended amps?

[2023-11-25T14:09:14] puneDir: so what i should do to fix it?
[2023-11-25T14:09:40] Jhinzuo ~~: Do both have resistor mod ?
[2023-11-25T14:09:50] puneDir: one has external dcdc one resistor
[2023-11-25T14:10:02] puneDir: <video_file>
[2023-11-25T14:10:59] Jhinzuo ~~: Fix would be disconnect canbus before u turn off the escs
[2023-11-25T14:11:19] Jhinzuo ~~: Or have both turn off same time so the one ESC don't pull through canbus
[2023-11-25T14:11:32] puneDir: Then how spintend does this?
[2023-11-25T14:12:26] Jhinzuo ~~: Prolly because they can be shutdown from factory instead of flipsky
[2023-11-25T14:12:40] Jhinzuo ~~: I think they fixed all issues thats why they don't blow
[2023-11-25T14:13:09] Jhinzuo ~~: @Megacorporate did so much shit with his ubox they're not easy to kill
[2023-11-25T14:18:53] puneDir: My external dcdc acts like theres a short
[2023-11-25T14:18:57] puneDir: But theres no short
[2023-11-25T14:19:00] sombre_enfant: On spintend they have can off
[2023-11-25T14:19:12] puneDir: is it possible to implement this?
[2023-11-25T14:19:32] sombre_enfant: Put a switch on your can wire
[2023-11-25T14:19:43] puneDir: But theres some people uses this without any problem
[2023-11-25T14:20:33] sombre_enfant: Who ? The ignition + dual
[2023-11-25T14:22:17] puneDir: @NetworkDir
[2023-11-25T14:29:58] sombre_enfant: He got key switch it cut simultanisly
[2023-11-25T14:34:55] puneDir: great My 5v is shorting
[2023-11-25T14:39:21] Mirono escooters: Mounting a cap can't be this hard
[2023-11-25T14:39:36] Jhinzuo ~~: Be glad it isn't 3.3v cuz I killed stm few days ago XD
[2023-11-25T14:39:59] Mirono escooters: Idk how punedir does it
[2023-11-25T14:40:29] Jhinzuo ~~: He don't listen we told him where he killed his first time
[2023-11-25T14:40:51] Mirono escooters: 🤡😂😂
[2023-11-25T14:41:09] Mirono escooters: New rule: not listening and then complaining it happened again is a 24h ban :)
[2023-11-25T14:41:38] Jhinzuo ~~: Maybe this way people start learning out of their mistakes 🙈
[2023-11-25T14:42:07] Jhinzuo ~~: Are 75100 box and 75100 Alu schematic same ?
[2023-11-25T14:43:45] Mirono escooters: Mostly
[2023-11-25T14:45:49] puneDir: to the canbus?
[2023-11-25T14:48:25] puneDir: @nosoudoppi can i dm you?
[2023-11-25T14:51:24] Jhinzuo ~~: Sure
[2023-11-25T14:52:30] sombre_enfant: Fit the caps around driver seems difficult with the 3 big caps on top
[2023-11-25T15:20:30] Jhinzuo ~~: I have a worse situation I was lazy and used 1big 1000uf. Im prolly checking if a big one on the 12vdc rail is enough
[2023-11-25T15:21:08] Jhinzuo ~~: If not you I'll let you know because my flipsky is a POS anyways so many mix matched components 👀
[2023-11-25T15:21:09] Mirono escooters: Just fit a slightly bigger one onto the 12v rail, forget the drivers
[2023-11-25T15:21:15] Mirono escooters: Eh I'll see if I have time this evening.
[2023-11-25T15:21:29] Jhinzuo ~~: How much uf do you recommend ?
[2023-11-25T15:22:43] Mirono escooters: Minimum 220uf
[2023-11-25T15:22:48] Mirono escooters: The more mos, the more uF
[2023-11-25T15:23:01] Mirono escooters: (and the more Gate capacitance the more uF)
[2023-11-25T15:27:43] sombre_enfant: Please do tutorial
[2023-11-25T15:28:04] Jhinzuo ~~: I can make crappy video while I do mine brother
[2023-11-25T15:28:32] Jhinzuo ~~: For 6mos ncep85t14 ? 🙈
[2023-11-25T15:28:32] sombre_enfant: Thanks
[2023-11-25T15:31:01] sombre_enfant: Only 470uf or a 330uf instead of 220uf
[2023-11-25T15:44:09] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2023-11-25T15:44:12] puneDir: my 5v on 75100 alupcb is shorting But nothing gets hot etc What should i check?
[2023-11-25T15:45:20] Jhinzuo ~~: Everything on 5v line XD
[2023-11-25T15:45:34] Jhinzuo ~~: <files/MKSESC 75100_001-schematic.pdf>
[2023-11-25T15:46:01] Jhinzuo ~~: Also didn't u wanted to dm me or no need nomore?
[2023-11-25T15:46:25] puneDir: Im troubleshooting now I will dm when i solve the 5v issue ;D
[2023-11-25T15:46:48] Jhinzuo ~~: Ahhh I understand this issue needs to be done first 🙈😅
[2023-11-25T15:48:21] Jhinzuo ~~: Could only be regulator or canchip or some caps/resistors around it
[2023-11-25T15:48:39] puneDir: Regulator is removed but still shorting
[2023-11-25T15:50:40] Jhinzuo ~~: Look if can chip dead again
[2023-11-25T15:50:53] Jhinzuo ~~: If not check the caps from 5v to gnd, look at the schematic there isn't much 5v is commented to
[2023-11-25T15:51:38] Mirono escooters: Not much
[2023-11-25T15:51:44] Mirono escooters: 220uf pleenty
[2023-11-25T15:52:24] Jhinzuo ~~: Thank you I guess 25v would be enough headroom to 12v
[2023-11-25T15:52:27] Mirono escooters: Bro, stop Go check the datasheet and trace "Getting hot" ain't a good check method
[2023-11-25T15:52:31] puneDir: its not
[2023-11-25T15:52:36] Mirono escooters: 16v plenty 😆
[2023-11-25T15:52:46] puneDir: Thermal camera is definetly a good method if theres a short
[2023-11-25T15:53:43] Jhinzuo ~~: And what gets hot ? You have to tell us 😂
[2023-11-25T15:54:41] Mirono escooters: Fucking around and finding out
[2023-11-25T15:57:20] Jhinzuo ~~: Ye lul just inject voltage into shorted thing 🙈
[2023-11-25T15:57:36] Jhinzuo ~~: <animation>
[2023-11-25T15:57:51] puneDir: yeah im doing that 💀
[2023-11-25T15:58:09] Mirono escooters: 🤦🤡
[2023-11-25T15:58:36] puneDir: i will write again when i find out 👍
[2023-11-25T15:58:58] NetworkDir: Use lighter gas
[2023-11-25T15:59:05] puneDir: Dm
[2023-11-25T15:59:38] Mirono escooters: Yes, thanks
[2023-11-25T17:12:43] sombre_enfant: <video_file>
[2023-11-25T17:14:26] NetworkDir: do you check the power and any current difference?
[2023-11-25T17:16:35] sombre_enfant: I could'nt llt was buggy
[2023-11-25T17:17:21] sombre_enfant: I used 75100 v2 from izuna file
[2023-11-25T17:18:13] sombre_enfant: I will try on my way back home... I had cutoff on the front i think, may put more abs im at 180A
[2023-11-25T17:21:11] sombre_enfant: Well my mistake, front was at 150A rear 180A...i put both 180A Rear is 80A 170A Front 65A 145A
[2023-11-25T17:46:24] sombre_enfant: Explain
[2023-11-25T17:48:16] sombre_enfant: Without fwk ?
[2023-11-25T17:53:55] sombre_enfant: I was on flipsky with same amps setting but way less amps on rt data than on mks75100 same firmware
[2023-11-25T17:57:00] Mirono escooters: Just topspeed leveling out?
[2023-11-25T18:01:31] sombre_enfant: This
[2023-11-25T18:04:59] Mirono escooters: BMS is usually a little off But 50a off. Hm.
[2023-11-25T18:14:33] sombre_enfant: Too bad llt dosent save max wattt like ant
[2023-11-25T18:21:08] Mirono escooters: Makerbase is just the older better brother of flipsky
[2023-11-25T18:21:12] Mirono escooters: I'm glad they joined
[2023-11-25T18:30:12] sombre_enfant: Networkdir used it and was wrong amp
[2023-11-25T18:31:37] Face de Pin Sucé: why not just measure the shunts and put the value into the firmware ?
[2023-11-25T18:32:00] Mirono escooters: Doubt they got the tools for that
[2023-11-25T18:41:33] sombre_enfant: Can u do it ?
[2023-11-25T18:43:53] NetworkDir: With what tools can measure shunts 😄
[2023-11-25T18:44:11] Mirono escooters: Shunts this low value*
[2023-11-25T18:45:05] NetworkDir: Maybe with this
[2023-11-25T18:45:13] puneDir: No
[2023-11-25T18:45:22] NetworkDir: But actually the shunts correct
[2023-11-25T18:45:34] puneDir: Yes My alupcb gives good amps
[2023-11-25T18:45:47] NetworkDir: We speaking about box
[2023-11-25T18:45:49] NetworkDir: No alupcb
[2023-11-25T18:46:09] puneDir: Im going to make external 5v this time
[2023-11-25T18:47:19] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_11198@25-11-2023_18-47-19.jpg>
[2023-11-25T18:47:36] NetworkDir: 3 stacked shunts And 0m50 shunts
[2023-11-25T18:48:52] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_11199@25-11-2023_18-48-52.jpg>
[2023-11-25T18:49:19] NetworkDir: I compile with this hwconf for @lBabacar But solved
[2023-11-25T19:01:03] Кирилл: Eve 21700 40PL
[2023-11-25T19:08:30] NetworkDir: 100A?☠️☠️
[2023-11-25T19:08:44] Finn: Holy
[2023-11-25T19:08:48] NetworkDir: Holy moly
[2023-11-25T19:08:54] Finn: Discharge at -40
[2023-11-25T19:08:55] Finn: Tf
[2023-11-25T19:09:09] Finn: How much capacity?
[2023-11-25T19:09:24] NetworkDir: I think 40$ per cell with this specific 😂
[2023-11-25T19:09:33] Finn: Bruh
[2023-11-25T19:10:15] NetworkDir: Effectively achieve an energy density of 223Wh/kg, 100A continuous discharge, the product can support 500 cycle times at 50A high rate and discharge at -40°C, which will be mass produced in 2023.
[2023-11-25T19:11:35] NetworkDir: 4000mAh
[2023-11-25T19:13:01] NetworkDir: What
[2023-11-25T19:29:50] Unknown: Cheap price
[2023-11-25T19:42:20] Finn: Oh ma
[2023-11-25T19:42:25] Finn: Buy 1000
[2023-11-25T19:43:38] Кирилл: 40P ≠ 40PL
[2023-11-25T19:43:57] Кирилл: 40PL no info even now. 58e is going to be produced atleast
[2023-11-25T19:44:07] Кирилл: 40p from eve is analog for 40t samsung
[2023-11-25T19:47:57] Finn: Samsung 58e?
[2023-11-25T19:47:59] Finn: What specs
[2023-11-25T19:48:08] Finn: 5800mAh with 10A discharge?
[2023-11-25T19:49:48] Happy Giraffe: 40T ok but 42P better and P45B much better😁 for our use people wont need that high sustained current anyways I think...
[2023-11-25T19:51:20] Кирилл: 5.8Ah rated and 3C
[2023-11-25T19:51:31] Кирилл: Eve 58e
[2023-11-25T19:51:38] Кирилл: There is no samsung 58e
[2023-11-25T19:51:39] Finn: Oh
[2023-11-25T19:51:43] Finn: I know
[2023-11-25T19:51:56] Finn: Thought new announced series
[2023-11-25T19:51:57] sombre_enfant: Sibclimb might need it🤪
[2023-11-25T19:54:12] Mirono escooters: How the F?
[2023-11-25T19:54:29] Mirono escooters: Youv got the energy density
[2023-11-25T19:54:41] Mirono escooters: Safety 5 stars means what? Hahaha
[2023-11-25T19:54:44] Mirono escooters: I find it a vague ad
[2023-11-25T19:55:34] Mirono escooters: Real capacity 5.5
[2023-11-25T19:55:35] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-11-25T19:55:57] Mirono escooters: Oh god.
[2023-11-25T19:57:14] Finn: 5min in 40C cold mineral oil

[2023-11-25T20:06:46] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-11-25T20:07:38] Кирилл: I think not, cause of cycles and Ah. 100A can be, but cmon, with what temperature, capacity and cycle life will be 50-100? P45b still better ofc and will be
[2023-11-25T20:08:45] Кирилл: Dunno about what is tabless structure
[2023-11-25T20:09:01] Кирилл: And no info about nominal voltage
[2023-11-25T20:41:48] haku: is that 40pl available for purchase? i will be the guinea pig
[2023-11-25T20:42:07] Jhinzuo ~~: They say 300 cycles
[2023-11-25T20:42:24] Jhinzuo ~~: Couldnt find them only found 40p
[2023-11-25T20:42:52] haku: thats an awsome cell if real.
[2023-11-25T20:44:06] haku: i hope not fake like vapecell specs
[2023-11-25T20:44:17] Jhinzuo ~~: I think It could be marketing they released apparently few months ago
[2023-11-25T20:44:33] Jhinzuo ~~: Most ppl I knew who used vapes had molicel
[2023-11-25T20:44:52] Кирилл: No
[2023-11-25T20:45:09] haku: i agree. back then it was vtc4 when i was vaping
[2023-11-25T20:46:07] haku: or vtc5 i dont remember. they skiped a generation i think. off topic sorry
[2023-11-25T20:51:21] haku: i think some have fake specs. but yes they rebrand too
[2023-11-25T20:53:16] Jhinzuo ~~: Could I use g30 ESC for front motor and vesc for rear? And put dash to g30 ESC and then splice brake data wire for adc2 and throttle data wire for adc1?
[2023-11-25T20:53:52] Mirono escooters: That's really not optimal
[2023-11-25T20:54:08] Mirono escooters: Can you? Yes Should you? Absolutely not : D
[2023-11-25T20:54:59] Jhinzuo ~~: Same amount of optimal as 2x g30 ESC with a 2nd dash or ?
[2023-11-25T20:55:16] Jhinzuo ~~: Will it kill something or just unreliable AF
[2023-11-25T20:56:20] Mirono escooters: Even less
[2023-11-25T20:56:35] Mirono escooters: <animation>

[2023-11-25T20:56:51] puneDir: not ry thing
[2023-11-25T20:56:59] Mirono escooters: The only person to possibly know is @Mltra
[2023-11-25T20:57:38] puneDir: please help me konstantin :D
[2023-11-25T20:57:43] Jhinzuo ~~: I could flash vesc port to g30 ESC , could the escs communicate through uart or only through canbus ( which the hep don't have)
[2023-11-25T20:57:52] puneDir: I dont want external 5v :(
[2023-11-25T20:59:34] Jhinzuo ~~: Only good awd method is dual vesc right ?
[2023-11-25T21:05:55] sombre_enfant: I had weird shit on front motor wheel spin then stuttering and no power max

[2023-11-26T13:07:26] Jesús: Hello, how are you? I have a problem, I have restored everything to factory values. I have done engine detection again. I went out for a ride with the scooter and when I was going at high speed I heard a noise in the rear engine or the controller and it has cut me off. I don’t know what it can be. Can you help me?
[2023-11-26T13:08:14] Jesús: <photos/photo_11213@26-11-2023_13-08-14.jpg>
[2023-11-26T13:08:26] Jesús: <photos/photo_11214@26-11-2023_13-08-26.jpg>
[2023-11-26T13:08:54] Jesús: That came out for me
[2023-11-26T13:09:45] Paolo ⁭: Get vesc app, don't use this app
[2023-11-26T13:16:55] KierreKikkeli: On the off topic the solid custom steel mounts are done, 25mm a bit too long so around 22.5mm should be perfect, brothers gonna make me new ones someday with 22.5mm middle part and 15mm bearing/body fastening part, didnt faction in the bearings extending a few mm and the og parts 1mm solid o ring on the planning part :/
[2023-11-26T13:16:55] KierreKikkeli: :////
[2023-11-26T13:17:54] Jesús: In the air it also cuts me when I give it to the fullest.
[2023-11-26T13:18:37] Jesús: I only use that app for telemetry.
[2023-11-26T13:19:33] Jesús: I also have the VESC app.
[2023-11-26T13:20:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: We know 😂 😂 😂
[2023-11-26T13:23:02] Jesús: Tronic 240R I did it all default
[2023-11-26T13:24:46] Jesús: Well, I don’t know what I have to do anymore, it never gave me any problem automatic detection.
[2023-11-26T13:26:10] Jesús: So how do I solve it?
[2023-11-26T13:26:16] KierreKikkeli: <animation>
[2023-11-26T13:27:09] Jesús: If it works but at high speed it makes some noise.
[2023-11-26T13:27:23] Jesús: Do I upgrade to 6.2?
[2023-11-26T13:30:28] Jesús: The one that worked correctly is the one that came by default in the controllers I only did engine detection and everything worked well then I went back to do detection and the problem has already started
[2023-11-26T13:31:16] Jesús: Yes, it works well, but at high rpm the rear motor makes a noise and sometimes with the wheel in the air it reaches maximum rpm I stop accelerating and when I accelerate again it does not respond
[2023-11-26T13:35:26] Jesús: Well, thank you for the wonderful help
[2023-11-26T13:40:09] Mirono escooters: ban

[2023-11-26T16:10:17] sombre_enfant: Do you have official 6.0 no limit ?
[2023-11-26T16:10:37] sombre_enfant: I will make a battery too soon
[2023-11-26T16:14:17] sombre_enfant: I need 6.0 till 6.05 isnt fixed since beta change with lisp
[2023-11-26T16:17:29] sombre_enfant: Its beta23 dont works with izuna script

[2023-11-26T16:44:25] sombre_enfant: Well well well, what current u put with the alu on vsett motor ?
[2023-11-26T16:45:24] NetworkDir: How much your battery can give
[2023-11-26T17:02:04] sombre_enfant: ?
[2023-11-26T17:10:31] Santiago: Anybody please
[2023-11-26T17:11:04] Mirono escooters: Your order. The text and buttons were upside down
[2023-11-26T17:11:14] Mirono escooters: Look at dis
[2023-11-26T17:21:54] Mirono escooters: Can be anything..
[2023-11-26T17:23:22] Mirono escooters: Bugggered opamp or your pin headers between the opamp and the shunt resistors are broken Or you killed the resistors biasign the opamp.
[2023-11-26T17:23:56] Mirono escooters: Or literally anything else on that line xW
[2023-11-26T17:55:17] puneDir: Basically there was no opamp on there :)
[2023-11-26T17:55:34] Mirono escooters: Moh, how surprising.
[2023-11-26T18:12:38] sombre_enfant: U need to put a motor
[2023-11-26T18:12:46] puneDir: <photos/photo_11227@26-11-2023_18-12-46.jpg>

[2023-11-26T18:15:00] Santiago: Appreciate it, but still having the dashboard freezing after setting up the throttle and the only way is to re-run the code (?? And recalibrating throttle too because it erases the settings after this
[2023-11-26T18:16:58] sombre_enfant: Upload the code, if dash freeze u need to reboot vesc only. But u must add caps and resistor to avoid freeze
[2023-11-26T18:20:12] puneDir: everything worked motor turned but canbus gone XD
[2023-11-26T18:20:22] puneDir: im out
[2023-11-26T18:23:59] sombre_enfant: Do flipsky/makerbase and ubox have same jst type and pinout for hall comm nrf can ?
[2023-11-26T18:26:36] Santiago: Resistor is soldered just no caps
[2023-11-26T18:27:04] puneDir: Yes
[2023-11-26T18:28:03] puneDir: Now it gives 4.4 from both
[2023-11-26T18:28:10] puneDir: (could be stm issue)
[2023-11-26T18:28:22] puneDir: Yeah
[2023-11-26T18:29:35] puneDir: This time it wasnt about me
[2023-11-26T18:31:48] sombre_enfant: Put the Throttle motor do setup then tweak for Dashboard
[2023-11-26T18:34:42] Santiago: Got it to work thank u so much, just one more thing
[2023-11-26T18:36:10] Santiago: I want to modify speed limit and motor current since the limit somehow is 25km/h
[2023-11-26T18:39:58] sombre_enfant: U need to do a profile in vesc mobile and activate it
[2023-11-26T18:40:27] sombre_enfant: Or u write on code in sport speed 400 and 1500000w
[2023-11-26T18:40:28] Santiago: No need to change anything in lisp code??
[2023-11-26T18:40:51] Santiago: Aight
[2023-11-26T19:54:50] Mirono escooters: Motor super saturating is fun, for good power But a well configured non saturating motor helps, not losing track while breaking and vibrating xD
[2023-11-26T20:45:47] puneDir: im going to buy one more box
[2023-11-26T20:45:57] puneDir: Or repair this when i have time and patience
[2023-11-26T20:45:58] Yamal: I want to learn vesc tool, but it's really difficult😅🔥🤣
[2023-11-26T20:54:07] Mirono escooters: You'll get there ;)
[2023-11-26T20:54:12] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-11-26T21:56:13] haku: this is me too. i still have alot to learn but once you get the basics its pretty fun.
[2023-11-26T21:57:04] puneDir: Caps no need
[2023-11-26T21:57:12] haku: the vesc lords here program and write code. now that i want to learn
[2023-11-26T22:02:37] Mirono escooters: On flipsky, defenitely do
[2023-11-26T22:02:44] Mirono escooters: 5v line 3.3 makes no sense
[2023-11-26T22:03:03] puneDir: i use with no problems since few weeks Theres no capacitor
[2023-11-26T22:06:06] Mirono escooters: With no problems 👀
[2023-11-26T22:06:48] Mirono escooters: Can we set a password for Vesc Bluetooth? Or even usb? Because I don't want nosy people accessing it.
[2023-11-26T22:12:49] haku: can random folks just connect to your vesc tool with phone or laptop? or is it always paired
[2023-11-26T22:13:59] Mirono escooters: Afaik any can
[2023-11-26T22:15:20] haku: dam thats not good. i think thats what happened to me in the park. a bunch of onewheel guys messed with my settings😂.
[2023-11-26T22:15:41] haku: or maybe im just paranoid
[2023-11-26T22:53:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Save settings and restore
[2023-11-26T22:54:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Something should be possible 🤔
[2023-11-26T22:54:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you talk about screen mode than first time
[2023-11-26T22:54:43] haku: where is the tab for that option?
[2023-11-26T22:54:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Somebody write it down ,but we are on the same side of a story
[2023-11-26T22:55:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁🤣
[2023-11-26T22:55:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Main tab of vesc
[2023-11-26T22:55:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Backup configs
[2023-11-26T22:55:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And restore
[2023-11-26T22:55:48] haku: gotcha! thank you
[2023-11-26T22:55:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 👌👌
[2023-11-26T23:03:06] Happy Giraffe: You can enable setting to only connect to your phone but it needs manual typing and setup thats not addressed in any documentation. I did that thinking it automatically chose my phone ID that was already connected but no and then I was locked out until usb to pc and disabling setting😂 So its possible to lock it to your phone but a bit complicated (Maybe someone who knows/has done it could share tutorial here?) Setting "Pairing Done"
[2023-11-26T23:03:51] haku: okay. that would be great. thanks
[2023-11-26T23:04:24] haku: its scary anyone can just access it and set your ride on fire 😂
[2023-11-26T23:06:23] NetworkDir: I hate BT for this. And for this reason i make wifi esp32 script :D
[2023-11-26T23:12:32] Mirono escooters: Its sad, yes
[2023-11-26T23:13:08] Mirono escooters: 4 pin code can't be that hard to integrate.
[2023-11-26T23:13:17] NetworkDir: if you ok with little bit lagging or .. use this: https://github.com/ElshanRajabi/Vesc_WIFI
[2023-11-26T23:14:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pretty sure it's possible to add some macaddress of your phone or such, Also if youcan , make it a connect only from close ,than such should not happen But how do you imagine some comes up and bugs with my scoot ? I mean in my case ,if some tries messing with it 😅 🤣🤣🤣 ends up in hospital
[2023-11-26T23:15:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i never leave it on anywhere,its a stupid idea mostly
[2023-11-26T23:15:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would need to ask the shop for the video ,but security cam
[2023-11-26T23:15:43] Mirono escooters: But esp32
[2023-11-26T23:15:49] NetworkDir: yep
[2023-11-26T23:16:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Idiot comes in and vesc based scooter is infront of him, first thing he does, hits throttle and scooter goes over the desk
[2023-11-26T23:18:17] Rose: Hey there xXbungbabeXx, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-11-26T23:20:19] haku: i think this is what happened to me. my spinny throttle suddenly acting up. i sat down next to a bunch of e skateboard and onewheel dudes. i wasnt rude or anything.
[2023-11-26T23:20:35] haku: kids though
[2023-11-26T23:22:28] Bitchass mother Bungle: Hey all new user I'm bung. I've got a couple silly questions and I don't expect anything but silly answers as a result. So first I was wondering if a vesc amd some tuning could provide much of a speed boost to my bike powered by a 350w rear hub and 36v battery.
[2023-11-26T23:24:01] Bitchass mother Bungle: I intend to buy one anyway for dual motor scooter project next year. But in the mean time it seemed like it'd be a good way to learn about the hardware and software
[2023-11-26T23:24:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,turn scoot off is a good idea next time ,some ppl thinks its funny to mess like that ,some ppl brake's noses for things like this 🤷‍♂ tastes and slaps as saying tells 🤣
[2023-11-26T23:25:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if you have some extra button on handlebar with unused feature, wire out and you can swich power from bt
[2023-11-26T23:25:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Several solutions
[2023-11-26T23:25:30] haku: good idea.
[2023-11-26T23:26:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like jam indicator turns bt on if you have such ,i used it to enable fun leds
[2023-11-26T23:27:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if this is not a dual spin there is only one serial port so ,there is choose your destiny , Bt or cc Shit single flip has two , just saying🤣🤣🤣 If its a spin
[2023-11-27T00:08:18] Rose: Hey there Monsieur, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-11-27T00:20:31] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/h4MiDHl6Vj0?si=yzXmEkT30aREpQ5W
[2023-11-27T00:20:49] haku: looks like kaboo making dirt bikes now
[2023-11-27T00:26:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This when you have too much time and so you waste😁
[2023-11-27T02:27:31] Rose: Hey there Franchesco, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-11-27T03:36:34] haku: what determines voltage sag? is it battery capacity or discharge rate? my from my understanding its the discharge rate?
[2023-11-27T04:32:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nop
[2023-11-27T04:32:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: For the price they are nice
[2023-11-27T04:32:48] Rogerio Figueiredo: If wasn't from them ide never tried vesc
[2023-11-27T05:17:44] Jan: I would guess from the battery internal resistance
[2023-11-27T05:17:54] Jan: The higher it is the more voltage sag
[2023-11-27T05:18:58] Jan: If i can use U=R*I and i assume 15mOhm resistance, that would be 0.6V sag at 40A discharge per cell?
[2023-11-27T05:19:08] Jan: 20s bat would have 12V sag
[2023-11-27T05:28:33] haku: i see. thanks.
[2023-11-27T05:29:13] Happy Giraffe: Also battery nickel, copper, wires, connectors if done wrong give you sag (extra resistance) in addition to cells
[2023-11-27T05:31:43] haku: of course. im just talking cell level. do you guys know if 40t sags a little when pushed to its amp limits?
[2023-11-27T05:33:31] haku: for example pulsing it at 35a. how much sag happens?
[2023-11-27T05:57:54] Happy Giraffe: Mooch data doesnt open on the facebook link sadly. Its a good 25A cell 30A maybe short bursts and 35A burst I wouldnt use on it. Better then use Moli
[2023-11-27T05:59:15] haku: i see. the only real 45a cell is p45b?
[2023-11-27T06:02:12] haku: all good already purchased my cells. hopefully it can do 35a burst. for acceleration and climbing hills
[2023-11-27T06:03:59] haku: should be enough for my needs. i just want proper burnouts
[2023-11-27T06:07:24] Jan: P42a is also ok
[2023-11-27T06:07:43] Jan: There is no jump in resistance
[2023-11-27T06:08:01] Jan: All are about i believe 9mOhms region
[2023-11-27T06:08:20] Jan: P45B a bit less resistance than P42A
[2023-11-27T06:08:42] Jan: The question is always why you need that good cells if you got the battery space
[2023-11-27T06:08:42] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jan has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-11-27T06:08:48] haku: thats nice. if it goes on sale i will get some. got the 40t at a good price
[2023-11-27T06:12:36] Happy Giraffe: On a big battery thats never fully stressed or charged to 100% it will give a good cell life. Active bms balance is must of you only charge to 90% or 95%
[2023-11-27T06:13:18] haku: my pack will not be too big like ebikes. maybe 8 or 9p
[2023-11-27T06:13:36] haku: i got enough for 22s but idk if im gonna do it
[2023-11-27T06:13:44] Jan: Do you need good cell life? Lets say you charge it every 50km, 500cycles is alread 25'000km
[2023-11-27T06:38:51] Jan: Question about Vesc regenerative braking, can i limit it to a certain voltage so it doesnt overcharge the battery?
[2023-11-27T06:39:03] Jan: Never really tried regen braking
[2023-11-27T06:39:30] puneDir: Isnt it already does that?
[2023-11-27T07:12:55] puneDir: Im going to get box again and keep the alupcbs spare
[2023-11-27T07:13:11] puneDir: Maybe 2 box matches good
[2023-11-27T07:13:18] haku: when will 6.05 be available to the masses?
[2023-11-27T08:54:23] Bitchass mother Bungle: Is trying to out two separate 36v batteries in series dumb or fun?
[2023-11-27T09:02:49] Finn: Dumb if you use controller that is rated with 36V
[2023-11-27T09:03:34] Bitchass mother Bungle: No I'd be upgrading controller if that was possible but I've read a lot of mixed things might blow up ect
[2023-11-27T09:10:33] Bitchass mother Bungle: I had noticed some 48v 13ah batteries down to 170 for black friday. And found a controller that would work with my current display and can apparently also be modded with open source firmware. But for about 250 quid I really wasn't sure it'd be worth it on 350 battery. Throttle only I can hit 20 flat mph. Not sure if I'd get much gains with the 48v. If I could safe(ish)ly put two 36v in series and run a 1000w motor that'd probably be worth getting a motor and Controller for
[2023-11-27T09:11:39] Bitchass mother Bungle: Really I should just keep my bike as is and functional and try building something silly like a go kart or scooter I guess
[2023-11-27T09:19:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically it's a messy connection where you dont grow your range and there are things what you would like to pay attention ,like since you connect with serial connection +to- You dont want the batteries to charge eachother
[2023-11-27T09:20:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Batts like this far from a decent battery
[2023-11-27T09:21:48] Bitchass mother Bungle: If I got a spot welder and took apart the batteries and rebuilt it would that in the long run help?
[2023-11-27T09:22:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on what batteries they were
[2023-11-27T09:23:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But vesc draws a lot power ,sags even good batts
[2023-11-27T09:23:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on power
[2023-11-27T09:24:22] Bitchass mother Bungle: Doubt driving another 350w front motor with a vesc would help? Awd ebike 😂
[2023-11-27T09:24:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Most off the ppl here spends a lot on parts ,so in the end of day (build) they can be happy about it
[2023-11-27T09:25:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If the second aint vesc driven , pointless
[2023-11-27T09:25:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Front will pull the back
[2023-11-27T09:25:40] Bitchass mother Bungle: And if it were?
[2023-11-27T09:26:15] Bitchass mother Bungle: Sorry for the daft question I've not slept and been reading forums and just confusing myself all night
[2023-11-27T09:27:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,it makes a point, since the two vesc can work together
[2023-11-27T09:28:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As i said before,smart out what's is your goal for real
[2023-11-27T09:28:34] Bitchass mother Bungle: 30mph spending as little as I can
[2023-11-27T09:29:22] Bitchass mother Bungle: Get 20 currently. I have a spare 36v battery tho
[2023-11-27T09:29:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i would say till you consider let us move this conversation in off topic
[2023-11-27T09:29:34] Bitchass mother Bungle: OK sorry
[2023-11-27T09:30:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Np ,just others may have on going things ,not just planned ones, that's all
[2023-11-27T09:34:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @Albinobungo so how about telling us more what you have now, and than we can move on
[2023-11-27T09:51:09] Bitchass mother Bungle: OK. I've got a bike with a rear hub 350w motor. 36v battery runs fine. I love it. But.... we all wanna go fast don't we. I acquired another 36v battery and a 24 wheel with a 250 motor. I was going to maybe make a cheap ebike for a friend's kid. But I got to looking into mods for scooters and found out about the flysky vesec and some other potential conteollers for my bike that also have customisable firmware. I see my option as do nothing be happy. Try and connect 2 36v in series into a 72v or rebuild the cells into a new battery both sound like they have big caveats. I could use the other battery to power a front 350 hub for awd with a vesc to that the power is balanced and not just the front pulling apparently? So yeah that's my short list of bad ideas
[2023-11-27T10:10:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You could fire that bike a bit but after a lvl you would need bigger engine to survive You could do one vesc and just upgrade battery to needed lvl Serial connection has some rules to follow,like in your case two "same" batteries Totally same would be the "good" But still one is new the other is used so they wont work well together Making a new pack from the two is similar,old used maybe stressed cells and new cells not a good idea to mix Also cells should be the same kind
[2023-11-27T10:12:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say forget other engine for now , better build mates kid a bike from that maybe from your ex battery pack
[2023-11-27T10:15:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just for an example, one of my costumers shoe's Ha has an rear engine 1000w scooter Vesc drives it With older 13s6 p 21ah (Samsung 35e cell)from his ex xiaomi With 30A bms only
[2023-11-27T10:16:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 10 km ride is like 30-40% used and you stop around 45-50% rest is vdrop So kinda like eats it alive and his not power user never was
[2023-11-27T10:18:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But now his getting new stuff and partly his getting rid off old stuff what he bought an year ago
[2023-11-27T10:18:36] Bitchass mother Bungle: Yeah I sadly thought that's what all the sensible ideas would generally be. Thank you for bringing me down to earth
[2023-11-27T10:18:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What contoller you have in that ebike
[2023-11-27T10:19:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Show or show link
[2023-11-27T10:19:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe knows 48 v
[2023-11-27T10:19:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than upgrade battery and save money for the next
[2023-11-27T10:20:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if its not doesnt mean it wont work ,some china contollers takes huge stress 🤣
[2023-11-27T10:20:19] Bitchass mother Bungle: I've found there might be some custom firmware to it but I'm not 100% on the controller as it was a yose power kit with the conteoller integrated into the hailong battery mount but I can pop it open for a peek later
[2023-11-27T10:21:06] Bitchass mother Bungle: There are some on sale currently £170 but lower capacity
[2023-11-27T10:21:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But near all these ,you are there you see I having a shit e moped with china finest contoller 🤣 shunted to shit to work as you would expect
[2023-11-27T10:21:25] Bitchass mother Bungle: Yeah I get you
[2023-11-27T10:22:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Show link coz names tell nothing,show in ali or where ever there us description and i take a look
[2023-11-27T10:22:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sale on what?
[2023-11-27T10:22:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also imperial doesnt tell me a lot
[2023-11-27T10:22:48] Bitchass mother Bungle: 48v batteries
[2023-11-27T10:23:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe better question is where
[2023-11-27T10:23:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We know decent builders in the Uk
[2023-11-27T10:23:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ali amazon etc battery packs i would not advise
[2023-11-27T10:23:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And surly not use with vesc
[2023-11-27T10:24:45] Bitchass mother Bungle: This is the firmware and compatipal batteries. https://github.com/stancecoke/BMSBattery_S_controllers_firmware/wiki/06-Progamming-new-features This is the battery for sale an I have one of the 36v ones lemme see if I can't narrow the contoller down
[2023-11-27T10:28:21] Bitchass mother Bungle: <photos/photo_11229@27-11-2023_10-28-21.jpg>
[2023-11-27T10:32:03] Bitchass mother Bungle: This is where I found out about the bms/controller being flashable potentially https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AevfY0HGgcs
[2023-11-27T10:33:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And this is what you have?
[2023-11-27T10:34:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz this way different
[2023-11-27T10:34:48] Bitchass mother Bungle: Yeah sorry the only link between them is they support the same screen. I'm a twat and haven't slept much
[2023-11-27T10:36:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well i would say if you have the first,buy something Stronger 25-35 ish GBP you find double stronger ones on ali with pass , probably on amazon also
[2023-11-27T10:37:38] sombre_enfant: @SibClimb hi any chance u have M2.5 screw ?
[2023-11-27T10:38:44] Bitchass mother Bungle: I think my options for tinkering mayne taking a neighbours broken scooter and seeing if I could run it off my bikes battery maybe getting a dual vesc with the goal of adding a 2nd motor later. Think its just the battery that's dead
[2023-11-27T10:39:32] Bitchass mother Bungle: Sorry I'll leave you folks without my ramblings to deal with. I appreciate you all for being kind and honest.
[2023-11-27T10:41:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For screen? You guys live close?
[2023-11-27T10:43:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All good , Vesc is no joke Vesc can fuck the battery and bad battery behavior could fuck vesc ,so better on the good side
[2023-11-27T10:43:47] Bitchass mother Bungle: Yeah lotta money to burn without results
[2023-11-27T10:44:29] Bitchass mother Bungle: Wish I could weld go carts look a laugh to make
[2023-11-27T10:48:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need to start somewhere , there is ppl in this chat with huge respect from me ,he had similar idea now learns how to do such Near all ,frames like a cart a bike and such are welded in a skeleton frame so they cant move by the welding heat Also all like that is fun ,but lot time and knowledge
[2023-11-27T10:51:29] Bitchass mother Bungle: Yeah I'm very new to electronics. Was excited to hear about vesc open source firmware as even handling how the acceleration responds to the throttle sounds like it could be fun to play with. But maybe I'll see what I can do on a small budget with model scale components that don't cost as much to learn the hard way with
[2023-11-27T10:52:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe in my trash screw box haha
[2023-11-27T10:54:20] Happy Giraffe: Almost same setup than mine tho I have 35A bms😂 And better motor😁
[2023-11-27T10:57:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,you could see a lot from high performance builds and vesc if you follow rage-mechanics on insta and you can take look on there site also
[2023-11-27T10:58:41] Bitchass mother Bungle: Much obliged
[2023-11-27T10:59:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True but i probably that's more effective like that ,also this old ass daly 🤣 rating means nothing,but i see the sag and makes me sad so i dont stress it cant wait to replace with some 60v
[2023-11-27T10:59:29] Bitchass mother Bungle: That's the wonder if if I got a 48v battery and beefier controller how much can a 350w even take?
[2023-11-27T11:06:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,this when one thing brings the other up ,if you go deep Coz engine could enjoy New decent Bearings and ferrofluid, also if its like that mid heatsink solutions exist Also if your engine is rated 36v 350w Than on 48v its 466w basically Also continues and peak different,but should take 1200-1500 w loads probably ,but lot depends on everything
[2023-11-27T11:09:16] Bitchass mother Bungle: So what your saying is yes buy it it'll work 💯 amd you'll help with all issues along the way?
[2023-11-27T11:10:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If i can, i help
[2023-11-27T11:18:05] Gabe Enzo: vesc power 🍟
[2023-11-27T11:18:07] Bitchass mother Bungle: Is it hard to respoke a hub to a new wheel?
[2023-11-27T11:18:57] Bitchass mother Bungle: That was beautiful how fast is she with load?
[2023-11-27T11:19:17] Gabe Enzo: 60
[2023-11-27T11:19:31] Bitchass mother Bungle: Kph?
[2023-11-27T11:19:36] Gabe Enzo: Yes. but enough for me
[2023-11-27T11:19:44] Gabe Enzo: maybe 65 now, cause I turned on BLDC
[2023-11-27T11:19:50] Gabe Enzo: but more inefficient
[2023-11-27T11:20:04] Gabe Enzo: Can reach 70 with Xiaomi esc, now I use vesc
[2023-11-27T11:20:24] Bitchass mother Bungle: I bet! Sounds like a good laugh tho. Scooters feel so much faster than bikes imo probably cause of the height
[2023-11-27T11:21:02] Bitchass mother Bungle: And one pot hole or pebble and that could be it
[2023-11-27T11:21:26] Bitchass mother Bungle: Makes it a bit more intense. Not tried air tyres tho
[2023-11-27T11:25:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bike service is faster 😁
[2023-11-27T11:26:10] Bitchass mother Bungle: None will touch a hub here
[2023-11-27T11:26:12] Jan: Never something else than air tires lol
[2023-11-27T11:26:23] Jan: Solids are the worst
[2023-11-27T11:26:36] Bitchass mother Bungle: Yeah rattle like mad
[2023-11-27T11:27:14] Bitchass mother Bungle: Is it feasibly doable by someone with free time and tutorials?
[2023-11-27T11:27:44] Bitchass mother Bungle: I seems like it should be simple but also like black magic
[2023-11-27T11:28:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tools needed and knowledge,i would not bug with my own
[2023-11-27T11:29:14] Bitchass mother Bungle: It's possibly for the kids bike got a 24inch wheel with hub but if he hasn't he's gonna outgrow it soon so mayne best making something that'll last long
[2023-11-27T11:30:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Biked 15 years never had the idea to start to mess with that,if its not a temp fix so you can go
[2023-11-27T11:32:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's true in a way I never had a bmx size something Started on 24" i bearly reached the pedals and had jump start it🤣
[2023-11-27T11:33:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also depends on kid what he needs but idea what you said is good ,but i am rude east eu fella,so if kid fat no ebike for him 😅
[2023-11-27T11:34:01] Bitchass mother Bungle: Playing outsides better than not....
[2023-11-27T11:34:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As i said, all depends on the kid
[2023-11-27T11:34:49] Bitchass mother Bungle: Hopefully he'll explore long enough to learn how long it takes to pedal home
[2023-11-27T11:35:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I had trike inside when i was 6 and it was winter ,long hall way 😏😏😏😏 I went over the glass door with it
[2023-11-27T11:37:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I always had the energy The courage And the stupidity also
[2023-11-27T11:37:36] Bitchass mother Bungle: Anyone built anything really dumb? Was wondering if anyone had made a chariot pulled my ebikes or summit
[2023-11-27T11:38:08] Bitchass mother Bungle: Or I guess that's two pissed mates rope n a hoverboard
[2023-11-27T11:38:37] Bitchass mother Bungle: Or put a vesc on a shopping trolley
[2023-11-27T11:47:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @roscheeee made 3 wheeler bike with old ass chair on the back for Grandma ,i would not say dumb,more like fun
[2023-11-27T11:49:09] Bitchass mother Bungle: I've been looking at motorising my mother's wheelchair or a wheel barrow
[2023-11-27T11:49:49] Bitchass mother Bungle: Side car with powered side wheel also sounds a laugh but dunno how to weld
[2023-11-27T11:53:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Last probably not too good idea ,since its not the main part
[2023-11-27T11:53:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wheelchair mods can be done easy by scooters
[2023-11-27T11:54:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All what's needed is a part what holds the wheelchair front in position while one drives
[2023-11-27T11:54:44] Jhinzuo ~~: Ye I follow a disabled person on tiktok who did a attachment for his wheelchair onto his pro2 😂
[2023-11-27T11:55:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its a really old thing to do
[2023-11-27T11:55:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 2-3 years existed
[2023-11-27T11:55:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i think its great ,not brainless way
[2023-11-27T11:55:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But to give back mobility to person like that is cool
[2023-11-27T11:56:25] Jhinzuo ~~: Ye I also think wheelchair + scoot gives u back so much mobility just German rules suck and they fine u for it.
[2023-11-27T11:57:01] Bitchass mother Bungle: Was trying to judge if that'd be a better solution for my mother or assistance for me pushing. Not sure she'd be great at steering these days I'm afraid
[2023-11-27T11:57:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://youtube.com/shorts/N30ZCyI-XFA?si=_apLVrDW78GHy4pP

[2023-11-27T11:59:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Imagine you cant go to a shop coz of the chair ,and than they can It doesnt give the legs back but being able to go further without getting tired is thing for them for sure
[2023-11-27T11:59:33] Bitchass mother Bungle: So simple wow. Thanks again this could be a game changer for my crippled mother

[2023-11-27T12:00:33] Bitchass mother Bungle: I'd have to help her of course but any independence I can help her get back would make us both happy
[2023-11-27T12:00:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But make decent lock sytem ,has to be safe
[2023-11-27T12:01:17] Bitchass mother Bungle: Yeah was thinking maybe something like those 3rd party seats could help hold it too

[2023-11-27T12:04:26] sombre_enfant: I wonder how long is the thread too, i will choose 8mm one i think
[2023-11-27T12:05:10] sombre_enfant: 3-4 mm are already for the frame
[2023-11-27T12:10:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure you need to measure it ,also if you use countersunk head than less long needed ,but has to make the shape so head can sit inside🤷‍♂
[2023-11-27T12:16:36] sombre_enfant: Chc head
[2023-11-27T12:18:57] Face de Pin Sucé: I found some screws in my trash screw box haha Did you try calling Quincaillerie Gresset ? I don't remember if they have M2.5, or you can buy from Bricovis, which ships in 24H

[2023-11-27T18:00:16] puneDir: halls 5v is not isolated And my halls failed somehow and pushed more than 5v

[2023-11-27T21:07:34] Gabe Enzo: Totally not stealing this design
[2023-11-27T21:08:36] Mirono escooters: Hopefully as safe
[2023-11-27T21:08:59] Mirono escooters: Idk why anyone would do the BMS connections like that tho. Useless.
[2023-11-27T21:09:02] puneDir: No holders no isolation 😁
[2023-11-27T21:09:08] Mirono escooters: And I don't see isolation
[2023-11-27T21:09:19] Mirono escooters: Maybe he should totally not steal the design..
[2023-11-27T21:10:28] sombre_enfant: The copper is just show off.... Take Thierry example for battery
[2023-11-27T21:10:43] Mirono escooters: Yes, its stupid
[2023-11-27T21:10:51] Mirono escooters: I hate looks before functionality
[2023-11-27T21:10:58] Mirono escooters: Can make something look good while not overdoing
[2023-11-27T21:12:58] sombre_enfant: Again a G30 battery
[2023-11-27T21:13:21] Gabe Enzo: It's Paolo's, take that back
[2023-11-27T21:13:34] Mirono escooters: Then we just dont see the isolation.
[2023-11-27T21:13:50] Mirono escooters: And the copper strips, are still weird. Maybe he had no space for wire? Would be weird.
[2023-11-27T21:13:56] puneDir: Yeah but why dont locate on top
[2023-11-27T21:14:06] haku: how many 18650 can fit a g30 again?
[2023-11-27T21:14:09] Gabe Enzo: Xiaomi pro 2 space
[2023-11-27T21:14:21] Mirono escooters: With or without rails
[2023-11-27T21:14:26] Mirono escooters: With or without Esc space
[2023-11-27T21:15:14] haku: no rails
[2023-11-27T21:15:38] haku: with esc space
[2023-11-27T21:15:49] haku: like a 100/100 dual
[2023-11-27T21:17:23] haku: copper too close together 😂
[2023-11-27T21:18:43] sombre_enfant: 16s6p
[2023-11-27T21:19:05] sombre_enfant: Never take 100/100 or dual spintend atm, take 80100
[2023-11-27T21:19:21] haku: some folks running 20s. how?
[2023-11-27T21:19:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically its the let it burn song , didn't ment it to listen whole🤣

[2023-11-27T21:25:28] Gabe Enzo: Paolo made it, so let's just say it's not gonna blow.
[2023-11-27T21:25:46] haku: looks real clean tbh
[2023-11-27T21:27:17] haku: copper wrapped in capton so that should do it
[2023-11-27T21:34:56] Gabe Enzo: You mean no spacer
[2023-11-27T21:35:13] Gabe Enzo: that's 96 cells.

[2023-11-27T21:45:45] haku: dumb question but i have to ask. would a 3d printer still work on a wobbley table. like this table?
[2023-11-27T21:46:27] haku: the table is plastic and not really planted
[2023-11-27T21:46:33] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-27T21:46:40] Mirono escooters: Just don't go 300m/s
[2023-11-27T21:47:38] haku: thanks. when i got my printer i did not expect it to be huge.
[2023-11-27T21:50:31] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-11-27T21:52:39] Gabe Enzo: No
[2023-11-27T21:52:46] haku: i really thought i can fit it in my desk
[2023-11-27T21:52:52] Gabe Enzo: Place it on the floor
[2023-11-27T21:53:22] Gabe Enzo: You can print if you go 40% speed on that desk probably
[2023-11-27T21:53:24] haku: gotcha. im just afraid of dog hair messing it up 😂
[2023-11-27T21:53:35] Gabe Enzo: it's fine mine works fine and it's in spider webs
[2023-11-27T21:55:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔🤔🤔

[2023-11-27T21:57:34] haku: you cant tell
[2023-11-27T21:57:54] Mirono escooters: Its fine on da desk.. it must be reaaaaly wobbly to throw a hotend around
[2023-11-27T21:57:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Buy few 2 by 4 and OSB
[2023-11-27T21:58:01] Mirono escooters: And get thrown around by the little inertia a hotend gives
[2023-11-27T21:58:09] Mirono escooters: It'll probably resonate and drive you nuts
[2023-11-27T21:58:12] Mirono escooters: But it'll print
[2023-11-27T21:58:37] haku: good to know. thanks

[2023-11-27T22:01:45] haku: its cheaper to buy a desk than make one.
[2023-11-27T22:02:02] Gabe Enzo: the question is if the table comes out straight
[2023-11-27T22:02:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cheaper than a new printer and could be good for more than that
[2023-11-27T22:02:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends
[2023-11-27T22:02:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ikea type yeah
[2023-11-27T22:02:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But one what you could hammer on different thing
[2023-11-27T22:02:45] Gabe Enzo: You're always gonna wanna put it away when it's not in use, I know personally. uses up so much space
[2023-11-27T22:03:11] haku: i agree. i have a solid desk in the garage but i will not put printer out in the cold.
[2023-11-27T22:03:22] Gabe Enzo: Yes, it damages the prints
[2023-11-27T22:03:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I live in 230m2 alone mostly using one room and the workshop,rest scooters bodies and car parts
[2023-11-27T22:04:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like literly scooters in the kitchen
[2023-11-27T22:04:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is no such thing as enough space
[2023-11-27T22:04:26] puneDir: bodies 😨
[2023-11-27T22:04:35] haku: well im new to printing. still setting it up. i will update when i get test prints
[2023-11-27T22:05:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes scooter bodies
[2023-11-27T22:05:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Used and new also
[2023-11-27T22:06:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: My mate would say set it up correctly and never let anybody even near
[2023-11-27T22:16:16] Konstantin: Why copper for signal wires xDdd , to balance them 50a current?)) xDDD
[2023-11-27T22:22:11] haku: maybe charging at 100a?
[2023-11-27T22:25:27] Mirono escooters: Balance is balance
[2023-11-27T22:28:38] haku: https://youtu.be/OKyB1LEOFEI?si=Cbl7e_y_VEVASo_F
[2023-11-27T22:28:54] haku: @Megacorporate steal this design
[2023-11-27T22:30:40] haku: i would replicate it but soldered negative leads. how do you weld that negative side. so risky
[2023-11-27T22:31:11] haku: i will buy this robot when it goes on sale😂
[2023-11-27T23:49:17] Finn: @Mirono_escooters how does bluetooth even work on smartesc m365?
[2023-11-27T23:53:24] Mirono escooters: Rx tx of BMS used as comm port
[2023-11-28T00:39:18] haku: is there a tool that can measure IR of a lion battery pack?
[2023-11-28T00:41:22] Jhinzuo ~~: U can calculate using load voltage and idle voltage
[2023-11-28T00:43:56] haku: is this the IR meter? this can only do single cell i think
[2023-11-28T00:44:31] haku: i did not know it can measure the whole pack. ty
[2023-11-28T00:45:04] haku: ok
[2023-11-28T01:12:28] NetworkDir: This ones nice
[2023-11-28T01:12:48] NetworkDir: Can measure 1.8 mohm
[2023-11-28T01:13:05] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_11237@28-11-2023_01-13-05.jpg>
[2023-11-28T01:13:55] NetworkDir: Also have a usb port for communication and on github scripts available. For example automatic add cell test to excel and ..
[2023-11-28T01:14:00] NetworkDir: Useful tool
[2023-11-28T01:14:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. NetworkDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-11-28T01:17:09] haku: i think mine is the knockoff of that tool.
[2023-11-28T02:35:03] haku: oh man! my i love china motors arrived
[2023-11-28T02:35:03] haku: <photos/photo_11239@28-11-2023_02-35-03.jpg>
[2023-11-28T02:44:01] haku: hefty boy
[2023-11-28T02:59:57] haku: 12" hopefully it will it my laotie 😂
[2023-11-28T03:27:12] Ion: That's some crazy motor. That's more than 60h?
[2023-11-28T03:28:17] haku: i know. very good build quality. it 70h
[2023-11-28T03:29:00] haku: it looks like a surron motor but in a different form factor
[2023-11-28T05:31:09] haku: whats the problem with your rion?
[2023-11-28T05:33:21] Jan: I want to see a working Rion scooter in my lifetime lol
[2023-11-28T05:34:01] Jan: Is it like illegal to make videos and record stats?
[2023-11-28T06:11:19] haku: dam that barely fits
[2023-11-28T06:12:09] haku: i am hoping once the tires inflated it will expand
[2023-11-28T06:18:53] haku: if it doesnt fit ill get real pmt stardales
[2023-11-28T06:26:17] haku: i will get this to work. worry not vesc lords. i will not fail you
[2023-11-28T06:35:07] sombre_enfant: Wich vesc ?
[2023-11-28T06:35:11] puneDir: I love china
[2023-11-28T06:35:50] sombre_enfant: 75200 spintend ?
[2023-11-28T06:45:48] haku: yes that is the plan maybe g300 but for now i only have 80/100 and dual 100/100 v2
[2023-11-28T06:50:09] haku: but i might do spintend since alu pcb
[2023-11-28T06:55:44] sombre_enfant: G300 is bad
[2023-11-28T06:57:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: not that bad, the last one are better with some improuvement a friend did
[2023-11-28T06:58:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 80H ?
[2023-11-28T07:01:01] haku: nah just 70. i think this id the most that i can fit without modifying the dropout
[2023-11-28T07:19:42] JPPL: Spinted or makerx way much better 😂😂
[2023-11-28T07:20:58] JPPL: Its funny
[2023-11-28T07:22:28] haku: we should have a poll. my wallet is saying spintend but my heart says g300
[2023-11-28T07:23:44] JPPL: G300 ❤️ seems we are The ONLY lovers
[2023-11-28T07:25:15] haku: my bms is also 350 peak. g300 might be too much
[2023-11-28T07:29:24] JPPL: G300 is a good beast, you should study well what setup Will be. A lote is based on The config, g300 or ubox 85v 250a
[2023-11-28T07:31:13] JPPL: My lonyo motors are handling arround 250a phase and 440 peak, Thays what Im using recently on vesc config Also 100a battery each
[2023-11-28T07:38:35] haku: very nice does it get hot at all?
[2023-11-28T08:04:28] JPPL: 50° max i Saw if not wrong
[2023-11-28T10:05:05] Gabe Enzo: Hahaha what a name
[2023-11-28T11:37:11] Yamal: LY motors just look nice
[2023-11-28T11:53:39] sombre_enfant: I want to fit that on g2
[2023-11-28T13:03:29] Paolo ⁭: No possible without arms mod
[2023-11-28T13:03:40] Gabe Enzo: is there any way to make the 80100 air cooled?
[2023-11-28T13:21:56] Happy Giraffe: NDA signed not to race any modded G30
[2023-11-28T13:24:17] sombre_enfant: <video_file>
[2023-11-28T13:24:54] sombre_enfant: Makerbase crash is il possible because i hit my duty reduction of low battery 51.2v
[2023-11-28T13:30:48] Rose: Hey there Juli, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-11-28T13:36:55] Finn: What duty limit did you set
[2023-11-28T13:39:14] Jan: Im gonna race it when i get some gear and a track
[2023-11-28T13:39:23] Jan: The open streets are really the worst
[2023-11-28T13:40:02] Happy Giraffe: Which printer? If its a bambulab one then no, resonance calibration needs atleast somewhat decent surface. I dont think this will give consistent results
[2023-11-28T13:40:40] Happy Giraffe: Interesting design
[2023-11-28T13:47:39] sombre_enfant: 95
[2023-11-28T13:48:30] Mirono escooters: G300 ❤️
[2023-11-28T13:49:28] Mirono escooters: Chonk
[2023-11-28T13:55:12] Finn: You can turn it up to 97%
[2023-11-28T14:02:21] sombre_enfant: Ik but they dead brother
[2023-11-28T14:02:34] Finn: Did your battery cut?
[2023-11-28T14:04:39] Mirono escooters: F
[2023-11-28T14:05:44] haku: gotcha. yes its a p1s. still need to set it up and find a stable platform. i did not expect it to be big and bulky
[2023-11-28T14:07:16] haku: i agree. very well built by the looks of it too
[2023-11-28T14:09:45] Yamal: For me 60h 22/3 is okay no need more,,
[2023-11-28T14:12:45] Yamal: Soon is finish ‼️🙏😂🔥
[2023-11-28T14:13:46] haku: looking good bro!
[2023-11-28T14:15:46] haku: mine wont be finished until atleast mid january. parts and makimg battery will take time. also holidays very hectic time
[2023-11-28T14:21:11] Happy Giraffe: To reduce sound I have my printer on a small table with foam pad concrete block and another foam pad. Now only sound is the fans and vibrations are minimized
[2023-11-28T14:24:35] Jhinzuo ~~: Ye I think so look v drop on accel 🙈
[2023-11-28T14:30:21] sombre_enfant: Nope
[2023-11-28T14:30:32] sombre_enfant: Batt cut at 2.8v
[2023-11-28T14:33:29] Finn: Overcurrent?
[2023-11-28T14:35:03] haku: nice!
[2023-11-28T14:36:15] haku: @PaoloWu do you know where to get nickel plated copper sheets?
[2023-11-28T14:43:26] Yamal: I'm still in doubt whether to put 20s10p or 24s7p
[2023-11-28T14:45:52] Happy Giraffe: 20% more energy stored in 20s10p as it has 32 extra cells. Depends on motors you gonna use I guess and what they are capable of
[2023-11-28T14:53:37] Paolo ⁭: Why you need that hahaha
[2023-11-28T14:53:52] haku: 24s would be cool. never seen 24s on a scooter exeept exrtreme bull k6
[2023-11-28T14:54:23] Mirono escooters: Resonance calibration?
[2023-11-28T14:54:25] haku: it seems like a good idea😂. are there vendors for that type of stuff?
[2023-11-28T15:35:35] sombre_enfant: Neither its 180A
[2023-11-28T15:37:30] sombre_enfant: U can weld direct copper with your stuff
[2023-11-28T15:40:11] Finn: Mks moment
[2023-11-28T15:40:23] Finn: Measure mosfets
[2023-11-28T15:43:02] JPPL: Solid 20s is my vote, more parallel, for daily use amazing, The 4s Will help to get more speed
[2023-11-28T15:44:11] Gabe Enzo: always go with more voltage if your hardware allows it.
[2023-11-28T15:48:58] Кирилл: K6 is 32s system
[2023-11-28T15:49:04] Кирилл: 134v full charge
[2023-11-28T15:49:35] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_11221@26-11-2023_16-02-44.jpg>
[2023-11-28T15:49:43] sombre_enfant: Not needed
[2023-11-28T15:49:49] puneDir: Ntc moment
[2023-11-28T15:51:21] sombre_enfant: @jamessoderstrom what u think about drilling the side of the frame of vsett to screw two ubox, then fit 20s6p with side bms
[2023-11-28T15:53:04] sombre_enfant: Wont the ntc blow before the mosfet ?
[2023-11-28T15:57:25] Mirono escooters: I do not see how
[2023-11-28T16:05:40] sombre_enfant: Man fuck that shit if u put that much dedication to fix 50€ u should make your own vesc for the time spent
[2023-11-28T16:06:16] puneDir: i already have new one Just want to make this work
[2023-11-28T16:07:53] sombre_enfant: No LinkedIn moment
[2023-11-28T16:10:28] puneDir: what?
[2023-11-28T16:30:44] Basti: <photos/photo_11245@28-11-2023_16-30-44.jpg>
[2023-11-28T16:31:03] Basti: Has anyone ever had this error and knows how to fix it?
[2023-11-28T16:38:32] haku: i agree. i want want to try becauese nickel plafe doesnt oxididize
[2023-11-28T17:27:29] sombre_enfant: Put slow down abs
[2023-11-28T17:37:13] sombre_enfant: Dont worry it just slow it it dont remove it
[2023-11-28T17:42:05] Happy Giraffe: The whole point of bambulab printers. Whatever its called input shaping. Basically calibrates printer for its resonance in relation to surface its on
[2023-11-28T17:53:13] Mirono escooters: Oh god..
[2023-11-28T17:53:26] Mirono escooters: Such a bad idea on fragile flipskys..
[2023-11-28T17:53:53] sombre_enfant: Its fine brother
[2023-11-28T17:54:03] Mirono escooters: Great gimmick/ fezture
[2023-11-28T17:54:07] Mirono escooters: No..
[2023-11-28T17:54:34] Mirono escooters: Its like the last solution
[2023-11-28T17:54:57] Mirono escooters: Wich power settings you did? Move to vesc help, Problably better help there
[2023-11-28T17:56:44] Mirono escooters: Especially flipsky
[2023-11-28T18:41:47] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/m0fLEgZpvGE?si=tuFAr6th-Z0Hd9kk
[2023-11-28T19:15:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Good idea Always,,you could even sandwich a heatsink from outside ,than more effective just if so ,remove paint under it
[2023-11-28T19:18:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Spit on it first next time😁
[2023-11-28T19:43:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Learnt it from Tony🤣
[2023-11-28T20:59:40] haku: oh. i see thats nuts
[2023-11-28T21:00:33] haku: do you know what contriller they use? far driver?
[2023-11-28T21:18:56] haku: funny i do sing some weird songs too when i ride lol
[2023-11-28T21:28:07] JPPL: I love it
[2023-11-28T21:40:48] JPPL: https://www.ennoid.me/esc/150v-esc
[2023-11-28T21:41:05] JPPL: Small little vesc for 150v
[2023-11-28T21:41:56] JPPL: Small specs overall but Nice to see vesc controllers continue their devlopment
[2023-11-28T21:42:24] JPPL: Amazing small for 30s
[2023-11-28T21:42:24] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-11-28T21:43:23] Mirono escooters: Try to get all your messages into 1 Not 1 after another ;)
[2023-11-28T21:43:36] Mirono escooters: Not much amps tho. But at 30s, still reasonable.
[2023-11-28T21:49:15] JPPL: True almost double The specs on amps. Seems good offer
[2023-11-28T21:49:33] Mirono escooters: I am still debating da spintend sale
[2023-11-28T21:50:50] haku: me too. i told amy i will wait for a bigger discount lol
[2023-11-28T21:51:06] Mirono escooters: Still a pretty good sale But import and the no need hold me back.
[2023-11-28T21:51:53] haku: thats right. import taxes makes it dificult indeed
[2023-11-28T21:52:04] Mirono escooters: Yeah. I guess I'll pass
[2023-11-28T21:52:56] sombre_enfant: Make stock thats how u become a succefull man
[2023-11-28T21:53:28] Mirono escooters: I got enough makerbases to last me 3 years 👀
[2023-11-28T21:54:01] sombre_enfant: Till they burn on first ride randomly
[2023-11-28T21:59:02] Mirono escooters: Mine work fine..
[2023-11-28T21:59:18] Mirono escooters: I'm not a SPintend fan Just a nice price
[2023-11-28T22:03:17] Happy Giraffe: Its the only way to make fast prints without quality losses
[2023-11-28T22:05:15] Happy Giraffe: I noticed motor to do some tiny brr on some rotation if its -10°c in the core. Maybe need to calibrate it near 0 degrees now and use temp comp. Its now calibrated at 22°c
[2023-11-28T22:05:31] Mirono escooters: Thats y I said no fast speess
[2023-11-28T22:11:41] Happy Giraffe: 0
[2023-11-28T22:15:51] Happy Giraffe: Well same quality 2x faster😅
[2023-11-28T22:16:01] Mirono escooters: I like waiting 😁
[2023-11-28T22:21:09] haku: is p1s pretty easy to setup? just open software and print?
[2023-11-28T22:21:47] haku: nice. ill be lazy and just ask you how everything works 😂
[2023-11-28T22:28:11] Happy Giraffe: Should be a nice experience
[2023-11-28T22:29:08] Happy Giraffe: Hmm thats interesting, also my torque sensor doesnt like the cold I guess but so far works ok
[2023-11-28T22:32:45] haku: im still about to set it up. holdays delayed it
[2023-11-28T22:32:56] Gabe Enzo: My motor cuts off sometimes, like why? accept the power im injecting into you and die already
[2023-11-28T22:34:50] haku: and i still have to decorate for christmas 🙈
[2023-11-28T22:53:55] Mirono escooters: What?..
[2023-11-28T22:54:04] Mirono escooters: Batt cutting Motor cant even cut.
[2023-11-28T22:55:32] Gabe Enzo: My batts are so shit haha, the BMS goes crazy cause the voltage drop.
[2023-11-28T22:55:38] Gabe Enzo: It doesn't know what to do
[2023-11-28T22:56:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its crying for more P

[2023-11-28T23:07:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont forget to spit on things if they dont fit😁
[2023-11-28T23:08:43] haku: lol
[2023-11-28T23:10:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am not really into decoration like that ,basically it's not really common here ,but there is a fact of it actually but also that part is a local thingy
[2023-11-28T23:10:27] haku: im about to sell vsett or trade it for that new honda suitecase. im a sucker for hondas
[2023-11-28T23:10:49] haku: i think its out for sale already
[2023-11-28T23:11:50] haku: here its pretty mandatory lol

[2023-11-28T23:13:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Here its a flag 😅 more shit you have outside gives you a multiplier number of how much change they will brake into your house , since you have lot to waste
[2023-11-28T23:13:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's important for them

[2023-11-29T09:36:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, will depend of the track, but I believe you don't have any chance because of tyres x)
[2023-11-29T09:36:49] Jan: Would love to see
[2023-11-29T09:36:59] Face de Pin Sucé: You cannot imagine how much grip we have using slicks 11" over the 10" efire
[2023-11-29T09:37:36] Face de Pin Sucé: The only good thing about the 10" efire is rubber is very softer than the T41 slick and more agile
[2023-11-29T09:37:43] Jan: Ok
[2023-11-29T09:38:06] Jan: Internal code name for Shul controllers

[2023-11-29T09:39:33] Mirono escooters: Discord
[2023-11-29T09:40:06] Face de Pin Sucé: But assuming you are running same tronic as a Rion, 60H motors and 20S battery, you won't win using power, so will be about grip and driving
[2023-11-29T09:40:07] Mirono escooters: I just tell what happened, don't judge anyone But roschee need to be honest and tell whole story 😁
[2023-11-29T09:40:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes but which thread in discord ? X)

[2023-11-29T16:01:58] Mirono escooters: Then just compile msg into 1 Its not that hard. You get used to it It is waaay easier to read chats.
[2023-11-29T16:01:59] Happy Giraffe: India doesnt give a fuk about EU regulations Im afraid etc.
[2023-11-29T16:07:24] Mirono escooters: That's cool

[2023-11-29T16:10:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, it's more complicated x) I have for some controllers, but not all, because when I ask, he busy doing something, they I forget, then I ask again, then busy again, then sometimes send me one x)
[2023-11-29T16:10:38] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-11-29T16:11:02] Happy Giraffe: "Busy" it takes them 1 minute to send?😅
[2023-11-29T16:11:16] Happy Giraffe: Or they don't know how to use computer
[2023-11-29T16:12:17] Happy Giraffe: Seems they like to keep customers at their toes so they are dependant on them🤔
[2023-11-29T16:14:12] Happy Giraffe: Luckily we have competition and no need to buy from them😁
[2023-11-29T16:17:29] Happy Giraffe: Amy better catch up with John
[2023-11-29T16:20:49] Face de Pin Sucé: Can upload to a drive ?

[2023-11-29T16:24:19] Face de Pin Sucé: x) why you can't now ?

[2023-11-29T16:25:05] Mirono escooters: I want one too
[2023-11-29T16:25:51] Face de Pin Sucé: True x)
[2023-11-29T16:28:31] Happy Giraffe: If you want 20kw+ you are kinda pushing the frame a bit😅
[2023-11-29T16:29:29] Happy Giraffe: Dont think so but people have said it starts to bend etc
[2023-11-29T16:30:10] Happy Giraffe: Can you buy a minicross and use that frame?
[2023-11-29T16:30:55] Happy Giraffe: So a 45kmh moped class?
[2023-11-29T16:31:34] Happy Giraffe: Then buy 125cc bike frame and enjoy legal 120kmh😁
[2023-11-29T16:32:36] Happy Giraffe: Move to a new apartment that has an access to garage or door outside on ground floor😅
[2023-11-29T16:32:53] Happy Giraffe: If you heavily mod it, it will be ~70kg anyway
[2023-11-29T16:33:42] Happy Giraffe: Also chains, shocks, wheels everything would need to be upgraded😅
[2023-11-29T16:33:47] Face de Pin Sucé: If you upgrade motor, go for C1000, BTW, upcoming Rage Mechanics motor finally after months of testing :p
[2023-11-29T16:34:19] Face de Pin Sucé: We have already plug and play kit for 700/1000 for Surron, so easier to fit it

[2023-11-29T16:34:52] Face de Pin Sucé: no
[2023-11-29T16:35:13] Face de Pin Sucé: Too lazy to make crap things such as kickstand or those things to work with
[2023-11-29T16:35:58] Face de Pin Sucé: basically, you have throttle, key contactor and battery that works, which is good enough in my opinion
[2023-11-29T16:36:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Then you put SmartDisplay and get real features haha

[2023-11-29T16:37:30] Mirono escooters: I don't want Surron if it only does 20kw
[2023-11-29T16:37:58] Mirono escooters: Sad we can't even transform it into electric legally
[2023-11-29T16:37:59] Happy Giraffe: Propably will burn to dust at continuous 20+ use😂
[2023-11-29T16:38:01] Face de Pin Sucé: yes it's separated
[2023-11-29T16:38:15] Mirono escooters: Bomber eats surron
[2023-11-29T16:38:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, 25KW with mid drive is far more powerful than QS273hub x)
[2023-11-29T16:38:43] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/bQYbBI1K4WQ?si=6Cj-hwiM22X6EhUC
[2023-11-29T16:39:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Not that heavy, yes you can, and you can always remove the battery
[2023-11-29T16:42:32] sombre_enfant: Its 5k here 1/4 of my saving..
[2023-11-29T16:42:58] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't like this kind of comparison because it's not same product at all, but yes
[2023-11-29T16:43:45] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, thats true. Also Stark is not available to buy instantly
[2023-11-29T16:44:16] Happy Giraffe: But James could just buy Stark then and have it already legal and setup tho thats not DIY (+weighs more)
[2023-11-29T16:44:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2023-11-29T16:44:43] Face de Pin Sucé: But not go upstairs with it (I mean he could, but not by carrying it x) )
[2023-11-29T16:44:59] Happy Giraffe: Time to hit the gym bois!
[2023-11-29T16:45:35] Face de Pin Sucé: 110Kg x)
[2023-11-29T16:45:54] Mirono escooters: Atleast my frame doesn't bend
[2023-11-29T16:45:56] Face de Pin Sucé: I can lift 110Kg, doesn't mean I'll go upstairs with it haha
[2023-11-29T16:46:44] Happy Giraffe: I thought it could be legalized, maybe they will do it as an option later
[2023-11-29T16:47:00] Finn: Mhhh
[2023-11-29T16:47:24] Happy Giraffe: Well bike will be much bigger and harder shape to push😂 My bike 37kg😂
[2023-11-29T16:47:27] Mirono escooters: Merika doesn't care anyway
[2023-11-29T16:48:14] Happy Giraffe: There you can go fishing on a beach with AR-15 open carry legally so yeah a Stark Varg aint their top problem😂
[2023-11-29T16:48:54] Mirono escooters: No really. You can just register your e moped as self build.
[2023-11-29T16:49:28] Mirono escooters: Ah.
[2023-11-29T16:49:44] Mirono escooters: Here nothing. Nothing. The legal part is done, but no govment instances actually do it.
[2023-11-29T16:49:47] Mirono escooters: Yk, Belgium stuff.

[2023-11-29T19:55:50] Mirono escooters: Its LifePo4? Or
[2023-11-29T20:03:21] haku: anyone know what pmt tire this is? i cant find this on the site
[2023-11-29T20:03:46] haku: R 6.5 it says
[2023-11-29T20:04:21] haku: also is it a 11 inch or 12?
[2023-11-29T20:05:08] Mirono escooters: Well they handle power But they should sag
[2023-11-29T20:05:16] Mirono escooters: Or he draws 1a xd
[2023-11-29T20:13:47] haku: thanks
[2023-11-29T20:14:11] haku: oh is it custom made for them only?
[2023-11-29T20:18:32] haku: weped use LY motors? i thought thier motors korean made.
[2023-11-29T20:18:49] Face de Pin Sucé: PMT 130 ;)
[2023-11-29T20:19:49] haku: pretty wide tire huh
[2023-11-29T20:20:33] haku: i will not be racing tho. it gets super hot here in the summer. slicks might last a month.
[2023-11-29T20:23:24] haku: like i said i only want burnouts and bitches😁
[2023-11-29T20:26:57] NetworkDir: Bruh you answer 2022 pm lol
[2023-11-29T20:26:58] Mirono escooters: That's a msg from 2022 💀
[2023-11-29T20:27:54] rosheee: omg
[2023-11-29T20:28:14] NetworkDir: Expensive and looks unreliable cells
[2023-11-29T20:28:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Man WTF x)
[2023-11-29T20:28:41] NetworkDir: xD
[2023-11-29T20:28:58] rosheee: XD IDK WHYX IT SEND ME BACK TO 2022

[2023-11-29T20:31:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Rose is so powerful ❤️
[2023-11-29T20:57:40] NetworkDir: What
[2023-11-29T20:57:47] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_11267@29-11-2023_20-57-47.jpg>
[2023-11-29T20:58:13] NetworkDir: 20$ 3.7V 40Ah 80A discharge and 2000 cycle? 😐
[2023-11-29T20:58:23] haku: wow!
[2023-11-29T20:58:37] Paolo ⁭: Power density is worse, also weight worse, it's normal
[2023-11-29T20:58:41] haku: where from?
[2023-11-29T20:59:04] NetworkDir: Well, the only problem is its weight?
[2023-11-29T20:59:12] NetworkDir: or unreliable data
[2023-11-29T20:59:20] Paolo ⁭: And size
[2023-11-29T20:59:47] NetworkDir: But spec and price very nice if weight and size not mater
[2023-11-29T20:59:56] NetworkDir: Looks good for big frames
[2023-11-29T20:59:58] Paolo ⁭: And it's unsafer , cylindrical cells are more resistant to impact
[2023-11-29T21:00:06] Paolo ⁭: Technically yes
[2023-11-29T21:00:08] haku: that would fit perfect on a bomber frame yea? 20s
[2023-11-29T21:00:18] NetworkDir: Hahaha teverun says no burn and explode with this cells
[2023-11-29T21:00:59] Paolo ⁭: The One which don't burn is the blade cell, not this one
[2023-11-29T21:01:22] haku: those are the cells on tevuruns?
[2023-11-29T21:01:27] haku: pouch?
[2023-11-29T21:01:33] NetworkDir: So blade cells are safe and can give high currents?
[2023-11-29T21:01:52] Paolo ⁭: Blade cell Is lifepo4
[2023-11-29T21:02:03] NetworkDir: Hmm yes lifepo4 safe
[2023-11-29T21:02:05] Paolo ⁭: Also since there's no test , I still don't trust it
[2023-11-29T21:02:11] Paolo ⁭: I mean SK
[2023-11-29T21:02:56] NetworkDir: But i see on youtube stupid guy shunted 7260r controllers and draw 20-25kW with stock cells and no voltage drops
[2023-11-29T21:05:09] Paolo ⁭: And so? Don't mean it don't catches fire I mean the blade cells if you drill it , the cell don't catches fire. If you try with normal lion of lipo cell it will explode + 500C
[2023-11-29T21:05:56] NetworkDir: No, I don't mean that they are safe. The fact that they have a high discharge and no voltage drop makes them pass others easily in races
[2023-11-29T21:06:05] Paolo ⁭: https://youtu.be/CGQwqWqzkNA?feature=shared
[2023-11-29T21:06:09] Paolo ⁭: Look the difference
[2023-11-29T21:07:17] NetworkDir: interesting
[2023-11-29T21:08:29] haku: wow the first one look like dodgecoin prices in 2020. where do you buy these cells?
[2023-11-29T21:09:11] Paolo ⁭: Lol only because of Elon's manipulation
[2023-11-29T21:10:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Do you have link of video ? And also of the cells ?
[2023-11-29T21:10:39] NetworkDir: w8
[2023-11-29T21:11:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Do you think we can charge up to how many C for less than a minute ?
[2023-11-29T21:12:11] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm looking for very powerful battery, only for charging it very hard but for peaks less than a minute x)
[2023-11-29T21:13:57] NetworkDir: Race Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8WeHd_IN3Y&t=402s
[2023-11-29T21:14:50] NetworkDir: Teverun Blade Cells Owner says: 72v 60a blade spk cell 15c 900A max discharged
[2023-11-29T21:14:50] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_11269@29-11-2023_21-14-50.jpg>
[2023-11-29T21:15:15] NetworkDir: And on air top speed
[2023-11-29T21:28:35] puneDir: this means nothing
[2023-11-29T21:29:02] puneDir: it just pulls less than 1a on air
[2023-11-29T21:29:47] puneDir: yeye 900a 👍👍👍 try to run that from that cables They will start to shake
[2023-11-29T21:30:36] JPPL: Very good
[2023-11-29T21:35:04] Paolo ⁭: Yes 900a with stock controller😂😂
[2023-11-29T21:36:52] Paolo ⁭: But obviously, 60Ah of battery, you've also much discharge
[2023-11-29T21:37:04] Paolo ⁭: Same performance you can do if you do 60ah with molicel
[2023-11-29T21:37:47] NetworkDir: XD some bullshits
[2023-11-29T21:38:36] NetworkDir: Yep but looks 60ah molicel bigger size and weight maybe
[2023-11-29T21:38:42] NetworkDir: And more $ i think
[2023-11-29T21:39:13] NetworkDir: 60000/4200 = 14.28571429
[2023-11-29T21:41:32] NetworkDir: 20s14p 280 cells 630A peak discharge (Just 15kg) 280*6 euro = 1680 euro
[2023-11-29T21:41:33] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. NetworkDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-11-29T21:49:09] haku: how do you fit that on a scooter?
[2023-11-29T21:49:44] NetworkDir: it's teverun superme 7260r stock cells
[2023-11-29T21:49:49] NetworkDir: not my photo
[2023-11-29T21:50:12] haku: oh wow. i did not know some scooters use pouch cells.
[2023-11-29T21:51:38] JPPL: Just This new One and Russians i think
[2023-11-29T21:55:41] JPPL: My first Blade Kelly powered
[2023-11-29T21:58:16] haku: i really like the look of the tevurns/blade.
[2023-11-29T21:59:02] haku: i never see those here.
[2023-11-29T22:31:56] Кирилл: 11" 130 width
[2023-11-29T22:41:28] francois schempers: i can make stock xiaomi go 100km/h on air x)
[2023-11-29T22:42:31] Unknown: What dis stik
[2023-11-29T23:17:15] Mirono escooters: Reinforcement
[2023-11-29T23:18:27] Yamal: Kelly 7212 or 7218..?
[2023-11-29T23:31:35] Unknown: Good idea
[2023-11-29T23:46:40] NetworkDir: <video_file>
[2023-11-29T23:51:53] Face de Pin Sucé: But do we know for charging ?
[2023-11-29T23:55:51] haku: is it safe to mount the caliper bracket like this? on the outside?
[2023-11-29T23:56:20] Кирилл: Owner says 15C or factory that created cells?
[2023-11-29T23:57:33] haku: my mind is saying that motor will rip that caliper off
[2023-11-29T23:57:35] NetworkDir: Owner say 900A😂
[2023-11-29T23:58:11] NetworkDir: Owner iq is shunt teverun 7260r controller
[2023-11-29T23:58:30] Кирилл: They will be destroyed very soon with 15C, only 1p
[2023-11-29T23:58:37] Кирилл: Their max discharge is 8C
[2023-11-29T23:59:04] NetworkDir: And don’t know smd shunt resistors He shunt with soldering iron without measuring
[2023-11-29T23:59:05] NetworkDir: Lol
[2023-11-29T23:59:12] Face de Pin Sucé: And about charging ? How much C ?
[2023-11-29T23:59:44] NetworkDir: So 60*3=180 Max 180A continus
[2023-11-30T00:00:12] NetworkDir: Sure
[2023-11-30T00:00:16] Кирилл: Molicel or high discharge cells like 40T will give more continuous current at same capacity than pouch
[2023-11-30T00:00:44] haku: but my body is telling me yeah
[2023-11-30T00:01:10] Кирилл: And it will be safer alot than pouch cells
[2023-11-30T00:01:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Me I'm saying WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING WITH SHITTIEST ZOOM BRAKES
[2023-11-30T00:01:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Especially running those motors
[2023-11-30T00:01:23] Face de Pin Sucé: x)
[2023-11-30T00:01:51] Face de Pin Sucé: And about charging?
[2023-11-30T00:02:04] haku: lol. just for now. gatehering parts from the vesc lords recomendations
[2023-11-30T00:02:50] haku: what is the recomendation then magura?
[2023-11-30T00:02:51] Mirono escooters: Stopping distance of those zoom calipers: eventually.
[2023-11-30T00:02:55] Кирилл: 1C usually max
[2023-11-30T00:03:26] Mirono escooters: Many better exist Magura always ok Or Shimano (saint)
[2023-11-30T00:03:31] Mirono escooters: Or those expensive ones I forgot the name Or if you want 3mm disk: Kotto (more motorbike brakes but whatever) Or hope if you richie
[2023-11-30T00:03:36] Кирилл: So 1 hour of charging and destroying any outlets in a city
[2023-11-30T00:03:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Go for Hope Tech4 V4
[2023-11-30T00:03:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Damn
[2023-11-30T00:04:00] Face de Pin Sucé: That's shit
[2023-11-30T00:04:03] haku: im thinking shimano too. just in my budget
[2023-11-30T00:04:05] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't want kt
[2023-11-30T00:04:06] Face de Pin Sucé: It
[2023-11-30T00:04:22] Mirono escooters: Shimano is Really price quality
[2023-11-30T00:04:26] haku: i will look that up
[2023-11-30T00:04:28] Face de Pin Sucé: I need something capable to take 250-300A charging for like a minute
[2023-11-30T00:04:48] Face de Pin Sucé: But for Budget, Shimano Saints yes
[2023-11-30T00:04:59] Mirono escooters: Mmmmmm. Debatable.. My SK pouch cells are really energy dense and do good power
[2023-11-30T00:05:05] Face de Pin Sucé: You did wrong x)
[2023-11-30T00:05:16] haku: i will check it out
[2023-11-30T00:05:29] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm your savior
[2023-11-30T00:06:04] Mirono escooters: That's a thing
[2023-11-30T00:06:31] haku: thank you vesc lords
[2023-11-30T00:06:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Do you guys have an idea ?
[2023-11-30T00:07:24] Кирилл: Thats why a lot of electric hypercars still use cylindrical cells form factor
[2023-11-30T00:07:25] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11273@30-11-2023_00-07-25.jpg>
[2023-11-30T00:07:25] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11274@30-11-2023_00-07-25.jpg>
[2023-11-30T00:07:34] Mirono escooters: 3mm stainless steel helps xD
[2023-11-30T00:09:28] Mirono escooters: I just love the pouch cells for the easyness. But hard to fit in anything not normal, and yes safety.
[2023-11-30T00:09:44] Mirono escooters: That's why we pot the stainless box full of epoxy. Its the best we can do. I trust it
[2023-11-30T01:58:26] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/HLvCxYtyu-w?si=AMeM5VIaOXrTMWiv
[2023-11-30T01:58:42] haku: is this brand the brembo of bikes?
[2023-11-30T02:37:58] cihan: Do you have a recommendation for spot welder under 40 USD? I'll probably buy one from aliexpress.
[2023-11-30T03:48:24] haku: i Hope i can afford them hehe
[2023-11-30T03:54:18] haku: there is the red capacitor based spot welder. i forgot what it was but pretty good reviews once modded.
[2023-11-30T03:54:44] haku: im sure the vesc lords know what im talking about
[2023-11-30T05:56:39] Unknown: Did you sort this out?
[2023-11-30T06:42:29] Basti: no unfortunately not yet i didn't have time why can you help
[2023-11-30T06:52:05] Unknown: When doing "Setup Motor FOC", the motor configurations will be set to default, the Slow ABS current limit is default false. After the motor FOC setup, we may need to set back the "Slow Abs Current Limit" to True.
[2023-11-30T06:56:37] Unknown: Also lowering my adc ramping time helped me these are what solved the abs over current issues for me.
[2023-11-30T07:23:58] Yamal: https://youtu.be/aUa5AnP3PnA?si=i-wZhxH22LnjV_Bt
[2023-11-30T07:28:58] haku: 100v very nice!
[2023-11-30T07:29:31] haku: is the rion 10" or 11"
[2023-11-30T07:35:51] Yamal: 11”
[2023-11-30T07:44:27] Yamal: I have tested the Rion at 100v with the tronic 250r and it is spectacular! I always say it, it's the perfect toy, you don't need anything else! now with the new tronic...😂
[2023-11-30T08:12:10] haku: very cool. ive never seen one in person must be really awsome
[2023-11-30T08:13:10] haku: its a unicorn scoot
[2023-11-30T08:14:22] Jan: Please send any content of it moving. Nobody has ever seen a Rion moving faster than 0kmh in a video outside of a commercial ever
[2023-11-30T08:20:32] cihan: Should I stay away from battery and transistor spot welders?
[2023-11-30T08:37:36] Jesús: Here I pass some videos of my Rion ready working perfectly.
[2023-11-30T08:37:36] Jesús: <video_file>
[2023-11-30T08:38:08] Jesús: <video_file>
[2023-11-30T08:40:09] Jesús: Thanks to @roscheeee for helping me

[2023-11-30T08:49:27] haku: you have nice roads. where is this?
[2023-11-30T08:51:16] Jesús: Spain
[2023-11-30T08:52:25] haku: how fast does these scooters get if you dont mind me asking? is it 100v?
[2023-11-30T08:53:19] Jesús: Correct, it’s 100v
[2023-11-30T08:53:54] haku: very nice! and its full aluminum frame?
[2023-11-30T08:54:25] Jesús: No, mine is full carbon.
[2023-11-30T08:55:38] haku: wow. dam. what model is that. seriously never seen one. maybe in LA theres a few.
[2023-11-30T08:57:10] haku: its american made scoot yea?
[2023-11-30T09:00:56] Gabe Enzo: where did you get those cells from
[2023-11-30T09:01:23] Face de Pin Sucé: I would say Trickstuff are the Brembo of bikes
[2023-11-30T09:01:46] Gabe Enzo: Lipo only bro
[2023-11-30T09:02:46] Jan: He spent a lot of work with tronic controllers
[2023-11-30T09:02:59] Jan: We blew a lot to test where the limits are
[2023-11-30T09:03:44] Jan: Never energy density
[2023-11-30T09:03:59] haku: i just googled it jeez
[2023-11-30T09:03:59] Gabe Enzo: Huh? wdym
[2023-11-30T09:04:23] Jan: Top of the line performance brake, not the best but insane for the price
[2023-11-30T09:05:02] Jan: <animation>
[2023-11-30T09:05:27] Jan: This disc is still working fine after this without bending
[2023-11-30T09:05:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Of course we did, I even have ridden two x)
[2023-11-30T09:05:55] haku: do they do well in the track?
[2023-11-30T09:06:02] Jan: Caliper was over 800°C
[2023-11-30T09:06:06] Jan: Disc even warmer
[2023-11-30T09:06:14] Jan: Caliper demagnetized
[2023-11-30T09:06:41] Face de Pin Sucé: No haha
[2023-11-30T09:06:49] haku: lol dam no warping?
[2023-11-30T09:06:52] Face de Pin Sucé: One of the worst on track
[2023-11-30T09:06:55] Jan: You can store less energy per volume than li-ion
[2023-11-30T09:07:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Carbon châssis isn't rigid at all, 140mm brake discs ...
[2023-11-30T09:08:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Rion Thrust 21S was only 116Kmh top speed, and the whole frame was like chewing-gum, vibrating
[2023-11-30T09:08:58] Face de Pin Sucé: It's been tested on a karting track, the owner stopped after 3 laps, because no brakes anymore, thanks to Magura shit 140mm discs 😂
[2023-11-30T09:09:08] haku: oh. lol
[2023-11-30T09:09:09] Jan: ^^
[2023-11-30T09:09:25] Face de Pin Sucé: RE90 was very on/off in power
[2023-11-30T09:09:44] haku: what size rotors are ideal for track cooling wise? 160
[2023-11-30T09:09:54] Jan: People underestimate structural carbon fiber design and fail doing proper FEA
[2023-11-30T09:10:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh yes Magura have magnetized calipers, which is amazing until you overheat the thing x)
[2023-11-30T09:10:25] haku: i am also wondering when carbon cracks must be hard to fix
[2023-11-30T09:10:35] Gabe Enzo: No no, lipo only for ultracharging.
[2023-11-30T09:10:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, you know much more than me on this, but I think you get what I describe
[2023-11-30T09:10:45] Gabe Enzo: can charge at 10c minimum
[2023-11-30T09:10:48] Gabe Enzo: charger is the limiter
[2023-11-30T09:11:03] Jan: Lipo are for fast discharge and charge but trade off in energy density
[2023-11-30T09:11:06] Face de Pin Sucé: 160 is the minimum yes, and 3mm thickness at least
[2023-11-30T09:11:16] Jan: You will get not even half the range with the same volume
[2023-11-30T09:11:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah I guess that's the only way for md
[2023-11-30T09:12:33] Gabe Enzo: Kind of. The more output they have, the more volume it is the less C output, the more compact 21700/18650 is like the middle ground
[2023-11-30T09:13:17] Gabe Enzo: 5000mah 1c pouch is so different than 5000mah 20c, triple in size (20c)
[2023-11-30T09:14:56] Jan: If i have a finite space and want the max range, i will put in a li ion
[2023-11-30T09:15:16] Jan: If i want big power burst capability then lipo banks
[2023-11-30T09:15:56] Jan: On scooters it doesnt make much sense for lipo tbh. And now with the potential new Li Ion Eve cells maybe even less so
[2023-11-30T09:16:10] Jan: No warping
[2023-11-30T09:17:30] Mirono escooters: China special delivery
[2023-11-30T09:26:50] haku: i really hope those eve cells are real specs.
[2023-11-30T09:27:23] Jan: Tbh i dont believe it yet, it sounds to good to be true
[2023-11-30T09:27:55] Jan: Usually the average improvement of cells was less than 10% and here now from nowhere a 120% improvement
[2023-11-30T11:14:17] Newuser G: Hi guys Can anyone measure exactly this wheelbase on original G30 battery? I need for build a controller case, but I sell battery 🫤
[2023-11-30T11:20:16] Alin Ciobanu: ti conviene chiedere nel gruppo g30, https://t.me/G30ItaliaFanclub you should ask in the g30 group, https://t.me/G30ItaliaFanclub
[2023-11-30T11:22:44] Newuser G: Provo
[2023-11-30T11:22:45] Newuser G: Grazie
[2023-11-30T11:35:58] Unknown: Would this reinforcement prevent folding and does it fits for zero too ?
[2023-11-30T12:07:43] Jan: A lol bar
[2023-11-30T12:09:20] JPPL: Its just a bar from motobikes adapted, there are better mods but i feel it eliminates some pressuare overall só i just keept it. No easy folding but possible
[2023-11-30T12:10:07] JPPL: 7212
[2023-11-30T12:32:26] Jan: I didnt read yet into the process, is there any link?
[2023-11-30T12:40:30] JPPL: To much flexible
[2023-11-30T12:42:40] Mirono escooters: Where they share how they make
[2023-11-30T12:51:22] Mirono escooters: Hm
[2023-11-30T13:05:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Guys, what Lipos do you recommend to charge at around 20-25C peak for 1minute max ?
[2023-11-30T13:43:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why
[2023-11-30T13:44:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They are measuring specialists?
[2023-11-30T13:44:42] Alin Ciobanu: There was no one at the time
[2023-11-30T13:47:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And did he get the info?
[2023-11-30T14:07:55] Mirono escooters: Cnhl 🥰
[2023-11-30T14:24:11] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-11-30T15:38:40] Unknown: What is the benefits of using lipo instead of lithium ion and what are the disadvantages ?
[2023-11-30T15:40:55] Face de Pin Sucé: PoWer
[2023-11-30T15:41:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Thank you, didn't knew this brand
[2023-11-30T15:46:20] Unknown: And size ? Price ?
[2023-11-30T15:47:36] Unknown: Safeness?
[2023-11-30T15:48:10] Jhinzuo ~~: If you have them in a enclosure kinda safe
[2023-11-30T15:48:32] Jhinzuo ~~: Power density is a disadvantage
[2023-11-30T15:50:32] puneDir: Anybody got dead mosfet 75100 alupcb to sell? Gonna get shipped to turkey
[2023-11-30T15:53:29] puneDir: im going to get some ubox
[2023-11-30T16:16:09] Mirono escooters: Not as safe, expensive, diff disch curve
[2023-11-30T16:16:15] Mirono escooters: Benefit energy density, power
[2023-11-30T16:20:51] Mirono escooters: It has no lost spots like cilindrical cells.
[2023-11-30T16:21:00] Mirono escooters: You can stack em efficiently
[2023-11-30T16:23:45] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-11-30T16:31:44] Mirono escooters: What.
[2023-11-30T16:50:21] Gabe Enzo: You don't need logic to realize this really.
[2023-11-30T16:50:36] Gabe Enzo: It's more efficient at space than honeycomb.
[2023-11-30T16:51:33] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-11-30T16:51:35] Gabe Enzo: Haha right, the enclosure expands usually, leading to them popping. Better to have a space they can breathe, a little bit of foam in the enclosures But yes u need enclosure because one dent and they blow

[2023-11-30T18:19:31] sombre_enfant: U doing ubox return scam with a makerbase ? 🤣
[2023-11-30T18:20:25] puneDir: what
[2023-11-30T18:31:17] Mirono escooters: But we are comparing apples and pears
[2023-11-30T18:31:31] Mirono escooters: Or well, I am. I was talking cilindrical li ion vs lipo pouch
[2023-11-30T18:32:20] Gabe Enzo: Btw they make cylinder lipo haha
[2023-11-30T18:32:27] Mirono escooters: Y tho
[2023-11-30T18:33:06] Gabe Enzo: Haha Idk, ask hobbywing
[2023-11-30T18:33:14] Mirono escooters: Mb
[2023-11-30T18:33:14] Gabe Enzo: For lasers I think
[2023-11-30T18:33:39] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2023-11-30T18:33:57] Mirono escooters: Yes, need compression usually
[2023-11-30T18:34:02] Mirono escooters: Even li ion Pouch
[2023-11-30T18:34:30] Gabe Enzo: That would be some good honeycomb
[2023-11-30T18:34:30] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-30T18:35:02] Gabe Enzo: The cylinder lipos would also have more puff ability
[2023-11-30T18:35:10] Gabe Enzo: Safer
[2023-11-30T18:43:41] Кирилл: Still using 4mm² phase wires, really?
[2023-11-30T19:06:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I like lion pouch idea ,but F Soon we going to build ATV and small cars
[2023-11-30T19:07:04] Mirono escooters: I love my li ion pouch
[2023-11-30T19:09:08] Omaid: How do companies take a HW R4830 PSU which has a 52v output and make them do up to 152v ?
[2023-11-30T19:11:26] Happy Giraffe: LiPo that doesnt randomly want to burn after 300 cycles would be nice😂
[2023-11-30T19:11:58] Happy Giraffe: Lmao QS motors "1kw" rated mid drive motor is 6mm2
[2023-11-30T19:13:19] Happy Giraffe: I bet I could 3D print stronger frame out of CF-Nylon😂
[2023-11-30T19:15:51] Кирилл: Segway gt2 motor "1.5kw" (at 14s) 4mm² winding also and 10awg (5.2mm²) phase cables. Already more than rions wtf
[2023-11-30T19:20:20] JPPL: Strange
[2023-11-30T19:21:55] puneDir: How to isolate canbus
[2023-11-30T20:10:11] Mirono escooters: Bwuh
[2023-11-30T20:10:19] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-11-30T20:10:30] Mirono escooters: Rion moment
[2023-11-30T20:13:54] Gabe Enzo: Guys, the Mac 6.02 and 6.05 version is totally fucked, I found out. It was the reason of the "Alzheimer issue" @punedir I just got a new Asus laptop, I'll install vesc tool on it, and I'll finally be able to use my shit properly.
[2023-11-30T20:14:22] Gabe Enzo: First time ever bought a windows.
[2023-11-30T20:16:38] Happy Giraffe: Get dual boot windows with mac?
[2023-11-30T20:16:54] Gabe Enzo: It's fine, I just got my laptop for school 😂

[2023-11-30T20:18:03] Gabe Enzo: Just pointing out there is an absolute issue with Mac vesc tool, for the unsuspecting souls.
[2023-11-30T20:19:27] Happy Giraffe: I never even used it😁 Always had it on windows even on mac
[2023-11-30T20:51:23] haku: dumb question but does thicker phase wires really make a difference? i know it will heat up less but power to the motor wise, will it affect it?
[2023-11-30T20:53:02] Кирилл: Ofc it does
[2023-11-30T20:54:18] Paolo ⁭: Heat mean lost power .
[2023-11-30T20:54:28] Paolo ⁭: More it heat, more power you waste
[2023-11-30T20:54:53] haku: okay. just wanted to know. the new motors i got have big phase wires. i was thinking it might be too much.
[2023-11-30T20:55:48] haku: ty.
[2023-11-30T20:55:49] Paolo ⁭: Resistance cause voltage drop, so yeah you're slower if it heat mich
[2023-11-30T20:56:12] haku: i see. thanks.
[2023-11-30T20:59:42] Simone: Ready for a boost 💪💪💪💪

[2023-11-30T21:03:14] haku: dayum. what esc?
[2023-11-30T21:03:46] haku: 20s4p can do 400a?
[2023-11-30T21:03:55] Simone: only a little 75100 cooled
[2023-11-30T21:04:06] haku: awsome
[2023-11-30T21:04:20] Simone: every cell have 100A instant current
[2023-11-30T21:04:48] Simone: but only some seconds
[2023-11-30T21:05:00] haku: i did not know that. thanks

[2023-11-30T21:29:02] Gabe Enzo: Y'all remake your packs after each year or something?
[2023-11-30T21:29:12] Gabe Enzo: I think I'll be getting Samsung 48X LOL
[2023-11-30T21:29:51] Gabe Enzo: this can't be right, right???
[2023-11-30T21:30:05] Mirono escooters: You charge.. twice a day?..
[2023-11-30T21:30:21] Gabe Enzo: lmao like 3 but that's just me rn
[2023-11-30T21:30:29] Gabe Enzo: Like once a day I guess
[2023-11-30T21:30:35] Mirono escooters: A: almost no one does B: then you still got 80% capacity left C: lower charge amps for longer life
[2023-11-30T21:30:52] Mirono escooters: 4a charging is, quite high.
[2023-11-30T21:31:00] Mirono escooters: I charge every week 💀
[2023-11-30T21:31:29] Mirono escooters: Some have higher cycle But bwah
[2023-11-30T21:31:33] Gabe Enzo: so the bigger pack you make the slower it degrades
[2023-11-30T21:31:34] Mirono escooters: Overthinking
[2023-11-30T21:31:37] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-30T21:32:32] Mirono escooters: Tru xD
[2023-11-30T21:32:38] Mirono escooters: Variables 😭

[2023-11-30T21:37:07] Gabe Enzo: I still don't know how they mix 100 cells and it doesn't blow up
[2023-11-30T21:37:34] Gabe Enzo: That's what I thought.
[2023-11-30T21:37:38] Gabe Enzo: thanks for clarifying
[2023-11-30T21:40:27] Mirono escooters: And wich is dat
[2023-11-30T21:40:36] Mirono escooters: By doing it properly
[2023-11-30T21:41:18] Gabe Enzo: Samsung 48x
[2023-11-30T21:42:36] Happy Giraffe: I consider 0.3C charging quite fast, guess I have patience then😂
[2023-11-30T21:43:14] Simone: copper is not more better
[2023-11-30T21:45:31] Mirono escooters: XD

[2023-11-30T21:47:53] Simone: i don't like copper
[2023-11-30T21:49:01] Simone: not easy to weld and so expensive, and not more better than nickel
[2023-11-30T21:49:50] Simone: plated or pure ?
[2023-11-30T21:50:02] Mirono escooters: Its way way better
[2023-11-30T21:50:08] Mirono escooters: Did you forget math and resistance
[2023-11-30T21:50:42] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-30T21:50:45] Mirono escooters: Maybe he confuse w that

[2023-11-30T21:55:25] haku: this is what i noticed too from ali. copper is more affordable
[2023-11-30T21:56:31] haku: problem is spot welder for it is 3x more $$
[2023-11-30T21:56:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Best is black everything for that
[2023-11-30T21:59:11] Mirono escooters: My S helmet is just too small

[2023-11-30T21:59:41] Gabe Enzo: easy to weld tho right?
[2023-11-30T21:59:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2023-11-30T22:00:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Add Another S
[2023-11-30T22:00:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🙈😂😂😂
[2023-11-30T22:00:18] Mirono escooters: I got this one
[2023-11-30T22:00:21] Mirono escooters: I'm being responsible
[2023-11-30T22:00:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But what you mean by that
[2023-11-30T22:00:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean S size?
[2023-11-30T22:01:25] Gabe Enzo: would it not be easier to just use copper strip to weld cells, rather than copper sheets?
[2023-11-30T22:02:04] Gabe Enzo: It would have the same design as nickel welded cells
[2023-11-30T22:03:05] Gabe Enzo: Ah, right, as the only way the current really flows through is through those weld points
[2023-11-30T22:03:09] Gabe Enzo: True
[2023-11-30T22:03:33] Mirono escooters: And cutted strips are more €
[2023-11-30T22:03:36] Mirono escooters: So win win for sheet
[2023-11-30T22:03:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hands on the waist ,kinda gives dissappointed feeling,but i could say differently But no offense with it
[2023-11-30T22:03:51] Mirono escooters: Non, you have more material with sheet
[2023-11-30T22:03:59] Mirono escooters: If spotwelded Fine, u use whole cell top
[2023-11-30T22:04:17] Gabe Enzo: If I only am gonna pull like 7-9kw I don't need copper no? or like sheets
[2023-11-30T22:04:34] Gabe Enzo: Like, low amps, not like zuna amps
[2023-11-30T22:05:15] Gabe Enzo: To be honest it would seem as if the wide sheet method is extremely uncomfortable to weld.
[2023-11-30T22:05:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont forget hell 😅
[2023-11-30T22:05:44] Mirono escooters: Depends wich pack, wich layout wich everything
[2023-11-30T22:06:08] Mirono escooters: I was kidding, wasn't meant as a cool photo
[2023-11-30T22:06:16] Mirono escooters: Just a "look I'm being cautionaus"
[2023-11-30T22:06:30] Gabe Enzo: Molicel specifically. and yes I'll be doing external too, (I hear it's unsafe as bla bla bla don't remember) @Mirono_escooters
[2023-11-30T22:07:07] Gabe Enzo: Apparently the external cell part doesn't discharge equally or something, I find that hard to believe haha
[2023-11-30T22:07:39] Gabe Enzo: If you don't use cell holders then yes, but most ppl use them, and the holders are taller than the cells.
[2023-11-30T22:09:29] Gabe Enzo: No need for holders tbh, waste of space
[2023-11-30T22:09:41] Gabe Enzo: Never used them when making packs
[2023-11-30T22:11:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure you look cauntionaus 🤔
[2023-11-30T22:11:46] puneDir: what h is kaabo wwx motor
[2023-11-30T22:12:06] puneDir: For 100 euro
[2023-11-30T22:12:29] haku: ask @PaoloWu
[2023-11-30T22:12:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You give 100 euro for the answer? Just to see the question clear
[2023-11-30T22:12:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont fuck up business 😅🤣🤣🤣
[2023-11-30T22:14:53] puneDir: yes
[2023-11-30T22:17:12] Кирилл: oh yea, its mine place then😂
[2023-11-30T22:17:44] Gabe Enzo: Your workshop is literally my room but I have a bed
[2023-11-30T22:18:16] haku: same haha
[2023-11-30T22:18:30] puneDir: ok now i finally have good motor
[2023-11-30T22:19:01] Gabe Enzo: what one?
[2023-11-30T22:19:57] puneDir: kaabo(?) Wolf warrior x motor
[2023-11-30T22:21:35] haku: you gonna make it fit?
[2023-11-30T22:22:27] Gabe Enzo: what wattage
[2023-11-30T22:22:31] haku: tell me how you do it. im too lazy to think of how.
[2023-11-30T22:27:15] Gabe Enzo: Whats the most speed (with no heat issues) someone has achieved here with an 800-1000w motor? and how much KW was used?
[2023-11-30T22:27:30] Gabe Enzo: I'm really aiming for 75 and I hope that's possible with my weight.
[2023-11-30T22:30:49] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11289@30-11-2023_22-30-49.jpg>

[2023-11-30T22:30:51] Mirono escooters: Speed is off
[2023-11-30T22:31:00] Paolo ⁭: It's good motor
[2023-11-30T22:31:43] puneDir: whats the max speed of it with 72v
[2023-11-30T22:34:31] haku: what vesc is that on your bomber?
[2023-11-30T22:36:55] Paolo ⁭: Pure

[2023-11-30T22:38:43] NetworkDir: Rim
[2023-11-30T22:38:50] NetworkDir: Jant kapak
[2023-11-30T22:38:50] puneDir: Outer rim?
[2023-11-30T22:40:02] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_11294@30-11-2023_22-40-02.jpg>
[2023-11-30T22:40:46] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_11295@30-11-2023_22-40-46.jpg>
[2023-11-30T22:41:29] Mirono escooters: Mp2
[2023-11-30T22:41:32] Gabe Enzo: mp2
[2023-11-30T22:42:04] Gabe Enzo: why didn't I see that
[2023-11-30T22:42:10] Mirono escooters: Btw the super cheap Bluetooth kept recording through all that and 300a @PaoloWu Maybe you had bad batch.
[2023-11-30T22:43:11] Paolo ⁭: Makerbase 75200 is worse than mp2
[2023-11-30T22:43:18] Paolo ⁭: Maybe controller problem
[2023-11-30T22:43:26] Paolo ⁭: Normal ble don't fail
[2023-11-30T22:43:28] Mirono escooters: Prolly
[2023-11-30T22:43:34] Mirono escooters: Yes but speed is off.
[2023-11-30T22:44:15] Mirono escooters: And I'm not hitting max batt amps Nor duty Suggestions are welcome
[2023-11-30T22:44:36] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2023-11-30T22:44:40] Mirono escooters: That's most likely it
[2023-11-30T22:44:50] Mirono escooters: But I couldn't fuckin scroll BCS bug
[2023-11-30T22:45:12] Paolo ⁭: Why motor temperature does that?
[2023-11-30T22:45:22] Mirono escooters: Idonno
[2023-11-30T22:45:37] Mirono escooters: I wonder if it is Where I check my S count setting
[2023-11-30T22:45:38] Gabe Enzo: what's the name of that temp sensor again?
[2023-11-30T22:45:42] Gabe Enzo: I've forgotten
[2023-11-30T22:45:44] Mirono escooters: 68v cutoff limit start Hm
[2023-11-30T22:45:54] NetworkDir: Ntc
[2023-11-30T22:46:04] Gabe Enzo: ntc 3000 is it?
[2023-11-30T22:46:26] Paolo ⁭: Doesn't qs using kty or something similar?
[2023-11-30T22:46:27] Mirono escooters: Not like my topspeed was great btw.
[2023-11-30T22:46:30] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11296@30-11-2023_22-46-30.jpg>
[2023-11-30T22:46:33] NetworkDir: Ntc is simple resistance With temperature change just resistance change
[2023-11-30T22:46:41] NetworkDir: Ntc 10k ohm fine for you
[2023-11-30T22:46:41] Mirono escooters: I hitted 93 before So bug But cop car + cold + bug app
[2023-11-30T22:46:50] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-30T22:47:02] Mirono escooters: Ig no filtering on the line Doesn't matter
[2023-11-30T22:47:22] Mirono escooters: But I'm just testing the waters with MP2 Its a good Esc. I had to hit 300a, so I did
[2023-11-30T22:47:46] Gabe Enzo: I mean isnt that how all temp sensors work xd
[2023-11-30T22:49:25] Mirono escooters: I defenitely hitted 3.4v per cell Eh. Guess I go out some later time again.👍
[2023-11-30T22:49:31] Mirono escooters: Ptc exist
[2023-11-30T22:50:40] haku: would NTC 3950b 100k work with vesc?
[2023-11-30T22:51:33] haku: oh dam. mine came with 100k. do i have to change it?
[2023-11-30T22:51:57] Paolo ⁭: Depends by controller you going to use
[2023-11-30T22:52:28] haku: it will be vesc for sure. what vesc can read that probe
[2023-11-30T22:52:55] haku: good to know
[2023-11-30T22:54:09] haku: got it. thanks
[2023-11-30T22:54:35] Simone: i don't have space problem and cells stay more stable and cooled
[2023-11-30T22:54:39] haku: aslong as it will read it.
[2023-11-30T22:57:26] Happy Giraffe: KTY 83 worse for me than NTC so I switched to use that instead
[2023-11-30T22:57:50] Gabe Enzo: why does this have 2 wires. the vesc only has one white wire for the temp sensor.
[2023-11-30T22:58:15] Mirono escooters: Gnd and temp sensor
[2023-11-30T22:58:30] Gabe Enzo: 5v ye?
[2023-11-30T22:58:35] Gabe Enzo: Usually
[2023-11-30T22:58:36] Mirono escooters: If you find electricity that only needs 1 wire, I'm your man
[2023-11-30T22:58:40] Mirono escooters: What????
[2023-11-30T22:58:56] Mirono escooters: Connect 1 to gnd Other to temp sensor pad
[2023-11-30T22:59:25] Gabe Enzo: ground is just black right. There's many ports that have gnd.
[2023-11-30T22:59:48] Gabe Enzo: I can just connect to any one?
[2023-11-30T23:00:11] puneDir: 1 gnd 1 temp sensor
[2023-11-30T23:02:15] Gabe Enzo: AC only needs one phase to power an LED 😂
[2023-11-30T23:02:23] Gabe Enzo: therefore one wire
[2023-11-30T23:02:34] Paolo ⁭: Practically it's possible hahah
[2023-11-30T23:02:56] Mirono escooters: 🤦
[2023-11-30T23:03:04] Mirono escooters: Ok, 1 conductor
[2023-11-30T23:03:16] Paolo ⁭: I mean this lol
[2023-11-30T23:03:24] Gabe Enzo: I'm not wrong! Elektroboom done it
[2023-11-30T23:03:46] Gabe Enzo: I mean sure it's like technically 2 wires but it's in a loop
[2023-11-30T23:03:52] Mirono escooters: Transmit any real power over 1 conductor and I'm your man Had to be more specific
[2023-11-30T23:04:08] Mirono escooters: The electricity travels through it as 2 Or however I explain it
[2023-11-30T23:04:14] Gabe Enzo: I still can't comprehend how AC works
[2023-11-30T23:04:21] Gabe Enzo: Like I know how it works but can't visualize it
[2023-11-30T23:04:24] Mirono escooters: Wait till 3 phase
[2023-11-30T23:04:40] Paolo ⁭: Polarity alternates
[2023-11-30T23:04:54] Paolo ⁭: Hz means how much times it does in one second
[2023-11-30T23:05:00] Gabe Enzo: Then the power would never reach anywhere if it's alternated back and forth. is this a stupid question?
[2023-11-30T23:05:24] Gabe Enzo: ???
[2023-11-30T23:05:25] Paolo ⁭: Induction , 0 wires
[2023-11-30T23:06:00] Paolo ⁭: Yes, very stupid
[2023-11-30T23:06:11] Paolo ⁭: Basically your motor is Ac too
[2023-11-30T23:06:40] Mirono escooters: Worst is I understand his thinking
[2023-11-30T23:06:42] Paolo ⁭: It's called DC because the power source is DC, but since is 3 phase the controller alternates it
[2023-11-30T23:07:05] Gabe Enzo: OK but like with single phase tho. with 3 phase you can obviously visualize the separate phases changing polarity.
[2023-11-30T23:07:23] Gabe Enzo: But with single phase it's... single phase
[2023-11-30T23:07:26] Paolo ⁭: Bro I don't get you
[2023-11-30T23:07:30] Mirono escooters: Move dat to off topic
[2023-11-30T23:07:42] Mirono escooters: Tldr you'll understand someday
[2023-11-30T23:08:17] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters atleast you relate
[2023-11-30T23:08:21] Gabe Enzo: 💀
[2023-11-30T23:09:09] Mirono escooters: I understand where the thinking comes from
[2023-11-30T23:09:12] Mirono escooters: Even if its wrong :)
[2023-11-30T23:29:52] Gabe Enzo: then you're the only one who can explain it to me
[2023-11-30T23:29:58] Gabe Enzo: cause 20 YouTube videos couldn't, and i watcheda couple now too.
[2023-11-30T23:33:58] Mirono escooters: I suck at explaining
[2023-11-30T23:34:02] Mirono escooters: Especially in a foreign language
[2023-11-30T23:34:58] sombre_enfant: U speak néerlandais ?
[2023-11-30T23:35:31] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-30T23:37:24] haku: you guys multi lingual. thats awsome
[2023-11-30T23:39:20] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2023-11-30T23:39:30] Mirono escooters: Hey guys. When I throttle, stop throttling, I get a phase filter error. Any suggestions?
[2023-11-30T23:41:04] Mirono escooters: Kinda
[2023-11-30T23:41:18] Mirono escooters: Mother language and English My french is.. debatable. Really common in Europa to be multi lingual
[2023-11-30T23:42:08] haku: i want to learn deutch. thats german yea?
[2023-11-30T23:50:25] Gabe Enzo: English is also my foreign language.
[2023-11-30T23:50:39] Gabe Enzo: Yes, and it's easy, if you know Polish.
[2023-11-30T23:52:42] haku: unfortunately i do not know any of those languages. im just thinking of using an app like babel to learn it once i have free time
[2023-11-30T23:59:57] Gabe Enzo: Babel/duolingo will help you with the foundation, this process takes about 2-3 months, or less if you're avid. After you become somewhat indeterminate you move on to real language learning textbooks.
[2023-12-01T00:00:06] Gabe Enzo: I'm a linguist so I can like speak on this xd without sounding like a moron
[2023-12-01T00:00:57] Gabe Enzo: I've studied Spanish, Japanese, German etc in excess.
[2023-12-01T00:01:11] Gabe Enzo: German i am super familiar with, I can speak like a 6 year old
[2023-12-01T00:01:14] haku: i see. ill try that
[2023-12-01T00:19:38] Jan: Yes but heat resistance is bad
[2023-12-01T01:16:31] haku: question if a hub motor has not been used for a while does it get seized?
[2023-12-01T01:21:31] cihan: are cheap spot welders all crap ? ı am looking for a spot welder cheaper than 50 USD but options are in general transistor or battery operated ones. Are they all crap ? Is capacitor spot welder a must for a proper spot weld ?
[2023-12-01T01:22:48] cihan: I don't know how thick but I am not going to weld anything too thick since I will never need really high current. 40A battery current is going to be most I will ever need.
[2023-12-01T01:24:56] cihan: By the way I used to get a 150 A JK BMS and I thought I could fit it placing the long edge along the scooter deck but I am not sure now. This thing is really big and the cables on it are 7 AWG. I am not sure if I can bend those 7AWG cables without damaging them.
[2023-12-01T01:25:30] Gabe Enzo: If it's like outside sure
[2023-12-01T01:25:41] Gabe Enzo: it'll rot
[2023-12-01T01:26:55] haku: you can probably resolder to the direction you want
[2023-12-01T01:27:36] haku: im not an expert tho. wait for someone knowledgable to reply
[2023-12-01T01:33:06] cihan: I found a link to the little red spot welder shared here and that little capacitor based spot welder costs 160 USD, it is ecxpensive and I am also not able to order it since it exceeds the allowed amount be customs. I saw many good reviews about the battery operated ones and also about the transistor ones connected to the wall outlet but ı cannot still be sure if they are going to be enough for me.
[2023-12-01T01:34:06] cihan: By the way telegram desktop program is much better and now I can search properly filtering users. It was not possible with the web app .
[2023-12-01T01:34:21] haku: im not an expert on spot welders. im sure you can get the affordable ones but you might have to mod it. wait for the battery lords to answer you
[2023-12-01T01:36:10] cihan: Thank you , I will be waiting for more replies before placing the order. They list really high currents or power on the specs but I don't know how they will be able to suppply such high current without a capacitor and from such a little battery.
[2023-12-01T01:36:13] haku: i dont have telegram desktop and i hear you can get hacked using it. i dont want folks to see me naked. only my onlyfans can 😂 jk
[2023-12-01T01:38:00] cihan: WEb app also displays the text really low resolution. I was always curious if that was because of 1080p monitor and 27 screen but no.
[2023-12-01T01:38:49] cihan: I miss old days when monitors were all 4:3 , it was much better choice for displaying text.
[2023-12-01T01:40:12] haku: ms dos days? lol
[2023-12-01T01:50:52] cihan: I couldn't catch DOS days but Windows 98 and ICQ days were amazing.)
[2023-12-01T02:17:32] JPPL: Ia phase filter on or off?
[2023-12-01T03:42:43] Paolo ⁭: Best hahah
[2023-12-01T03:43:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: Crap
[2023-12-01T03:49:54] haku: thats a fancy grocerry getter
[2023-12-01T05:09:56] haku: where can i get stainless steel cnc made? i might need to reinforce these.
[2023-12-01T05:13:26] haku: does pbc way do it?
[2023-12-01T05:19:20] haku: ive been told these dropouts crack 😭
[2023-12-01T05:50:08] Happy Giraffe: We use battery that doesnt boil😉
[2023-12-01T05:51:22] Jan: The glas transistion temp is 49°C
[2023-12-01T06:04:27] Happy Giraffe: 31 Lower than PETG?😳
[2023-12-01T06:06:32] Jan: PETG has higher glas
[2023-12-01T06:06:44] Jan: About 80°C or so
[2023-12-01T07:57:14] Happy Giraffe: @AJAJ1992 talking about petg, I'm about to try the 27€/kg petg cf from Tinmorry

[2023-12-01T13:04:41] Gabe Enzo: hey guys I have a 20s4p cell here and I am assuming that a pack is failing. How would I go about testing draw? Like I have a high precision discharger so I could use that?? the cells that are weaker should have a lower voltage drop? I'd love to make a 15s or greater with this pack honestly. I COULD also cycle all the cells and see which one is defective in capacity..
[2023-12-01T13:05:51] Gabe Enzo: I'm thinking of putting the newly made cell into my brother's Xiaomi m365.
[2023-12-01T13:20:34] Rose: Hey there Orhan, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2023-12-01T15:28:59] Jan: So then you just need to teach him social interactions, rest will be fine and he will do awesome
[2023-12-01T15:30:06] haku: exactly this.👍
[2023-12-01T15:30:59] Gabe Enzo: I never had to learn tables, I was in awe why the class was taught for years.
[2023-12-01T15:31:28] Gabe Enzo: Expose him to the outside world the autism will have no effect on him except him saying everything literally 😂

[2023-12-01T16:42:15] Mirono escooters: You use his settings?
[2023-12-01T16:42:22] Mirono escooters: I tried, didn't work at all, weird
[2023-12-01T16:44:49] JPPL: Garage, Will join This photos soon :) but its like This:

[2023-12-01T16:52:48] Кирилл: Please dont use these settings. It was done on xiaomi 2.1 pcb version with smartesc fw (vesc fw for xiaomi). And dont use any motor settings from others even you have same escs. You must do your individual detection and tuning
[2023-12-01T16:53:23] puneDir: Anybody got new settings?
[2023-12-01T16:53:48] puneDir: My vesc detects wrong for sure
[2023-12-01T16:57:50] puneDir: it feels slower
[2023-12-01T16:57:54] puneDir: but no shaking etc
[2023-12-01T16:58:00] puneDir: imma try this ones
[2023-12-01T16:58:59] Mirono escooters: I have for you 6.05 values for alupcb that work
[2023-12-01T16:59:02] Mirono escooters: I had to tune
[2023-12-01T16:59:09] Mirono escooters: These didn't work for me. Quite weird
[2023-12-01T16:59:36] Mirono escooters: Then you just did not have overshoot and so not a lot of unregulated amps Same here. But it's better like this. Way smoother.
[2023-12-01T17:06:09] Кирилл: slower? It can be tuning your observer gain, kp, ki, and/or actually phase current
[2023-12-01T17:06:30] Кирилл: also halls erpm
[2023-12-01T17:25:09] Mirono escooters: I never touched kp/ki
[2023-12-01T17:25:24] Mirono escooters: Anyone got a short tldr what it do?
[2023-12-01T17:25:45] Mirono escooters: God knows how much power he was pushing xD

[2023-12-01T18:11:40] puneDir: 250w
[2023-12-01T18:49:02] Gabe Enzo: Amazon most likely
[2023-12-01T18:56:32] haku: the ones for the phase cables.

[2023-12-01T20:34:23] Mirono escooters: What's the point then
[2023-12-01T20:40:24] JPPL: Imagine after all config off motor current, and. Input etc, we still can tune kp/ki, they both work together
[2023-12-01T20:40:39] JPPL: Try to increase by 1000 The valur or decrease and check behaviour
[2023-12-01T20:40:54] JPPL: Will be more torquy power, or smoother
[2023-12-01T20:41:08] JPPL: Normal values work good
[2023-12-01T20:41:21] Mirono escooters: What are the negatives then?
[2023-12-01T20:41:29] JPPL: But can BE changed
[2023-12-01T20:42:22] JPPL: For exemple on Kelly ctrl, when i Changed my hm3000 motors for Wolf motors that have diferent winding, i tuneed This values to have similar motor behavior, there Will be a value that Will be almost "The limit" that you Will feel no Changes putting higher
[2023-12-01T20:44:53] JPPL: But i suggest to increase by 500 or 1000, check behabiour

[2023-12-01T21:26:06] haku: @XgunaX is this how the gasket suppose to look like on ly hubs? they say its split rim tubeless but it seems like its leaking the gasket area.
[2023-12-01T21:27:24] haku: anyone else have this issue with beading tires on this sort of hub. never had split rim before.
[2023-12-01T21:37:12] sombre_enfant: Ask the rage mechanics
[2023-12-01T21:47:32] haku: they told me to dunk it on water or something like that.😂
[2023-12-01T21:48:07] Mirono escooters: Tubeless split rim is special stuff
[2023-12-01T21:49:08] haku: you mean its uncommon or i need special tools?
[2023-12-01T21:50:28] haku: <photos/photo_11308@01-12-2023_21-50-28.jpg>
[2023-12-01T21:50:28] haku: they said to do this.
[2023-12-01T21:51:00] haku: ill try to bead it first
[2023-12-01T21:53:00] haku: ill take it to the tire shop. i got a flat on my car anyway

[2023-12-01T22:01:23] JPPL: Normally
[2023-12-01T22:01:28] JPPL: The ring
[2023-12-01T22:01:34] JPPL: Seels
[2023-12-01T22:02:53] JPPL: I dont have tubeless split rims, mine are normal, One part os fixes on The motor. On my hm5000 i have tubeless split rims, The Rubber ring on The Middle Will seal
[2023-12-01T22:03:10] JPPL: After that i normally use 3 zip ties arround tyre

[2023-12-01T22:11:28] JPPL: I know brother so sorry, Will be long learn
[2023-12-01T22:11:49] Mirono escooters: Haha no problem xd
[2023-12-02T01:06:23] Ion: Apparently, instead of good design for scooters, we're getting double steering dampers now :)
[2023-12-02T01:06:41] JPPL: True 😂😂😂

[2023-12-02T02:05:57] haku: dam. if i was gonna buy a scoot full price this would be it or inmotion rs
[2023-12-02T02:10:54] NetworkDir: wtf
[2023-12-02T02:14:58] haku: does rake angle really make it unridable at high speeds? even with 2 dampers?
[2023-12-02T02:15:29] NetworkDir: 2 dampers for scooter stupid
[2023-12-02T02:16:08] NetworkDir: Normally, there should be no need for a steering damper at all
[2023-12-02T02:16:15] NetworkDir: Shit and stupid design
[2023-12-02T02:16:38] NetworkDir: Scooter manufacturers are not interested in proper design
[2023-12-02T02:16:46] haku: i agree. but most scooters have that suspension design
[2023-12-02T02:16:59] NetworkDir: I think it is the only segway that has solved these problems to some extent and presented the best form
[2023-12-02T02:17:57] haku: i really like the look of the blade/tevaruns
[2023-12-02T02:18:17] haku: its not overdone
[2023-12-02T02:19:14] NetworkDir: Teverun/Blade old models not bad The new model 7260r stupid design
[2023-12-02T02:20:32] Кирилл: You must have enough trail for these speeds
[2023-12-02T02:20:56] Кирилл: These type of forks and suspension are not working for stability at all
[2023-12-02T02:21:25] Кирилл: Because any bumps, braking, turning and your front wheel moves forward and makes trail negative (check rake angle and trail)
[2023-12-02T02:21:49] NetworkDir: And tank slapper
[2023-12-02T02:21:57] Кирилл: This means that the system will try to turn 180 degrees
[2023-12-02T02:22:10] Кирилл: While you goes 100+
[2023-12-02T02:22:43] Кирилл: thank you but no, this type of creation are for noobs or deaths
[2023-12-02T02:23:30] haku: gotcha. whats a good suspension design? motorcycle style like kaabo vsett11?
[2023-12-02T02:24:49] Ion: Right?? Wtf is that abomination lol
[2023-12-02T02:25:20] Ion: Tis is NEXT LEVEL lol
[2023-12-02T02:26:15] Кирилл: The best right know in scooters is segways gt (girder suspension), inmotion rs (the right way to do C type of forks - look at rake angle and trail), straight suspension fork (moto, bicycle) - but need to make good trail. Kaabo, vsett etc has very, very little trail. They also unstable
[2023-12-02T02:26:15] sombre_enfant: Is it good ? https://a.aliexpress.com/_EuXaYpX
[2023-12-02T02:26:40] NetworkDir: There is still room, they can add another steering damper 😂😂😂
[2023-12-02T02:28:01] haku: nami blast reverse c type? that any good?
[2023-12-02T02:28:43] NetworkDir: 😂😂
[2023-12-02T02:33:14] Кирилл: Yes! It is working the right way to be stable. When this thing sags - you increase trail by moving your front wheel to the rear side, not front. So it goes more stable. In motorcycle world there is classic straight forward fork and technical regulations for entering the market of safe motorcycles for management. If the trail does not meet the requirements, then the motorcycle will not be allowed to go on sale from big companies
[2023-12-02T02:34:29] Кирилл: The damper masks the problem and overloads the node even more when it tries to resist improper operation. It holds the steering wheel imaginary. The damper was created to prevent the occurrence of wobbling due to road situations and the displacement of the trajectory of the front wheel relative to the rear. And in 90% of scooters, it only masks the imperfection of the technical nature of the base itself because bad chinese scooter manufactures doesnt do the fck with it i dont know why. Looks like they just really dont know about it or dont give a fck or just sell shit (more speed - more money)
[2023-12-02T02:37:05] Кирилл: They absolutely don't care that their base is deadly at this speed
[2023-12-02T02:38:31] haku: nami burnie and rion also has this design yea?
[2023-12-02T02:39:27] Кирилл: Nami burn bad working (need to mode it by yourself or go for other model), rion better but still small trail for 120+ speeds
[2023-12-02T02:40:37] haku: ill just save my money and buy the honda motocompacto.
[2023-12-02T02:40:39] Кирилл: Right know the inmotion rs has a significant engineer touch with C type fork
[2023-12-02T02:41:11] haku: i really like the RS. very innovative scooter
[2023-12-02T02:42:16] Кирилл: They have a built-in damper, but the base is already well made so that the damper only helps to maintain stability, and not correct bad geometry by its presence
[2023-12-02T02:44:19] Кирилл: Oh yeah, the Chinesium geniuses like to "fix instability" with overstretched steering bearings and ofc adding damper to it
[2023-12-02T02:44:20] haku: off topic but do you know what motors weped use? is it LY?
[2023-12-02T02:45:06] Кирилл: @PaoloWu Paolo better knows, but looks like yes, they are from ly factory also
[2023-12-02T02:49:13] haku: what do you think about the slack design?
[2023-12-02T02:52:14] Кирилл: Its simple
[2023-12-02T02:53:08] Кирилл: When they talk about design, I imagine what they made of the 920r model👇
[2023-12-02T02:53:25] Кирилл: <photos/photo_11311@02-12-2023_02-53-25.jpg>
[2023-12-02T02:54:32] Кирилл: That is called - design👆
[2023-12-02T02:55:24] Кирилл: And now weped. like... wtf guys☠️
[2023-12-02T03:03:37] haku: that weped has the same suspension style like the segway gt?
[2023-12-02T03:04:50] haku: is there any trustworthy vendors in ali @jamessoderstrom?
[2023-12-02T03:08:43] haku: how about litokala?
[2023-12-02T03:16:09] JPPL: Nkon all The Time
[2023-12-02T03:20:28] Rose: Hey there Topol-E, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-02T03:23:17] Влад: <sticker>
[2023-12-02T09:03:48] Rose: Hey there Andrea, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-02T09:58:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's true
[2023-12-02T10:00:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well , some super bikes have it, if you drove some It hardens turning when you hit high speeds, but still speed wobble can happen and only your skill can help
[2023-12-02T10:01:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also worst wobble like this janobike t85,laotie t29 i had
[2023-12-02T10:03:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In some ways yes, In my opinion no scooter should exist under pocket bikes tire and sus sytem anything smaller doesnt really with basically it's more like "ringing on a spring"
[2023-12-02T10:04:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wonder if Andrea was vesc fan or crypto 🤔😏😎
[2023-12-02T10:37:06] Face de Pin Sucé: He is VESC fan, I know him from Paris haha
[2023-12-02T12:04:01] Mirono escooters: Nooo. Grade B cells
[2023-12-02T12:04:21] Mirono escooters: Real cells But didn't pass quality check of real brands😆
[2023-12-02T12:41:36] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-12-02T12:41:44] Gabe Enzo: back to when I thought 12s was fast 💀
[2023-12-02T12:48:42] Happy Giraffe: There are US based buildes and cells so dont look into chinese market😅
[2023-12-02T14:05:50] Rose: Hey there Roman, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-02T14:07:07] Roman: Hello! Can someone share a program for setting up VESC for PC?
[2023-12-02T14:08:07] Gabe Enzo: just register on the vesc website and it will let you download.
[2023-12-02T14:11:10] haku: just asking because the question was brought up. maybe save a buck. but yea i got mine from reputable supplier.
[2023-12-02T14:13:52] Roman: Registered. You can't buy the free version.
[2023-12-02T14:13:58] Mirono escooters: Since when?
[2023-12-02T14:14:25] Mirono escooters: Anyway here ya go

[2023-12-02T14:20:18] Happy Giraffe: You can get the free download permission. Just look for it😁
[2023-12-02T14:23:24] Gabe Enzo: Just look around *sigh* I'm becoming mirono.
[2023-12-02T14:23:54] Gabe Enzo: Also @Mirono_escooters I realized how ac works. all it took was a dream. or well, the "zone" you get when you're about to fall asleep
[2023-12-02T14:24:00] Gabe Enzo: it makes total sense!!!
[2023-12-02T14:24:36] Mirono escooters: 😆❤️ good boy
[2023-12-02T14:24:41] Mirono escooters: Oh no
[2023-12-02T15:05:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He🙈
[2023-12-02T15:15:33] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters motor burned
[2023-12-02T15:15:37] puneDir: Its locked now
[2023-12-02T15:15:42] puneDir: Rip front
[2023-12-02T15:16:14] Mirono escooters: You didn't listen to me.
[2023-12-02T15:17:13] Gabe Enzo: Why are you still experimenting with that electronic waste.
[2023-12-02T15:17:22] Gabe Enzo: Out of all people it's me telling you this
[2023-12-02T15:21:46] puneDir: wwx motor time
[2023-12-02T15:25:23] Gabe Enzo: Friend IRL wants to mod his kugoo, I am recommending him VESC! The kugoo has a 2kw motor with max output 1kw. Now that's kugoo engineering
[2023-12-02T15:25:34] puneDir: No its fine
[2023-12-02T15:25:35] Mirono escooters: Its kugoo
[2023-12-02T15:25:40] Gabe Enzo: Yep.
[2023-12-02T15:26:19] Gabe Enzo: I shit you not the last kugoo I had weighed like 40kg
[2023-12-02T15:26:24] Gabe Enzo: that's like. a female. or more.. I couldn't lift it up. basically a hunk of steel
[2023-12-02T15:26:54] puneDir: i want antispark now lol
[2023-12-02T15:27:20] Mirono escooters: 😔
[2023-12-02T15:27:23] Mirono escooters: He's asking for a ban
[2023-12-02T15:29:29] puneDir: Why its bad
[2023-12-02T15:30:04] puneDir: the reason of burning was i pulled my cyclist friend up to an hill
[2023-12-02T15:30:21] Mirono escooters: Ok NOW he's asking for a ban
[2023-12-02T15:30:21] puneDir: motor was set to 40a (single motor)
[2023-12-02T15:30:37] puneDir: i have a lotta motors
[2023-12-02T15:30:41] Mirono escooters: -mods ignition key switch - wants antispark
[2023-12-02T15:30:51] Mirono escooters: Still wasteful and dumb
[2023-12-02T15:31:09] puneDir: i dont trust to bms
[2023-12-02T15:31:36] puneDir: i will rebuild this next month Dual 50h etc
[2023-12-02T15:31:41] puneDir: makes sense
[2023-12-02T15:38:13] puneDir: Ngl this motor did 5kw for pretty long time (with single) Good job ninebot
[2023-12-02T15:39:03] Mirono escooters: Not pretty long
[2023-12-02T15:39:15] heimdler: Anyone know what these connectors are called?
[2023-12-02T15:39:25] Mirono escooters: Antispark isn't a fuse 💀
[2023-12-02T15:41:46] Mirono escooters: 😭
[2023-12-02T15:41:51] Mirono escooters: Bms 😭
[2023-12-02T15:42:30] Mirono escooters: I ageee too
[2023-12-02T15:43:42] Paolo ⁭: Mostly of case, fuse gives less energy waste
[2023-12-02T15:45:01] Paolo ⁭: Yes, that's why the best is rele BMS
[2023-12-02T15:45:14] Paolo ⁭: Which car and motorcycle uses
[2023-12-02T15:49:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What wheel diameter you set in vesc for 9" tires?
[2023-12-02T15:50:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 228?
[2023-12-02T15:51:13] Happy Giraffe: I have to use bit less diameter from bike than the tire is, needs gps calibration sadly...
[2023-12-02T15:51:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Approx is enough for now
[2023-12-02T15:51:43] Paolo ⁭: 225
[2023-12-02T15:52:18] Paolo ⁭: I've 245 for 10 inch
[2023-12-02T15:52:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I take it
[2023-12-02T15:52:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thanks guys
[2023-12-02T15:57:37] Gabe Enzo: Please give me some
[2023-12-02T15:58:47] Mirono escooters: So little exist for us tho, hardly any
[2023-12-02T15:59:12] Paolo ⁭: You can connect any relay
[2023-12-02T15:59:28] Mirono escooters: I mean integrated 😛
[2023-12-02T16:01:10] Paolo ⁭: There's ennoid BMS which have communication with vesc too, and support very powerful relay
[2023-12-02T16:01:37] Gabe Enzo: it's 254
[2023-12-02T16:01:43] Gabe Enzo: btw
[2023-12-02T16:02:00] Mirono escooters: Varies with every tire
[2023-12-02T16:02:08] Gabe Enzo: False advertising.
[2023-12-02T16:02:19] Gabe Enzo: smh
[2023-12-02T16:02:24] Jhinzuo ~~: Calculated at certain psi without much load
[2023-12-02T16:02:34] Gabe Enzo: trueeee
[2023-12-02T16:04:13] Paolo ⁭: I'm not noob bro, but if you put the theorical measure you get always fake speed
[2023-12-02T16:04:51] puneDir: <photos/photo_11314@02-12-2023_16-04-51.jpg>
[2023-12-02T16:04:55] puneDir: it looks clean weird
[2023-12-02T16:05:51] puneDir: <video_file>
[2023-12-02T16:05:55] Paolo ⁭: Time to try airless pmt😂
[2023-12-02T16:05:57] puneDir: it doesnt looks burned
[2023-12-02T16:06:46] Gabe Enzo: my bad, I thought it was a honest mistake.
[2023-12-02T16:07:35] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters magnets arent weak also nothing black Can your experienced eyes confirm is this motor burnt?
[2023-12-02T16:10:16] puneDir: imma try
[2023-12-02T16:10:48] NetworkDir: Poor gen 1 under abusing:(
[2023-12-02T16:10:59] NetworkDir: #Free_gen1
[2023-12-02T16:11:20] puneDir: its not burned Probably connectors or smth
[2023-12-02T16:11:37] puneDir: gen1 impresses me how tf its still not burned
[2023-12-02T16:11:59] NetworkDir: If your phases shorted rip esc
[2023-12-02T16:12:19] puneDir: No esc works
[2023-12-02T16:14:15] puneDir: yes
[2023-12-02T16:14:26] puneDir: no problem
[2023-12-02T16:14:54] puneDir: i actually didnt
[2023-12-02T16:15:03] puneDir: but motor lock gone if i shake the scoot
[2023-12-02T16:15:33] puneDir: Maybe phase connectors are shorted idk Also motor runs when i tilt it But it got hot as fuck
[2023-12-02T16:16:38] puneDir: Probably
[2023-12-02T16:17:53] Happy Giraffe: Snapped wires easy to see, can also test with multimeter
[2023-12-02T16:18:04] puneDir: yeah i will look it
[2023-12-02T16:24:20] Mirono escooters: 😭
[2023-12-02T16:24:25] Mirono escooters: Man opened it before checking the obvious
[2023-12-02T16:39:22] haku: its very blury but its a jst i think. maybe jst 2.0
[2023-12-02T17:05:04] puneDir: phases are fine
[2023-12-02T17:05:07] puneDir: time to change the motor
[2023-12-02T17:07:32] Gabe Enzo: What? why would that happen. Isn't a motor one big short anyways?
[2023-12-02T17:12:13] Gabe Enzo: Then what is a short? no resistance?
[2023-12-02T17:13:13] Gabe Enzo: when the motor burns then the resistance becomes zero because the wires start touching eachother right?
[2023-12-02T17:19:30] Gabe Enzo: So max abs current serves to lower the chances of the ESC dying when the motor fries? and slow abs current is????; bad??? what is its purpose even?
[2023-12-02T17:19:51] puneDir: <photos/photo_11315@02-12-2023_17-19-51.jpg>
[2023-12-02T17:25:14] Gabe Enzo: Why would one turn on the slow option?
[2023-12-02T17:31:04] Gabe Enzo: I always got abs max overcurrent error, but never knew why. You fixed it but never told me what was the cause.
[2023-12-02T17:31:25] Gabe Enzo: by bad setup, do you mean like shit Motor?
[2023-12-02T17:46:30] Mirono escooters: <animation>

[2023-12-02T21:12:22] Gabe Enzo: add usb on 5v line
[2023-12-02T21:22:00] Mirono escooters: Pretty fine if your scoot or bike is 2k+
[2023-12-02T21:22:09] Mirono escooters: And it's a really nice dash. I say worth it
[2023-12-02T21:25:56] haku: lol my scoot is $700

[2023-12-03T04:19:37] Jan: Yeah lol
[2023-12-03T04:30:54] haku: so clean!
[2023-12-03T04:50:27] Jan: I would love the G2 suspension somehow on G30 but more rigid version
[2023-12-03T04:50:36] Jan: Monorim isnt clean enough for me ^^
[2023-12-03T04:57:44] Jan: Could be even more stock looking
[2023-12-03T04:58:05] Jan: I dont know why i even have a suspension at this point, only driving on smooth pavements
[2023-12-03T05:14:56] Jan: True but most of high frequencies you get already out from the air filled tire
[2023-12-03T05:15:33] Jan: It dampens all those high amplitudes and high frequency vibrations quite well
[2023-12-03T05:16:40] Jan: But for low frequency there is nothing much without suspension, but also not many load cycles are generated but high amplitude

[2023-12-03T13:14:30] Gabe Enzo: @jtecnocool
[2023-12-03T13:16:10] Jesús: I never put it to the fullest.
[2023-12-03T13:17:03] Gabe Enzo: i just wanna know how fast it went in the video tbh
[2023-12-03T13:17:36] Happy Giraffe: USB quickcharge on handlebars👍
[2023-12-03T13:17:57] Gabe Enzo: 3a haha
[2023-12-03T13:18:28] Happy Giraffe: Wouldn't go anywhere without it if I forget powerbank or charger at home. Would suck not being able to change profiles to get abobe 28kmh😂
[2023-12-03T13:20:53] Gabe Enzo: jeez thats a big spacer, did you put the cells in that horizontally>?
[2023-12-03T13:27:18] Jan: No vertically, but needed space for bms and controllers
[2023-12-03T13:27:29] Jan: Else never 20kW+
[2023-12-03T13:27:42] Gabe Enzo: wow seems its a tight fit even with g30
[2023-12-03T13:27:59] Jan: Electronics can handle 40kW, battery can only 20kW
[2023-12-03T13:28:03] Gabe Enzo: id be worried about the controllers radiating the cells
[2023-12-03T13:28:14] Jan: Was the absolute fucking pain to assemble 😅
[2023-12-03T13:28:17] Gabe Enzo: 20kw? isnt it molicel, what config?
[2023-12-03T13:28:24] Jan: 20s6p
[2023-12-03T13:28:32] Jan: Molicel
[2023-12-03T13:28:46] Jan: 20kW is about the technical limit of the cell
[2023-12-03T13:29:01] Jan: 40kW could potentially the rest
[2023-12-03T13:29:11] Jan: Need better cells
[2023-12-03T13:29:11] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jan has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-03T13:29:34] Gabe Enzo: there is no better cells. you need more cells.
[2023-12-03T13:30:02] Gabe Enzo: tbh you can fit another 20s6p in 2 bags, that would be 40kw. imagine 2x 6kw motors at 20kw each jej
[2023-12-03T13:30:27] Gabe Enzo: 20s12p molicel would be deadly
[2023-12-03T13:31:17] Paolo ⁭: I doubt you can pull more power with tronic 250
[2023-12-03T13:31:35] Gabe Enzo: its dual motor no?
[2023-12-03T13:31:43] sombre_enfant: They got sucé controller now
[2023-12-03T13:31:56] Paolo ⁭: Ah oks
[2023-12-03T13:31:59] Paolo ⁭: Finally stop tronic
[2023-12-03T13:32:01] Jan: I dont have tronics anymore, i blew too many
[2023-12-03T13:32:19] Paolo ⁭: Ah right youve secret controller now
[2023-12-03T13:32:25] Gabe Enzo: where do you get money for this shit
[2023-12-03T13:32:26] Paolo ⁭: Now I remind
[2023-12-03T13:33:08] Mirono escooters: Jan, that could've been 1 msg xD
[2023-12-03T13:33:12] Mirono escooters: Poor bot doing overtime work
[2023-12-03T13:33:15] haku: only fans 😘
[2023-12-03T13:33:29] Jan: Yeah but i wont do any bags, it doesnt look clean enough for me. Ill wait until a new tech comes along. And can somebody disable this fucking floodbot? Its such a pain to write everything ever in one big block
[2023-12-03T13:33:34] sombre_enfant: After french gatekeeper we have swiss cheese gatekeeper
[2023-12-03T13:33:43] Paolo ⁭: Off topic chat no prob xd
[2023-12-03T13:33:52] Gabe Enzo: the limit is 3 messages, she hits you when its at 4.
[2023-12-03T13:33:53] Mirono escooters: Finally 3shul? And new cells?
[2023-12-03T13:33:54] Jan: Work
[2023-12-03T13:34:07] Mirono escooters: Still don't care, I still read off topic daily, it's annoying many msg
[2023-12-03T13:34:40] Gabe Enzo: i hate bags but ill be forced to because i cant find a g30 jej. pro 2 so small
[2023-12-03T13:34:47] Gabe Enzo: can only fit 20s4p
[2023-12-03T13:34:53] Paolo ⁭: No, he said they use special controller now, but keeping secret for now
[2023-12-03T13:34:58] Mirono escooters: Not like a 2L bag is that big or ugly
[2023-12-03T13:35:20] puneDir: xiaomi m365 v1.4 esc
[2023-12-03T13:35:24] puneDir: with sesc
[2023-12-03T13:35:35] Jan: You can fit 20s6p with tiny bms without spacer, but thats it
[2023-12-03T13:36:10] Gabe Enzo: you mean with the g30? because def not with my pro 2
[2023-12-03T13:36:28] sombre_enfant: Roger should take pic of the vesc, he didnt

[2023-12-03T13:39:40] Mirono escooters: https://hackaday.com/2023/11/30/300-amps-through-an-open-source-speed-controller/ an MP2 variant with surface mounted flat fets on one side and caps/converters on the other side of the board. and no, cant put two of them in a ninebot ^^
[2023-12-03T13:39:54] Mirono escooters: Based on mp2, very nice. Lovely. Now just a tolt or toll version👍😛
[2023-12-03T13:39:59] Jan: Which one?
[2023-12-03T13:41:37] haku: its so cool that fenders and lowering it completely changes the look of the scoot. not overdone just enough
[2023-12-03T13:42:44] Jan: But daily usability is a bit limited, you need to be careful everytime you go over an elevation. Changing from sidewalks to the road is not so easy
[2023-12-03T13:43:38] Gabe Enzo: what the fuck
[2023-12-03T13:43:49] Gabe Enzo: second time? G30 this time?

[2023-12-03T13:44:33] Mirono escooters: Yeah, doesn't seem like a daily driver : D
[2023-12-03T13:44:45] Jan: <animation>
[2023-12-03T13:44:49] Gabe Enzo: rewinding is rat shit, usually never can do it right 🤣
[2023-12-03T13:45:07] Mirono escooters: Just stop
[2023-12-03T13:45:29] puneDir: snsc feels like a cloud monorim wont feel like that
[2023-12-03T13:45:40] puneDir: so i need to keep 30h with front
[2023-12-03T13:46:13] puneDir: The guy who rewinds for us also rewinds for rental
[2023-12-03T13:47:36] scootero: Oh, that's good to know, I'm also perhaps evaluating Kelly, Fardriver since there isn't much information or many runners with them about shul cl350.
[2023-12-03T13:56:52] Happy Giraffe: https://trampaboards.com/vesc-str500-100v-500a--p-35876.html This sadly max 100v
[2023-12-03T13:58:30] Happy Giraffe: Has 5x switchable and variable MCU 6-24v aux outputs 15A max total😁 So wont even need DC-DC stepdown anymore for lights etc.
[2023-12-03T14:01:50] Happy Giraffe: Go to test dyno😁
[2023-12-03T14:10:21] Jan: Yeah but that doesnt give topspeed measurements
[2023-12-03T14:15:27] Yamal: 130 on g30 😁

[2023-12-03T19:17:28] Face de Pin Sucé: No, 2024 will see some real power x)

[2023-12-03T19:28:43] Yamal: It's going to be amazing, it's going to be a Rion in a Nami, I know that you don't like Rion very much and that you have bigger controllers and motors but for me it's perfect
[2023-12-03T19:30:53] Yamal: the connectivity of the vesc via bluetooth, the acceleration with the 22/3 motors, smoothness, and I think it will be around 130 which is scandalous
[2023-12-03T19:31:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Nice
[2023-12-03T19:31:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: if you come from OEM nami, Even the OEM motor with vesc is already amazing upgrade
[2023-12-03T19:32:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and with new BMS or battery
[2023-12-03T19:35:24] Yamal: 60h 22/3 motors, tronic 250, 20s10 p Samsung 40t battery with charging bms, free discharge..
[2023-12-03T19:36:09] sombre_enfant: Oh no not tronic
[2023-12-03T19:36:20] Face de Pin Sucé: You won't achieve 130Kmh unless using field weakening a lot
[2023-12-03T19:36:36] Face de Pin Sucé: More like 110-115Kmh with 22x3 60h
[2023-12-03T19:40:15] Yamal: We'll see, soon I'll be able to make a video to share in the group, gentlemen, place your bets‼️😂
[2023-12-03T19:40:41] Face de Pin Sucé: 💥
[2023-12-03T19:44:57] Happy Giraffe: I wanna see a working Rion😁
[2023-12-03T19:45:24] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 60H 22*3 are the same are the OEM nami motor
[2023-12-03T19:45:56] Yamal: Nami 17/4
[2023-12-03T19:46:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Nice config btw, Except the tronic i dont like, but for 200A it's acceptable
[2023-12-03T19:46:16] rosheee: he super light ^^' and small - not?
[2023-12-03T19:46:39] rosheee: i saw ^^
[2023-12-03T19:46:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Ah yes, my mistake, only up to 100 in 20S it's right
[2023-12-03T19:47:05] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 174 cm 70kg so not i am not
[2023-12-03T19:47:09] rosheee: rofl
[2023-12-03T19:47:16] rosheee: 184 90kg ^^
[2023-12-03T19:47:28] haku: my scooter goals is not being fast but a burnout machine. im too pussy to go fast 😭
[2023-12-03T19:47:44] rosheee: XD me 2 pussy for burnout
[2023-12-03T19:47:44] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but the new driver for Rage is less than 50 lol
[2023-12-03T19:47:50] rosheee: ja rofl
[2023-12-03T19:47:51] rosheee: wowe
[2023-12-03T19:47:57] rosheee: then additional weight plsa
[2023-12-03T19:48:18] rosheee: so they kicked u cuz weight ^^? (just joking)
[2023-12-03T19:48:59] rosheee: you could join us if u want 😃
[2023-12-03T19:49:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-03T19:49:20] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no, I refused the sponsorship offer for 2024
[2023-12-03T19:49:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: not, i will ride for my own
[2023-12-03T19:50:15] francois schempers: 1m97 140kg, I know I'm never gonna be a driver 😂😂
[2023-12-03T19:50:30] Yamal: 130 in scooter is just nice for some time 😂, I can get with Nami with Kelly 7218 and 65h32/3 stock battery
[2023-12-03T19:51:42] haku: i feel you my brother
[2023-12-03T19:51:53] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but you can have fun, and even if you are heavy you can got a good position with the good scooter and well driving
[2023-12-03T19:52:43] Yamal: My remember from 7218
[2023-12-03T19:53:20] Yamal: This is not
[2023-12-03T19:53:41] francois schempers: yeah sure, I'm building one currently, I'll soon have plenty of fun 😂😂
[2023-12-03T19:54:28] Yamal: <video_file>
[2023-12-03T19:59:06] Yamal: now that with the engines that had 33/2, zero torque
[2023-12-03T20:01:51] Yamal: They are also "rare" engines, they heated all the electronics, type minimotors, nami .kelly 7218, with the 7230 I think they would have gone well and of course the tronic, I also heated them
[2023-12-03T20:02:33] Yamal: and of course without torque, which for what? when the most fun is to have strong acceleration
[2023-12-03T20:05:00] Mirono escooters: Wait for my flipsky super g30 👀 Joke, it would die before I see the finish line
[2023-12-03T20:05:17] Mirono escooters: No way I curve like you guys, crazy I'm scared at 10*
[2023-12-03T20:06:13] haku: atleast g30 can handle super speeds. laotie will snap in half
[2023-12-03T20:12:15] Gabe Enzo: Pro 2 better than laotie then 🦃
[2023-12-03T20:13:30] Mirono escooters: Uuhh
[2023-12-03T20:14:45] haku: anyways batteries all good. average 10-11 mOhms
[2023-12-03T20:15:39] haku: just waiting on my other batteries to practice on copper welds
[2023-12-03T20:17:48] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: You can, in -38kg catégorie, it should be good !
[2023-12-03T20:18:11] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: You can learn, i was like you
[2023-12-03T20:18:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: how you mesure the IR resistor ?
[2023-12-03T20:19:24] haku: like this i think
[2023-12-03T20:19:45] haku: this tool
[2023-12-03T20:19:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ok, i really dont trust it 😆
[2023-12-03T20:20:29] haku: first time using it. just got it because seen some folk use it lol
[2023-12-03T20:20:43] Mirono escooters: Gen1 30h motor?👀
[2023-12-03T20:20:50] Mirono escooters: I'd get to 50 then slack behind hababa
[2023-12-03T20:21:33] Gabe Enzo: Multimeter?
[2023-12-03T20:21:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Low resistor are something sensible who can be mesured easyly, need inject enough current and with two separete wire mesure the voltage variation, the connexion, wire etc affect the result
[2023-12-03T20:21:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no
[2023-12-03T20:22:11] Mirono escooters: Yes, the meter has 4 wires
[2023-12-03T20:22:18] Mirono escooters: Its a pretty good tool, it's used a lot. Wich do u use?
[2023-12-03T20:22:44] Gabe Enzo: Is this tool needed? ugh
[2023-12-03T20:22:51] Gabe Enzo: new toool for everything
[2023-12-03T20:22:58] Yamal: https://youtu.be/8kYQlK4ExVc?si=4kwHrqKveS38rs9h
[2023-12-03T20:23:14] Yamal: Better this G30
[2023-12-03T20:23:17] haku: buy the knockoff version thats what i did
[2023-12-03T20:23:26] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but going in a probe, so he mesure the resistor of the probe who are higher than the Cell resistor probably, and if the tool dont inject enough current the précision of the voltage need to be very very precise, so i dont like that method of mesurement
[2023-12-03T20:24:20] Mirono escooters: If you wanna test cells properly
[2023-12-03T20:24:21] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: For classic Resistor i use Power supply CC i inject 10A and mesure the voltage where i want with my multimeter, but for battery it's more difficult
[2023-12-03T20:24:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: normally it need a AC current generator
[2023-12-03T20:24:42] Mirono escooters: Yes, ac 1khz very fun to do xD
[2023-12-03T20:24:47] Gabe Enzo: So I need it for my molicel shipment
[2023-12-03T20:24:49] Mirono escooters: The tool is fine for cells..
[2023-12-03T20:24:56] Mirono escooters: New cells should be fine.
[2023-12-03T20:25:19] Mirono escooters: Weped 🤢
[2023-12-03T20:25:25] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, Btw, i never lost time to mesure the new cell before use, it's totally waste time
[2023-12-03T20:25:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Test it's for validate or not a model of Cell, not to check all the new cells
[2023-12-03T20:25:45] Mirono escooters: Yes, I agree
[2023-12-03T20:25:52] Mirono escooters: What. I never have
[2023-12-03T20:26:06] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes, it's what i said, useless 😆
[2023-12-03T20:26:50] Yamal: 😂
[2023-12-03T20:27:35] Yamal: brands you like?
[2023-12-03T20:27:40] haku: i think this tool is best for recycled cells
[2023-12-03T20:29:40] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-12-03T20:29:55] Mirono escooters: Segway and vsett, I guess
[2023-12-03T20:33:09] haku: ill use it when i repack my laotie battery. what should be the ideal IR used for scooters?
[2023-12-03T20:33:57] Mirono escooters: That varies a lot
[2023-12-03T20:34:00] haku: for high amp usage
[2023-12-03T20:34:02] Mirono escooters: Stay under 50, Problably
[2023-12-03T20:34:07] Mirono escooters: Ah, then 30-50 rlly max
[2023-12-03T20:34:14] Mirono escooters: Can calculate your vdrop and see if you fine with it xD
[2023-12-03T20:35:04] haku: can that tool measure a whole pack?
[2023-12-03T20:39:29] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-12-03T20:39:46] sombre_enfant: U prefer yh1035 ?
[2023-12-03T20:41:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ?
[2023-12-03T20:48:34] haku: the portability of that scoot is pretty great. idk about performance but looks cool
[2023-12-03T20:53:15] Gabe Enzo: Wym classic resistor? resistor where?
[2023-12-03T20:54:53] Yamal: Only need the vesc no? Heh
[2023-12-03T20:58:47] haku: do you know what esc those use?
[2023-12-03T20:59:43] haku: they just over do it with the rgb. sometimes it looks like a chinese frame
[2023-12-03T21:07:36] Yamal: Before kelly, now I don’t know what they use
[2023-12-03T21:08:41] Pandalgns: how does it look? good? The loud noise is because of so much power the tire is stretched and it rubs against an axle..
[2023-12-03T21:09:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, if you prefer Resistor is can be mesured in static, Battery need to be mesured in dynamic
[2023-12-03T21:11:16] haku: test it with load.
[2023-12-03T21:11:56] Pandalgns: If I have to finish assembling the scooter, I need the second controller for the front motor and assemble a few things
[2023-12-03T21:13:23] Pandalgns: I really want to try it on the street with the two motors to see what results the janobike t10 motors at 72v give with these controllers
[2023-12-03T21:14:16] haku: im not vesc expert. vesc lords should chime in with tuning
[2023-12-03T21:15:58] Pandalgns: If anyone would like to give me a hand with the configuration or look at the parameters I have set, I would be delighted.
[2023-12-03T21:19:19] Gabe Enzo: anyone know why my brake acts as a reverse when at standstill?
[2023-12-03T21:19:26] Gabe Enzo: it's like a little tap backwards
[2023-12-03T21:43:32] haku: i believe you have to set it to adc2 current no brake. im not to sure.
[2023-12-03T21:44:15] haku: vesc lords should know.
[2023-12-03T21:50:28] sombre_enfant: Adc 2 brake no reverse
[2023-12-03T22:59:29] haku: do you guys know what magnet size on stock surron motors?
[2023-12-03T23:04:37] haku: the light bee motor.
[2023-12-04T00:32:50] haku: is it possible to fit a 140mm or 160mm rotor and zoom brakes on a vsett 9+. the clearance looks pretty tight
[2023-12-04T00:34:14] haku: <photos/photo_11337@04-12-2023_00-34-14.jpg>
[2023-12-04T00:35:19] haku: tired of vsetts crappy brakes
[2023-12-04T00:35:20] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-04T00:37:52] haku: jeez that was 3 messages. take it easy robot
[2023-12-04T00:48:58] JPPL: I bet for sure it is
[2023-12-04T01:06:20] haku: yep that was what im thinking too. might aswell change the rotors too. would 140mm fit?
[2023-12-04T03:46:50] haku: oof 20s9p very tight fit. gonna need to print an extender
[2023-12-04T03:48:25] haku: or need someone to make me a bigger deck
[2023-12-04T06:02:10] Happy Giraffe: We should make a catalog of different brake caliper dimensions how wide the part after disc is on the side etc.
[2023-12-04T06:17:56] puneDir: why use hexagon
[2023-12-04T06:18:09] puneDir: with normal holders you can have bigger space
[2023-12-04T06:18:42] haku: how. i think it takes more space
[2023-12-04T06:19:15] puneDir: the advantage of this shape is it takes less space on y axis
[2023-12-04T06:19:29] puneDir: but it takes more space on x axis
[2023-12-04T06:19:37] haku: i see. i will check it out
[2023-12-04T06:25:41] haku: <photos/photo_11339@04-12-2023_06-25-41.jpg>
[2023-12-04T06:25:48] haku: i can do it this way gonna need to cut the copper tough
[2023-12-04T06:36:43] sombre_enfant: Link of holder ?
[2023-12-04T06:41:19] haku: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $13.07 28%OFF | Turmera 10Piece 10S2P 20X 21700 Battery Holder Bracket 21700 Spacer Assemble for 36V 48V Electric Bike or Escooter Batteries Use https://a.aliexpress.com/_mrPn3lw
[2023-12-04T06:51:09] haku: i think ill have a metal fabrication shop make me a bigger deck. if i do this though it will defeat the purpose of a pimped out laotie
[2023-12-04T09:26:32] Gabe Enzo: You can fit 20s10p with no plastic
[2023-12-04T09:26:41] Gabe Enzo: No dude
[2023-12-04T09:27:36] haku: thought of that. cells in middle might get too hot yea?
[2023-12-04T09:29:31] haku: just use fishpaper as insulation. ive seen folks do that before.
[2023-12-04T10:02:55] Mirono escooters: Iv got a riddle for you guys I start the scoot. I full throttle. Vibrations, but drives 1-2 mins later (after its warm, I guess) it only does this when it got cold Its fine, even max throttle #whattefak?
[2023-12-04T10:57:03] Давно пора: Temperature compensation off
[2023-12-04T10:57:14] Давно пора: Had the same issue
[2023-12-04T11:29:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Define what you mean under vibrations
[2023-12-04T11:39:27] Mirono escooters: Observer losing track issue
[2023-12-04T11:39:35] Mirono escooters: Where can I enable it? :)
[2023-12-04T11:40:32] Oreo huzky: Bro I just wanted to fix scooters
[2023-12-04T11:41:59] Gabe Enzo: what happened?
[2023-12-04T11:46:11] Mirono escooters: I don't have a temperature sensor in motor, so I can't even use the compensation, shame. That's the fee I pay for not installing one. I'll lower Resistance by like 5% manually ig
[2023-12-04T12:34:13] Gabe Enzo: I had the same issue as you
[2023-12-04T12:40:55] Happy Giraffe: Sorry for your injury but this is help/troubleshooting channel😁
[2023-12-04T12:41:27] Happy Giraffe: Should not matter at start as motor runs on halls anyway vs. foc sensorless
[2023-12-04T12:43:20] Mirono escooters: Its when sensor lesf
[2023-12-04T12:43:27] Mirono escooters: Fix 2: longer halls usage
[2023-12-04T12:50:17] Unknown: what happened ??? your hand got caught in the disk rotor
[2023-12-04T12:50:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🙈🙈🙈
[2023-12-04T12:58:33] Unknown: Current no reverse braking.
[2023-12-04T13:31:42] Mirono escooters: Me sensorless is like till 3kmh
[2023-12-04T14:05:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What was setting? Before i mean
[2023-12-04T14:07:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pics is one message,text another Even if sent together
[2023-12-04T14:08:34] Mirono escooters: I didn't change anything
[2023-12-04T14:10:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its pretty blurry but looks melt middle isolation
[2023-12-04T14:11:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah isolation melt
[2023-12-04T14:12:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not Always looks like ,but if isolation melts it shorts to standing part
[2023-12-04T14:14:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Red where you still have it , blue missing Yellow other anomaly 🙈
[2023-12-04T14:14:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 👆👆👆
[2023-12-04T14:15:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Didn't you set sensorless swiching to higher number?
[2023-12-04T14:17:03] francois schempers: 3message +2 photo, that's 5 ^^
[2023-12-04T14:17:28] Mirono escooters: I did not. I just say it's Problably a fix
[2023-12-04T14:17:41] Mirono escooters: I'll just live with it till it gets a tad warm
[2023-12-04T14:17:47] Mirono escooters: Because it really is gone when warmer
[2023-12-04T14:33:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @Oreohuzky so what happened mate?
[2023-12-04T15:06:48] puneDir: finally im in 50h gang
[2023-12-04T15:08:50] puneDir: THIS HAPPENS TO ME TOO
[2023-12-04T15:13:20] Oreo huzky: I was trying to tighten the bolds on brake disk I slipped and cut my finger at the brake disk it was really deep cut you could see the bone
[2023-12-04T15:34:57] Gabe Enzo: Hey guys, would it be viable to bolt 2 vescs onto a brick of Alu and then have that set where the vesc should be? I have a tight fit on my pro 2, but i believe i can pull off 20s4p internal and dual vesc 👑😼
[2023-12-04T15:35:16] Gabe Enzo: It's gonna be insane, Paycheck coming soon. new project.

[2023-12-04T15:36:33] sombre_enfant: What is blue ?
[2023-12-04T15:38:07] Gabe Enzo: Alu
[2023-12-04T15:38:10] sombre_enfant: Easiest and cheaper is one on frame one on alu bottom plate
[2023-12-04T15:38:21] Gabe Enzo: Not clean tbh... but sure
[2023-12-04T15:39:06] sombre_enfant: 20s wont fit either way
[2023-12-04T15:40:32] Gabe Enzo: It will with a bag
[2023-12-04T15:41:30] Gabe Enzo: I'll be using a metal brick to push the surface of the vesc a bit further

[2023-12-04T20:35:38] János Tóth: Hello guys, I'm planing to overvolt a flipsky 75200. My goal is 22s. I'm sure somebody tried out earlier, so I'm curious about the results. How well does it handle it? Regen breaking is forgettable? If required, I could actualy change mosfets too.
[2023-12-04T20:54:10] haku: @PaoloWu can this be done?
[2023-12-04T21:57:58] sombre_enfant: Not worth it, 21s sweet spot and safe

[2023-12-04T22:02:53] sombre_enfant: Yes (need to confirm)
[2023-12-04T22:03:27] haku: im still deciding on g300 3shul or spintend.

[2023-12-04T22:11:06] Mirono escooters: I doubt that fit
[2023-12-04T22:11:21] Mirono escooters: Its not a shitty design..
[2023-12-04T22:11:52] Mirono escooters: It has the best layout I've ever seen. Its very, very compact. Very well designed. And 18fet is very cool Its not because no alupcb, no good.

[2023-12-05T01:43:41] Unknown: Is it worth it ?
[2023-12-05T01:44:45] haku: nah these are not that great cells. got em really cheap. i want to practice welding copper on them before i start my pack
[2023-12-05T01:44:56] Unknown: I've always wanted to build my own battery but it's hard to get new cells here
[2023-12-05T01:45:13] haku: 18650 1800mah 25a
[2023-12-05T01:47:00] Paolo ⁭: Is normal , because of customs
[2023-12-05T01:49:45] Unknown: In the end I got my 60/18ah 4c battery for 490£ is that expensive?
[2023-12-05T01:51:04] haku: no idea. battery prices varies everywhere i guess. you guys are lucky there you get em cheap
[2023-12-05T01:53:41] Unknown: Yes but the price of scooters/ebikes here are expensive for example the cheapest surron is 5300£
[2023-12-05T01:54:41] haku: wow
[2023-12-05T01:55:05] haku: good price i think if new
[2023-12-05T02:00:54] Unknown: After reaching the difference is 2500$ between the usa and us (me)
[2023-12-05T02:17:41] Paolo ⁭: Not true, inrunner just more benefits, but works very well with hub too

[2023-12-05T06:24:19] Happy Giraffe: Insert cat in the basket
[2023-12-05T07:56:49] Happy Giraffe: So what was the ambient temperature and how many% you changed the resistance?
[2023-12-05T08:00:00] Mirono escooters: When I set it up? Was like 12* And I didn't change resistance
[2023-12-05T08:00:08] Mirono escooters: Since we got better weather
[2023-12-05T08:07:41] Happy Giraffe: -5°c internal motor temperature makes mine brr, I try to lower resistance by 1% on thursday
[2023-12-05T08:20:58] Mirono escooters: You could use compensator if motor temp sensor
[2023-12-05T08:21:11] Mirono escooters: Seems like many experience it 🤷
[2023-12-05T08:21:18] Mirono escooters: Good it's not my setup this time
[2023-12-05T08:34:30] Happy Giraffe: Manual lathe, 0.003mm tolerance on DIY mounting😂
[2023-12-05T08:39:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Should work without modifications but forget about regen
[2023-12-05T08:39:55] Happy Giraffe: Elon Musk hire me pls
[2023-12-05T08:40:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Because Fedex is shitty company
[2023-12-05T08:43:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Mine is not as big x?

[2023-12-05T09:22:54] Mirono escooters: Did ya pay the tax :)
[2023-12-05T09:23:14] sombre_enfant: Not yet
[2023-12-05T09:23:52] Mirono escooters: And man wonders why it isn't being delivered..
[2023-12-05T09:24:12] Mirono escooters: Just pay it, how hard can it be 😂
[2023-12-05T09:24:52] sombre_enfant: Nah they still deliver it before right @SibClimb or it changed ?
[2023-12-05T09:25:42] Mirono escooters: 🤦
[2023-12-05T09:26:26] Mirono escooters: Being a cheapass or what hahaha
[2023-12-05T09:26:33] Mirono escooters: In Belgium they only deliver when pay.
[2023-12-05T10:19:21] sombre_enfant: For single what is better 60h 17x4 or 22x3 i need around 80kph on 16s
[2023-12-05T10:26:23] Happy Giraffe: Not sure if it works before vesc switches to sensorless. I use it but base temp measured at 20°c
[2023-12-05T10:27:25] Mirono escooters: Good point It only works sensorless
[2023-12-05T10:27:34] Mirono escooters: My brt is not in sensored range
[2023-12-05T10:27:43] Mirono escooters: Re measure at lower temp, fixed Or manually
[2023-12-05T10:35:44] Unknown: @lBabacar problem?
[2023-12-05T10:38:29] Unknown: Wow this is racist and antisemitic

[2023-12-05T10:39:06] Unknown: Who got offended by a flag ?
[2023-12-05T10:39:25] Mirono escooters: No politics. Its the second time you obviously showed your flag in photos, without reason.
[2023-12-05T10:39:40] Mirono escooters: Last warning or enjoy a mute Tis like a kindergarten
[2023-12-05T10:40:17] Unknown: No it's always on my scooter u chose to see it like that
[2023-12-05T10:40:27] Mirono escooters: No flags, no politics. Last warning.
[2023-12-05T10:40:31] Mirono escooters: Goes for everyone.
[2023-12-05T10:40:54] Unknown: All flags ok I'll keep an eye out

[2023-12-05T10:41:31] Mirono escooters: Last warning, next time it's a mute for who knows how long.
[2023-12-05T10:42:40] Unknown: Ok All tough u could've tell me I private
[2023-12-05T10:42:58] Mirono escooters: Thought it was obvious last time

[2023-12-05T13:47:15] Happy Giraffe: I'll see what happens and double check my sensorless switch RPM
[2023-12-05T14:21:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fun thing is i just got a ups call that , tomorrow they come and i need to pay fee at the car

[2023-12-05T15:58:06] sombre_enfant: InchAllah we have it by next year 👍🏾
[2023-12-05T15:59:14] Paolo ⁭: Normally high voltage is better
[2023-12-05T16:00:42] Jan: I love the idea of it
[2023-12-05T16:01:58] Jan: If lets say 120s1p sure there will be some other issues that would make it not efficient?
[2023-12-05T16:02:40] Jan: Isnt there like an optimum voltage range for certain type of power?
[2023-12-05T16:04:11] Paolo ⁭: Higher voltage you need more components, more expensive, controller may result much bigger, and need much safety parts
[2023-12-05T16:04:37] Paolo ⁭: You have to do it only if it worth, example on cars , they use 450-600-700v
[2023-12-05T16:05:18] Jan: 😱😱 good recovery. Maybe the @kawaiinekololis-way (No brakes at all) is maybe more suited for you 😬
[2023-12-05T16:05:18] Izuna 生活: I have used 22S, it's fine. Just disable regenerative braking.
[2023-12-05T16:05:32] Happy Giraffe: Higher voltage gives better phase longer and torque stays also longer😳
[2023-12-05T16:06:03] Jan: Electronics above 50V is illegal in switzerland
[2023-12-05T16:06:18] Gabe Enzo: Who here said they want 80kmh with 15s?
[2023-12-05T16:06:38] Gabe Enzo: Police casually disassembling your scooter to check cell specs
[2023-12-05T16:06:53] Izuna 生活: Me, but with high kV and a lot of field weakening
[2023-12-05T16:06:55] Jan: They measure charge port voltage and arrest you
[2023-12-05T16:07:24] Gabe Enzo: This world is getting worse and worse.
[2023-12-05T16:07:29] Jan: Yes
[2023-12-05T16:07:35] Izuna 生活: Wtf
[2023-12-05T16:08:04] Gabe Enzo: I'm surprised those knuckleheads know that
[2023-12-05T16:08:16] Gabe Enzo: We have an insider in the police force
[2023-12-05T16:08:38] Jan: 500W, 20kmh, 50V max, needs several reflectors positioned at certain hights, day drive light, and important No blinkers else you get a fine
[2023-12-05T16:08:57] Paolo ⁭: How electric car works ?
[2023-12-05T16:09:16] Jan: There the voltage law doesnt count for some reason
[2023-12-05T16:09:19] Gabe Enzo: Same way that crystal meth is legal if a pharmacy makes it. They make their own laws
[2023-12-05T16:09:23] Jan: Only e bikes and scooters
[2023-12-05T16:09:37] Jan: And other hand held electronics
[2023-12-05T16:09:44] Paolo ⁭: Because of certification I think
[2023-12-05T16:10:16] Gabe Enzo: Getting arrested in Switzerland for taking my 20s RC car on a spin
[2023-12-05T16:10:28] Gabe Enzo: 🤣
[2023-12-05T16:11:10] Mirono escooters: Crazy italian
[2023-12-05T16:11:15] Jan: Its thats above a certain vehicle weight without license and registration and getting official permission to use it in a certain area...
[2023-12-05T16:11:41] Mirono escooters: Oy boy do I love a police state
[2023-12-05T16:11:53] Jan: Some people have unnecessary cnc hours left
[2023-12-05T16:12:00] Gabe Enzo: We gotta make our scooters faster than ever before.
[2023-12-05T16:12:15] Mirono escooters: Deep inside you love that fork
[2023-12-05T16:12:24] Mirono escooters: Make too, and get rid of monorim finally
[2023-12-05T16:12:45] Gabe Enzo: why is monorim bad again?
[2023-12-05T16:12:55] Mirono escooters: You sponsor me bb?
[2023-12-05T16:13:05] Mirono escooters: Because shit
[2023-12-05T16:13:21] Mirono escooters: Less to fail, I guess Bonus!
[2023-12-05T16:13:22] sombre_enfant: If i hit the loto fs
[2023-12-05T16:13:25] Gabe Enzo: Y
[2023-12-05T16:13:27] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-12-05T16:13:28] Jan: Unclean in my taste
[2023-12-05T16:13:35] Jan: It must follow perfection
[2023-12-05T16:13:44] Jan: Too many moving parts
[2023-12-05T16:13:57] Mirono escooters: Its a shit design, shit brand and shit engineered
[2023-12-05T16:14:10] Gabe Enzo: Would konyk be good for rear suspension?
[2023-12-05T16:14:34] Gabe Enzo: I gotta keep my front monorim for now 🤣 no other way to fit a 1kw
[2023-12-05T16:14:36] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-12-05T16:14:48] Mirono escooters: Dereza ..
[2023-12-05T16:15:04] Jhinzuo ~~: thats what i wanted to ask next, if that one better?
[2023-12-05T16:15:14] Mirono escooters: Way better. Astronomically.
[2023-12-05T16:15:15] Jan: The idea is of the trapezoid suspension is nice but the monorim adaption of the idea is horrible, but not because of stupidity but because of maximizing profits
[2023-12-05T16:15:16] Jhinzuo ~~: cuz prices arent that far apart
[2023-12-05T16:15:28] Jan: Front lamp?
[2023-12-05T16:15:29] Mirono escooters: Just not highspeed ( c sus)
[2023-12-05T16:15:40] Gabe Enzo: what's a front lamp?
[2023-12-05T16:15:42] Mirono escooters: Idea good Product bad
[2023-12-05T16:16:00] Jan: GT2 really good trapezoid suspension
[2023-12-05T16:16:06] Mirono escooters: Yeees
[2023-12-05T16:16:11] Mirono escooters: Its monorims smarter brother
[2023-12-05T16:16:17] Jan: There it is actually perfect and outshines every other front sus
[2023-12-05T16:16:33] Mirono escooters: Yep. Its better by miles.
[2023-12-05T16:17:33] Mirono escooters: Segway has good engineers. One of the few brands
[2023-12-05T16:17:59] Mirono escooters: Vsett is kinda ok, atleast doesn't just break or fail, geometry is eh, fine Enough. Batt space nice, good frame
[2023-12-05T16:18:07] Mirono escooters: I'm pretty picky about brands : )
[2023-12-05T16:18:45] Jhinzuo ~~: i hope he wont hit cutoff going 80kmh with only ebrake 👀
[2023-12-05T16:20:08] Mirono escooters: Yeah, I was joking :D Atleast 1 mechanical backup is my rule.
[2023-12-05T16:20:13] Mirono escooters: Have seen enough shit happen
[2023-12-05T16:20:17] Gabe Enzo: Shouldn't 80kmh be absolutely possible with no field weakening and a good cell?
[2023-12-05T16:20:24] Mirono escooters: Yes, ofcourse
[2023-12-05T16:20:42] Gabe Enzo: Then why did he ask 🤣
[2023-12-05T16:20:43] Mirono escooters: Or high voltage or high kv and shitload of power
[2023-12-05T16:20:53] Gabe Enzo: Ah
[2023-12-05T16:21:05] Mirono escooters: A bit of fwk isn't bad
[2023-12-05T16:21:07] Gabe Enzo: Is it possible with a 1kw hub?
[2023-12-05T16:21:10] Mirono escooters: Non
[2023-12-05T16:21:12] Mirono escooters: Too weak
[2023-12-05T16:21:21] Mirono escooters: Wind resistance is your worst enemy
[2023-12-05T16:21:28] Gabe Enzo: What's the max I can do without it blowing?
[2023-12-05T16:21:30] Mirono escooters: Maybe for a minute 😁
[2023-12-05T16:21:31] Gabe Enzo: I really need 70
[2023-12-05T16:21:36] Mirono escooters: Not
[2023-12-05T16:21:40] Mirono escooters: AWD and more kw lol
[2023-12-05T16:21:47] Mirono escooters: Temp sensor and fuck it 🤷
[2023-12-05T16:21:49] Mirono escooters: And ferrofluid..
[2023-12-05T16:22:02] Mirono escooters: Need budget and a good scoot
[2023-12-05T16:22:14] Jan: Over 40kmh only dual hydraulics
[2023-12-05T16:22:15] Gabe Enzo: Damnit I'll be buying a second motor soon then.
[2023-12-05T16:22:19] Gabe Enzo: fuck it.
[2023-12-05T16:23:44] Happy Giraffe: If you have a wireless relay there?😂
[2023-12-05T16:24:08] Happy Giraffe: 13s fully charged illegal?😅
[2023-12-05T16:25:04] Jan: 12s charged to 99% is max legal
[2023-12-05T16:25:33] Jan: 12s 100% =>
[2023-12-05T16:25:39] Jan: <animation>
[2023-12-05T16:34:43] Happy Giraffe: So 12S high kv motor and then 300A capable battery?🤔 Or a small fake 42v circuit there😅
[2023-12-05T16:36:03] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Nyet. He's only for Xiaomi and ninebot
[2023-12-05T16:51:54] Mirono escooters: Single 70kmh is deadly And 1kw lol
[2023-12-05T16:52:10] Mirono escooters: As he should
[2023-12-05T16:52:24] Mirono escooters: Yes, thats the sensible, normal answer
[2023-12-05T16:52:35] Mirono escooters: But its izuna, anything better then only ebrake
[2023-12-05T16:52:49] Mirono escooters: Like 99% in this group doesn't do xD
[2023-12-05T16:54:00] Mirono escooters: I've got dual drum, dual ebrake. 50kph max, I wheelslip with it already, stop quickly. I came to senses few years ago, before that also only ebrake. Horrible of me
[2023-12-05T16:57:45] haku: what is tnf? fancy europeans.
[2023-12-05T16:59:52] puneDir: the north face

[2023-12-06T15:32:22] Unknown: What do you mean stability?
[2023-12-06T16:02:06] Mirono escooters: Fun thing today: Hard brake, hard ebrake (front lever also has ebrake sensor for rear) and observer loses track. Have to go to 0 and ride again. It only happens when I brake so hard and sudden, rear usually slips a little, and observer hates that 🤷 Ig time to lower ebrake amps Or tune observer more, since it's not being as good in the cold. This is a V2 update on my "brbrt when cold" thing of yesterday.
[2023-12-06T16:02:39] Mirono escooters: I did not have time to mess with R yet
[2023-12-06T16:21:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What ebrake amps you have?

[2023-12-06T16:25:49] Mirono escooters: Ortega
[2023-12-06T16:29:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And this is your bike? Right

[2023-12-06T20:45:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Flir is a brand?
[2023-12-06T20:47:58] haku: it will be hard to see cables and weld temps with just sensors. i just want to male sure the battery wont catch fire
[2023-12-06T20:49:01] haku: also im a nerd. i want to see temps on all devices
[2023-12-06T20:49:45] haku: including my peepee

[2023-12-06T23:24:12] Gabe Enzo: If I have 2 motors/escs then how will vesc Show temp?
[2023-12-07T00:07:49] Gabe Enzo: Damn, what if motor 1 burns and the other is colder? kinda dangerous. Perhaps Vedder should implement my idea? Same goes with the VESCs..
[2023-12-07T00:10:34] Gabe Enzo: Stock XD. like putting only 1kw into a 1kw motor 🗿
[2023-12-07T00:39:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Finaly ,time to go 😁
[2023-12-07T00:49:41] Martin Kaktits: If both motors have temp sensors, each plugged in to their own ESC's - it doesnt matter if the temp is displayed for your meatball eyes, internally it will cut/ decrease power when limits reached.
[2023-12-07T01:16:01] Martin Kaktits: I got u bro
[2023-12-07T01:16:58] haku: noob question is it possible to have 2 adc adapters for each 80/100?

[2023-12-07T02:17:59] haku: .2 copper is equivalent to .8 nickel yea?

[2023-12-07T07:16:34] Jan: 200A on a 72V system is aready nearly 15kW which is only constantly needed when holding around 120kmh. Are you planning to do highway travels at constant 120kmh until battery dead?
[2023-12-07T07:18:10] haku: maybe for a vesc drone that can carry humans. that would be the dream
[2023-12-07T07:30:10] haku: what is the difference between these 2 dual vescs?
[2023-12-07T07:30:11] haku: <photos/photo_11388@07-12-2023_07-30-11.jpg>
[2023-12-07T08:37:50] francois schempers: I'm planning to go up mountains here that's like a 1km of upward travel, I am 140kg and my controller is capable of 16kw ^^
[2023-12-07T08:44:19] Jan: Unless you are going up 90° vertical hills, 15kW is an overkill ^^
[2023-12-07T09:18:38] sombre_enfant: Both are bad...diff fets
[2023-12-07T09:30:35] francois schempers: overkill is what I want, I want everything to stay cool and not overheat in any situation
[2023-12-07T09:32:43] Jan: Motors will most likely be the issue and nothing else
[2023-12-07T09:32:54] Jan: Dual low KV torque motors required
[2023-12-07T09:51:31] Gabe Enzo: I found a way Just use 2x 10s cells LOL. it'll measure as 42v.
[2023-12-07T10:08:20] Mirono escooters: Minimum

[2023-12-07T13:37:47] Mirono escooters: @AJAJ1992 will ban u immediately with fans 😶
[2023-12-07T13:47:20] Happy Giraffe: Dont wanna be negative but fans rarely effective on scooters. Best to mount heatsource-heatspreader-thermalpaste-aluminium frame. Usually controllers have a smooth metal surface thats meant to be mounted this way straight to alu body of vehicle.
[2023-12-07T13:51:38] Mirono escooters: Yep, and ppl still do 😛🙈
[2023-12-07T13:51:56] Mirono escooters: Scoot big heatsink, natural airflow Air bad thermal conductor Hmm let's go fans 😂
[2023-12-07T13:51:57] Jan: You have committed atrocities against the scooter community 😬
[2023-12-07T13:52:42] Mirono escooters: 3 random fans too, and a glued on heatsink 😳
[2023-12-07T13:53:44] Jan: Now my day is sad..
[2023-12-07T13:53:50] Jan: I should not look into telegram
[2023-12-07T13:54:08] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2023-12-07T14:17:35] Unknown: I know they are unnecessary anyway the vesc does not goes above 60
[2023-12-07T14:18:53] Unknown: At least I don't mount my vesc outside my scoot
[2023-12-07T14:20:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I bet bro i bet But was fun like this too Also not all melt , still snowing 🤣 If it keeps up ,i am doing some forest night trip like 20 km
[2023-12-07T14:20:20] Unknown: It's astetick or however you write that haha
[2023-12-07T14:26:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Usually fans not really effective in a closed area Also there bearing in the middle will fail after a while. Best ways are heatbridging Some of does rely on a closed area airflow ,but all uses natural flow
[2023-12-07T14:29:33] haku: would fans help cooling the battery?
[2023-12-07T14:30:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is some minor differences ,like an upgraded version
[2023-12-07T14:30:07] haku: spintend sold me fans. they trolled me
[2023-12-07T14:30:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why bad?
[2023-12-07T14:30:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not really, same closed area
[2023-12-07T14:31:28] Mirono escooters: No alucpb is automatically bad for sombre 😛😛
[2023-12-07T14:31:36] Happy Giraffe: I doubt, if battery not meant to be removed then some thermally conductive tape or something and then against alu body. Offers tiny bit of cooling but impossible to cool from inside
[2023-12-07T14:31:38] Unknown: U are right and I knew that but I had to do something with them (they are not really doing something or need to do something cause temps warent high )
[2023-12-07T14:32:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Works like years ago, flawless 🤷‍♂
[2023-12-07T14:32:40] Happy Giraffe: Alupcb cooling is love. I need to CNC a case for the vesc before summer😁 Gonna be bling bling
[2023-12-07T14:32:51] Mirono escooters: 🤷 Its good vescs. I dont understand his issue
[2023-12-07T14:32:52] Unknown: I'm going either to remove them or switch them to rgb fans hhhh
[2023-12-07T14:33:25] Mirono escooters: Not much
[2023-12-07T14:33:29] Mirono escooters: Pot it with epoxy if u that worried.
[2023-12-07T14:33:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But why your pcb's get hot 😁?
[2023-12-07T14:33:47] Mirono escooters: Just remove. Its pointless
[2023-12-07T14:33:58] Mirono escooters: I'm serious happy, haha, dielectric heat conductive epoxy
[2023-12-07T14:34:00] Mirono escooters: Like my 18s
[2023-12-07T14:34:16] Jan: That implies that i have?
[2023-12-07T14:34:34] Happy Giraffe: Haha, max fet temp I got was 45°c and I have vesc bolted to as 100x200mm 3mm alu sheet only
[2023-12-07T14:34:49] Mirono escooters: Outside vescs are stupid, except in a nice hidden box like paolo
[2023-12-07T14:35:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean mosfets should get coz cant keep up with our swichings but near that🤷‍♂
[2023-12-07T14:35:14] Happy Giraffe: CNC a metal case for vesc, bolt it on scoot and make it waterproof. Profit
[2023-12-07T14:35:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cold place u have there
[2023-12-07T14:35:40] Happy Giraffe: Because they have stock left and cant sell
[2023-12-07T14:36:09] Happy Giraffe: Nah still during +20°c. Now I get max 25°c fets on winter
[2023-12-07T14:36:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: "Mine" usually bolted on some 1,5 cm one what's bolted on frame and has heatsink outside
[2023-12-07T14:36:36] Jan: Its absolutely feasable to mount inside without fans
[2023-12-07T14:36:57] Jan: <photos/photo_11393@07-12-2023_14-36-57.jpg>
[2023-12-07T14:37:12] haku: they sold me the fans fuses and a heatsink 😭
[2023-12-07T14:37:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I forgete to take a look after fun in the night, but at the point i took a look was 12C
[2023-12-07T14:37:41] Happy Giraffe: On winter I purposefully reduced cooling so vesc stays above 0 degrees lol. For summer alu box will be nice
[2023-12-07T14:37:48] Unknown: Sorry didn't mean to offend but if not in a box it's dumb
[2023-12-07T14:38:10] Jan: XD
[2023-12-07T14:38:10] Jan: <photos/photo_11252@29-11-2023_10-10-04.jpg>
[2023-12-07T14:38:12] Unknown: Maybe they are trying to get rid of some stock
[2023-12-07T14:38:50] Happy Giraffe: Oh god no...deceptive marketing
[2023-12-07T14:39:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I love when they offer studpid fuses what they sell 😅
[2023-12-07T14:39:59] Unknown: Want to get a motor for the front and another vesc that I'll have to mount it in outside box no enough space inside the frame
[2023-12-07T14:43:48] Jan: How big?
[2023-12-07T14:44:10] haku: they also sold me bullet connectors but they were banana plugs 😭
[2023-12-07T14:44:30] haku: oh amy my love
[2023-12-07T14:44:42] Unknown: What motor ? Stock zero10x one
[2023-12-07T14:56:35] Jan: Deck space
[2023-12-07T14:56:39] Jan: Inside
[2023-12-07T14:57:20] sombre_enfant: Small asf
[2023-12-07T15:04:59] Jan: You can still do a lot with small space, just need to plan every cable where it goes
[2023-12-07T15:08:35] Unknown: No not enough for another vesc
[2023-12-07T15:09:30] Unknown: By the way can I use 2 different vescs in dual motor?(75200 and a 75100)
[2023-12-07T15:15:52] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2023-12-07T15:25:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's how it's done and its a nightmare
[2023-12-07T16:07:52] francois schempers: my scooter will be a motor testbench 😂😂
[2023-12-07T18:50:38] Mirono escooters: Oh god, again?
[2023-12-07T18:50:55] Mirono escooters: He's not super consequent heh It annoys me we need a new script for every version..
[2023-12-07T18:51:06] Mirono escooters: His software is backwards compatible Why not his features 😛
[2023-12-07T18:51:23] Mirono escooters: 6.05 btw? Latest?
[2023-12-07T18:52:36] Mirono escooters: God knows what izuna compiled for me, good it works fine Except observer track bullshit 😛 I already hate the idea of tuning AWD.
[2023-12-07T18:52:48] Mirono escooters: True, good reminder.
[2023-12-07T18:53:07] Mirono escooters: Still a one man army who is flooded with request
[2023-12-07T18:53:12] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-12-07T18:53:18] Mirono escooters: (I don't know. Zuna made for me.)
[2023-12-07T18:53:47] Mirono escooters: Right after vedder fixed my issue
[2023-12-07T18:54:57] Mirono escooters: Affirmative
[2023-12-07T18:55:24] Mirono escooters: Ok in a bit
[2023-12-07T19:41:25] haku: if the deck is so crowded wouldnt it be worse because if esc catches on fire it might spread to the batteries? i always wondered this
[2023-12-07T19:42:17] sombre_enfant: @SibClimb is it possible to open surron bat to harvest cells ? Is it 21700?
[2023-12-07T19:43:02] sombre_enfant: Told you !
[2023-12-07T19:48:13] haku: if i turn vsett display into a vesc display would i have issues every time a new vesctool comes out?
[2023-12-07T19:48:33] sombre_enfant: No u dont change firmware, easier
[2023-12-07T19:49:25] haku: what is so special about 6.05 that 6.02 doesnt have?
[2023-12-07T19:58:58] haku: great. thanks
[2023-12-07T20:01:49] Ion: Does anyone have VESC tool/firmware BETA 22? ADC script doesn't work in BETA 23, and does load in BETA 21, but incorrect throttle reading (pinned at 50%)
[2023-12-07T20:02:08] Ion: Should be release between end of oct and beginning of dec
[2023-12-07T20:09:13] Gabe Enzo: @PaoloWu digga you used water bottles instead of packing foam 🤣🤣
[2023-12-07T20:09:21] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11396@07-12-2023_20-09-21.jpg>
[2023-12-07T20:09:39] Gabe Enzo: Respect for the creativity
[2023-12-07T20:23:13] Izuna 生活: He is running nothing official basically. His firmware is based on a pull request of mine that fixed the last issue vedderb introduced.
[2023-12-07T20:23:31] Izuna 生活: I will check soon
[2023-12-07T20:24:30] haku: its better to recycle than buy more plastic ;)
[2023-12-07T20:26:54] haku: thats a nice motor bro! are those the ones folks use for g30s?
[2023-12-07T20:28:43] puneDir: what happened while i was crying
[2023-12-07T20:33:45] Gabe Enzo: People use A LOT of different motors for their G30s hehe. But yes it can fit!
[2023-12-07T20:35:08] Paolo ⁭: eco-sustainability😂
[2023-12-07T20:43:37] Jan: Pfandflasche
[2023-12-07T20:43:46] Jan: At least in germany you get money for pet bottles
[2023-12-07T20:44:24] Jan: You need to fire proof it
[2023-12-07T20:45:49] Happy Giraffe: And how much does esc actually have fuel to burn? Could use some heatshield maybe to get the barrier needed
[2023-12-07T20:52:01] haku: look at @jamessoderstrom video of his esc. crazy stuff
[2023-12-07T20:52:49] haku: atleast the batteries on that video is on the outside
[2023-12-07T20:54:57] Mirono escooters: Sounds like I got 22 then
[2023-12-07T20:56:00] haku: @roscheeee got it on film even xD
[2023-12-07T20:56:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Recycling
[2023-12-07T20:56:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never buy stuff to pack also
[2023-12-07T20:58:36] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11397@07-12-2023_20-58-36.jpg>
[2023-12-07T20:58:50] Mirono escooters: @jamessoderstrom But this was the izuna compiled one, because 21 indeed had a issue
[2023-12-07T21:10:30] Ion: Can you provide the file of VESC Tool?
[2023-12-07T21:10:48] S1m 0n: IO Hawk is burning... if it wasn't even a Chinese battery
[2023-12-07T21:11:37] Ion: Does it fix the issue from BETA 21 or 23? Could you release this version or DM it if possible? Thanks
[2023-12-07T21:11:59] haku: is that a scooter company?
[2023-12-07T21:12:32] S1m 0n: Yes for the German Market. They import Vsett and Kaabo for us
[2023-12-07T21:15:24] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_11399@07-12-2023_21-15-24.jpg>
[2023-12-07T21:15:34] Mirono escooters: O o
[2023-12-07T21:15:46] haku: dam. impossible to put that out
[2023-12-07T21:15:51] Mirono escooters: No idea
[2023-12-07T21:15:56] Mirono escooters: Isn't it generic
[2023-12-07T21:16:00] S1m 0n: Also the the Warnsystem NINA was detecting the fire 🤯
[2023-12-07T21:16:00] Mirono escooters: I mean, 6.05
[2023-12-07T21:16:22] haku: those poor scooters
[2023-12-07T21:16:51] Ion: The oct release comes with BETA 21 The dec release comes with BETA 23
[2023-12-07T21:18:15] Mirono escooters: I don't run official fw, izuna compiled for me
[2023-12-07T21:18:26] Mirono escooters: So except if you have alupcb 75100, problably no good
[2023-12-07T21:18:34] Mirono escooters: Da wat
[2023-12-07T21:51:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mantis battery inside is beauty 🙈😅
[2023-12-07T21:52:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well you need to ask ,but probably was not from nothing 🤷‍♂
[2023-12-07T21:59:00] haku: sorry did not ask permission to repost it. it was in the general discussion talk a while back. it just sticked with me
[2023-12-07T22:01:53] Mirono escooters: That got reposted a bazillion times already
[2023-12-07T22:02:06] Mirono escooters: If it's been posted in this group once, it's fine to reuse.
[2023-12-07T22:02:54] haku: i was waiting for james to repost it but he must be busy
[2023-12-07T22:04:27] haku: but anyways this is what i meant of catching fire.
[2023-12-07T22:09:57] Gabe Enzo: dude its probably low power crap like 4kw peak.
[2023-12-07T22:10:07] Gabe Enzo: why even bother
[2023-12-07T22:10:24] Gabe Enzo: just sell the battery
[2023-12-07T22:14:37] Mirono escooters: Yep. Way more worth assembled then dissasembled.

[2023-12-07T22:16:39] NetworkDir: 22s
[2023-12-07T22:16:39] Gabe Enzo: What's the Max speed one has reached here with 2x 1kw motors? And with what wattage?
[2023-12-07T22:19:13] haku: i just got one of these too. i hope it can do ehat it claims
[2023-12-07T22:20:07] Gabe Enzo: Uhhh without E brake
[2023-12-07T22:20:33] Ion: they changed the name since it's built well and can handle it apparently
[2023-12-07T22:21:12] Mirono escooters: My motors got transported on a plane So theoretically, 1400kmh?
[2023-12-07T22:21:39] Gabe Enzo: Need answer
[2023-12-07T22:21:52] NetworkDir: Noice
[2023-12-07T22:22:02] NetworkDir: 22s 150A nice!
[2023-12-07T22:22:03] Mirono escooters: Depends so much
[2023-12-07T22:22:55] Ion: mach 1.1 cargo plane
[2023-12-07T22:23:37] haku: that video got me paranoid on flipskys
[2023-12-07T22:24:08] NetworkDir: Fuck it's scary
[2023-12-07T22:24:35] NetworkDir: Time to make a failure archive channel
[2023-12-07T22:24:49] NetworkDir: Finn failure roscheeee failures
[2023-12-07T22:24:52] NetworkDir: lol
[2023-12-07T22:25:38] Gabe Enzo: I just want a general answer. Im light so whoever answers, I'll obviously hit that speed
[2023-12-07T22:25:43] Gabe Enzo: Logically
[2023-12-07T22:27:36] Mirono escooters: How long do you plan to keep the speed
[2023-12-07T22:28:21] Gabe Enzo: Can't go more than 70 on these roads. I want 70 constant to get to uni. without burning
[2023-12-07T22:28:29] Gabe Enzo: Like a minute 🤣 or even 20s
[2023-12-07T22:28:42] Gabe Enzo: I just wanna say "yeah my scooter goes 100+ Bitch"
[2023-12-07T22:28:55] haku: im glad the vesc lords do these experiments so i dont have too
[2023-12-07T22:31:03] Mirono escooters: I'd say a solid 90kmh
[2023-12-07T22:31:07] Mirono escooters: If punedir can on 350w..
[2023-12-07T22:31:11] Mirono escooters: Maybe a 100 if no sag
[2023-12-07T22:31:42] puneDir: i have good motor noe
[2023-12-07T22:32:14] Gabe Enzo: Stable 90 constant??
[2023-12-07T22:32:28] Gabe Enzo: It'll be 20s7p Moli brah. wattage no problem. sag no prob
[2023-12-07T22:51:08] haku: you ballin with the molis. how much does it cost there?
[2023-12-07T22:51:15] haku: p42
[2023-12-07T22:55:21] Happy Giraffe: Yes it burned but would it keep the burning process alive for more than 3 sec?🤔
[2023-12-07T22:55:53] Gabe Enzo: Oh I have a private contact. But Im willing to spend up to 600?€
[2023-12-07T22:56:37] Gabe Enzo: Dude I quit drug addiction, cigs too. I have so much fucking money, I can afford anything.
[2023-12-07T22:59:03] haku: good job bro. this is a better addiction. scooters
[2023-12-07T22:59:26] Gabe Enzo: Might even get a G30 so I can fit more cells. 20s10p would be something else.
[2023-12-07T22:59:54] haku: yea man. those euro g30 fukin sexy
[2023-12-07T23:01:05] haku: no idea. maybe if there are wires and battery next to it
[2023-12-07T23:02:17] haku: and sealed. i dont want to experience that lol. i will moumt vesc outside. differenr compartments for different parts until i figure the correct parameters
[2023-12-07T23:18:23] Jan: Thats a lot of cells
[2023-12-07T23:18:35] Jan: Can only fit 120 into frame
[2023-12-07T23:18:41] Jan: 60 neck
[2023-12-07T23:18:55] Mirono escooters: Got a hate love with bags.. Good I won't need a external batt
[2023-12-07T23:19:11] Mirono escooters: Even a bag for my lock is too weird looking for me 💀
[2023-12-07T23:19:37] Happy Giraffe: Bought a button to enable onboard charging, was greeted with a screw in terminal😂🙈 So now gotta maybe take apart xt30 and solder wire to a pin🙈 If charger connected to battery without ac power it will atleast empty mine 0.1v per hour
[2023-12-07T23:20:16] Mirono escooters: I must be accoustic
[2023-12-07T23:20:31] Mirono escooters: But I didn't do all this work to attach a bag💀 So backpack lock it is I love the rentals with build in locks.
[2023-12-07T23:22:56] Happy Giraffe: Bags kinda suspicious for police aswell. I had my chainlock in the original battery bag from Denis. Police were interested whats in there when they stopped me🙈
[2023-12-07T23:23:28] Mirono escooters: That's just Finland moment, dont worry about bags+ police.
[2023-12-07T23:23:53] Mirono escooters: That's weird.
[2023-12-07T23:37:41] haku: how many 18650 can you fit g30 again?
[2023-12-07T23:42:02] haku: i have a bunch of cells that i thought was bad but its 11-12mOhms. i want to reuse it.
[2023-12-07T23:44:33] Gabe Enzo: Lol, you can fit more with a lowrider spacer. It'll just look weird
[2023-12-07T23:47:14] Happy Giraffe: Denmark* the same civil cop that pulled a dyno out of car trunk. But yeah chain lock in a bag is the most practical thing. And chain someway mounted on frame like I had with a tight U lock
[2023-12-08T00:19:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am talking about fire reason
[2023-12-08T00:19:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not the reposting
[2023-12-08T00:20:52] sombre_enfant: Send it to me i bought 0.50€ pieces
[2023-12-08T00:24:14] haku: i wish i could prolly tax me too sending to EU. 😭
[2023-12-08T00:25:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know him doing stuff way back
[2023-12-08T00:26:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He managed to melt out xiaomi phase connectors from the pcb
[2023-12-08T00:26:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Love that guy 😎
[2023-12-08T00:27:08] haku: i wish i was around when the vesclord council was posting stuff like that. guy must be a legend
[2023-12-08T00:28:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This was years ago😁
[2023-12-08T00:28:06] Jan: 120x 21700 without anything else you can close with stock bottom
[2023-12-08T00:28:31] Jan: I dont think you can more as you need also space for controller and bms
[2023-12-08T00:28:41] Jan: 30mm spacer gives you that space
[2023-12-08T00:29:17] haku: do you know how many 18650 can fit with spacer like yours?
[2023-12-08T00:29:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say over his most of crazy experiments ,lot can be learned in several ways.
[2023-12-08T00:29:32] Jan: With 18650 i dont know
[2023-12-08T00:32:25] Gabe Enzo: 140 prob min
[2023-12-08T00:32:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,just imagine where esc and maybe other shit takes place and measure rest
[2023-12-08T01:13:28] sombre_enfant: @kawaiinekololis please fix script
[2023-12-08T02:09:37] Ion: Im guessing this is a bug in beta FW, and not intended? While researching I couldn't find any beta FW changelogs sadly
[2023-12-08T02:57:03] Ion: yep, lots and lots of changes. I'm not gonna pretend to understand anything here, but this at least looks related: "unbound results in an error" https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/commit/27f5bb5b321f99724810742729fcce89de3d93b6
[2023-12-08T03:07:20] Izuna 生活: alright alright, it's 3am I'm making soup now and go update my VESCs...
[2023-12-08T03:24:44] Izuna 生活: I am going to try out mksesc_75_100_v2_old firmware on my makerbase 75100 v2 (the old variant)
[2023-12-08T03:24:56] Izuna 生活: wondering how it will perform if there is any difference
[2023-12-08T03:25:07] Izuna 生活: I should check parameters
[2023-12-08T03:25:10] Izuna 生活: yup
[2023-12-08T03:25:51] Izuna 生活: VIN_R2
[2023-12-08T03:27:36] Izuna 生活: normal linux situations
[2023-12-08T03:29:39] Ion: damn, hope you can recover 😅
[2023-12-08T03:34:23] Izuna 生活: hm cool
[2023-12-08T03:35:09] Izuna 生活: okay flashing
[2023-12-08T03:42:30] Izuna 生活: I am really wondering how lisp support is going to work in the future, because there is so much development that causes the work of others to break. I cannot keep updating it forever. I still remember changing the ScriptAPI in my software 3+ years ago, I gave them at least 3 years to adapt to the new system (not new language, just different functions). Now I removed the support layer for the old system and whole userbase HELLA MAD, they were furoius. Meanwhile VESC: every few beta update, break break break 💀
[2023-12-08T03:46:40] Izuna 生活: timed out 😡
[2023-12-08T03:47:45] Izuna 生活: yeah
[2023-12-08T03:56:44] Izuna 生活: Yes
[2023-12-08T03:57:25] Izuna 生活: Because flashed different model, requires firmware as bin.
[2023-12-08T03:57:38] Izuna 生活: <photos/photo_11406@08-12-2023_03-57-38.jpg>
[2023-12-08T03:57:54] Izuna 生活: Alright. Now focus on soup
[2023-12-08T03:59:25] Ion: Lisp changing every release is not sustainable, idk how that's supposed to work in the long term. But thank you for looking into it on 23
[2023-12-08T04:00:24] Izuna 生活: I don't sleep
[2023-12-08T04:00:44] Izuna 生活: Go to bed late
[2023-12-08T04:00:58] Ion: My other idea was compiling FW with your ADC fix commit from beta 21, but without the breaking lisp update. But idk if that would even work
[2023-12-08T04:01:21] Izuna 生活: Yes that would have worked. This is what I have done for @Mirono_escooters
[2023-12-08T04:01:55] Ion: Ok good to know, will try tomorrow
[2023-12-08T04:03:50] Izuna 生活: I will probably have it fixed by then
[2023-12-08T04:07:05] Ion: fair, thanks again. Also would be interesting to know what broke
[2023-12-08T04:14:05] Izuna 生活: I feel like the results are better than with the other firmware 🤨
[2023-12-08T04:14:22] Izuna 生活: But idk it's been awhile since I tested, can't remember
[2023-12-08T04:15:33] Izuna 生活: Now everything is set up and I can work on the script 👍
[2023-12-08T04:17:14] Izuna 生活: ah cool he took it out the menu and put it into the sidebar
[2023-12-08T04:25:51] Izuna 生活: ok fixed
[2023-12-08T04:26:52] Ion: 🎉 nice, what was it?
[2023-12-08T04:27:25] Izuna 生活: variable not bound
[2023-12-08T04:27:28] Izuna 生活: 🤷‍♀️
[2023-12-08T04:27:51] Izuna 生活: one sec ill show you
[2023-12-08T04:28:19] Izuna 生活: thats it
[2023-12-08T04:53:38] Izuna 生活: @Mirono_escooters I have now added the idea you suggested
[2023-12-08T04:54:22] Izuna 生活: so g30 script is 100% confirmed to be working
[2023-12-08T04:54:26] Izuna 生活: m365 script should work but idk
[2023-12-08T04:57:14] Izuna 生活: I cannot tell why but somehow my front ESC keeps disappearing from CAN since the update. The display itself is working (which is connted to the front) so the MCU is running. Bluetooth is connected to the rear ESC. 🙄
[2023-12-08T04:57:17] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 1zuna (Izuna) has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-08T05:02:32] Izuna 生活: It now checks if the button stays at the same state as 10ms before. This should reduce the risk of reading wrong button states.
[2023-12-08T05:02:49] Izuna 生活: After booting. I cannot access it at all currently.
[2023-12-08T05:03:58] Izuna 生活: Yes I know. Thats not what happend here... :/
[2023-12-08T05:06:51] Izuna 生活: Yes it was fine until now xd have been driving a lot yesterday and everything back to normal
[2023-12-08T05:07:03] Izuna 生活: and I mean it still works, its just that CAN is not responding
[2023-12-08T05:07:39] Izuna 生活: The issue is that I cannot access the ESC without opening the scooter... and the scooter is fully sealed with silicone. I gone crazy this time
[2023-12-08T05:08:18] Izuna 生活: cannot tell
[2023-12-08T05:08:32] Izuna 生活: display/throttle is connected to front
[2023-12-08T05:08:39] Izuna 生活: and ADC app is turned off
[2023-12-08T05:16:27] Izuna 生活: no idea, have to look into it later, i hope it fixes itself 😂 i really dont want to open this scooter again 😭
[2023-12-08T05:27:21] haku: TEVERUN TETRA - Teverun Electric Scooter https://teverun.com/teverun-tetra/
[2023-12-08T05:27:30] haku: this is wild
[2023-12-08T05:31:19] haku: anyone know the price?
[2023-12-08T05:41:56] haku: 1st time ive seen a quad scooter. this would be good for snow and all terain
[2023-12-08T05:47:59] haku: and rear drive drifting
[2023-12-08T08:10:46] sombre_enfant: I had same issue on box 2 weeks ago
[2023-12-08T08:28:14] S1m 0n: Can be, but IO Hawk not using original Kaabo/Vsett Battery. They use customizing ones
[2023-12-08T08:28:57] sombre_enfant: Same layout tho
[2023-12-08T08:32:17] S1m 0n: How it can be Same same Layout, when original Mantis 10 has 16s and German one 13s? Vsett 10 also original 16s in German 14s
[2023-12-08T08:41:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What i ment in the mantis is the layout , maybe made similar🤷‍♂
[2023-12-08T08:41:40] Konstantin: Hah, somebody read correct value;))) but they still sometimes change them, they don't care about value;)))
[2023-12-08T08:47:49] S1m 0n: can have many reasons... n battery... a customer battery that was there because of a technical defect, or even arson... IO Hawk has made a lot of enemies in the last few years. It could even have been IO Hawk himself... at least I wouldn't rule it out, after everything I've experienced with them over the last few years 😄
[2023-12-08T08:48:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have no experience with them can be a lot things that's true
[2023-12-08T08:49:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did you saw a battery like that open?
[2023-12-08T08:50:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Here in the summer was a fire in a service, a home made shit made fire , was huge 🤷‍♂
[2023-12-08T08:52:06] S1m 0n: I saw a few pictures online. they actually looked well made. But I've also seen pictures of newly purchased scooters where the motors/batteries or other parts had already started to rust
[2023-12-08T08:54:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh
[2023-12-08T08:57:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably home bugged ,but mantis
[2023-12-08T09:02:43] S1m 0n: What a mess 😄
[2023-12-08T09:15:11] S1m 0n: German Vsett 10 14s Battery. Looks ok so far 30A
[2023-12-08T09:15:14] S1m 0n: Mantis 10 thread is too old. That would take forever to search
[2023-12-08T09:46:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah Imagine you store such in the house
[2023-12-08T09:48:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The one on the video yes
[2023-12-08T09:50:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Last crap i saw irl
[2023-12-08T09:51:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_11413@08-12-2023_09-51-03.jpg>
[2023-12-08T09:52:05] S1m 0n: Yes similar new Battery i also seen
[2023-12-08T09:52:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fun fact is ,shrink tube was good on it
[2023-12-08T09:53:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So it was rotting inside from the moment they made it
[2023-12-08T09:54:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am just guessing, that's just nickel plated steel and he didn't clean shit after soldering the wires and it started corrosion
[2023-12-08T10:14:50] Mirono escooters: I hope it works
[2023-12-08T10:14:55] Mirono escooters: Tis annoying when I brake hard xd
[2023-12-08T10:32:04] haku: isnt vsett 10 16s?
[2023-12-08T10:32:45] S1m 0n: German Version only 14s
[2023-12-08T10:34:54] haku: thats crazy. might aswell get a vsett 9 if 10 is only 14s
[2023-12-08T10:35:58] sombre_enfant: 10+ not that good no 11"...
[2023-12-08T10:36:20] S1m 0n: It is only the frame from Vsett 10. Battery is 14s, Contoller is from Zero
[2023-12-08T10:37:10] S1m 0n: Hehe and look at the price for the slimmed-down German version (smaller Battery, Bad Motor/s)
[2023-12-08T10:38:29] haku: wow the decks are slimmer so you cant mod. thats crazy
[2023-12-08T10:39:44] haku: is 48v the limit there?
[2023-12-08T10:43:59] S1m 0n: No decks the Same
[2023-12-08T10:44:44] S1m 0n: No.. the Vsett 10 is 54,6V and its cuming a new Scooter with 60 or 72V
[2023-12-08T10:45:51] S1m 0n: Oh no, the new Scooter also have 48V 🤦‍♂️
[2023-12-08T10:49:05] haku: i do like the german ninebots though. the blue ones
[2023-12-08T10:50:24] S1m 0n: Ninebot is still the most customer-friendly scooter😃
[2023-12-08T10:55:38] francois schempers: /approve @kawaiinekololis he legit don't spam
[2023-12-08T10:55:38] Rose: 1zuna (Izuna) has been approved in Vesc / Scooter group! They will now be ignored by automated admin actions like locks, blocklists, and antiflood. Reason: he legit don't spam
[2023-12-08T11:05:18] francois schempers: just so you guys know, approved persons are not monitored by rose, we will approve members who contribute good content and elevates the group. approval can be taken too if you abuse it
[2023-12-08T11:09:51] Mirono escooters: The price should be illegal for what you get.
[2023-12-08T11:12:44] Oreo huzky: Tf
[2023-12-08T11:15:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Had tf now

[2023-12-08T11:16:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅😅
[2023-12-08T11:19:18] S1m 0n: all there prices are illegal
[2023-12-08T13:34:33] Finn: Thats why we mod g30 and pro2 here to its limit
[2023-12-08T13:34:54] Finn: Because its cheaper and faster/stronger
[2023-12-08T13:42:04] Gabe Enzo: is ferrofluid really needed?
[2023-12-08T13:42:26] Gabe Enzo: My mom's m365 has 48v 🗿
[2023-12-08T13:45:57] Finn: Ez
[2023-12-08T13:46:27] Mirono escooters: Yes..
[2023-12-08T13:57:17] Gabe Enzo: Does off brand matter. And how much of it?
[2023-12-08T14:00:49] Mirono escooters: Statorade is best
[2023-12-08T14:00:53] Mirono escooters: But I got a fine alternative
[2023-12-08T14:01:00] Mirono escooters: Like 5-6ml depends on motor
[2023-12-08T14:02:35] Gabe Enzo: What is it.
[2023-12-08T14:02:43] Gabe Enzo: the more the better. correct?
[2023-12-08T14:02:59] Mirono escooters: Supermagnete.de
[2023-12-08T14:03:09] Mirono escooters: Noooooooo
[2023-12-08T14:03:16] Mirono escooters: There's a limit when u just get a lot of drag
[2023-12-08T14:04:07] Gabe Enzo: That's a magnet site. what do I search up? ferrofluid?
[2023-12-08T14:04:12] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11417@08-12-2023_14-04-12.jpg>
[2023-12-08T14:04:12] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-12-08T14:04:20] Gabe Enzo: Ohhhhhhhh it's that magnet shit
[2023-12-08T14:04:25] Gabe Enzo: Lmao all makes sense now
[2023-12-08T14:08:51] Happy Giraffe: It helps to cool motor a lot but also you gotta be careful not to run motor at 80°c+ to avoid heating magnets excessively
[2023-12-08T14:10:15] Gabe Enzo: What's that tool called that's a cutting saw on the floor and it can be used to cut metal blocks? Not An angle grinder
[2023-12-08T14:11:33] Happy Giraffe: Circular saw? Table saw?
[2023-12-08T14:12:09] Happy Giraffe: Only seen saw cut soft aluminium
[2023-12-08T14:12:56] Gabe Enzo: Need to cut metal Alu blocks in a triangle shape to push the escs to the concaving part of the pro 2. so more cell space.
[2023-12-08T14:13:02] Gabe Enzo: exactly what ima cut anyway
[2023-12-08T14:13:55] Happy Giraffe: Why not a hand opersted saw then with a bi-metal blade? Costs 20€ and you have lot of control
[2023-12-08T14:14:21] Gabe Enzo: I had that issue before
[2023-12-08T14:14:44] Gabe Enzo: ohhhh
[2023-12-08T14:14:56] Happy Giraffe: Gotta know what your source material is first ofc. Can saw on both ends
[2023-12-08T14:24:37] Mirono escooters: Band saw
[2023-12-08T14:24:52] Mirono escooters: It does anything
[2023-12-08T14:25:11] Mirono escooters: Expensive tho and "safe" Grinder works fine
[2023-12-08T14:47:58] Rose: Hey there Constance, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-08T14:55:56] francois schempers: some train brakes for yall 😂😂 imagine installing that on a scooter

[2023-12-08T15:13:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And imagine still trains brake distance from 60km/h is like 800 m
[2023-12-08T15:14:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But different weight 😁
[2023-12-08T15:25:37] Happy Giraffe: Yes if he meant that then ofc
[2023-12-08T15:26:15] Ion: @kawaiinekololis script with commit "button debounce" works, but last one "optimize" somehow doesn't? just a heads up. I'll use the working one
[2023-12-08T15:26:25] Ion: <photos/photo_11419@08-12-2023_15-26-25.jpg>
[2023-12-08T15:26:34] Ion: Beta 23, Ubox 80
[2023-12-08T15:26:55] sombre_enfant: Do theres no limit 6.05? For 80100
[2023-12-08T15:28:26] Ion: UBOX? there is for me, enable this
[2023-12-08T15:28:53] sombre_enfant: Ohhhh
[2023-12-08T15:29:38] sombre_enfant: I will try that i need to update to beta 23... Do the script works now ?
[2023-12-08T15:44:41] francois schempers: @kawaiinekololis one more thing, I'm gonna directly connect adc and brake so the script don't need that, can I just use the script for display info ? I'll mod the on/off button too
[2023-12-08T15:46:20] Rose: Hey there 1946, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-08T15:52:53] sombre_enfant: Why u dont connect it to the Dashboard ?
[2023-12-08T16:00:19] francois schempers: because if the script fail, I just loose the screen, I still have all the controls since they are directly connected to Vesc
[2023-12-08T16:19:36] Rose: Hey there Steven, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-08T16:23:57] Mirono escooters: Did a Script even fail yet?
[2023-12-08T16:33:31] francois schempers: I don't want to add middle man when it's unnecessary, you just add failing points, If I can use a cable instead of a ble+script, I'll do it. that way it's more reliable
[2023-12-08T16:46:41] Mirono escooters: True
[2023-12-08T16:46:49] Mirono escooters: If throttle fail, 100% power tho : D
[2023-12-08T16:47:38] sombre_enfant: If u have ebrake wired its ok
[2023-12-08T16:47:49] Mirono escooters: Yeah
[2023-12-08T16:47:58] Mirono escooters: Except element of surprise like on bike
[2023-12-08T16:58:42] Gabe Enzo: Imagine being stuck in the middle of nowhere because the script stopped working and having to open up the dashboard and bypassing the BLE
[2023-12-08T16:58:57] Gabe Enzo: Rewiring all the wires by twisting and shit Lmao
[2023-12-08T17:06:51] puneDir: or use vesc 6.02
[2023-12-08T17:18:44] Thierry: Sometime main vesc change ID to same as slave so slave disappears, maybe it is your issue?
[2023-12-08T17:19:59] Thierry: It is exactly what I've done, also to stay on stable release as I don't need to detach adc.
[2023-12-08T17:42:55] haku: why is ebike windings say 3.5t,5t and scooters 33x2
[2023-12-08T17:43:05] haku: what does 33x2 mean
[2023-12-08T17:45:29] haku: i know what ebikes mean turns. scooters i dont know
[2023-12-08T18:53:37] S1m 0n: Maybe 33 cogging steps per Turn Windings Factor 2
[2023-12-08T18:58:01] Happy Giraffe: Same thing, scooter motors need much less torque per amp for high speed as the tire is smaller and typically used in awd
[2023-12-08T19:01:52] Rose: Hey there iMarek, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-08T19:03:16] haku: so 33x2 means 33 turns and 2 means what?
[2023-12-08T19:03:29] haku: sorry so many questions
[2023-12-08T19:05:07] Gabe Enzo: magnet size
[2023-12-08T19:05:32] Gabe Enzo: I think
[2023-12-08T19:06:16] S1m 0n: Yes its realstic, when its a small Motor
[2023-12-08T19:07:02] haku: not magnet.
[2023-12-08T19:08:26] S1m 0n: What Motor it is?
[2023-12-08T19:09:48] haku: its ly motor 70h
[2023-12-08T19:10:09] haku: i asked for winding specs they said 33x2
[2023-12-08T19:10:26] Gabe Enzo: Should I change the awg of these wires if I'm planning to push 100a ESC? idk how much phase that is. 300a?
[2023-12-08T19:10:33] Gabe Enzo: but there's no way these wires will handle this shit
[2023-12-08T19:10:39] S1m 0n: It would be better to google "cogging steps blcd" and "windings factor" in your language. I don't know why you should enter this data in the product data
[2023-12-08T19:12:02] sombre_enfant: Man wtf @kawaiinekololis
[2023-12-08T19:12:02] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_11423@08-12-2023_19-12-02.jpg>
[2023-12-08T19:13:01] S1m 0n: Or each phase consists of 33 cores and has been wound twice each
[2023-12-08T19:13:06] Mirono escooters: Those r tiiny
[2023-12-08T19:13:20] Mirono escooters: 100a = 300a?
[2023-12-08T19:14:07] Mirono escooters: It'll be fine peak xd
[2023-12-08T19:14:14] Mirono escooters: You ain't pushing continuous near that
[2023-12-08T19:15:27] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2023-12-08T19:19:32] sombre_enfant: And i cant downoald new vesc apk
[2023-12-08T19:19:46] sombre_enfant: <files/vesc_tool_test_android.apk>
[2023-12-08T19:21:00] Gabe Enzo: Planning 3.5kw cont
[2023-12-08T19:22:05] Gabe Enzo: Vallety has no heat issues with 2500w and he's 75kg same motor as me
[2023-12-08T19:23:30] Gabe Enzo: Like per wire because it's split into 3 yknow what I mean? so only one wire at a time is on
[2023-12-08T19:24:43] Jhinzuo ~~: AC doesn't split amps across all 3phases no?
[2023-12-08T19:25:17] Gabe Enzo: Damnit sannio misleading me again
[2023-12-08T19:26:05] Gabe Enzo: I mean it sends all the amps through one wire and then it alternates between the other 2 constantly so the wires don't heat up even tho they're severely small. each wire gets a break every once in a while. With DC they would all burn
[2023-12-08T19:27:38] Jhinzuo ~~: They still burn on AC with the amount u plan
[2023-12-08T19:28:04] Jhinzuo ~~: They don't look thicker than I have on g30 gen1
[2023-12-08T19:28:54] Jhinzuo ~~: With xiaodash can't be sure watt reading is correct
[2023-12-08T19:29:32] haku: buy i love china branded motors. very thick wires
[2023-12-08T19:30:11] Gabe Enzo: With how packed these wires are, I'm pretty sure that 12awg would contain the same molecular mass of copper as this thin wire. it just has a thin coating of like plastic, whereas silicone awg wires are 50% silicone
[2023-12-08T19:30:28] Gabe Enzo: So I'm unsure if I could even change them. if it makes any sense to
[2023-12-08T19:30:50] Gabe Enzo: You can see the copper through the coating
[2023-12-08T19:31:00] Jhinzuo ~~: Idc how much isolation. What's awg rating from the wire
[2023-12-08T19:31:07] Jhinzuo ~~: Is there anything stamped on it
[2023-12-08T19:32:40] Gabe Enzo: It's the same as Xiaomi 300w motors.
[2023-12-08T19:32:49] Gabe Enzo: It's equal to 18awg by size.
[2023-12-08T19:34:14] Jhinzuo ~~: And they are thin coated as well so I guess it's no lower than 16awg
[2023-12-08T19:34:51] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2023-12-08T19:35:21] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2023-12-08T19:38:27] Gabe Enzo: Actually maybe I won't need to change these wires. Paolo said I shouldn't push more than 2.5kw on it.
[2023-12-08T19:38:56] Gabe Enzo: Xiaomi pro 2 motor wires handles 2.5kw just fine
[2023-12-08T19:39:01] Mirono escooters: Obviously
[2023-12-08T19:39:22] Gabe Enzo: How the hell does Finn push 9kw with 1.2kw?
[2023-12-08T19:39:53] Mirono escooters: Let's keep it at black magic
[2023-12-08T19:40:00] Gabe Enzo: Maybe he's 8yo
[2023-12-08T19:40:02] Mirono escooters: Easiest explanation
[2023-12-08T19:46:06] Gabe Enzo: If I add a temp sensor Ill lose the original wire niceness @Mirono_escooters. Should I just leave it and not bother?
[2023-12-08T19:46:16] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11424@08-12-2023_19-46-16.jpg>
[2023-12-08T20:04:53] Happy Giraffe: The T supposedly means Turns per Tooth so makes perfect sense why thicker wires fit less turns per tooth
[2023-12-08T20:08:00] haku: so in scooter talk 33x2 is high speed or high torque?
[2023-12-08T20:09:52] sombre_enfant: High speed
[2023-12-08T20:11:37] haku: thank you. i still dont understand the science of it
[2023-12-08T20:14:44] Paolo ⁭: The meaning of "flip" "sky"
[2023-12-08T20:14:53] Mirono escooters: A temp sensor is noob proof, great for you : D
[2023-12-08T20:16:20] haku: 😂
[2023-12-08T20:16:53] Paolo ⁭: Was me with flipsky box edition 😂
[2023-12-08T20:16:55] haku: how that does even happen lol
[2023-12-08T20:18:37] Paolo ⁭: I forgot to tighten the brake caliper screw
[2023-12-08T20:27:12] Ion: newest doesn't work, read what I wrote above lol
[2023-12-08T20:27:27] Ion: here
[2023-12-08T20:28:07] Ion: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/blob/3893339d70c2652a1ce9a490d8bbccce86883d65/g30_dash.lisp
[2023-12-08T20:28:19] Ion: this one works "added button debounce"
[2023-12-08T20:38:45] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-12-08T20:50:32] haku: anyone has a side by side size comparison of spintend 80/100 and 85/200?
[2023-12-08T20:53:41] Izuna 生活: use the one before the commit optimuze
[2023-12-08T20:54:01] Izuna 生活: that's where my vesc disconnected
[2023-12-08T20:59:04] Izuna 生活: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/blob/3893339d70c2652a1ce9a490d8bbccce86883d65/g30_dash.lisp @lBabacar
[2023-12-08T20:59:08] Izuna 生活: that's the working one
[2023-12-08T20:59:38] Finn: 9kw ez
[2023-12-08T20:59:47] Finn: and im 18yo with a driving license
[2023-12-08T20:59:53] Gabe Enzo: for 1 sec maybe
[2023-12-08T21:00:08] Finn: you watched the run i did
[2023-12-08T21:00:10] haku: anyone use this thing?
[2023-12-08T21:00:12] Finn: 80+ for like a minute
[2023-12-08T21:00:17] Gabe Enzo: na, show it
[2023-12-08T21:00:23] Finn: lemme grab it rq
[2023-12-08T21:04:23] Finn: Okay it wasnt a minute but still. Video uploading..
[2023-12-08T21:04:56] Finn: @
[2023-12-08T21:05:03] Finn: @Megacorporate
[2023-12-08T21:05:33] Finn: also my phone almost flew away
[2023-12-08T21:05:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Finn has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-08T21:06:41] Gabe Enzo: how did you mount the handlebars to not move, the pro 2 stem thing has these 2 little edges on them that stick into the original handlebars to prevent it from moving.
[2023-12-08T21:08:18] Finn: I spend a lot of time to modify the handlebar
[2023-12-08T21:08:36] Gabe Enzo: What did you have to do?
[2023-12-08T21:08:45] Finn: drill a lot of holes
[2023-12-08T21:08:58] Gabe Enzo: also how many cells u got again?
[2023-12-08T21:09:02] Gabe Enzo: internal and external
[2023-12-08T21:09:11] Finn: 20s4p(16s4p + 4s4p)
[2023-12-08T21:09:20] Gabe Enzo: im doing 20s7p moli.
[2023-12-08T21:09:22] Finn: didnt have time to redo my 20s4p inside
[2023-12-08T21:09:26] Finn: ok
[2023-12-08T21:09:44] Gabe Enzo: how often do you charge lol
[2023-12-08T21:09:50] Gabe Enzo: thats only 1.2kwh
[2023-12-08T21:09:53] Finn: uh i dont drive it daily
[2023-12-08T21:10:07] Finn: i got my 20s g30 for daily use
[2023-12-08T21:10:18] Gabe Enzo: whats ya range if you dont mind me asking? pro 2
[2023-12-08T21:10:25] haku: learning deutch slowly
[2023-12-08T21:10:25] Finn: uh around 50km
[2023-12-08T21:10:28] Finn: on flat road
[2023-12-08T21:10:41] Gabe Enzo: sheeesh thats heavy. i was expecting u to say 30
[2023-12-08T21:10:48] Finn: nah
[2023-12-08T21:10:55] Finn: i weight arround 55kg
[2023-12-08T21:11:02] Gabe Enzo: ah, sannio clone.
[2023-12-08T21:11:13] Izuna 生活: My VESC is still not showing up :((((
[2023-12-08T21:11:13] Finn: mhm
[2023-12-08T21:11:46] Gabe Enzo: Finn where u get those handlebars from?
[2023-12-08T21:11:57] Finn: amazon.de
[2023-12-08T21:21:32] Izuna 生活: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/tree/6_05_adc Ion Could you please check if it works now? I have now fixed the issue with the /= and also added profile parameters for field weakening
[2023-12-08T21:21:54] Izuna 生活: i would check it myself but eh no connection XD
[2023-12-08T21:22:07] Izuna 生活: need to open my damn thing up and connect with USB : (
[2023-12-08T21:22:32] Ion: yea I can check, one moment
[2023-12-08T21:26:15] Ion: @kawaiinekololis
[2023-12-08T21:26:20] Izuna 生活: ah ok one sec
[2023-12-08T21:26:37] Izuna 生活: typo xd
[2023-12-08T21:27:07] Izuna 生活: now again : )
[2023-12-08T21:27:48] Ion: fixed the typo, script did upload
[2023-12-08T21:28:41] Ion: display and ADC work and FW in secret sport works
[2023-12-08T21:29:47] Izuna 生活: : )
[2023-12-08T21:29:48] Izuna 生活: great
[2023-12-08T21:29:59] Ion: yea nice
[2023-12-08T21:30:01] sombre_enfant: Not working, it upload dash dont do the stuff, only one esc show
[2023-12-08T21:30:18] Izuna 生活: you get the same issue with VESC only showing one ESC via CAN?
[2023-12-08T21:30:23] Izuna 生活: I got the same issue
[2023-12-08T21:30:28] Ion: I don't have dual to test sadly, only single motor
[2023-12-08T21:30:33] Izuna 生活: beta bug again 💀
[2023-12-08T21:30:42] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2023-12-08T21:30:50] Izuna 生活: I will report it to vedderb asap
[2023-12-08T21:30:50] Rose: Hey there Tommy ª, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-08T21:31:09] sombre_enfant: Fuck them beta
[2023-12-08T21:31:49] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_11428@08-12-2023_21-31-49.jpg>
[2023-12-08T21:32:30] Ion: are you sure that you are using the new commit
[2023-12-08T21:32:48] sombre_enfant: Please halp why battery % dont show on dash
[2023-12-08T21:33:02] sombre_enfant: I used last zuna links
[2023-12-08T21:33:11] Ion: only in "secret" mode, hold brake and throttle and press button 2 times
[2023-12-08T21:33:16] Ion: then it shows :)
[2023-12-08T21:33:24] Izuna 生活: it only shows on unlock mode
[2023-12-08T21:33:33] Izuna 生活: ah ion already said that
[2023-12-08T21:33:33] Izuna 生活: xd
[2023-12-08T21:33:42] sombre_enfant: No more on idle ?
[2023-12-08T21:33:52] Izuna 生活: no police was angry
[2023-12-08T21:34:24] sombre_enfant: I dont have 3 hands tho...
[2023-12-08T21:34:31] Ion: lol, but was it fine? your scooter looks very modded :)
[2023-12-08T21:34:49] Ion: bro use same hand for throttle and button 😅
[2023-12-08T21:35:33] Tommy ª: that was smart 🗿🍷

[2023-12-08T21:36:18] sombre_enfant: I just cant
[2023-12-08T21:36:37] Ion: Vsett nice, I have a VESC vsett 10+, but without dash, only use phone app
[2023-12-08T21:37:15] Izuna 生活: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/issues/658#issuecomment-1847814617
[2023-12-08T21:37:17] Izuna 生活: I have reported it
[2023-12-08T21:37:23] Izuna 生活: below my old post about CAN and Lisp
[2023-12-08T21:37:27] Izuna 生活: somehow this shit never works as intended
[2023-12-08T21:37:28] Izuna 生活: fuck this
[2023-12-08T21:37:51] sombre_enfant: Can you change to only Throttle oe brake not both😔
[2023-12-08T21:38:28] Tommy ª: casually i put one of these but with a small cover for the water no more opening the thing
[2023-12-08T21:38:41] haku: gotcha thanks
[2023-12-08T21:39:46] Tommy ª: casually i wanted to ask the same, sometimes i use the brake under acceleration
[2023-12-08T21:39:50] Paolo ⁭: Many times ago happened hahaha
[2023-12-08T21:40:04] Paolo ⁭: Clone Xiaomi frame 18s 85kmh
[2023-12-08T21:41:53] Jan: Why need this?
[2023-12-08T21:41:58] Jan: What motor size?
[2023-12-08T21:42:03] Paolo ⁭: Yes, 18s4p 50e battery and 50h blade motor, I sold for 300€ because was very very scary
[2023-12-08T21:42:08] Jan: You need a lot of amps else no torque
[2023-12-08T21:42:24] haku: just asking what it meant. thats my motor specs.
[2023-12-08T21:42:26] Paolo ⁭: It has crazy torque
[2023-12-08T21:42:36] Ion: Yeah I'm leaving 6.02 on my vsett for now
[2023-12-08T21:42:38] Jan: Not at 10A
[2023-12-08T21:42:43] sombre_enfant: 90h
[2023-12-08T21:42:49] Paolo ⁭: We pushing it 300A phase
[2023-12-08T21:42:56] Jan: Ok then it has crazy
[2023-12-08T21:43:12] sombre_enfant: Im bored my scooter never run...
[2023-12-08T21:43:19] Paolo ⁭: Actually 579A phase maximum reached
[2023-12-08T21:43:19] Tommy ª: this guy is using vesc on a car 💀
[2023-12-08T21:43:49] sombre_enfant: Not sucé yet
[2023-12-08T21:44:19] sombre_enfant: Yes it was showing
[2023-12-08T21:44:30] Paolo ⁭: Dual obviously
[2023-12-08T21:44:40] sombre_enfant: He need to fix Android app too.
[2023-12-08T21:44:41] Paolo ⁭: For 10 inch 60h is pretty much
[2023-12-08T21:45:08] sombre_enfant: The 75200 was sweating
[2023-12-08T21:45:48] Tommy ª: Anyone has experienced the wheels locking trying to brake with field weakening?
[2023-12-08T21:45:58] sombre_enfant: Less than 22x3?
[2023-12-08T21:46:23] Paolo ⁭: Obviously highest kV lowest the torque
[2023-12-08T21:49:19] sombre_enfant: No
[2023-12-08T21:49:30] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2023-12-08T21:50:08] sombre_enfant: If someone can clutch me a vesc tool with ubox 80 no limit 6.0😭
[2023-12-08T22:03:04] Mirono escooters: Y not vsett screen
[2023-12-08T22:05:07] Mirono escooters: Scroll issue?
[2023-12-08T22:11:14] haku: how big is the 85/200 compared to these?
[2023-12-08T22:13:49] haku: my setup will be like this. it would be cool if someone compare the size of 80/100 and 85/200. i want to know if i can fit it in stem
[2023-12-08T22:16:10] Jan: You could fit controller also in deck?
[2023-12-08T22:17:33] haku: no i want it in the stem i compared battery compositions and 20s10p seems best according to battery folks
[2023-12-08T22:18:03] haku: <photos/photo_11434@08-12-2023_22-18-03.jpg>
[2023-12-08T22:18:03] haku: <photos/photo_11338@04-12-2023_03-46-50.jpg>
[2023-12-08T22:18:42] haku: the 1st one is 20s10p 2nd one can fit up to 22s but 8 or 9p
[2023-12-08T22:19:44] haku: i can also mount it on side but only 9p
[2023-12-08T22:30:51] haku: man i guess i just have to purchase 85/200 and see 😭

[2023-12-08T22:32:44] francois schempers: 😘
[2023-12-08T22:33:34] sombre_enfant: 130€
[2023-12-08T22:33:56] Ion: @kawaiinekololis idk if it's configuration issue or expected behavior but double click changes to secret mode without brake + throttle. And can't get into other modes
[2023-12-08T22:34:34] haku: vesc lords. do you guys have a comparisson? or should i ask the fardriver lords?
[2023-12-08T22:34:36] Izuna 生活: Ok that shouldn't be the case. I will look into it when I get access to my VESC (😭), have you configured ADC correctly already?
[2023-12-08T22:35:23] Ion: <video_file>
[2023-12-08T22:35:33] Ion: Yea (I think so at least), ADC works
[2023-12-08T22:36:55] Ion: ADC works as expected, this is the idle values
[2023-12-08T22:37:31] Izuna 生活: That is too high
[2023-12-08T22:37:50] Izuna 生活: The idle values should be at zero
[2023-12-08T22:38:10] Izuna 生活: Why is it showing 0.19...?
[2023-12-08T22:38:13] Izuna 生活: man vesc wtf
[2023-12-08T22:38:31] Ion: I can try and re-calibrate. but it does technically work tho :)
[2023-12-08T23:32:09] Happy Giraffe: You gotta tell more info, which vesc, firmware, setup etc
[2023-12-08T23:35:53] Tommy ª: Shitsky 75100 6.02, now im on 6.05 but still the same a old 900w electric scooter i read about this danger of field weakening, i have the same problem when im on the "field speed" when i press the brake o just release the thorttle the wheel locks at max normal speed for example going at 57kmh (without FW 48kmh) the wheel insta-lock at 50kmh
[2023-12-08T23:37:19] haku: what? what do you mean insta lock?
[2023-12-08T23:37:35] haku: thats really bad
[2023-12-08T23:38:58] Tommy ª: it locks at 50kmh i mean not fully locked but it locks at the max voltaje speed i got over 70kmh downhill with field weakening but when i depress the thorttle that thing got crazy
[2023-12-08T23:39:47] haku: i see. sorry i thought you mean the wheels sieze up.
[2023-12-08T23:44:53] Izuna 生活: <photos/photo_11438@08-12-2023_23-44-53.jpg>
[2023-12-08T23:44:55] Izuna 生活: I am so glad
[2023-12-08T23:45:01] Izuna 生活: I was able to recover my access to the front ESC
[2023-12-08T23:45:08] Izuna 生活: 🙏
[2023-12-08T23:45:59] Izuna 生活: @Mirono_escooters Now the big amount of MKS75100 comes in handy that I can use to diagnose the issue. :)
[2023-12-08T23:46:43] Izuna 生活: Yes of course.
[2023-12-08T23:46:47] Izuna 生活: That is first step I do.
[2023-12-08T23:46:49] Izuna 生活: @lBabacar had the same issue, it is something with Lisp.
[2023-12-08T23:50:46] Izuna 生活: yeah idk
[2023-12-08T23:50:50] Izuna 生活: it somehow flashed both
[2023-12-08T23:53:16] Izuna 生活: somehow (can-list-devs) also reports nil 🤔
[2023-12-08T23:53:52] Izuna 生活: honestly I have no idea how to reproduce this issue
[2023-12-09T00:00:03] Izuna 生活: Yes
[2023-12-09T00:00:06] Izuna 生活: It was never an issue
[2023-12-09T00:00:09] Izuna 生活: my CAN is working great.
[2023-12-09T00:00:13] Izuna 生活: It is 100% software bug
[2023-12-09T00:19:20] Izuna 生活: i just tried reproducing the issue by uploading the script to the front
[2023-12-09T00:19:23] Izuna 生活: it now works?? 💀
[2023-12-09T00:20:05] Izuna 生活: but can-scan has some issues 100% after uploading, after uploading it will sometimes show can scan timed out and shit
[2023-12-09T00:25:40] Izuna 生活: ok ill just try configuring everything now and well see what happens 🤔
[2023-12-09T00:38:07] Izuna 生活: <video_file>
[2023-12-09T00:38:28] Izuna 生活: Well everything works now? I have no idea what issue I caused before but I have done everything the same.
[2023-12-09T00:39:52] Tommy ª: from civic with laptop here it comes xiaomi with laptop 💀
[2023-12-09T00:46:01] Izuna 生活: I was not able to reproduce your issue
[2023-12-09T00:46:06] Izuna 生活: It works for me ™️
[2023-12-09T00:47:20] Ion: I will reset and try again. Idk what the reason could be. Were you able to replicate the button issue?
[2023-12-09T00:47:31] Izuna 生活: No
[2023-12-09T00:47:34] Izuna 生活: thats what I mean
[2023-12-09T00:47:42] Izuna 生活: double press normally changes the speed mode for me
[2023-12-09T00:47:53] Izuna 生活: and only goes into secret when i press throttle and brake
[2023-12-09T00:51:46] Izuna 生活: Haha yes...
[2023-12-09T01:19:43] Ion: I'll see tomorrow, but thanks for checking
[2023-12-09T01:20:54] Izuna 生活: @jamessoderstrom I reproduced the issue again and I may now know what it's caused by.
[2023-12-09T01:22:57] Paolo ⁭: What?
[2023-12-09T01:30:41] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: 100*2 200*2
[2023-12-09T01:32:16] Tommy ª: i love the ximi screen o a vsett
[2023-12-09T01:36:18] Izuna 生活: @jamessoderstrom :))
[2023-12-09T01:42:44] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Just bug with can line?
[2023-12-09T01:43:04] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Which gets weird error after dashboard(screen, BLE)reboot
[2023-12-09T01:45:18] Izuna 生活: At the moment it does. Before it did not... Not sure why
[2023-12-09T01:49:15] Izuna 生活: Ok lmao, now it works just normal. I can turn on and off and both stay working.
[2023-12-09T01:49:22] Izuna 生活: This issue is absolutely random as it seems.
[2023-12-09T01:50:35] Tommy ª: imagine a loose can cable messing all 💀
[2023-12-09T01:52:46] Izuna 生活: Yes @lBabacar says he had the same issues
[2023-12-09T01:53:26] Izuna 生活: Also before updating to the firmware this issue was not present!!
[2023-12-09T01:53:33] Izuna 生活: It has to be software related
[2023-12-09T01:56:23] Izuna 生活: no no im not
[2023-12-09T01:56:25] Izuna 生活: still on my scooter
[2023-12-09T01:56:54] Izuna 生活: in case vedderb not able to reproduce it, I will try to get a testbench running and try to reproduce it on it
[2023-12-09T02:01:09] Izuna 生活: I sent him two videos, one that one I sent here with the shutdown entirely breaking it and another one (read the message). I hope that helps.
[2023-12-09T02:19:42] Happy Giraffe: Hope he changes "pairing done" setting aswell😂
[2023-12-09T02:23:25] Happy Giraffe: PTSD worse than Vietnam. Sucks to ride bike home and open up...😂
[2023-12-09T03:03:53] Ion: It "fixed" iself by resetting everything And doing script and ADC setup again... I'm guessing mode switching wasn't working because it registered the brake and throttle being pressed constantly, so it satisfied the condition
[2023-12-09T03:04:04] Ion: <photos/photo_11442@09-12-2023_03-04-04.jpg>
[2023-12-09T03:04:48] Ion: Now it properly detects both at 0 😅
[2023-12-09T03:05:21] haku: if these can handle 150a according to spintend should i replace the phase cables and battery cable to thicker ones?
[2023-12-09T03:07:32] haku: thats battery according to spintend. i will test it
[2023-12-09T03:08:46] haku: do you think it can do that?
[2023-12-09T03:12:29] haku: i see. if i burn the esc would it have an effect on the motor windings? would it short it too?
[2023-12-09T03:13:04] Tommy ª: casually the starter motor wires of my car is more thinner than that bruh
[2023-12-09T03:13:19] haku: sorry im noob to all this. this is my 1st vesc project
[2023-12-09T03:13:48] Tommy ª: im pushing 120a on 15awg without problems
[2023-12-09T03:14:21] haku: thats awsome bro. hopefully i can max this thing out
[2023-12-09T03:14:46] haku: but i will be getting a 85/200 if i burn these for sure
[2023-12-09T03:15:28] haku: thats good news. thanks james
[2023-12-09T03:16:12] Tommy ª: just locked wheels if you go too fast and short the mosfets if you are lucky you destoy the mosfets and dont lock the wheel 💀
[2023-12-09T03:16:35] Finn: If you set the amperage correctly it should be fine
[2023-12-09T03:16:42] Finn: 170A phase no problem
[2023-12-09T03:16:44] Finn: For me
[2023-12-09T03:16:55] haku: thats a death sentence
[2023-12-09T03:17:00] Finn: Yeah
[2023-12-09T03:18:10] Tommy ª: just look the datasheet mosfet and dont pass whatever tells it the mine is 100amp rated but datasheet says 120 and i use the entire 120a (dont try for being sure 💀 )
[2023-12-09T03:18:41] Finn: @Bradhaku what voltage are you using
[2023-12-09T03:19:06] haku: i waiting for the next spintend sale. maybe new years sale
[2023-12-09T03:19:25] haku: its gona be 72v
[2023-12-09T03:20:03] Finn: You can get it for cheaper from @jamessoderstrom then on the website
[2023-12-09T03:20:50] haku: no way! i did not know that. im in the US tho
[2023-12-09T03:21:17] Finn: Ask him maybe
[2023-12-09T03:21:27] haku: i know there will be export fees. might be troublesome for him
[2023-12-09T03:21:33] Finn: It will still be cheaper then getting it from the website
[2023-12-09T03:21:47] Tommy ª: respect the european law of 25kmh (20 sometimes)
[2023-12-09T03:21:57] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2023-12-09T03:22:09] Finn: This isnt shu...
[2023-12-09T03:22:37] haku: hehe. US no holds bar still. but there will be restrictons. i can sense it
[2023-12-09T03:23:08] haku: the surron boys are killing it for everyone
[2023-12-09T03:23:14] Tommy ª: here all scooter are going to become illegal in 2027 bruh
[2023-12-09T03:23:30] Finn: get a surron then hehe
[2023-12-09T03:23:41] Finn: with some high amp controller
[2023-12-09T03:23:44] haku: i wish i can afford one
[2023-12-09T03:23:53] Finn: yeah they are hella expensive
[2023-12-09T03:24:11] haku: i almost had a bomber but never delivered
[2023-12-09T03:24:32] Finn: they ripped you?
[2023-12-09T03:24:36] Finn: damn
[2023-12-09T03:25:10] haku: yea. paypal saved me
[2023-12-09T03:25:16] Finn: nice
[2023-12-09T03:28:54] haku: i rather support the vendors that help me though.
[2023-12-09T03:30:48] haku: i need to break up with amy anyways
[2023-12-09T03:34:53] haku: thanks bro

[2023-12-09T08:24:39] Yamal: Better in normal bike shop, more cheap..
[2023-12-09T08:34:11] haku: not in my bikeshop they overprice. example
[2023-12-09T08:36:29] haku: they know my brother is a sucker for expensive bikes and will sell with markup
[2023-12-09T08:39:07] haku: i told my bro i will build him a full carbon bike from aliexpress for 1/3 of the price 😭
[2023-12-09T09:02:06] sombre_enfant: Beta 23 with script ?

[2023-12-09T12:20:23] sombre_enfant: Mine dont work i tried again
[2023-12-09T12:31:10] sombre_enfant: The can esc dont show...
[2023-12-09T14:26:09] Izuna 生活: Hm, right after uploading or after turning display off/on?
[2023-12-09T14:27:42] Izuna 生活: I have to find the exact reason for this behavior for vedderb to diagnose, that's why I am asking
[2023-12-09T14:28:39] sombre_enfant: After this i think but my display didnt turned off or change mode
[2023-12-09T14:28:59] Izuna 生活: Ok so only uploading?
[2023-12-09T14:30:00] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2023-12-09T14:31:01] Izuna 生活: And it keeps not showing up after reconnecting bluetooth? Or are you connected via USB?
[2023-12-09T14:32:42] sombre_enfant: I cant use Bluetooth on my phone

[2023-12-09T21:44:37] haku: they told me the phase cables come upgraded from the factory to 2x 10awg.
[2023-12-09T23:10:58] Happy Giraffe: Best for power👍
[2023-12-09T23:11:54] Happy Giraffe: Yup, you might get to soldering some adapters if motor has different plugs😁
[2023-12-09T23:13:57] haku: i will use 10mm or 8mm bullet connectors. i dont know yet. i have to check when i recieve it
[2023-12-09T23:27:39] Mirono escooters: 8 is pleenty
[2023-12-09T23:29:04] haku: where can you get reliable qs8? genuine stuff that can handle some amps
[2023-12-09T23:29:21] haku: amazon and ali kinda shady
[2023-12-10T00:19:41] Happy Giraffe: QS8 on phase kinda bulky but if managed nice could work great. You wanna be able to remove motor without a hassle so need to have them outside😁
[2023-12-10T00:20:53] haku: i will use it on battery cable. combine it to 1 beacause spintend use 2xt90s for some reason
[2023-12-10T00:21:24] haku: they should just use 1 thicker cable and a qs8. but im just a noob. they know better
[2023-12-10T00:22:50] haku: 4 xt90s will look so messy
[2023-12-10T00:23:03] JPPL: 2 cables into 1 qs8 would BE Nice, 2 cables is good because off 2 point of contact with power board
[2023-12-10T00:24:30] haku: i see. that makes sense.
[2023-12-10T00:26:17] haku: how many mosfets does the flipsky 75/200 have?
[2023-12-10T00:34:43] Mirono escooters: 12
[2023-12-10T00:34:53] Mirono escooters: 12 good ones
[2023-12-10T00:35:28] Ion: https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/18eif5m/this_is_superior_escooter_design/
[2023-12-10T00:36:39] haku: looks cool. how does it ride?
[2023-12-10T00:36:41] Ion: I've seen this design on the nami, but didn't think you could just invert a "normal" C-suspension scooter. This surely has some disadvantages, right?
[2023-12-10T00:37:54] Ion: Also comments 😅
[2023-12-10T00:37:59] haku: no idea. im not knowledgable on suspension design.
[2023-12-10T00:58:02] Happy Giraffe: Here Im using bullets pulled from xt30 in this stupid screw in terminal button. Only needs to hold 1.5A so should be ok when filled with solder inside so it doesnt deform when tightened😁
[2023-12-10T01:06:20] Tommy ª: bruh i got the same message i just blocked and reported him 💀
[2023-12-10T01:08:16] haku: i just troll
[2023-12-10T01:10:12] haku: <photos/photo_11453@10-12-2023_01-10-12.jpg>
[2023-12-10T01:10:25] haku: disturbing my beauty sleep
[2023-12-10T01:29:17] Diego: A question: in your opinion, is it madness to have created a switch by short-circuiting the gate and source pins on the discharge MOSFETs of the BMS? Be aware that it works; I had thought of using the connection for the second NTC, but sometimes there are delays in reactivation... I wondered if there might be a more appropriate way to turn off the battery output😄
[2023-12-10T02:31:18] Izuna 生活: @Mirono_escooters what beta are you running with my script? it is dual or single?
[2023-12-10T02:31:25] Izuna 生活: need to find a version that I can roll back
[2023-12-10T02:31:36] Izuna 生活: until vedderb finds out why the fuck CAN breaks again when using can-cmd
[2023-12-10T02:32:55] Izuna 生活: 100% yes
[2023-12-10T02:33:34] Izuna 生活: start-up runs profile set shutdown runs profile set profile button runs profile set and I was able to basically run only can-cmd and it broke, but here comes the issue: I cannot make it break 100% all the time
[2023-12-10T02:33:49] Izuna 生活: <photos/photo_11454@10-12-2023_02-33-49.jpg>
[2023-12-10T02:34:20] Izuna 生活: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/issues/658#issuecomment-1848816455
[2023-12-10T02:34:20] Tommy ª: it smells so hard to translator
[2023-12-10T02:35:43] Izuna 生活: The only thing I can do now is checking if vedderb has done any changes to CAN and Lisp that might cause this issue. Otherwise I am out and going back to BETA 15 or smth
[2023-12-10T02:36:19] Izuna 生活: id rather have unreliable can-cmd than can-cmd breaking my whole CAN communication 🤣
[2023-12-10T02:40:44] Izuna 生活: On october he said "Another note on this one. Turns out there was a bug in unflatten which would cause random strange behavior and crashes. Should be fixed in the latest beta."
[2023-12-10T02:40:50] Izuna 生活: but idk where and what
[2023-12-10T02:40:54] Izuna 生活: because if I know what commit it is
[2023-12-10T02:41:04] Izuna 生活: i could simply revert it and use the newest beta and maybe it works then?
[2023-12-10T04:57:50] Oreo huzky: What frame
[2023-12-10T05:06:48] Rose: Hey there D, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-10T05:29:44] haku: i have no idea. its for a 13inch scooter. ill see if i can make em fit lol
[2023-12-10T05:30:56] haku: i hope it can bolt on but if i cant ill get them welded
[2023-12-10T05:30:56] haku: <photos/photo_11456@10-12-2023_05-30-56.jpg>

[2023-12-10T10:33:02] Mirono escooters: 😔
[2023-12-10T11:54:42] Mirono escooters: This worked, thanks
[2023-12-10T13:32:46] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11458@10-12-2023_13-32-46.jpg>
[2023-12-10T13:42:13] Yamal: Lambo
[2023-12-10T13:48:38] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom so 6.02 and 6.05 have bigger changes on fundamentals like how motor tracking works?😳
[2023-12-10T13:53:26] sombre_enfant: Did u found good beta ?
[2023-12-10T13:56:50] Izuna 生活: Of course. Beta 15 which I was using before.
[2023-12-10T13:57:38] sombre_enfant: can u share it pls
[2023-12-10T13:59:54] sombre_enfant: Pls i beg u
[2023-12-10T14:02:27] sombre_enfant: With the Android app
[2023-12-10T14:03:01] Mirono escooters: Vedder been Messing around lately xD
[2023-12-10T14:03:16] Mirono escooters: I am on 21? I think, good enough. Works. (I have no idea about can)
[2023-12-10T14:04:14] sombre_enfant: Can u share ?
[2023-12-10T14:07:48] Mirono escooters: I have the file for 75100 alupcb only 🤷
[2023-12-10T14:11:41] Izuna 生活: One sec
[2023-12-10T14:17:06] Izuna 生活: I have used this 6.05 BETA 15 for about 3-4 months! Has been working great for me.
[2023-12-10T14:18:01] Mirono escooters: If my 21 doesn't like can, guess I'll have to switch..
[2023-12-10T14:18:15] Izuna 生活: I think its broken since October 22. But I cannot tell. Thats where vedderb said he "fixed" something.
[2023-12-10T14:18:28] sombre_enfant: Works with last script ?
[2023-12-10T14:18:53] Izuna 生活: It should, otherwise use the one before I did the recent changes.
[2023-12-10T14:19:58] sombre_enfant: How i do that to have old ?
[2023-12-10T14:20:47] Izuna 生活: there, but I am 100% certain that the newest should be compatible.
[2023-12-10T14:23:11] Izuna 生活: I can tell more when I go back to BETA 15 myself but I have to transfer the makerbase hw config to the old beta 15 firmware, which is something I am not doing right now. I still have to get my spanish podcast written and recorded for class, learn for the exam tomorrow and get my sports presentation done 💀
[2023-12-10T14:33:56] Mirono escooters: I feel ya
[2023-12-10T18:16:51] sombre_enfant: @kawaiinekololis im on beta 15 it does nothing when i press my Throttle
[2023-12-10T18:18:15] S1m 0n: cool. I hope this will become standard. This means that the front wheel is pulled instead of pushed and significantly improves stability. Shopping carts have been using this technology for a long time
[2023-12-10T18:20:36] haku: need to put a vesc and ly motors on that thing
[2023-12-10T18:20:57] haku: give tesla some competition
[2023-12-10T18:23:31] Tommy ª: you can put these 6inch 150w scooter wheels in the 4 legs and some sort of traction control
[2023-12-10T18:24:59] Tommy ª: yep it fits
[2023-12-10T20:55:46] Happy Giraffe: Found Fusion 360 weakness, having two different more complicated components and making holes and features fit...if anyone knows an easy way pls tell Somehow managed to select the component behind eventually but it doesnt feel like a realiable method
[2023-12-10T20:56:31] haku: is fusion the best cad software?
[2023-12-10T20:57:05] haku: or bambu software is good enough
[2023-12-10T20:57:29] Happy Giraffe: The only one that doesnt force you to pay if using for hobby/student work. Maximum 10 active models but you can have 1000 on read-only state and toggle them anytime
[2023-12-10T20:58:56] Happy Giraffe: Also on fusion if you want to change how a solid body behaves its easy to just change the 2D drawing and changes will take effect. Other softwares are crap, messy and give aids in comparison to Fusion. Fusion also most intuitive and very easy to learn
[2023-12-10T20:59:13] Paolo ⁭: Bambù Is slicer not cad
[2023-12-10T20:59:22] Happy Giraffe: Which are you referring, the slicer? Thats not a CAD
[2023-12-10T21:00:01] Paolo ⁭: But I like bambù very much, all bambu haters don't have it
[2023-12-10T21:00:16] Paolo ⁭: Definitely better than prusa
[2023-12-10T21:00:45] haku: i see. my printer still sad in the corner untouched so im a noob
[2023-12-10T21:01:05] haku: so intimidating
[2023-12-10T21:01:16] Happy Giraffe: You make CAD/3D model - Place the 3D model on Slicer software, then slicer as its name suggest will slice model in tiny layers and you can change how they are formed :)
[2023-12-10T21:01:47] Happy Giraffe: Bambulab printers basically plug in and turn on. Just watch a video at the same time
[2023-12-10T21:01:47] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2023-12-10T21:04:00] haku: do you guys know of any 3d printing telegram groups?
[2023-12-10T21:06:48] Happy Giraffe: Not that I know of, its basically just watching youtube videos to learn. PLA/PETG you just keep stock suggested settings and have fun first. Temperature, cooling, layer height, wall thickness, top and bottom thickness propably most important settings aside from managing the supports
[2023-12-10T21:08:07] haku: thanks. i woke up 1 day and decided to be self taught engineer. its harder than it looks
[2023-12-10T21:20:50] Mirono escooters: Better then dying on school subjects
[2023-12-10T21:21:57] haku: lesson learned. money can buy all the gear. but knowledge. you cannot buy 😂
[2023-12-10T21:28:30] Happy Giraffe: Thats a fun hobby of mine aswell, building stuff out of metal and plastic. Beats using cocaine behind the supermarket
[2023-12-10T21:29:07] Happy Giraffe: Knowledge you will get when you do mistakes and get mad af when trying to figure them out
[2023-12-10T21:29:31] Happy Giraffe: @Bradhaku Do you have a dryer for the printing filament?
[2023-12-10T21:29:53] haku: honestly i dont know i needed that.
[2023-12-10T21:30:13] haku: i only have 3 pla filaments i think
[2023-12-10T21:31:26] Happy Giraffe: Its needed for PETG and Nylon especially but good for others aswell. Then you never have a print fail/deform/weak because of the tiny microscopic moisture buildup inside that gives a popping sound when extruded
[2023-12-10T21:31:57] haku: i see. what do those dryers look like? i have a heat gun
[2023-12-10T21:32:51] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_11463@10-12-2023_21-32-51.jpg>
[2023-12-10T21:33:36] haku: i see. its for special fillaments yea?
[2023-12-10T21:33:48] Happy Giraffe: https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/aw/d/B094XXJMT6?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title
[2023-12-10T21:34:20] Happy Giraffe: Nope, regular PETG needs it already, especially if you live in a humid place
[2023-12-10T21:35:09] haku: after the holidays i will focus more on printing.
[2023-12-10T21:36:02] haku: so fusion is good cad software. then bambu slicer is good too?
[2023-12-10T21:36:16] Happy Giraffe: These dry boxes are flawed by design but easy to fix, moisture cant escape the box so you could drill a hole in highest point of case. Or put silica gel bag inside. Anyway when filament is heated it will naturally release moisture to air around it so it should be enough. If filament is dropped in water or extra wet then would need to open the lid up to get fresh air in once in a while. But then you would see the fog buildup already
[2023-12-10T21:36:21] Happy Giraffe: Yes and yes
[2023-12-10T21:37:19] haku: gotcha. thank you
[2023-12-11T00:47:25] Happy Giraffe: First tests with my first carbon fiber filament, will make waterproof cap for the charger box😁
[2023-12-11T00:59:02] haku: is it possible to print cell holders with cf fillament?
[2023-12-11T01:04:45] haku: is this vsett branded tires the only thing thay can fit a vsett 9? the tolerance is pretty tight if changing to different brand.
[2023-12-11T01:04:45] haku: <photos/photo_11465@11-12-2023_01-04-45.jpg>
[2023-12-11T01:32:05] Happy Giraffe: Yes but don't think people usually do that. Havent printed them myself so dont know which material is best. PLA aint the one for sure tho😂
[2023-12-11T01:45:55] haku: theres this guy that makes incredible custom holders for ebikes.
[2023-12-11T01:49:57] haku: i asked he use petg
[2023-12-11T01:59:30] Happy Giraffe: Yup, thats good stuff, just need to calibrate hole size as petg tends to change its shape a tiny bit after printed. Carbon fiber should be dimensionally bit more accurate they say, well soon we find out how good it is😅
[2023-12-11T02:00:02] Paolo ⁭: No lol
[2023-12-11T02:02:25] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-12-11T02:03:15] Paolo ⁭: Never carbon fiber for battery, it's conductive
[2023-12-11T02:03:53] Happy Giraffe: Didnt say that, just stated that PETG needs to be calibrated😁
[2023-12-11T02:05:06] Paolo ⁭: Nah if youre good at printing it doesn't , specially for this thickness
[2023-12-11T02:07:18] Happy Giraffe: Just a scientific fact that PETG less accurate than PLA😂 Tho most people dont need +-0.05mm accuracy but it really shows if you print large 200mm objects.
[2023-12-11T02:08:14] Tommy ª: bruh aliexpress is full of these tires
[2023-12-11T02:12:30] haku: whats a good brand of petg filament. bang for buck brand
[2023-12-11T02:13:30] haku: today is the day i will face my demons and be the engineer that i want to be.
[2023-12-11T02:13:56] haku: im setting it up right now
[2023-12-11T02:16:07] Happy Giraffe: US market propably bit different
[2023-12-11T02:16:30] haku: what about the brand sunlu?
[2023-12-11T02:16:50] Happy Giraffe: Known brand atleast so should work There was some cheap filament brand that sponsored a youtube channel in US. It was very cheap like 15$ per 1kg of pla
[2023-12-11T02:18:10] haku: yes. its only 1 design ive noticed for 8.5 tires.
[2023-12-11T02:19:23] Tommy ª: you want bigger ones?
[2023-12-11T02:19:48] haku: ill check it out. but fillament is not all created equal yea? some brands better?
[2023-12-11T02:20:27] Steven: https://ulipstore.com/products/ulip-2-pack-8-1-2x3-inch-off-road-tire-with-8-1-2x250-134-inner-tube-pneumatic-tyre-for-vsett-8-9-macury-zero-8-9-series-scooter
[2023-12-11T02:20:56] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, bad ones go out of business eventually but when you start it's good to buy decent ones so you can factor filament out when troubleshooting
[2023-12-11T02:21:02] Tommy ª: i think he wants bigger tires or idk
[2023-12-11T02:21:23] Steven: Bigger tires won’t fit. Don’t bother.
[2023-12-11T02:22:08] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2023-12-11T02:22:12] Happy Giraffe: Especially in carbon fiber filaments are the biggest differences, others materials are stronger when the fibers. Then there are crap is companies that put carbon fiber dust in there and it makes it weaker than the vanilla filament😁 (Needs to be chopped fibers)
[2023-12-11T02:22:49] haku: yes i was thinking putting bigger ones. but tolerances is too tight
[2023-12-11T02:22:59] Happy Giraffe: I did the noobie mistake again of making 3D model that has one object 1mm in the air, fk me I never remember to double check.
[2023-12-11T02:23:33] Tommy ª: just 20 washers on the fenders and it fits
[2023-12-11T02:24:02] haku: its not the fender. its too close to the suspension
[2023-12-11T02:24:20] Tommy ª: i hate newer scooters 😭
[2023-12-11T02:24:43] haku: all good i will wear this tire out. its just slippery when roads are cold
[2023-12-11T02:25:29] Tommy ª: imagine people riding with solid tires on snow or super cold conditions or icy roads
[2023-12-11T02:32:00] Steven: Why ppl always want to mount larger tires than their scooter was designed for? If you want 11” tires, get 11” tire scooter. No point to buy a 8.5” or 10” scooter then try to install 11” tires.
[2023-12-11T02:32:43] haku: sometimes we make purchasing mistakes
[2023-12-11T02:33:22] Izuna 生活: Did you configure ADC? 😂
[2023-12-11T02:33:37] haku: or experiment on stuff
[2023-12-11T02:33:56] Izuna 生活: Like enabling ADC App, saving App conf, going into ADC, set everything up correctly and saving it.
[2023-12-11T02:34:59] Tommy ª: depends a lot of your zone there is the most cheap way to dont destroy your scooter because of the shi*** streets
[2023-12-11T03:02:28] Paolo ⁭: Yes but that's not the case for battery holder
[2023-12-11T03:13:05] haku: is the tronic 250 and 250r a 6 mosfet vesc?
[2023-12-11T04:29:53] haku: is this normal on the self test?
[2023-12-11T04:30:49] haku: it sounds like it needs a vesc
[2023-12-11T06:09:52] Happy Giraffe: Yes haha, input shaping. Needs to be on stable table and if you move it to another one gotta do calibration again
[2023-12-11T06:20:54] haku: yea. i put in on the floor for now. my table is wobbly. this printer is loud
[2023-12-11T06:21:55] haku: benchy looks good
[2023-12-11T06:29:24] Happy Giraffe: 20 mins?
[2023-12-11T06:30:16] haku: i dont remember. i did not time it. i think it was more
[2023-12-11T06:31:04] haku: its cool that you can watch it on your phone too. im watching videos on how to use the slicer.
[2023-12-11T06:33:23] Happy Giraffe: Start with basics and hide more advanced features for now. Easy to get overwhelmed
[2023-12-11T06:34:59] haku: i know. its super overwhelming. theres no crash course. its like learning photoshop all over again
[2023-12-11T06:37:13] haku: im printing this for my son. there are supports. can that come off easy?
[2023-12-11T06:37:45] haku: <photos/photo_11470@11-12-2023_06-37-45.jpg>
[2023-12-11T06:43:53] Happy Giraffe: Show us the model first, I think supports not even needes for this
[2023-12-11T06:45:21] haku: <photos/photo_11471@11-12-2023_06-45-21.jpg>
[2023-12-11T06:45:57] haku: i just found it on thingiverse. he likes this character
[2023-12-11T06:46:04] puneDir: why hes a security camera
[2023-12-11T06:46:33] haku: no idea. its a weird show on youtube. its called skibidy
[2023-12-11T06:46:49] Happy Giraffe: Bit odd shaped and hard for first prints
[2023-12-11T06:47:21] haku: is this pretty difficult print?
[2023-12-11T06:48:03] haku: i will print the scooter spoiler next
[2023-12-11T06:48:13] Happy Giraffe: Very
[2023-12-11T06:48:31] haku: i see. hope it comes out alright
[2023-12-11T06:49:08] Happy Giraffe: On bambulab slicer you can mark spots on model that you don't wanna get supported.
[2023-12-11T06:49:31] haku: gotcha. watching tutorials right now.
[2023-12-11T06:50:16] haku: someday i want to be able to model and print scooter and battery stuff
[2023-12-11T06:50:50] Happy Giraffe: Propably only needs support on hands and face Very bizarre model tho😂🙈
[2023-12-11T06:51:50] haku: my sons generation is pretty crazy.
[2023-12-11T06:53:08] haku: what is the difference with regular pla, tough pla and pla silk?
[2023-12-11T06:53:31] haku: different temps or nozzles?
[2023-12-11T07:15:16] Happy Giraffe: Tells in the name😁, silk has special look to it. Tough idk some properties changed havent tested them
[2023-12-11T07:16:36] Happy Giraffe: Did lot of modeling around a piece that Fusion fuking cloud based shit didnt save😂🙈 Now gotta create a file out of them everytime to check I have atleast copy on my ssd...
[2023-12-11T07:31:45] haku: these filaments are only good for sample/prototype and model. not good for use on scooters?
[2023-12-11T08:07:33] haku: did not come out clean
[2023-12-11T08:22:09] Mirono escooters: This or Gst3D
[2023-12-11T08:34:51] Happy Giraffe: From EU Amazon I like Tinmorry also
[2023-12-11T09:32:42] Constance Moyer: Hey new to this telagram group sombody from the vsett facebook group recomend i join this trying to get my scooter set up its a vsett 10+ and i just put 2 80v 100amp spintend controllers on pretty much got it all set up but started having a issue with my rear motor which is set up on my secondary esc when i got to give it throttle on my spin y2 the rear motor doesnt start up as easily it is jerky it eventually goes but moving a bit slower then the front motor at small amounts of throttle i tried using a different canbus cable to see if that was it but no my main worry if it possiblly has to do with mabey my soldering possibly on hall wire or somthing any thoughts thanks
[2023-12-11T09:33:57] Constance Moyer: <video_file>
[2023-12-11T09:35:41] Constance Moyer: Hard to see i guess but can see a jerky movement
[2023-12-11T09:36:33] Constance Moyer: <video_file>
[2023-12-11T09:36:56] Constance Moyer: Thats a better video of it Thanks
[2023-12-11T09:36:56] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Constance has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-11T10:12:41] sombre_enfant: Yes i followed the video
[2023-12-11T10:20:33] Izuna 生活: Okay
[2023-12-11T10:20:34] Izuna 生活: I just got out of the exam, had to take my scooter inside class because I forgot my bike locks. Glad they didn't say anything about it, because it's not allowed here at this school to take E-Scooter inside.
[2023-12-11T10:20:36] Izuna 生活: I don't know?
[2023-12-11T10:33:41] sombre_enfant: Can u add Throttle param the old way on script, please its been week i cant scoot
[2023-12-11T10:34:08] Izuna 生活: Bro it's working
[2023-12-11T10:34:12] Izuna 生活: Your just doing something wrong
[2023-12-11T10:34:27] Izuna 生活: I'm not your employee
[2023-12-11T10:35:01] Izuna 生活: and why tf are you not just using 6.02?
[2023-12-11T10:50:30] sombre_enfant: Uh ? What 6.02 would fix ? I used the beta u sent
[2023-12-11T10:52:12] Izuna 生活: U ask old throttle param?
[2023-12-11T10:52:15] Izuna 生活: That's 6.02
[2023-12-11T10:52:41] Izuna 生活: The only reason to use 6.05 is because of ADC (dual motor+traction control etc)
[2023-12-11T10:53:43] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-12-11T10:57:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Honestly for PETG I don't use any dryer, no problem at all for my prints with Bambu
[2023-12-11T10:58:07] Izuna 生活: I have a suggestion, might share what you are doing and show what's going on. Saying it's not working is not helping to figure out the mistake.
[2023-12-11T10:58:23] Izuna 生活: For example the app config as XML of your display ESC.
[2023-12-11T10:58:49] Izuna 生活: and a screenshot of the LispBM tab with polling enabled
[2023-12-11T10:59:16] Izuna 生活: Like, I don't even know if your display is showing anything. All I know (something) is not working for you
[2023-12-11T11:04:16] Izuna 生活: Fml
[2023-12-11T11:04:18] Izuna 生活: Got a flat
[2023-12-11T11:08:13] Mirono escooters: Noo
[2023-12-11T11:11:54] Happy Giraffe: You gotta have really dry air at home then😁 I live next to sea on an island😂
[2023-12-11T11:43:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Former workshop was very humid, brake discs got rusted when leaving these for 2 weeks there 😂
[2023-12-11T11:58:44] Rose: Hey there Skero, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-11T12:24:00] Gabe Enzo: HAHAHAHA I HAD THE SAME STORY AS YOU WHEN I DID MY ABITURS
[2023-12-11T12:24:23] Gabe Enzo: THE HEART PAIN WHEN YOU FORGET YOUR LOCK
[2023-12-11T12:26:21] Mirono escooters: Belgium with 99% humidity wants to have a chat
[2023-12-11T12:38:10] Izuna 生活: Quick swap
[2023-12-11T12:38:29] Izuna 生活: Now I can drive to PE and do my presentation
[2023-12-11T12:38:37] Unknown: Skidibibi ?
[2023-12-11T12:39:57] Unknown: I think I have to buy a new set of swing arms (rear) for The zero10x I have some play in the suspension
[2023-12-11T12:43:01] Izuna 生活: Yes it was my pre Abitur exam too 😂
[2023-12-11T12:43:49] Unknown: Another question is there strengthen ones ?
[2023-12-11T12:58:40] Mirono escooters: That was quick
[2023-12-11T12:58:45] Mirono escooters: I need 3-5 business days to do that
[2023-12-11T13:06:57] Ion: Actually had that happen too... Since I was almost late for my finals presentation. But in my hurry I left it outside and hoped for the best...
[2023-12-11T13:07:30] Ion: You run no brakes in the rear 😅
[2023-12-11T13:10:30] haku: my sons skibidi army is ready for battle
[2023-12-11T13:12:54] Izuna 生活: Yes only front
[2023-12-11T13:13:10] Izuna 生活: and dual electric
[2023-12-11T13:14:50] Gabe Enzo: Front brake is way better than rear. Rear just slides.
[2023-12-11T13:16:54] haku: im sure there are makers of that frame that makes stronger ones
[2023-12-11T13:25:22] haku: are those the vsett motors folks use on g30s?
[2023-12-11T13:26:29] Izuna 生活: no, it's 60h 22x3 motor
[2023-12-11T13:26:40] Izuna 生活: bigger and faster than vsett
[2023-12-11T13:28:26] Happy Giraffe: It's disgustingly fast printer😅 You have no idea as you never used basic Enders
[2023-12-11T13:28:40] haku: very nice!
[2023-12-11T13:28:42] Mirono escooters: Even my drum + ebrake does 💀
[2023-12-11T13:30:04] Happy Giraffe: In the meantime I will get sonicpad for the Ender3 S1Plus🌚 will not be as fast as bambulabs printers but close enough😁
[2023-12-11T13:33:38] Unknown: Do you know some ?
[2023-12-11T13:34:12] haku: as long as it prints fine. ive heard enders are workhorses of the printing industry
[2023-12-11T13:35:02] haku: no unfortunately. hopefuly someone with that frame will comment
[2023-12-11T13:35:35] Happy Giraffe: Nowadays outdated and worse bang for buck. I dont understand idiots who spend 300$ on Ender 3 vs 550$ on Bambu P1S
[2023-12-11T13:37:02] haku: ive wanted a printer for the longest time. now im printing toilets lol
[2023-12-11T13:40:01] Happy Giraffe: I paid 550$ on the big Ender but the print area is worth it and bambu didn't exist then😁
[2023-12-11T13:40:26] haku: im not very knowledgable on vesc but i had this same problem with my spinny. i had to redo the setup motors and throttle setup and it fixed it. maybe some vesc lord might help you.
[2023-12-11T13:48:31] Mirono escooters: Me bing chilling with tronxy
[2023-12-11T13:54:35] Ion: Alright 😅. I only have drum front and electric rear lol. But it only guess like 55kph so it's fine for now .. (I guess)
[2023-12-11T14:23:53] Gabe Enzo: 55 is soooo slow can't even pass cars
[2023-12-11T14:23:58] Gabe Enzo: I'm stuck at 55 myself rn
[2023-12-11T14:26:01] Mirono escooters: I never drive over 45 with cars
[2023-12-11T14:27:18] Happy Giraffe: Best quality of ebike vs scooter, tire change easy af on front. Takes 5 minutes. Rear must disassemble torque arms so maybe 30min😂
[2023-12-11T14:34:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say i am unsure if its not settings, also vid still bit dark to see 😅 But without more information i am unsure we can help
[2023-12-11T14:35:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Would be nice to see that your engine's stats from motor wizard
[2023-12-11T14:36:31] Gabe Enzo: I get passed by cyclists when going 40.
[2023-12-11T14:36:34] Gabe Enzo: even 45.
[2023-12-11T14:36:48] Gabe Enzo: cyclist legs output like 2hp
[2023-12-11T14:38:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lol ,glitch
[2023-12-11T14:38:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean didn't saw answers before
[2023-12-11T14:39:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Normal if you have good bike like giant any noob does 35 More experienced even more Race bikes easy 50
[2023-12-11T14:55:01] sombre_enfant: I will do
[2023-12-11T14:55:11] sombre_enfant: No too difficult
[2023-12-11T14:55:44] sombre_enfant: No its parsing
[2023-12-11T15:09:55] Izuna 生活: Omg fuck me PE class is cancelled
[2023-12-11T15:10:13] Izuna 生活: and I'm here with the other guys that had to do a presentation
[2023-12-11T15:23:10] Izuna 生活: So cold and wet. My poor g30 😭
[2023-12-11T15:27:43] Izuna 生活: At least when I'm home I have time to try with VESC and CAN. I remembered that vedderb sent me the code server library, which practically does the same as can-cmd but better.
[2023-12-11T15:27:51] Izuna 生活: Maybe this works without breaking.
[2023-12-11T15:43:39] Izuna 生活: oh boi hit the throttle at the train station in front of people because I forgot the display is still on 😂
[2023-12-11T15:43:48] Izuna 生活: Glad it did not pull out of my hands
[2023-12-11T15:47:04] Mirono escooters: Yeah, happens
[2023-12-11T15:47:07] Mirono escooters: Handy u can turn dash off
[2023-12-11T15:47:47] Gabe Enzo: Molicels start sagging in the cold aye?
[2023-12-11T15:48:37] Izuna 生活: Yup
[2023-12-11T15:48:43] Izuna 生活: No idea.
[2023-12-11T15:48:45] Izuna 生活: I don't watch it.
[2023-12-11T16:08:02] Mirono escooters: Can you filter for a user and only videos?
[2023-12-11T16:09:43] Izuna 生活: Eh not sure
[2023-12-11T16:10:04] Izuna 生活: Ok no
[2023-12-11T16:10:08] Izuna 生活: idk
[2023-12-11T16:31:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nope sadly
[2023-12-11T17:37:21] Gabe Enzo: What would be a good motor for an Ekart?
[2023-12-11T17:37:32] Gabe Enzo: summer project.
[2023-12-11T17:37:53] Gabe Enzo: "electric motor from a car" *clearly drone Motor*
[2023-12-11T17:52:11] sombre_enfant: display show classic 0kph and d mode
[2023-12-11T17:52:48] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_11477@11-12-2023_17-52-48.jpg>
[2023-12-11T17:52:48] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_11478@11-12-2023_17-52-48.jpg>
[2023-12-11T17:52:48] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_11479@11-12-2023_17-52-48.jpg>
[2023-12-11T17:56:10] sombre_enfant: Idk why old script dont work on 80100 even with 6.00
[2023-12-11T17:57:37] Tommy ª: mine looks different and bigger
[2023-12-11T18:04:16] sombre_enfant: Please halp
[2023-12-11T18:46:11] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-12-11T18:46:16] Gabe Enzo: hahahahaha
[2023-12-11T19:19:45] Happy Giraffe: Everything does, that's why taking battery with you is handy in winter -20°c
[2023-12-11T19:20:15] sombre_enfant: Wait i do
[2023-12-11T19:20:27] Izuna 生活: If the display shows 0kph and D-Mode it's either script not running or hardware issue.
[2023-12-11T19:21:02] Happy Giraffe: Couple of guys built arduino powered heater to keep battery 10°c when heating activated
[2023-12-11T19:21:10] sombre_enfant: Display was working fine on flipsky
[2023-12-11T19:21:29] Izuna 生活: Ok, what are you using now?
[2023-12-11T19:21:34] Izuna 生活: Or same setup?
[2023-12-11T19:23:43] Gabe Enzo: I'm not gonna do that cause I can't so the only counter is more cells in parallel.
[2023-12-11T19:23:52] Gabe Enzo: Ah, so actual Tesla shit! sounds awesome something I should get my hands on doing.
[2023-12-11T19:23:58] sombre_enfant: Same wiring setup, just 6.05 ubox 80100 beta 15
[2023-12-11T19:25:01] Izuna 生活: Ahh!!
[2023-12-11T19:25:13] Izuna 生活: You have to change RX and TX.
[2023-12-11T19:25:16] Izuna 生活: It's different on ubox
[2023-12-11T19:25:24] sombre_enfant: Seriously
[2023-12-11T19:25:28] Izuna 生活: Yes
[2023-12-11T19:25:53] sombre_enfant: I retry i redo detection
[2023-12-11T19:26:50] Happy Giraffe: Making proper own battery is already hard, this is amother game completely😂
[2023-12-11T19:36:51] sombre_enfant: Dont works either
[2023-12-11T19:40:07] Izuna 生活: HEHE I DID IT @jamessoderstrom
[2023-12-11T19:40:09] Izuna 生活: code server works
[2023-12-11T19:40:11] Gabe Enzo: Got experience with lipo for years. Except I obviously won't be soldering here, this is different, but I won't fuck up. I'll test on dead cells first.
[2023-12-11T19:40:16] Izuna 生活: so far no CAN disconnect issue
[2023-12-11T19:41:57] sombre_enfant: Do any of you have team viewer ?
[2023-12-11T19:42:42] Mirono escooters: That's, very cool
[2023-12-11T19:43:01] Mirono escooters: Lipo and a whole batt assembly do be diff
[2023-12-11T19:43:03] Mirono escooters: But tis a statt
[2023-12-11T19:43:26] Izuna 生活: It now even is capable of knowing if the CAN command was successful and retries it if not 5 times
[2023-12-11T19:43:29] Mirono escooters: Love no industry standards
[2023-12-11T19:45:12] sombre_enfant: Works on old 6.0
[2023-12-11T19:47:37] sombre_enfant: Is it same for bluetooth module ?
[2023-12-11T19:49:05] Izuna 生活: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/commit/3508e40db0d0b72f1a3451f4e95f009be378e8e0
[2023-12-11T19:49:07] Izuna 生活: 👍
[2023-12-11T19:49:30] Izuna 生活: what do you mean with same for bluetooth module
[2023-12-11T19:49:37] Izuna 生活: i think so yes
[2023-12-11T19:49:38] Izuna 生活: idk
[2023-12-11T19:49:55] Izuna 生活: i dont remember exactly but on COMM it was 100% flipped for flipsky vs ubox
[2023-12-11T19:50:24] Izuna 生活: Time will tell if it really works but I am very confident that this approach is finally the right one as it is basically its own implementation apart from VESC. No more breaking out of nowhere (as long he does not break its own library)
[2023-12-11T19:51:16] Izuna 生活: Only downside, requires one step more, which is flashing slave_esc.lisp to any slave ESC
[2023-12-11T19:52:51] sombre_enfant: Ok rx tx of ble too
[2023-12-11T19:53:29] sombre_enfant: I did works with old script and 6.0 100100 limited... I dont have a no limit one that match bluetooth app
[2023-12-11T20:04:51] sombre_enfant: It works now, not on last fw but 6.0 100100
[2023-12-11T20:05:14] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2023-12-11T20:05:40] sombre_enfant: Not no limit tho😑
[2023-12-11T20:05:59] sombre_enfant: Idk if it will go to 165A phase...
[2023-12-11T20:06:40] sombre_enfant: I cant use new since i cant use Bluetooth app, or if u have latest with app i can use i'll do
[2023-12-11T20:06:58] sombre_enfant: Its classic
[2023-12-11T20:07:46] sombre_enfant: Its not proposed on my vesc tool even with show non default option
[2023-12-11T20:10:37] sombre_enfant: Where ?
[2023-12-11T20:15:35] sombre_enfant: The one i have wont works with my beta apk
[2023-12-11T20:31:20] Gabe Enzo: I know for a fact I'll be safer than assigning a normie to make a batt xd
[2023-12-11T20:31:37] Gabe Enzo: 💥
[2023-12-11T20:40:09] sombre_enfant: The vesc tool aint here
[2023-12-11T20:46:33] sombre_enfant: Do you have a new v6.00 Android
[2023-12-11T20:47:13] haku: https://youtu.be/jCsnVp6mEbk?si=OK_7VxwvpTvcw2uf
[2023-12-11T20:47:19] haku: oh no!
[2023-12-11T20:47:33] sombre_enfant: Dont works on my phone
[2023-12-11T20:49:35] Unknown: What happened?
[2023-12-11T20:50:22] haku: tldr pla is not biodegradable
[2023-12-11T20:50:48] haku: that sucks
[2023-12-11T20:51:34] sombre_enfant: Last Android app
[2023-12-11T21:04:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well actually that's not true
[2023-12-11T21:05:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pla is bioplastic made from genetically modified plant starch, which is most often produced from corn
[2023-12-11T21:05:49] sombre_enfant: Phone is pristine
[2023-12-11T21:05:57] haku: thats good. i dont want to feel guilty everytime i print useless stuff
[2023-12-11T21:05:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But wont come down easy
[2023-12-11T21:06:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need more time and atleast 60c hot enviroment
[2023-12-11T21:07:10] haku: gotcha. ill see if there are filament recycle centers where i live. i hears some countries do that
[2023-12-11T21:07:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So than dont throw it in trash
[2023-12-11T21:07:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes they have the stuff for it
[2023-12-11T21:10:42] sombre_enfant: Could not read motor... With app that dont match...
[2023-12-11T21:17:22] Oreo huzky: I welded myself a stand for my scooter I wanted to look like the stands that racing bikes have
[2023-12-11T21:19:10] haku: you need front wheels too
[2023-12-11T21:19:31] sombre_enfant: What will be the issue if i use classic 100100?
[2023-12-11T21:20:45] Mirono escooters: Stronk
[2023-12-11T21:21:29] Oreo huzky: No
[2023-12-11T21:21:54] Oreo huzky: Front wheels not good idea because battery in front
[2023-12-11T21:22:19] Oreo huzky: And Race bikes also just use rear wheel
[2023-12-11T21:23:21] Oreo huzky: I made it out of an old suspension arm of a 45kmh scooter
[2023-12-11T21:23:56] haku: i see. i thought its a platform for testing
[2023-12-11T21:24:16] Oreo huzky: Nah just as a stand
[2023-12-11T21:26:07] Oreo huzky: But maybe I make something to prop it up for testing I also bought a new handlebar that’s longer
[2023-12-11T21:29:17] haku: nice. i think i use 780mm handlebars on mine. havent expirienced wobbles. but that was on 60v
[2023-12-11T21:30:40] haku: im still waiting for my new battery box. i think i want all components inside. very messy if esc is outside
[2023-12-11T21:30:43] Oreo huzky: I have too the next ones I get are 980mm but I will probably cut them to length
[2023-12-11T21:31:04] Oreo huzky: 21700?
[2023-12-11T21:31:22] haku: yes. frame is smaller than i thought
[2023-12-11T21:31:49] Oreo huzky: How mine won’t even fit 20s 8p
[2023-12-11T21:32:32] haku: maybe because of holders i use the compact ones
[2023-12-11T21:33:29] haku: the bigger battery box should help. this is too tight. but if i cant get that to work im fine mounting esc in stems
[2023-12-11T21:33:31] Oreo huzky: I used same ones
[2023-12-11T21:34:00] haku: oh wow. 20s10p is very tight though
[2023-12-11T21:35:33] haku: where did you put your vesc? inside?
[2023-12-11T21:38:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice ,not just race ppl has that ,kinda every body is into them ,but in our case its harder to make sweet point , that's why its nice to have lift like @roscheeee or @PaoloWu has if i remember good
[2023-12-11T21:46:50] Oreo huzky: Yes
[2023-12-11T21:47:51] sombre_enfant: I can push my amps wont be limited ?
[2023-12-11T21:56:43] sombre_enfant: I have limit one... Wheres the limit tho ?
[2023-12-11T21:58:03] Gabe Enzo: can I run flipsky and spintend for dual?
[2023-12-11T21:58:26] Gabe Enzo: Need dual motor I don't wanna buy another spintend so expensive
[2023-12-11T21:58:41] Gabe Enzo: Does anyone have a burned 800w motor?
[2023-12-11T21:58:54] sombre_enfant: Yes u can
[2023-12-11T21:58:54] Gabe Enzo: I'm looking for something cheap to fix
[2023-12-11T21:59:05] sombre_enfant: Take mks alu
[2023-12-11T21:59:18] Gabe Enzo: also there's no chance of running a 500w with an 800w motor yea? they look the same.
[2023-12-11T21:59:29] Gabe Enzo: having trouble sourcing another 800w
[2023-12-11T21:59:52] sombre_enfant: What exact param u have on it ? 40h?
[2023-12-11T22:00:19] sombre_enfant: Ask paolo, tbh dual with 40h is sad...
[2023-12-11T22:00:21] Gabe Enzo: I have no idea I just got a motor from Paolo, haven't even opened it. He has a defective 800w I'm tryna buy it off him
[2023-12-11T22:00:24] Gabe Enzo: Why? cause they're small?
[2023-12-11T22:00:42] haku: i have a g30 motor. if you in the US i would give it to you
[2023-12-11T22:01:09] sombre_enfant: Ye not good enough...
[2023-12-11T22:01:28] Gabe Enzo: Nah don't need Xiaomi
[2023-12-11T22:01:30] Gabe Enzo: too much heat
[2023-12-11T22:01:47] Gabe Enzo: Then I'll stay with single..
[2023-12-11T22:01:51] Tommy ª: <animation>
[2023-12-11T22:01:52] Tommy ª: i got a small pin 🗿
[2023-12-11T22:02:23] sombre_enfant: On the builder i can see ? Or it will show on road ?
[2023-12-11T22:03:54] sombre_enfant: Ah yes thats fucked up...
[2023-12-11T22:04:47] sombre_enfant: I cant if i don't have suitable vesc tool and apk
[2023-12-11T22:08:46] sombre_enfant: It come from my beta51 6.00 vesc tool with the apk
[2023-12-11T22:09:36] sombre_enfant: If u have stable files for the esc the tool and apk i take it
[2023-12-11T22:14:44] Unknown: I hate this folding mechanism
[2023-12-11T22:15:33] Tommy ª: *removes stm32*

[2023-12-11T22:15:56] Unknown: Well not a big deal we are degradable
[2023-12-11T22:16:06] Happy Giraffe: Motherfucker doesnt even tell me the time required because its more than two full days😂🙈
[2023-12-11T22:17:00] Happy Giraffe: Adult size mandalorian helmet😂
[2023-12-11T22:17:54] Happy Giraffe: Ender 3S1Plus, tho print bed is warped like fuck
[2023-12-11T22:18:37] Mirko Boni: Unfortunately it's true 😭😭😭😭
[2023-12-11T22:24:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, atleast slime also
[2023-12-11T22:29:26] haku: @Happy_Giraffe to avoid this stringing i have to use supports?
[2023-12-11T22:29:53] Happy Giraffe: Show us the model from same spot
[2023-12-11T22:30:04] Happy Giraffe: That's spaghetti not stringing😂
[2023-12-11T22:30:47] haku: i see its the back of the toilet
[2023-12-11T22:30:53] Happy Giraffe: If this works Im happy, nobody will see the uneven first layer🤫
[2023-12-11T22:31:06] haku: some prints have it. what causes this?
[2023-12-11T22:32:05] Happy Giraffe: Printer trying to print in mid air in the model, if you stack layers on top of each other it normally cant go sideways mid air😂
[2023-12-11T22:32:41] haku: i see. yes the printer was crowded.
[2023-12-11T22:33:24] haku: do i need support?
[2023-12-11T22:33:50] haku: also there is supports called tree. is that better than the other stuff?
[2023-12-11T22:34:33] Happy Giraffe: Yes for that you could use support just for that spot
[2023-12-11T22:34:51] Happy Giraffe: Different, try the basic ones first
[2023-12-11T22:35:48] haku: ok. thanks.
[2023-12-11T22:37:16] Happy Giraffe: If it puts supports all over the place then you can select if they can only touch buildplate or be everywhere. Also can select the angle it will support Manually on bambu slicer you can also paint places where you wish no support
[2023-12-11T22:38:07] haku: ok. i will play around with it
[2023-12-11T22:38:47] haku: what do you think of tinkercad? is it too advanced for a noobie?
[2023-12-11T22:57:34] sombre_enfant: Brother send apk+tool
[2023-12-11T22:58:18] sombre_enfant: Vesc tool from ?

[2023-12-11T23:13:55] haku: thank you
[2023-12-11T23:15:39] sombre_enfant: Tomorow i redo with unlimited and 6.02
[2023-12-11T23:16:45] sombre_enfant: Old lisp with 6.02 works ?
[2023-12-11T23:34:03] haku: 7hr print. let me test it
[2023-12-11T23:34:50] Tommy ª: i remember when i discovered that 3d printers takes hours to work internet dont stop to scam people with 50 secs shots
[2023-12-11T23:34:52] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2023-12-11T23:40:35] haku: its pooping on my ninebot
[2023-12-11T23:41:23] Tommy ª: i never seen a ninebot its the same than a xiaomi?
[2023-12-11T23:42:03] haku: i dont know. ive never seen a xiaomi
[2023-12-11T23:42:20] Tommy ª: <animation>
[2023-12-11T23:43:06] haku: Awsome possum
[2023-12-12T01:22:36] haku: does this segway have the same motor as g30
[2023-12-12T01:27:26] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: no
[2023-12-12T01:29:46] haku: thanks. they selling it for 350 stacking coupons
[2023-12-12T01:31:00] Paolo ⁭: Walmart?
[2023-12-12T01:34:35] haku: sams club. its like the walmart verision of costco
[2023-12-12T01:58:05] Paolo ⁭: Wtf means that, how can be dual configuration no good with 800w motor . Dual is always better than single
[2023-12-12T02:55:51] Jhinzuo ~~: ye im also confused dual always make sense. even punedir with dual 30h goes fast af
[2023-12-12T02:59:07] Paolo ⁭: Maybe single motor is sad
[2023-12-12T02:59:17] Paolo ⁭: Make sense only for law reasons
[2023-12-12T03:35:52] Unknown: I believe those don't have hall sensors. They use back emf? for wheel position sensing.
[2023-12-12T04:13:01] haku: im not sure but the coupon price seems good for a segway
[2023-12-12T04:24:41] haku: gotcha. not like ninebot
[2023-12-12T04:25:36] haku: i was gonna recomend it to my nephew for his college scooter
[2023-12-12T04:25:52] haku: thanks for the heads up
[2023-12-12T04:26:43] haku: yea g30 is what i want him to get. hes on a budget though.
[2023-12-12T04:27:05] haku: xiaomi and ninebot same company?
[2023-12-12T04:27:44] haku: i did not know that. ive never seen a xiaomi. only nui and ninebot
[2023-12-12T04:28:10] Jhinzuo ~~: Both got build by Segway basically so they are quite similar
[2023-12-12T04:29:58] haku: do you have a link to a xiaomi model that you recomend. i will try to find it in the US
[2023-12-12T04:30:59] Jhinzuo ~~: Pro2 like he said
[2023-12-12T04:31:15] haku: gotcha
[2023-12-12T04:31:44] Jhinzuo ~~: Has 12.4ah battery, 300w front motor, and is a little smaller than g30 but has same tuning capabilities
[2023-12-12T04:37:19] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: F series are weak
[2023-12-12T04:37:41] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: <photos/photo_11494@12-12-2023_04-37-41.jpg>
[2023-12-12T04:45:15] haku: ooh not good.
[2023-12-12T04:46:27] haku: no wonder the supermarket had it on sale
[2023-12-12T05:26:54] haku: is this how you guys 20s 18650s on a g30? but standing up?
[2023-12-12T05:27:12] haku: <photos/photo_11495@12-12-2023_05-27-12.jpg>
[2023-12-12T06:30:06] haku: basically the general motors of the pevs
[2023-12-12T06:36:19] puneDir: non bankrupt one
[2023-12-12T06:37:04] Rose: Hey there Blue, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-12T06:44:10] haku: okay. ill say they are like blackrock then.
[2023-12-12T06:46:27] haku: hey how many 18650 did you fit your g30?
[2023-12-12T06:54:14] puneDir: well i have 80 in but
[2023-12-12T06:54:32] puneDir: 20s6p fits inside
[2023-12-12T06:54:55] puneDir: with more complixated layouts and no esc 20s9p is possible
[2023-12-12T06:56:09] haku: thats crazy. 20s 9p and vesc inside?
[2023-12-12T07:54:09] haku: can anyone show me these complicated layouts for g30 batteries?
[2023-12-12T07:55:15] haku: probably alot of copper folding.
[2023-12-12T08:07:08] sombre_enfant: Complicated=shitty amps distribution
[2023-12-12T08:14:11] haku: dam thats a good deal
[2023-12-12T08:15:21] haku: its trash frame but its cheap
[2023-12-12T08:15:45] Mirono escooters: As the g2
[2023-12-12T08:16:18] Mirono escooters: Good motor, but shit frame (the one in pic)
[2023-12-12T08:17:06] Mirono escooters: Yeah I'd love a p series
[2023-12-12T08:21:48] haku: that ebike scooter is super affordable. perfect for my nephew on a budget. wonder if 12" ly motors fit like the fido scooters
[2023-12-12T08:25:25] haku: so many pevs going sale. wonder if its the weather. prolly getting rid of old stock.
[2023-12-12T09:05:02] sombre_enfant: Link
[2023-12-12T11:20:55] Mirono escooters: Merika 🦅
[2023-12-12T11:45:09] Gabe Enzo: Dead cells bro. I noticed this a long time ago.
[2023-12-12T11:45:45] Gabe Enzo: they're kept in stock at 70-100% instead of the recommend 30% for long term keeping.
[2023-12-12T11:46:23] Gabe Enzo: Bookmarked
[2023-12-12T11:47:48] Mirono escooters: Id you don't know how to build 😁😛
[2023-12-12T11:48:09] Gabe Enzo: faith restored in 20s6p internal pro 2.
[2023-12-12T11:48:12] Mirono escooters: Wich layout do you mean arit? There are so many. Most are normal tho
[2023-12-12T11:48:24] sombre_enfant: 🤓🤓
[2023-12-12T11:48:24] Mirono escooters: You stay with simple layout for first time 😛
[2023-12-12T11:48:25] Gabe Enzo: the ones where the cells are horizontal and stacked on eachother.
[2023-12-12T11:48:33] Gabe Enzo: right... good idea.
[2023-12-12T11:48:35] Mirono escooters: Prove me wrong?
[2023-12-12T11:48:57] sombre_enfant: Brother i just dont build shit layout
[2023-12-12T11:49:01] Mirono escooters: Never need in g30 afaik That's for shitty low height spaces xD
[2023-12-12T11:49:09] Mirono escooters: You do you But why spread misinformation
[2023-12-12T11:49:20] sombre_enfant: Its the truth
[2023-12-12T11:49:23] Mirono escooters: Any layout is fine, if you do math and calculate the thickness of wires and copper
[2023-12-12T11:49:35] Mirono escooters: I prefer science over "shit layout"
[2023-12-12T11:49:45] sombre_enfant: Material wise less amps
[2023-12-12T11:49:54] Gabe Enzo: I think so too!!!!
[2023-12-12T11:50:04] Gabe Enzo: HAHAHA
[2023-12-12T11:50:09] Mirono escooters: If you wanna squeeze the max out of space, I doubt you care about a little more material
[2023-12-12T11:50:26] Mirono escooters: Anyone who pains himself to build such layouts will happily throw more material at it.
[2023-12-12T11:51:42] Mirono escooters: Better
[2023-12-12T12:09:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well , probably some of us heard your question, but because an old song was louder "killing me softly" didn't answered
[2023-12-12T12:10:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So near unsure about your question is for real ,but bro Ninebot factory made xiaomi frames for years 😅
[2023-12-12T12:11:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No
[2023-12-12T12:12:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If that's f40 it's 30 h marked as 350 D series motoros even smaller magnet
[2023-12-12T12:14:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes like this and all frames like that not too strong and to unplug engine is a mess
[2023-12-12T12:14:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Only interesting in that its sensorless and you dont feel it
[2023-12-12T12:16:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bro segway and ninebot is ine thing a few years not Ninebot made all xiaomi frame up to mi 3 Now Unsure how much navee us doing 🤷‍♂
[2023-12-12T12:16:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Love this pics 😁
[2023-12-12T12:17:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont they fit in side gap? Maybe if you remove rail partly ,than mount heatsink outside
[2023-12-12T13:32:47] francois schempers: g2 frame is steel, I don't call that shit x)
[2023-12-12T13:33:50] Mirono escooters: You misread.
[2023-12-12T13:34:12] Mirono escooters: "the one in pic" = shit frame.
[2023-12-12T13:36:29] francois schempers: ahh
[2023-12-12T14:11:24] Happy Giraffe: One support got loose from bed...I dont fucking understand how because it has lot of contact area...
[2023-12-12T14:11:48] Happy Giraffe: Sad because the actual print has flawless look into it...

[2023-12-12T14:46:30] Tommy ª: It's not very real Casually the most sell scooter here are Xiaomis, most of people don't know about ninebot existence I discovered when I noticed ninebot printed on every part of my Xiaomi bruh
[2023-12-12T14:51:17] haku: this copper silk pla looks very nice.
[2023-12-12T14:55:14] haku: whas this the mando helmet?
[2023-12-12T15:06:14] Happy Giraffe: Yup, never buying any other filament than Tinmorry lol. Also supports next time I put a wide brim to stick them in place. Clearly this wasnt enough. 160gram lost filament means I cant complete this with a single roll anymore
[2023-12-12T15:06:41] Happy Giraffe: That looks fantasic
[2023-12-12T15:07:06] haku: that sold out fast. its amzon. i checked. its out of stock
[2023-12-12T15:08:19] haku: the normal rectangle 20s?p layout for the g30
[2023-12-12T15:08:27] Gabe Enzo: This is why it makes zero sense to buy new PEVs. It's better to buy a trashed one and make your own cell. Sure you pay 100€ extra but at least you get a GOOD cell. get what you pay for
[2023-12-12T15:08:40] Gabe Enzo: Those G2's are definitely kept the same way. It's all shit. idk why the manufacturers just don't give a shit.
[2023-12-12T15:10:47] haku: i will grind the rails.
[2023-12-12T15:14:54] Gabe Enzo: will that not risk structural integrity?
[2023-12-12T15:15:07] Gabe Enzo: my 2 cents
[2023-12-12T15:16:04] Jan: Check for Brim feature and do a 10mm brim
[2023-12-12T15:16:12] Unknown: Tf ?
[2023-12-12T15:16:34] sombre_enfant: No
[2023-12-12T15:17:09] haku: maybe. but its on the way of the batteries. this scooter will really lose its structural integrity because ill try to fit 11 tires😭
[2023-12-12T15:17:18] puneDir: no it will not
[2023-12-12T15:18:32] Mirono escooters: They are stored at the perfect condition, otherwise its literally illegal to transport or sell
[2023-12-12T15:18:35] Mirono escooters: Stop making stuff up
[2023-12-12T15:20:52] Mirono escooters: : D
[2023-12-12T15:20:58] Mirono escooters: People just clicking stuff
[2023-12-12T15:41:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What's not real?🤣
[2023-12-12T15:41:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why Others fault that non looks around
[2023-12-12T15:43:43] Happy Giraffe: Did 3mm around
[2023-12-12T15:43:55] Happy Giraffe: Next time for sure 15mm🙈
[2023-12-12T15:44:03] Jan: What material?
[2023-12-12T15:44:17] Happy Giraffe: Pla+
[2023-12-12T15:44:21] Jan: Hm
[2023-12-12T15:44:34] Jan: 60°C + Hairspray is usually my way to go
[2023-12-12T15:44:42] Happy Giraffe: First time trying it lol, regular pla worked fine
[2023-12-12T15:44:58] Happy Giraffe: I had 70°c set and PEI sheet
[2023-12-12T15:48:27] haku: is this a decent brand?
[2023-12-12T15:54:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also imagine like this all old xiaomi models are small bro of ninebot g30
[2023-12-12T16:32:19] Gabe Enzo: Every ev I've bought has always been overcharged during storage.
[2023-12-12T16:32:53] Gabe Enzo: Have you not checked percentage when you buy a new toy? When I got my Pro 2 it was shipped at 75% (bad) Same with my FIIDO L3, sold at 100%.
[2023-12-12T16:42:44] Mirono escooters: Skill issue
[2023-12-12T16:43:04] Mirono escooters: You could sue em for that🤓🤷
[2023-12-12T16:43:32] Mirono escooters: Anyway, all my PEV came perfectly fine regarding safety.
[2023-12-12T16:44:03] Jhinzuo ~~: Nah 75 ain't bad still if batt has 1 cycle u won't loose anything
[2023-12-12T16:44:28] Mirono escooters: 75 is bad if stored loong
[2023-12-12T16:45:39] Jhinzuo ~~: But tbh I never received anything with a li-ion battery charged more than 45% phones scooters laptops
[2023-12-12T16:46:48] Jhinzuo ~~: Ye but the scoots get bought regularly so I don't think they keep them for a year
[2023-12-12T17:03:30] Mirono escooters: Depending on their Shipping company, they have rules to follow
[2023-12-12T17:03:37] Mirono escooters: If you buy it from a shop, I can't say anything about that.
[2023-12-12T17:07:46] Gabe Enzo: It was possibly refurbed. Too cheap.
[2023-12-12T17:13:43] Mirono escooters: Shitty brand or a proper?
[2023-12-12T17:13:50] Mirono escooters: Same applies
[2023-12-12T17:14:01] Mirono escooters: But yah, it happens. But, any good brand I saw, didn't
[2023-12-12T17:14:04] Mirono escooters: Even vsett respects it
[2023-12-12T17:34:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not the best, but you cant even fully charge,so unsure how accurate is that% from this point of view
[2023-12-12T17:49:53] Mirono escooters: This message confuses me
[2023-12-12T17:49:57] Mirono escooters: Weird
[2023-12-12T17:50:01] Mirono escooters: Maybe diff supplier
[2023-12-12T17:52:45] Mirono escooters: The fuck? Doesn't make sense
[2023-12-12T17:52:54] Mirono escooters: I never had issues. Weird.
[2023-12-12T18:06:24] Rose: Hey there Windfire, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2023-12-12T18:34:58] Tommy ª: some of the v2 comes with the wrong shunt configuration
[2023-12-12T18:39:18] Mirono escooters: Alupcb no issue
[2023-12-12T18:39:25] Mirono escooters: Only cutoff mos die issue Ez fix

[2023-12-12T19:15:06] Jhinzuo ~~: Same. Germany has harsh regulation regarding batterys
[2023-12-12T19:16:56] Mirono escooters: Guess regulations a good thing sometimes.
[2023-12-12T20:10:48] Windfire: My problem is the power is low.....i have a 36v battery and with throttle the max current in vesc in 4 ampere. I have measured with instrument
[2023-12-12T20:11:45] haku: its different. 75/100 alu pcb

[2023-12-12T20:23:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You have to show or tell more to get a proper answer
[2023-12-12T20:24:58] Mirono escooters: Still, 4.13v per cell storage is bad.
[2023-12-12T20:33:28] Windfire: Max speed with my ebike is 16 km h
[2023-12-12T20:33:35] Windfire: Is very low
[2023-12-12T20:34:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I didn't ment top speed

[2023-12-12T20:44:32] Windfire: I ve bypassed him
[2023-12-12T20:45:30] Windfire: Original controller is off
[2023-12-12T20:45:38] Tommy ª: why bike users always bypass the battery? that thing explodes funny

[2023-12-13T10:03:29] Happy Giraffe: Soldering it after would heat cells a bit. A builder in Finland solders copper idk why he doesnt get a proper spotwelder as he has the money
[2023-12-13T10:04:24] Mirono escooters: Because moron and "my way is better"
[2023-12-13T10:04:28] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-12-13T10:04:56] Mirono escooters: Because someone else do it, doesn't mean it's good :)
[2023-12-13T10:57:07] Gabe Enzo: What wire size should I use for 10kw? 8awg?
[2023-12-13T10:57:32] Gabe Enzo: Batt wires
[2023-12-13T10:57:39] Gabe Enzo: Also, Nickel won't cut it. will it?? 🗿
[2023-12-13T11:10:02] sombre_enfant: Use copper or u waste molicell
[2023-12-13T11:12:33] Unknown: Do think I can fit a 11inch motor on the zero10x and if yes how ?
[2023-12-13T11:12:57] Gabe Enzo: Where's a reliable place for copper. I don't trust AliExpress really
[2023-12-13T11:13:12] sombre_enfant: Yes with swingarm axle machined
[2023-12-13T11:13:49] Gabe Enzo: Can a car battery manage to weld copper?
[2023-12-13T11:14:31] sombre_enfant: Bro wtf buy a glitter
[2023-12-13T11:15:49] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11508@13-12-2023_11-15-49.jpg>
[2023-12-13T11:16:52] Gabe Enzo: dat shit is 600€, more than my fkn scooter
[2023-12-13T11:18:43] Gabe Enzo: can't pull money put of my ass bro I'm already breaking my ass to get moli later
[2023-12-13T11:20:28] sombre_enfant: Its 180€
[2023-12-13T11:22:17] Gabe Enzo: Oh god I'm actually gonna spend 1000 on my pro 2 and I've already spent 1000 on it as Is
[2023-12-13T11:22:21] Gabe Enzo: that's 2 fucking thousand euros
[2023-12-13T11:22:42] sombre_enfant: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EvYHH5r
[2023-12-13T11:22:53] Gabe Enzo: <sticker>
[2023-12-13T11:23:09] sombre_enfant: Bro stop trippin your setup dont need 20s7p molicell
[2023-12-13T11:23:44] Gabe Enzo: you're the second person to tell me that after @nosoudoppi Perhaps I go with 20s4p only.
[2023-12-13T11:24:02] Gabe Enzo: Full internal no bag
[2023-12-13T11:24:25] sombre_enfant: Yeah even 4p with your small motor dont need 40A cells
[2023-12-13T11:24:47] Jan: G30 only 20s6p possible but then with floor extension
[2023-12-13T11:24:48] Gabe Enzo: I'm going with molicel purely for the fact that I'm looking at dual motor in the future So I'm essentially saving money in the future by buying better* cells now.
[2023-12-13T11:25:06] Jan: 20s5p without probably but thermally challenging
[2023-12-13T11:26:22] sombre_enfant: How tf u spent a thousand ??? I did dual 50h 16s vesc g30 for half 2 year back
[2023-12-13T11:26:35] Mirono escooters: Copper is copper..
[2023-12-13T11:26:42] Mirono escooters: And amazon has Alieexpress
[2023-12-13T11:26:49] Mirono escooters: Depends
[2023-12-13T11:27:02] Jan: Or spray painted alu 😅
[2023-12-13T11:27:54] Mirono escooters: @francois_schempers 🤔😁
[2023-12-13T11:28:02] Gabe Enzo: Oh dude you wish.. I've been a moron. Spent around 200 on xescs that constantly burned. 200€ on spintend 200€ on a pro 2 which motor i burned and battery I killed (fucked) 420€ on my Original pro 2 Bunch of misc like tyres and BLE and suspension around 300€
[2023-12-13T11:28:07] Mirono escooters: I don't know any Chinese that does that..
[2023-12-13T11:28:14] Mirono escooters: Well wasted money doesn't count
[2023-12-13T11:28:37] Gabe Enzo: My brain sure likes to tell me it does. But you're correct. I shouldn't Beat myself up
[2023-12-13T11:28:53] Gabe Enzo: That brings the total down to 550.
[2023-12-13T11:28:56] Mirono escooters: If I count all the old mods or unsuccessful, I'm at high € too
[2023-12-13T11:29:06] Jan: Hopefully it stays that way
[2023-12-13T11:29:39] Jan: I call that learning experience money
[2023-12-13T11:29:43] Mirono escooters: Voila
[2023-12-13T11:29:57] Mirono escooters: You barely waste money. You learn
[2023-12-13T11:46:36] Ion: What would cause a motor *clunk* sound (+ you can feel it through the frame) when transitioning from braking to acceleration and acceleration to braking. Notice it only happens when you "change" what the motor is doing. you can even coast in between, but the first time you brake after throttle or throttle after brake, the sound happens. After that, It never does, only when go and "change" again.
[2023-12-13T11:46:57] Ion: The harder you accelerate or brake in this transition, the louder and more violent it is.
[2023-12-13T11:47:29] Ion: Is this related to motor tracking? why does it only happen the 1st time you brake/accelerate, but not on every consecutive "same action"
[2023-12-13T12:07:38] Unknown: New swing arm ?
[2023-12-13T12:09:28] Mirono escooters: Your motor axle is Problably loose? 99% of the time it's that
[2023-12-13T12:09:36] Mirono escooters: So it's rocking back and forth. Defenitely asap check this.
[2023-12-13T12:13:58] Gabe Enzo: Which one do I get? Left is 50€ right is 100€
[2023-12-13T12:13:58] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11510@13-12-2023_12-13-58.jpg>
[2023-12-13T12:16:01] Chen Simhony: Monorim is better
[2023-12-13T12:17:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you would open it ,you would see a big u shape alu inside (usually) Why not remove shit plastic and do more ,or just get old pc heasink and thermal glue it around?
[2023-12-13T12:20:13] Jan: Lol the right one is maximum stupid design
[2023-12-13T12:21:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sounds like that , in rare cases ,this can come after Bearing change coz they forget to put washers back on axle ( not all engine's have this)
[2023-12-13T12:22:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Resin is not ment for super hard breaking ,also good for nothing in rain or wet situations ,pad acts like chalk (kinda like)
[2023-12-13T12:22:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So probably not the best for fast rides
[2023-12-13T12:23:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And probably your brake distance was over than it should be
[2023-12-13T12:24:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Magura brake good ,levers shit
[2023-12-13T12:24:22] Mirono escooters: I'm sorry, right is a 100?
[2023-12-13T12:24:31] Mirono escooters: I hope you mean konyk, and not the china knockoff That one's like 30
[2023-12-13T12:25:19] Mirono escooters: Anyway get konyk Monoshit..
[2023-12-13T12:34:36] Gabe Enzo: monorim has always been expensive as hell.
[2023-12-13T12:35:01] Gabe Enzo: I sadly bought front minorum already
[2023-12-13T12:35:47] Mirono escooters: Monorim is shit
[2023-12-13T12:37:50] Jan: I agree but its because nobody is paying for actual quality products
[2023-12-13T12:38:21] Jan: If i say i can make the perfect suspension solution for 250€ per axle, people are not gonna get it
[2023-12-13T12:38:36] Jhinzuo ~~: Because the price is a 2nd scooter
[2023-12-13T12:38:45] Gabe Enzo: ding ding
[2023-12-13T12:38:47] Gabe Enzo: Yep.
[2023-12-13T12:38:53] Happy Giraffe: Im not sure whats inside😂
[2023-12-13T12:39:07] Happy Giraffe: But this will be enough when bolted properly with paste
[2023-12-13T12:39:17] Jan: Yes and they keep their prices low with insane production numbers and cheap materials
[2023-12-13T12:39:52] Jan: If im selling 100x pieces of something, i cannot keep up with prices for production scooters that sell in the millions
[2023-12-13T12:39:59] Jhinzuo ~~: Yes true
[2023-12-13T12:40:19] Jhinzuo ~~: They have big ass factories vs a guy and a workshop
[2023-12-13T12:40:23] Jan: So how do you compensate for that if you gonna sell for low production numbers? You sell cheap ass shit
[2023-12-13T12:40:46] Jan: But people buy despite complaining
[2023-12-13T12:40:53] Jan: as long as it is cheap
[2023-12-13T12:41:08] Jan: The mindset of: Buy cheap, buy twice
[2023-12-13T12:41:29] Jan: throwing old stuff away, accumulating trash in the world for nothing
[2023-12-13T12:41:29] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jan has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-13T12:43:19] Ion: that's interesting,. I did replace bearings, but did not have any washers on both sides
[2023-12-13T12:44:00] Ion: motor was opened before and i fixed it, so possible that washers were missing. Its a Vsett10+ motor. How can missing washers cause that?
[2023-12-13T12:48:11] @Súperpatin: Hello!!! I ask you for help, I have a zero 10x motor at 1200W and a 68V battery at 59 amps, and a Flipsky 75100 speed controller - based on VESC. How much amperage could it handle without breaking the motor, but still having a good top speed? What do you recommend?
[2023-12-13T12:48:20] @Súperpatin: <photos/photo_11511@13-12-2023_12-48-20.jpg>
[2023-12-13T12:48:23] @Súperpatin: <photos/photo_11512@13-12-2023_12-48-23.jpg>
[2023-12-13T12:49:37] Jan: If thats a 50H probably 7-8kW saturation limit, but temperature will rise so fast that you cannot use it for long at that power without overheating and therefore breaking
[2023-12-13T12:50:06] @Súperpatin: <photos/photo_11513@13-12-2023_12-50-06.jpg>
[2023-12-13T12:50:58] Jan: You cant push more than 4kW anyway with that battery
[2023-12-13T12:51:38] @Súperpatin: Can you recommend some amperage that does not break???
[2023-12-13T12:51:41] Jan: Dual motor 50H with dual controller over can-bus and your battery
[2023-12-13T12:52:06] Jan: Motor will not break when kept below 80°C
[2023-12-13T12:52:08] @Súperpatin: One motors !!!
[2023-12-13T12:52:18] Jan: Just have an eye on temp
[2023-12-13T12:52:45] Jan: Can send it full 4kW until 80°C
[2023-12-13T12:55:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bearings change was just now or earlier?? If second sound should exist a while, also unsure if that engine has washers or not
[2023-12-13T12:56:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is a cheap 2 A charger right?
[2023-12-13T12:56:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Usually u bar inside and some mosfet bolted on it
[2023-12-13T13:00:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In this case i would set only 44- 50 A battery amp , If you set that high as cells knowledge you will Always keep them superhot
[2023-12-13T13:00:44] Ion: recent, less than 50km, but that motor has other "issues" (all magnets reglued and 1 magnet snapped and glued)
[2023-12-13T13:01:03] Ion: On my Vsett 10+ (with good motors) I also changed bearings but never had that clunk issue
[2023-12-13T13:01:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably your engine can take all what battery and contoller can provide
[2023-12-13T13:02:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What happened?
[2023-12-13T13:02:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also try this
[2023-12-13T13:03:23] Ion: Bought it this was with intent to fix, magnets were not glued in properly from factory, and my dumbass snapped one while installing lol
[2023-12-13T13:03:34] @Súperpatin: So can the plate break before the motor?
[2023-12-13T13:04:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Get scooter engine in the air like a table or something,best is if some holds down the scooter for this , So engine in the air and you try to move it to sides on axle
[2023-12-13T13:05:14] Ion: I'll check, thanks for the tips
[2023-12-13T13:05:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So basically not huge hit ,what is good
[2023-12-13T13:05:40] Ion: was cheap tho :) and works (mostly)
[2023-12-13T13:06:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did you check also what Miro said?
[2023-12-13T13:06:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So nothing is loose
[2023-12-13T13:07:23] Happy Giraffe: 1.5
[2023-12-13T13:07:36] Ion: not loose, but I could try tighten more
[2023-12-13T13:07:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you find nothing these ways , try turn motor by hand while you stress to one side,like push , So try to make the sound Worst case need to open
[2023-12-13T13:08:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than i am sure its like that
[2023-12-13T13:09:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure why you ask this to be honest
[2023-12-13T13:13:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You dont set maximum cell Amper in vesc, you would just destroy them in short time and also there is bms
[2023-12-13T13:19:15] Mirono escooters: Come on. There is a border between that and monoshit
[2023-12-13T13:19:29] Mirono escooters: We just ask for normal quality. Nothing special. Its 2023, they got the tools.
[2023-12-13T13:19:57] Mirono escooters: Capitalism so great
[2023-12-13T13:21:01] Jan: Monorim would be 200€ if it where actually decent
[2023-12-13T13:21:02] sombre_enfant: Do 20s5p and dual
[2023-12-13T13:23:01] Mirono escooters: Very much doubt so
[2023-12-13T13:23:29] Mirono escooters: Konyk/dereza is European Company, handcrafted.
[2023-12-13T13:23:36] Mirono escooters: For the same price +-
[2023-12-13T13:24:03] Gabe Enzo: 170 much different than 100
[2023-12-13T13:24:11] Mirono escooters: And their quality is top notch. Out of this world. Yes it's C type, doesn't matter, the travel is perfect and fine for under 60kmh. And yes, I know not many competitors to monorim exist, but that doesnt mean we should accept their quality and business behavior.
[2023-12-13T13:24:18] Mirono escooters: You are wrong. Its 100€ for the front sus
[2023-12-13T13:24:24] Mirono escooters: And rear is like 80
[2023-12-13T13:24:45] Gabe Enzo: wtf I'll check rn
[2023-12-13T13:26:24] Mirono escooters: After making monorim "good" In my eyes, I spend 4-5h work, and 40-50€ in materials So I don't see the argument about "200€ suspension"
[2023-12-13T13:27:02] Mirono escooters: But that is my view, and views can differ.🤷 I debated to design a suspension as a project, but it wasn't worth it for me. Especially since konyk exist now
[2023-12-13T13:27:43] Jan: You got some pictures?
[2023-12-13T13:28:01] Mirono escooters: Somewhere 🤷
[2023-12-13T13:28:22] Mirono escooters: Its C type anyway. You won't like it Doesn't matter. Its a example that craftsmanship can be cheap and great.
[2023-12-13T13:28:40] Mirono escooters: I will never buy monorim, except if I have no other option. And for now, no need, : D

[2023-12-13T13:29:24] Mirono escooters: Goodbye last sunny and warm day. And Hello winter madness
[2023-12-13T13:30:29] Mirono escooters: That is my dream, to have such a company to make this stuff. Sadly, I doubt that'll Ever be reality 😁
[2023-12-13T13:31:30] Jan: Yeah the interesting part is how many pieces do they expect to sell. When i order an injection mold for sidepieces like these, i pay minimum 5000€ for a dirt cheap mold
[2023-12-13T13:32:07] Jan: They probably did a 3parts in 1 mold for that price somewhere in china
[2023-12-13T13:32:29] Mirono escooters: They did a batch of a 100, didn't even reach it, yet still produced it. That's what I call a good business.
[2023-12-13T13:32:46] Jan: Thats kinda risky without a market analysis
[2023-12-13T13:33:05] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter? Its a beta thing. They sell a thousand other things
[2023-12-13T13:33:08] Jan: Even with 100pieces thats easily 50-60€ just plastic parts production cost
[2023-12-13T13:33:25] Mirono escooters: Idk how they do it, I also don't care, I'm just setting a example 😆
[2023-12-13T13:33:27] Jan: If you are a big supplier you can cover the loss if fail
[2023-12-13T13:33:40] Mirono escooters: The side piece is optional btw. I don't like it. I prefer the black paint.
[2023-12-13T13:33:50] Mirono escooters: Monorim earns enough too
[2023-12-13T13:39:31] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: no I heard someone say that steel is 25% worse, but I don't see a big difference (I see a shortage of real nickel and its price)
[2023-12-13T13:39:56] Mirono escooters: I see math and physics, and not "heard" and "see"
[2023-12-13T13:40:36] Mirono escooters: "yes 20s on stock Esc is fine, my friend does it" same vibe. Annoys me.
[2023-12-13T13:50:58] Mirono escooters: https://www.thoughtco.com/table-of-electrical-resistivity-conductivity-608499 Actually almost 6× as good. Idk what made up source the 25% comes from. Stop the misinformation.
[2023-12-13T13:52:03] Mirono escooters: Even depends wich grade and type of steel, and be sure china doesn't use the high quality one
[2023-12-13T13:53:37] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I'm not taking more than 30A from 0.15-0.2, It’s more likely that the battery will heat up and drain than the strip will affect.
[2023-12-13T13:53:47] Mirono escooters: Lol 30A through 0.2 steel
[2023-12-13T13:53:49] Mirono escooters: Funny man
[2023-12-13T13:54:48] Mirono escooters: Why would you ever recommend someone, unknowingly of his batteries and specs, recommend nickel plated.
[2023-12-13T14:13:42] Gabe Enzo: not Steel plated, nickel plated 99.99% steel
[2023-12-13T14:13:55] Gabe Enzo: Thank fuck I saw this or I would've made a moli pack with STEEL
[2023-12-13T14:13:57] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2023-12-13T14:14:32] Mirono escooters: My bad. Was typing fast
[2023-12-13T14:15:04] Mirono escooters: And THIS is why I hate misinformation. Unknown people will listen and follow the advice. If I don't read this group daily, I just know bad things will be shared
[2023-12-13T14:15:45] Mirono escooters: There's a new rule. If you are spreading misinformation first hand (meaning you didn't pick it up from someone else, or you just made it up for "fun) you will get a mute, duration depends on my mood
[2023-12-13T14:16:16] haku: be smart on where you purchase your scooter parts. stuff like copper and welders you can use ali. but batteries and use trusted retailers and you will be able to afford it all .
[2023-12-13T14:20:59] haku: only in ali is where you can ball out of control baby
[2023-12-13T14:21:40] Mirono escooters: Batts from alieexpress is always a gamble
[2023-12-13T14:22:33] haku: yes if you know the right vendors 😜
[2023-12-13T14:22:47] Mirono escooters: Well, none : D
[2023-12-13T14:23:27] haku: there are gems ive been told.
[2023-12-13T14:24:16] Mirono escooters: On AliExpress? Cells? If gems are grade B cells sure : D
[2023-12-13T14:26:32] Jhinzuo ~~: I like that 😂
[2023-12-13T14:27:19] Mirono escooters: Me too. I'm done with justifying things every day
[2023-12-13T14:34:04] Happy Giraffe: You need a thermistor, single motor will heat lot more than dual if you accelerate constantly
[2023-12-13T14:42:43] haku: there is still a market for quality products. if your product is good there are folks that will buy it.
[2023-12-13T14:43:05] Mirono escooters: But not many : d
[2023-12-13T14:43:46] haku: i know alot of boogie folks. they buy the best western products
[2023-12-13T14:51:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I actually agree with Jan Cant be made at that price and there is also another barrier
[2023-12-13T14:52:51] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom
[2023-12-13T14:53:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All these small "suspensions" are more like a ring out on a spring that's why you see huge reaction on handlebar with all ,cant be made this small to be effective
[2023-12-13T14:53:36] Gabe Enzo: I'm super lost on the decision Xd.i need someone smart.
[2023-12-13T14:55:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just telling, Csabi who bought stuff from you back in the day managed to broke konyk arm 🙈🤷‍♂
[2023-12-13T14:57:50] Ion: yep, looks like its not about ramp time
[2023-12-13T14:57:55] Mirono escooters: Wich decision
[2023-12-13T14:58:07] Mirono escooters: Wich arm? How? 😭
[2023-12-13T14:58:18] Mirono escooters: Anything breaks But compare konyk to monorim.
[2023-12-13T14:59:16] Gabe Enzo: 20s4p or 20s7p or even 20s6p haha. If 20s4p will be enough for dual 800w in the future. which I doubt it will as it's only 1.2kwh and that's basically 2x pro 2 Batts
[2023-12-13T14:59:27] Mirono escooters: I'm betting my money on loose axle. Especially if clonk is that big. Something is loose
[2023-12-13T14:59:45] Mirono escooters: XD thanks James
[2023-12-13T14:59:54] Gabe Enzo: I've been thinking about it non stop it's becoming a nuisance
[2023-12-13T15:00:03] Gabe Enzo: And ofc the cell must last 4years
[2023-12-13T15:00:07] Gabe Enzo: or 3
[2023-12-13T15:00:46] Gabe Enzo: I'm not scared of a bag tbh
[2023-12-13T15:00:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This also depends, older steel monorim forks where from good steel ,try to cut thread and than you know ,alu one is a bad joke😅
[2023-12-13T15:01:27] Gabe Enzo: 20s5/6p could be middle ground and what I want. but I need a price per cell to know if I can finance it.
[2023-12-13T15:01:36] Gabe Enzo: today I make the final decision
[2023-12-13T15:02:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think right side ,he made side jump and managed to crack,but his a doing 1000 km a week or such
[2023-12-13T15:03:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz they retards
[2023-12-13T15:03:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Search version super
[2023-12-13T15:03:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The one what comes with one chamber exa
[2023-12-13T15:04:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fork has a shiny edge and monorim logo on side
[2023-12-13T15:04:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Can show you if you like
[2023-12-13T15:04:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I can bend it on my knee🤣
[2023-12-13T15:04:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Super shit🤣🤣🤣
[2023-12-13T15:04:48] Mirono escooters: Why be surprised then?
[2023-12-13T15:05:01] Mirono escooters: 1000km a week Man I'd be doing maintenance a lot
[2023-12-13T15:05:21] Mirono escooters: Monoshit not trying to make bad engineering decisions (impossible challenge)
[2023-12-13T15:05:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way it was his fault,but still managed to broke it 😁
[2023-12-13T15:05:41] Mirono escooters: Yes, and torque washer
[2023-12-13T15:05:48] Ion: Loose you mean on axle nuts or internally on stator?
[2023-12-13T15:05:51] Mirono escooters: Otherwise it clonks. I had excact same thing
[2023-12-13T15:05:57] Mirono escooters: Axle nuts in dropout
[2023-12-13T15:05:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Food delivery
[2023-12-13T15:06:03] Mirono escooters: Use torque washer, and loads of uggabugga
[2023-12-13T15:06:11] Mirono escooters: Easy to check if it's looze
[2023-12-13T15:06:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When they do something from there own all turns even worse
[2023-12-13T15:06:31] Mirono escooters: That's the downside of ebrake. Constant torque change. Wiggles everything loose
[2023-12-13T15:06:52] Ion: It's fine on my Vsett tho...
[2023-12-13T15:06:57] Mirono escooters: Just imagine the forces. When wheel turn counterclockwise, axle wants to turn clockwise Then you ebrake, both forces change Rocks back and forth
[2023-12-13T15:07:08] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter. Because it works there, doesn't work here
[2023-12-13T15:07:17] Ion: fair
[2023-12-13T15:07:17] Mirono escooters: Ebrake is fine, if dropouts and margins ok
[2023-12-13T15:07:28] Mirono escooters: And torque washers, loads xD
[2023-12-13T15:07:39] Mirono escooters: Everything is breakable..
[2023-12-13T15:07:47] Ion: Well it's g30, so only has 1 washer on the outside
[2023-12-13T15:07:54] Mirono escooters: Id be a better engineer at this point
[2023-12-13T15:08:01] Mirono escooters: Ah the tiny one?
[2023-12-13T15:08:13] Mirono escooters: Well, check. Because even then it has wiggle And needs 3 uggabuggas of torque
[2023-12-13T15:16:24] Ion: <photos/photo_11520@13-12-2023_15-16-24.jpg>
[2023-12-13T15:16:43] Ion: Tho yes, I was able to tighten it more. I'll ride and check
[2023-12-13T15:17:57] Mirono escooters: 5 uggabuggas
[2023-12-13T15:25:35] Ion: Works 🎉
[2023-12-13T15:25:48] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2023-12-13T15:25:52] Ion: I wouldn't have guessed you need THAT much torque
[2023-12-13T15:26:16] Mirono escooters: Keep an eye on it. It can get loose overtime Best get some tight fitting torque arms.
[2023-12-13T15:26:30] Mirono escooters: Yeah, it's surprisingly much

[2023-12-13T15:31:53] Windfire: Do you know motor poles value are right ?
[2023-12-13T15:31:57] sombre_enfant: Cant help on that one
[2023-12-13T15:33:34] Mirono escooters: Only matters for speed
[2023-12-13T15:33:40] Mirono escooters: Change if off
[2023-12-13T15:39:44] Windfire: Can you help me to setup ?
[2023-12-13T15:53:12] Windfire: <video_file>
[2023-12-13T16:03:48] Windfire: In the street max speed is 16 km h ?
[2023-12-13T16:03:51] Windfire: Why ?
[2023-12-13T16:17:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Which part 😁
[2023-12-13T16:17:45] Tommy ª: everything 😭💀
[2023-12-13T16:18:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well whole Starts with the disc
[2023-12-13T16:18:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But in old stuff like that lot shit can exist like probably Bearings are there from 2006
[2023-12-13T16:19:15] Tommy ª: everything on that is from 2001 everything is distroyed
[2023-12-13T16:20:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brake is interesting part old mopeds had this slide style just double ,called self setting 🤣
[2023-12-13T16:21:28] Tommy ª: casually i put one of these brakes in my old scooter and works better than the old drum brake the "self setting" is quite genius
[2023-12-13T16:22:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On mopeds and such like this can be good ,but if scooter not noise like this annoying to listen to it every time you accelerate
[2023-12-13T16:23:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can find it even in hidro
[2023-12-13T16:23:32] Tommy ª: imagine my chain under regen uwu
[2023-12-13T16:24:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure its ment to do such
[2023-12-13T16:24:57] Tommy ª: DiiiiiiiiiuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE (?)
[2023-12-13T16:25:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If like so, 22 years of not caring ,would expect much better
[2023-12-13T16:25:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure this is English
[2023-12-13T16:26:37] Tommy ª: my friend got it for free, i got the idea for restore it but its a nightmare everything is f*** even the own frame
[2023-12-13T16:26:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Always tighten max with threadlock
[2023-12-13T16:30:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you spin engine in the air ,vesc doesnt need to send much amps
[2023-12-13T16:30:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Since in the air
[2023-12-13T16:32:06] Tommy ª: the mine draws 800ma in the air, there is no power! 😭
[2023-12-13T16:33:18] Tommy ª: bro that spins like normal, imagine that motor its not going to reach 25kmh in original state you want more speed? just change the gears
[2023-12-13T16:38:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Air has zero resitance so no power needed in the air , problem is no power on the ground, measuring you made is pointless vesc app would tell more
[2023-12-13T16:39:58] Tommy ª: jk, actually i got more than 50 amps from battery on road just measure amps in air is useless
[2023-12-13T16:40:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am also not sure if that's a large category
[2023-12-13T16:40:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Please let us help him ,same thing say I said already twice
[2023-12-13T16:40:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also near pulley
[2023-12-13T16:41:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @Happy_Giraffe might played with that but Engine full different
[2023-12-13T16:41:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is super mini ,just was looking some inside pictures
[2023-12-13T16:41:46] Tommy ª: how actually you measure speed with geared bike and mid drive? 💀
[2023-12-13T16:42:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah lot times bent, i have 4 frames ,two shitty two like new ,but just storing them
[2023-12-13T16:42:32] Finn: @PaoloWu perfect shipping 😂
[2023-12-13T16:42:41] Finn: <photos/photo_11526@13-12-2023_16-42-41.jpg>
[2023-12-13T16:43:31] Paolo ⁭: Bottle gone 🙈
[2023-12-13T16:43:33] Tommy ª: the bent thread 😭💀
[2023-12-13T16:43:51] Tommy ª: WAIT I JUST SEE THE BOTTLES 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
[2023-12-13T16:44:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Was about to ask how you thread on the otherside 😁😅
[2023-12-13T16:46:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Near vesc the same way as any other cases
[2023-12-13T16:46:19] Gabe Enzo: there was a hole in mine too xd
[2023-12-13T16:46:59] Ion: Loctite maybe? Also what are "torque arms" in this context. Do people with modded g30 use them?
[2023-12-13T16:58:10] Happy Giraffe: It's not possible for vesc to show correct mid drive speed without a speed sensor or something like that. The cassette already changes 4x the speed motor makes the rearwheel spin. If you want to have a profile limit to 25 or something I would count the teeth at front and smallest rear cog and use that as motor pulley and wheel pulley. Then the tire diameter and rest play with magnet pairs to find correct one. Typically you must put quite a lot smaller tire value to match it with even number of magnet pairs

[2023-12-13T17:03:38] Jan: @PaoloWu
[2023-12-13T17:04:08] Windfire: But my problem is not real speed. My problem is that when i in the street the ebike max speed is only 16 km h . Which parameter check in vesc configuration ? I need more torque
[2023-12-13T17:05:43] Mirono escooters: Expensive, but so good
[2023-12-13T17:05:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He believes in recycling
[2023-12-13T17:06:01] Mirono escooters: But shipping motor with bottles is. special🤔🙈
[2023-12-13T17:07:05] Mirono escooters: bubble wrap is recyclable too..
[2023-12-13T17:08:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He should drink more water than it would have more layer😁
[2023-12-13T17:09:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably run out of the good boxes , thats the main thing, all stuff recieved from him was in super sturdy box what's ment for engine's
[2023-12-13T17:10:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I use to over wrap everything
[2023-12-13T17:11:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Even more expensive than you think coz that's pir foam not pur
[2023-12-13T17:11:08] Mirono escooters: Overwrapping doesn't exist If I'm shipping something expensive, I'm for sure adding alot of layers..
[2023-12-13T17:11:11] Mirono escooters: Even sometimes 2 boxes
[2023-12-13T17:11:23] Mirono escooters: Yes, but better then bottles 🙈😂😂😂
[2023-12-13T17:11:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So not the same thing you find in shops in cans , that's pur based
[2023-12-13T17:11:53] Tommy ª: at least he can fill the bottles with water and it gets more reliable
[2023-12-13T17:12:09] Mirono escooters: Yeah till it punctures 🤨
[2023-12-13T17:12:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Last thing i sent was a painted picture in frame
[2023-12-13T17:12:17] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't use them, ever
[2023-12-13T17:12:22] Mirono escooters: But Paolo does what he want xd
[2023-12-13T17:12:34] Tommy ª: the old tshirt, never fails
[2023-12-13T17:13:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That what i ment over ,i always do such
[2023-12-13T17:13:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Worst i saw was some ali shop
[2023-12-13T17:13:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kugoo m4 Engine
[2023-12-13T17:14:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The top and low side foam was in flawless

[2023-12-13T17:14:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So engine housing touching the box
[2023-12-13T17:14:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Crack 🤣
[2023-12-13T17:14:57] Mirono escooters: O o
[2023-12-13T17:15:01] Mirono escooters: Reuse old tires xd
[2023-12-13T17:15:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I can show you this ,i have the housing
[2023-12-13T17:17:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Should get magnets out , still in the box Than i would have nice kugoo ashtray
[2023-12-13T17:19:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Torque arm bike thingy mainly, For g30 i always make new braket what fits the body, also brake adapter is one thing with that and on bigger engines we 🤔 cnc the washer sit point on the inner side ,so its a washer also
[2023-12-13T17:21:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I Think he should redo motor wizard with "numbers" you mentioned Still think should be mini something or small
[2023-12-13T17:36:32] sombre_enfant: Omg first ride dash keep crashing...

[2023-12-13T18:29:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why?
[2023-12-13T18:40:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Can happen , or maybe it was marked something else to cheat on tax and they opened it🤷‍♂

[2023-12-13T18:56:55] Happy Giraffe: You need to show us all motor settings. The motor aint strong for sure but should still give more than the market bikes and maybe 30-40kmh. Did you try different gears on cassette?
[2023-12-13T18:59:36] Happy Giraffe: Might be some ERPM limit idk, you can do like 8 pole pairs if its IPM motor. Then wheelsize put for now 800mm
[2023-12-13T19:00:57] Happy Giraffe: Also record your vesc phone screen when riding so we see how much power its pulling and what are the duty/erpm etc numbers. For that size of a motor I would start at 20A battery and 80A phase current and see what happens.
[2023-12-13T19:39:06] Jhinzuo ~~: turkey corrupted af i got a good friend who goes there regularly to his familiy and they have presents for border controll always in trunk so they take that instead of searching whole vehicle 😀
[2023-12-13T20:11:36] haku: ive seen this before. i think its copper etching
[2023-12-13T20:11:57] haku: or something like that
[2023-12-13T20:13:40] haku: atleast you can bribe the police.
[2023-12-13T20:14:24] haku: imagine all the stuff you can get away with. 😂 lets be positive here lol
[2023-12-13T20:26:35] Windfire: Where in software i set phase current ?
[2023-12-13T20:27:10] Windfire: The wheelsize is important ?
[2023-12-13T20:29:25] Mirono escooters: Motor current xd
[2023-12-13T20:29:37] Mirono escooters: Yes, and your gear ratio
[2023-12-13T20:35:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>

[2023-12-13T20:41:17] haku: only way to fix this is clean up the gov from top to bottom. its hard
[2023-12-13T20:41:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure gov like exist 😅
[2023-12-13T20:42:04] haku: in the US the top 1% gets away with alot of crap.

[2023-12-13T20:52:15] Windfire: What value do you suggest for gear ratio ?
[2023-12-13T20:52:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You dont have bt module? That's the way how you can record what's happening

[2023-12-13T20:55:55] Windfire: Is it possible 38 front and 15 rear ?
[2023-12-13T20:55:59] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2023-12-13T20:55:59] haku: what do you guys think of this scooter?
[2023-12-13T20:56:07] Windfire: Is it the gear of the bike ?
[2023-12-13T20:56:38] Windfire: But rear is variable...🫤🫤🫤
[2023-12-13T20:57:10] Mirono escooters: Ah rip
[2023-12-13T20:57:16] Mirono escooters: Just guess it. Its only for speed
[2023-12-13T20:57:28] haku: thanks. i want something i can recomend to family at an affordable price. i guess g30 is bare minimum.
[2023-12-13T20:58:05] Mirono escooters: Solids from factory 🥰🥰🥰
[2023-12-13T20:58:10] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi
[2023-12-13T20:59:10] Jhinzuo ~~: xiaomi 1s/mi3 or xiaomi pro2 for a bigger battery or g30 i also like g30l but battery is smaller than normal g30
[2023-12-13T20:59:29] Jhinzuo ~~: thats all models i would recommend
[2023-12-13T20:59:29] haku: i cant find a vendor in the US maybe rebranded
[2023-12-13T20:59:40] Jhinzuo ~~: lemme see
[2023-12-13T21:00:18] Jhinzuo ~~: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Xiaomi-Mi-Electric-Scooter-PRO-2/114339525
[2023-12-13T21:00:55] Jhinzuo ~~: i would avoid any offbrand xiaomi they are super shitty, also non tuneable
[2023-12-13T21:01:36] haku: this on amazon but i rather them get a g30 for this price
[2023-12-13T21:02:00] haku: only model available unless imported
[2023-12-13T21:02:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont buy pro 4 or ultra
[2023-12-13T21:02:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Get g30 than or a g2
[2023-12-13T21:02:56] haku: ill tell them to wait for g30 to go on sale. ive seen it as low as 400
[2023-12-13T21:03:51] haku: these folks dont want to shell out $$ on scooters. 😭
[2023-12-13T21:04:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It will be for ? Woman? Kid? There is few things what can make difference ,like if one from above and there is like 3 floor no elevator,unsure 20 kg scoot good for them
[2023-12-13T21:04:51] Happy Giraffe: Best would be to use phone app, can instantly change settings on the road
[2023-12-13T21:04:54] haku: woman and a 16yr old girl
[2023-12-13T21:05:20] haku: mom and daughter. also my nephew
[2023-12-13T21:05:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,if they dont need to lift it too much than good
[2023-12-13T21:05:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also kinda safer than smallers
[2023-12-13T21:06:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean if they do frontal with smaller they win coz g30 is. A Tank like that
[2023-12-13T21:06:55] Happy Giraffe: Meanwhile I will be doing later 8mm stainless plates for monorim to our baguette friend😂
[2023-12-13T21:07:32] haku: g30 frame is crazy durable.
[2023-12-13T21:08:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What you mean plates ,not sure i get it
[2023-12-13T21:10:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mostly yes ,the only thing, i dont like is rear fork area as it leaves the part where you bolt fender If you take a look upside down You will get it
[2023-12-13T21:10:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In custom builds I replace the factory bracket to one what full fills that area
[2023-12-13T21:18:20] haku: how about this one? hover 1. looks like a xiaomi rebrand
[2023-12-13T21:27:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We would say clone
[2023-12-13T21:27:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Worst china crap you can find under different names
[2023-12-13T21:28:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Usa
[2023-12-13T21:28:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont buy any clone for them if there is no hate
[2023-12-13T21:29:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You get a good aovo pro clone what brings house down 🤣😅
[2023-12-13T21:29:12] haku: only 1 model in amazon or walmart
[2023-12-13T21:29:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🙈
[2023-12-13T21:30:11] Ion: can you show what you mean, I'm curious
[2023-12-13T21:30:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know two local story where it did make fire,one of them 3 story house ,but story ends with housefire
[2023-12-13T21:30:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Partly yes
[2023-12-13T21:32:06] haku: on my petg print the support looks like it failed should i stop it or keep going? how does this happen?
[2023-12-13T21:33:02] haku: filament is overture brand petg.
[2023-12-13T21:33:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: One off the reasons ,latest version scoot not in the workshop, other what is here partly different coz engine dropout different, What maked brake and inside washers fit
[2023-12-13T21:50:54] Luis Magalhaes: Any one has the vesctools apk for the 5.3 firmware?
[2023-12-13T21:56:09] sombre_enfant: Use latest app and pinned archive firmware
[2023-12-13T21:57:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I was searching where you asked lol
[2023-12-13T21:57:43] Luis Magalhaes: Its not for me, its for a friend and he has some problems with latest firmware 😅 he is using 5.3 but has the last vesctools
[2023-12-13T21:58:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2023-12-13T22:00:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2023-12-13T22:00:15] Ion: Ahh ok, yeah I know what you mean now. Thanks for the video 😅
[2023-12-13T22:02:28] Ion: Also fun on my G30 with new motor from factory, the cable is on the other side. So if I want a rear brake, I would need to drill new hole for cable...
[2023-12-13T22:02:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Was the easiet way to explain,just needed another frame to show difference
[2023-12-13T22:04:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Happens with different engine's also
[2023-12-13T22:04:38] Windfire: I have the android app. But the parameters than i chage with the android app is less than pc software
[2023-12-13T22:04:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bent yes sideways
[2023-12-13T22:05:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: From body to stem?
[2023-12-13T22:05:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Side jump probably but not fully sure
[2023-12-13T22:06:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But look around the frame mostly sturdy and thick,than rear fork thickness 3 mm with small bracket ,kinda joke in my metal working eyes
[2023-12-13T22:07:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also on the other what has blade motor
[2023-12-13T22:08:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Plastic covers front bolt changed to m8 size
[2023-12-13T22:09:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think you need some repeated impact to rip that to parts
[2023-12-13T22:09:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like
[2023-12-13T22:10:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would be scared from that part but mostly as stem joins if we would have a good suspension what me and Jan was talking about
[2023-12-13T22:10:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like pitbike or pocket bike has
[2023-12-13T22:10:38] Ion: Something I also wondered. It looks like it's wider at the rear than the front of the fork/ motor holder. By like only few mm, but I'd need to measure. 125mm axle should fit perfectly tho, right?
[2023-12-13T22:10:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lot of does can be from bad usage
[2023-12-13T22:10:57] Mirono escooters: Yes, front is smaller then back
[2023-12-13T22:11:27] cihan: Can I use a constant 42V, high current power supply to charge ninebot f2 pro? Will the BMS limit current properly? I need to charge faster.
[2023-12-13T22:12:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I use to jump a lot ,with that you super stress things ,all is about landing it good Lot bad ones surly ends in problems
[2023-12-13T22:12:24] cihan: Power supply is 8A
[2023-12-13T22:12:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Other side of this
[2023-12-13T22:12:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The dark side
[2023-12-13T22:12:48] cihan: And it's 10S4P battery to be charged.
[2023-12-13T22:13:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When ppl put useless reinforcements in a bad place and while that holds it brokes above or under
[2023-12-13T22:13:16] Ion: Mean this, but looks fine on picture
[2023-12-13T22:13:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 125 is blade
[2023-12-13T22:14:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The case i was talking about
[2023-12-13T22:15:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You mean it forced so red and yellow not same long
[2023-12-13T22:15:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: ?
[2023-12-13T22:16:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If yes that's the part when custom braket gets milled and than it sits in braket,what acts like inside washer and measurement would line up
[2023-12-13T22:16:03] Gabe Enzo: You stop immediately when this happens dude
[2023-12-13T22:16:29] Gabe Enzo: check if the base is screwed on right, it made My prints fail every single time.
[2023-12-13T22:16:43] Gabe Enzo: Ender 3 pro has a factory defect that's hard to fix, no normal human can do it. (in my printer)
[2023-12-13T22:16:59] Ion: Yes that is what I meant :) but it fits Soo... Probably ok
[2023-12-13T22:17:04] haku: i think i forgot to change settings like how thick the supports should be
[2023-12-13T22:17:14] Gabe Enzo: If the base is wobbly even a little bit then it needs work
[2023-12-13T22:17:17] Gabe Enzo: go check
[2023-12-13T22:17:24] Mirono escooters: Oh uh that's weird
[2023-12-13T22:17:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably it wont charge above 4 a
[2023-12-13T22:17:38] Ion: I think other people also used the same hub Motor without bracket made custom
[2023-12-13T22:17:54] Gabe Enzo: Uhm the power supply has to be for lithium ion
[2023-12-13T22:19:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dc some random powersupply or you can set anything? I charge lot stuff with dc powersupply coz fuck wants this much chargers to keep
[2023-12-13T22:21:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When you do brake if you do whole doesnt sit strait ,will be not an easy one,but as you like
[2023-12-13T22:21:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes some did
[2023-12-13T22:22:11] Ion: True, disk and caliper would not line up fully then
[2023-12-13T22:22:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And if something happens like motor gets loose coz zero inner stuff to hold,i will just laugh
[2023-12-13T22:22:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Never build anything whats powerfull and nothing holds it
[2023-12-13T22:23:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Inside washer thingy is not for nothing, mostly all big engine's use it ,not for trend
[2023-12-13T22:23:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What? Its the same thing
[2023-12-13T22:24:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also on both you need to save after settings done
[2023-12-13T22:25:12] Ion: Inside washer would be as thick as the custom bracket right? I think washer was 3mm on mine Vsett, with same motor
[2023-12-13T22:25:29] haku: should i stop even though iys just 1 branch of the tree support is messed up? everything looks fine
[2023-12-13T22:25:33] Ion: I don't know if I could fit inside washer with cable and bracket
[2023-12-13T22:25:52] Gabe Enzo: show closer
[2023-12-13T22:26:20] Gabe Enzo: Can't see
[2023-12-13T22:26:39] Gabe Enzo: usually with small things it corrects itself but you'll know with logic if it'll ruin everything else More you print and the more you fuck up the more you learn just please God don't sleep while it's printing or you can wake up with either A: your printer covered in plastic Or B: a fire
[2023-12-13T22:26:44] Ion: @AJAJ1992 how did you solve this with your G30 and 50H Vsett Motors? Am curious
[2023-12-13T22:28:38] haku: im a noob to printing. idk the rules yet
[2023-12-13T22:29:53] Gabe Enzo: If it keeps ruining it after each run, then it's obvious u must lower print speed. depends on the shape of the print how much it can print at. Say If PLA is for 150/ms and you're printing a tree, even 80/ms can be too fast if you want a quality print.
[2023-12-13T22:30:12] Gabe Enzo: AND make sure to always print the first 5 layers or so very slowly
[2023-12-13T22:30:21] Gabe Enzo: Helps it have a rigid base
[2023-12-13T22:30:34] haku: i did not change any speed settings. thanks for the heads up
[2023-12-13T22:30:36] Gabe Enzo: 40ms is what I do for first 5
[2023-12-13T22:30:47] Jan: What do you mean?
[2023-12-13T22:32:54] Jan: I modified the inner bracket to make the motor cable fit
[2023-12-13T22:33:07] Jan: I dont use 50H vsett anymore
[2023-12-13T22:43:35] Ion: Yeah ik, but you started out with that motor, that's what I meant.
[2023-12-13T22:47:02] Happy Giraffe: Monorim front side plates
[2023-12-13T22:47:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Forks
[2023-12-13T22:48:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You make it for g30
[2023-12-13T22:48:18] Happy Giraffe: Everything that you need is in Android app. It's bit confusing in the start but you get the hang of it with the drop down menus
[2023-12-13T22:48:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If yes, make the shock top holder also
[2023-12-13T22:49:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's the most weak in g30 monorim
[2023-12-13T22:49:25] Happy Giraffe: Damn, they messed up another component. Only they are able to achieve this😂
[2023-12-13T22:49:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically cheaped out
[2023-12-13T22:50:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On xiaomi its a solid ring
[2023-12-13T22:50:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On g30 it has several cut outs and small arms use to brake under big weight
[2023-12-13T22:50:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: User of mine around 130 kg
[2023-12-13T22:51:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I can measure the broken or send it so you could measure
[2023-12-13T22:53:28] Happy Giraffe: That's the job of our baguette friend😁 Yeah if its easily measureable or made into 3D model
[2023-12-13T23:01:08] haku: no way this half a dog made out of pla can carry 120 kilos
[2023-12-13T23:01:09] haku: <photos/photo_11544@13-12-2023_23-01-09.jpg>
[2023-12-13T23:01:19] haku: this thing is solid
[2023-12-13T23:03:30] haku: 160 kilos wtf
[2023-12-13T23:08:06] haku: i wonder of he can beat my deadlift
[2023-12-13T23:09:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It has a super shitty shape
[2023-12-13T23:10:37] haku: <video_file>
[2023-12-13T23:10:47] Jan: Yes and then went up in magnet size
[2023-12-13T23:12:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When it fails ,you need to repair the floor🤣
[2023-12-13T23:21:43] sombre_enfant: 11" and 70h when ?
[2023-12-13T23:34:03] Jan: haha never 11''
[2023-12-13T23:34:29] Jan: its already too fast for me
[2023-12-13T23:36:54] Jhinzuo ~~: @Mirono_escooters how much uf do u use for mos die issue on 75100
[2023-12-13T23:37:45] Mirono escooters: Poor g30
[2023-12-13T23:37:51] haku: is this the tool to cut presice copper pieces?
[2023-12-13T23:37:59] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-12-13T23:38:39] Mirono escooters: Look out, because some are weak and can't even cut that
[2023-12-13T23:38:48] Mirono escooters: But 0.1 copper, try find a lasercutter locally?
[2023-12-13T23:38:51] Mirono escooters: I just use sciccors
[2023-12-13T23:39:20] Mirono escooters: (ok sorry) 220uF minimum, if u add on drivers also
[2023-12-13T23:39:25] Mirono escooters: If not, 470uF or more
[2023-12-13T23:39:38] Mirono escooters: Still set undervoltage limits properly
[2023-12-13T23:39:46] haku: i want a tool that can cut up to .4 copper. like precise uniform cuts
[2023-12-13T23:39:52] Jhinzuo ~~: I laughed hard tbh 😂
[2023-12-13T23:40:11] Mirono escooters: A cnc isn't it for thin copper
[2023-12-13T23:40:15] Mirono escooters: Laser or water is
[2023-12-13T23:40:16] Jhinzuo ~~: Damn gonna be tight fit 👀
[2023-12-13T23:40:17] Mirono escooters: Or sciccors
[2023-12-13T23:40:20] haku: is there an affordable tool for that?
[2023-12-13T23:40:25] Mirono escooters: 🤷
[2023-12-13T23:40:41] Mirono escooters: Yeah that's why I do 220uF and then smol on drivers
[2023-12-13T23:40:46] Mirono escooters: I need make tutorial to show
[2023-12-13T23:40:50] Jhinzuo ~~: How smol
[2023-12-13T23:41:14] Mirono escooters: weewee smol 50uF
[2023-12-13T23:41:20] Jhinzuo ~~: I have 47uf laying around
[2023-12-13T23:41:33] Mirono escooters: Good
[2023-12-13T23:41:43] Mirono escooters: Btw use 16v caps They are crazy small
[2023-12-13T23:43:55] Jhinzuo ~~: Hmm have to harvest some don't have any 16v
[2023-12-13T23:47:46] Jan: I would like to attempt the 140kmh but the weather is permanently shit for 6months and there is no street really to do it here
[2023-12-13T23:48:18] Jan: For 10inch scooter it makes no sense to go even faster
[2023-12-13T23:49:14] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Shittiest Xiaomi clone ever
[2023-12-13T23:50:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not really
[2023-12-13T23:50:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Good stuff is able to cut only
[2023-12-13T23:50:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or buy it🤔
[2023-12-13T23:50:54] haku: are those tools and software pretty pricey?
[2023-12-13T23:51:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tools yes
[2023-12-13T23:51:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably co laser needed
[2023-12-13T23:53:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That starts like g30 price and you need knowledge to use and to not blind your self ,co laser has no color so only cam view can be done, and usually it big like 1,5m *1 and table tall
[2023-12-13T23:54:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or you pre think send layout to them
[2023-12-13T23:54:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNfsvtq
[2023-12-13T23:54:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: These fuckers make you the shape cutted what ever you want
[2023-12-13T23:55:35] haku: thats true ive seen those. but i want to directly spot weld copper with no nickel.
[2023-12-13T23:56:10] cihan: Lithium ion charging without a BMS only needs current limiting, otherwise lithium charger is just a current limited power supply. In fact I wonder if BMS will limit current and charge or if it will just trigger high current protection and stop charging.
[2023-12-13T23:56:17] haku: it will have a complex zig zag shape
[2023-12-13T23:56:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than you buy sheet and cut with metal sciccors
[2023-12-13T23:59:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did you ever charge with dc powersupply? You set all and it will do that ,that simple No bms packs not too good idea Not even sure where that came up
[2023-12-13T23:59:27] cihan: I can't set current with this power supply. So I'm expecting BMS to limit current but I have no idea if it will. Many cables for xiaomi scooters are sold for 2A,3A or 4A charging. So I guess Xiaomi scooters support maximum of 4A charging. However Segway sells 5A charger but I'm not sure which models are comparable with it. This 5A Segway charger has 8mm barrel connector same as the one on f2 pro. Anyway, I bought some cables with barrel connector. I'll test with power supply and wrote the result here.
[2023-12-14T00:00:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 5a charger is for g30
[2023-12-14T00:00:25] cihan: I didn't since I don't have that ninebot proprietary 8mm connector but I bought some and will try.
[2023-12-14T00:01:04] cihan: Probably, it has bigger battery 5P instead of 4P on f2 pro
[2023-12-14T00:01:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Soon as you send 8 a ,bms will cut charging
[2023-12-14T00:01:57] cihan: By the way did anyone try west biking or rockbros balaclava without helmet?
[2023-12-14T00:02:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bit more than 4 can be done but even cells get hot,small pack
[2023-12-14T00:02:29] cihan: 8A is a lot but I could expect 5A work since it's 12.8Ah battery
[2023-12-14T00:02:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Didn't but i have lot from does
[2023-12-14T00:03:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you dont want to wear just that buy the ones made for skiing
[2023-12-14T00:03:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Same brand
[2023-12-14T00:03:39] cihan: You mean ski balaclava from Rockbros?
[2023-12-14T00:04:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is like the third time atleast i told you it will not accept more , I didn't say because its fun Coz it was tested
[2023-12-14T00:04:27] cihan: I need something to keep me warm at 32 km/h at - 15.
[2023-12-14T00:05:35] cihan: Thank you, so I'll try 4. Many chargers are 2A,3A or 5A. I was thinking buying a Liitokala 5A charger so I'll skip it.
[2023-12-14T00:07:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_11547@14-12-2023_00-07-28.jpg>
[2023-12-14T00:07:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: These ones ,rockbross less thick
[2023-12-14T00:08:36] cihan: Is the brand name "phmax"?
[2023-12-14T00:09:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Better, Lot ppl here uses yzpower charger ,wate or orhija
[2023-12-14T00:09:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes but you find lot similar ones , get whats best for you
[2023-12-14T00:09:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: From the ones on pics two atleast has ffp mask inside also
[2023-12-14T00:10:32] cihan: Ohrija had good reviews, good reputation and has current limiting and voltage adjusting potentiometer too so seems better.
[2023-12-14T00:10:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some even has screen
[2023-12-14T00:11:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Does have like 4 potmeter inside so you can fine tune them
[2023-12-14T00:12:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But this also needs good multimeter ,mostly chargers not really set good ,so i measuring all before i plug into any scooter
[2023-12-14T00:12:30] cihan: They seem quality. Rockbros models seemed thinner you're right. Now it's about zero at nights and I already started feeling my nape cold even with hat and hood. Balaclava seems like a must for winter.
[2023-12-14T00:13:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Last time i saw a charger,i thought it will be nice ,i was suprised on big size of it , Than i measure and half V off
[2023-12-14T00:13:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And it was more not less😅
[2023-12-14T00:14:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you hate helmets?
[2023-12-14T00:14:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Helmet takes much more
[2023-12-14T00:14:18] cihan: I've got a multimeter. I just wanted to buy something cheap since I wouldn't adjust it if 5A was supported. I can use the DC power supply but I cannot carry it and it causes too many cables around. I need to feed another DC power supply to it.
[2023-12-14T00:14:40] cihan: Dangerous.)
[2023-12-14T00:15:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Multimeter and multimeter is the other thing
[2023-12-14T00:15:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have 5 and two is something i would call good
[2023-12-14T00:15:57] cihan: Mmm, in fact I could use, I've never used one. I want to buy something good and protective if I buy one but I cannot leave it on scooter even if I lock it. I'm sure it'll be stolen so I don't buy.
[2023-12-14T00:16:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But more chepo it is the more you can be sure it's not fully showing good
[2023-12-14T00:16:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Take it with you maybe?
[2023-12-14T00:17:08] cihan: In fact even cheap ones measure well, not more than 10mV error in general.
[2023-12-14T00:18:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on what you measure and if you only have cheap one ,how do you know how off it is
[2023-12-14T00:18:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤷‍♂
[2023-12-14T00:19:02] cihan: It will be cumbersome, especially when I go shopping and will have a helmet on my arm when carrying something. I made a little search before and cheapest helmet which can protect starts from 120 USD and I'm sure it'll be stolen in first 6 months if I leave it on scooter when shopping.
[2023-12-14T00:19:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I use to measure and set my own ones to an expensive whats like 280 euro multimeter
[2023-12-14T00:19:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well
[2023-12-14T00:19:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just to go near your idea
[2023-12-14T00:19:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe
[2023-12-14T00:21:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: One falls and spends much more than 120$ on dentist,not something I didn't see But i wear helmet coz i dont trust idiots on the road Anytime i scoot i have to watch out for the ppl who broke road laws and try to kill me
[2023-12-14T00:22:09] cihan: I just see from reviews compared to known brand ones. The ones I have also show similar results but can never be sure.
[2023-12-14T00:22:50] cihan: You're right, I already experienced it with bicycle.)
[2023-12-14T00:23:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Btw my helmet is a fox v1 dirt was more than 290$ when it was new
[2023-12-14T00:23:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if anybody ask ,i tell the other fact
[2023-12-14T00:24:22] cihan: Good helmet is always worth it if it won't be stolen soon.)
[2023-12-14T00:24:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I wear a helmet coz i am handsome and ladies need my face 😎
[2023-12-14T00:25:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Shop with cart and there you have the space for the helmet
[2023-12-14T00:26:57] cihan: Putting helmet on and wearing it off also makes shopping harder. Helmet is certainly necessary but too much cumbersome, I need to leave it on scooter to feel comfortable and unfortunately I can't.
[2023-12-14T00:28:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on shop and scooter also ,but a something small like a pro fits lidls bigger carts beer compartment holder when folded
[2023-12-14T00:29:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you wish
[2023-12-14T00:30:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I go to places with scooter where i can enter and go other way if i cant,i dont leave my scoots on the Street and such
[2023-12-14T00:33:01] cihan: I mostly use scooter to buy from very small markets, bakery so I'll need to visit 3-4 small shops and I cannot enter with scooter when they're crowded. And I'm sure that feeling of living among thieves, robbers will make me sad more compared to having something I own stolen if I ever experience it. So I try to avoid such a risk of having something stolen.)
[2023-12-14T00:33:55] cihan: There are many times a few steps when entering a shop so I'll also have to lift up the scooter if I want to enter with scooter.
[2023-12-14T00:34:24] Tommy ª: how you turn with that wire? 😭
[2023-12-14T00:35:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But there are some nice places ,like my local small shop lets me park inside and there is bike holder Outside, however they let me in and whole area is fam houses and cherry tree everywhere,so not really something where you get robbed ,but probably also helps that i dont look too friendly irl😅 Less nice is local big post office, Folds scooter One hand scooter on the same hand you wear helmet and other hand opens door and mostly i go first floor on stairs 🤷‍♂
[2023-12-14T00:35:21] cihan: Maybe wire has some length to move inside the tube. I don't think they didn't think that.)
[2023-12-14T00:36:30] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I sure it's just render picture
[2023-12-14T00:37:05] cihan: That's what I mean. I would probably keep the helmet on and just slide up the front screen.
[2023-12-14T00:37:05] Tommy ª: in some time i got a xiaomi clone with glue in that zone no the typical white foam like xiaomis, literally glue 😭
[2023-12-14T00:37:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: My local small has few stairs also , not the best but still ok
[2023-12-14T00:37:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,i respect post ppl so i take it off
[2023-12-14T00:38:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i am two meter tall and not too friendly look ,use to scare ppl in helmet 😅 Some finds full face dirt style type basically agressive look alike for the helmet
[2023-12-14T00:39:39] cihan: In fact I don't consider it being rude if a rider roams with helmet on. I can understand them well. Meal delivery guys mostly keep helmet on in winters, if they also wear balaclava inside helmet, they'll look even more strange with balaclava and without helmet.)
[2023-12-14T00:39:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But its white so kinda stormtrooper alike
[2023-12-14T00:42:00] cihan: It's still fine for me but I don't know if other people will feel uncomfortable. It's not worse than wearing eyeglasses indoors when talking to someone. Many do that.
[2023-12-14T00:42:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also whole depends on what scooter you are with ,i dont want climb to first floor with my oxo in my hand 🤣 So better to have more than one
[2023-12-14T00:43:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You mean sunglasses?
[2023-12-14T00:44:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If i am not in a helmet ,you can be sure i am that coz i have too blue eyes and see nothing when everything is shiny
[2023-12-14T00:44:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And even inside lights hurt my eyes
[2023-12-14T00:44:48] cihan: Sorry, yes sunglasses
[2023-12-14T00:45:56] cihan: Does light indoors make you feel uncomfortable without sunglasses?
[2023-12-14T00:46:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: try find some mask for your self ,but consider helmet also What scooter frame you use?
[2023-12-14T00:47:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not all of them,but lot yes Than i squints
[2023-12-14T00:48:06] cihan: It's a f2 pro with no modification, just same scooter from factory. I'm not into VESC yet. I'll try to install 75200 on Navee n65.
[2023-12-14T00:48:35] cihan: Ahh OK. It's understandable.
[2023-12-14T00:51:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Outside always ,inside where its needed , home has lights what hurt less, and bedroom lights kinda not enough usually for other ppl ,if i dont need to find something, I would call it dark😅 And yes in a way, i see in the dark Not complete all but mostly bit more than others
[2023-12-14T00:51:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I remember now
[2023-12-14T00:53:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: N65 was familiar, we have two moded s65 now and Another 3 but does c models for January
[2023-12-14T00:55:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It auto adjust cable lenght 🤣
[2023-12-14T00:55:16] Tommy ª: *pulls the entire controller*
[2023-12-14T00:55:43] cihan: You can try to decrease blue light at home, your eyes probably will feel more comfortable even when you're looking at same illuminance.
[2023-12-14T00:55:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wire always has some extra ,but nowdays even xiaomi likes to make it shitty ways
[2023-12-14T00:56:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like foam the shit out in the frame, without cable s inside the hole area
[2023-12-14T00:56:53] cihan: Does s65 have same deck space and battery as n65? I wonder how many cells I can fit inside n65 when I'll have a custom battery.
[2023-12-14T00:57:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bigger
[2023-12-14T00:57:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also you can do spacer on that
[2023-12-14T00:57:43] Tommy ª: casually my og m365 dont come with foam also the essential and 1s feels lighter and it comes with fuzzy foam
[2023-12-14T00:58:26] cihan: Do you increase deck height?
[2023-12-14T00:58:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 2 x vesc and and 100 cells should fit easy with adc2 also
[2023-12-14T00:59:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes so 21700 fits
[2023-12-14T01:00:46] cihan: I won't add another motor soon. But I'll be happy if I can somehow fit 120 cells, ADC and a JK BMS. I bought a 150A JK BMS to use in future and maybe somewhere else than scooter too and it's not small.
[2023-12-14T01:00:58] cihan: I mean 120 18650.
[2023-12-14T01:01:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What cells?
[2023-12-14T01:01:50] haku: how do you guys tell if its a clone or a rebrand?
[2023-12-14T01:02:35] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: rebranded doesn't exists
[2023-12-14T01:03:34] haku: ive noticed that inside the g30 neck. there is foam. i thougt original owner did it
[2023-12-14T01:04:53] Tommy ª: just try to connect with any xiaomi related app xiaomi home, downg, scooterhacking, xiaodash also the og ones dont most of times comes with tubeless wheels xiaomi comes with CST tires and the weight says all ah, there is only black and white xiaomis the m365, pro 2, 1s, essential are not longer in production, if you see a "new m365" is a scam
[2023-12-14T01:04:58] haku: <photos/photo_11549@14-12-2023_01-04-58.jpg>
[2023-12-14T01:05:12] Tommy ª: ah yes, ninebot foam
[2023-12-14T01:05:52] haku: is that for the cables not to rattle around?
[2023-12-14T01:05:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What did you imagine, 150 bms Sounds overkill,i am unsure what you had in mind
[2023-12-14T01:06:09] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: mudguard with 4 bolts(orig xiaomi is 3) folding mechanism like g30 but not gap between fork and frame hole in fork plastic...wtf? how tf caliper mounted?(bicycle postmount adapter, huh) frame welding 🤮
[2023-12-14T01:06:27] Tommy ª: yea and a nightmare for pulling them out
[2023-12-14T01:06:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Factory
[2023-12-14T01:07:21] cihan: They'll be probably Aspilsan, a local battery manufacturer.
[2023-12-14T01:07:30] Tommy ª: actually these are the most generic type of brakes, just universal brakes i put one of these in my old scooty with drum brake and works well, also in a xiaomi is imposible 💀
[2023-12-14T01:07:48] cihan: I checked the size when buying but it still felt bigger when I received it, probably because of thick cables.
[2023-12-14T01:08:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Partly yes but there is foam ring what you miss , but when you fill all cables u need nothing can move there
[2023-12-14T01:08:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Easy
[2023-12-14T01:09:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: First usually u read xiaomi and ching bao yao
[2023-12-14T01:10:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But this is so so far from xiaomi
[2023-12-14T01:10:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As guys pointed out
[2023-12-14T01:10:56] haku: ive never seen an authentic xiaomi here. just lots of clones i guess
[2023-12-14T01:11:36] Tommy ª: same here, about 70% of scooters are clones or another brands (no xiaomi based)
[2023-12-14T01:11:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 1s pro2 Essential has a orange color mi sign above neck
[2023-12-14T01:11:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Should exist
[2023-12-14T01:12:11] Tommy ª: if you dont see this, run
[2023-12-14T01:12:13] haku: maybe but very rare
[2023-12-14T01:12:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think i saw too turnt tony getting a bj on one🤣🤣🤣
[2023-12-14T01:12:34] haku: lol
[2023-12-14T01:13:31] haku: what do you guys think of the brand niu. lots of those. you can buy it on bestbuy
[2023-12-14T01:14:00] Tommy ª: what is bestbuy? i hear a lot of that in youtube 😭

[2023-12-14T01:18:14] haku: it looks like the segway p100

[2023-12-14T01:22:14] haku: that one photo is different segway
[2023-12-14T01:22:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's why i said for kids

[2023-12-14T01:24:05] haku: so many different segways. but ninebot built like a tank
[2023-12-14T01:24:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Only g30
[2023-12-14T01:24:51] haku: yes g30 is what i meant
[2023-12-14T01:25:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like there is ninebot es2 and such and that's super crappy
[2023-12-14T01:25:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dhgate ships to you?
[2023-12-14T01:26:11] haku: maybe. im not sure
[2023-12-14T01:26:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Check we use to order stuff from there
[2023-12-14T01:26:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe gives nice offer for you for g30, g2 or xiaomi
[2023-12-14T01:27:15] haku: thanks
[2023-12-14T01:29:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean what cells will know ? How much S?
[2023-12-14T04:50:57] haku: what is an aspilsan?
[2023-12-14T04:55:14] haku: very nice. is this china cells?
[2023-12-14T05:07:14] cihan: What does S stand for? They are 2800mAh if I'm not mistaken and can do 5C discharge.
[2023-12-14T05:08:01] cihan: As far as I know they're made in Turkey as they claim but I cannot be sure.
[2023-12-14T05:08:30] haku: series. depending on how many S will determine your voltage
[2023-12-14T05:09:00] cihan: Ahh, OK, sorry.
[2023-12-14T05:09:18] haku: very nice. how many battery brands does turkey produce?
[2023-12-14T05:10:36] cihan: The brand Aspilsan was established to manufacture cells in Turkey and stop dependency to foreign manufacturers for cells, so they shouldn't import from China but everything is possible in Turkey lately.)
[2023-12-14T05:10:46] cihan: Only one probably
[2023-12-14T05:11:14] cihan: I mean for lithium, there are many brands for lead acid
[2023-12-14T05:11:22] haku: thats awsome i wish we had local cells for retail.
[2023-12-14T05:13:03] cihan: Aspilsan also didn't have until late years, brand was established only for military purposes as it's told. Where are you from by the way?
[2023-12-14T05:13:47] haku: US. no local cells for retail.
[2023-12-14T05:14:00] haku: tesla cells only for thier cars
[2023-12-14T05:14:43] cihan: 20S6P if I can fit. 80 cells minimum, at least 16S. I'm flexible about series and parallel according to the space I'll have.
[2023-12-14T05:16:08] cihan: I think manufacturing rechargeable cells doesn't produce good value and doesn't make good profit, that's why no one was interested probably.
[2023-12-14T05:17:49] haku: i dont know. if we had local made cells there will be a market for it
[2023-12-14T05:20:28] haku: if tesla sold thier new 4860 cells alot will buy it just because of the brand
[2023-12-14T05:51:32] cihan: Yes, Tesla could cell easily. But it would cost same as a Japanese cell or a little more expensive.
[2023-12-14T05:55:14] haku: im sure.
[2023-12-14T05:56:12] haku: folks will still buy it. look at rion made in the US and people flock and buy it overpriced. there is a market for western made.
[2023-12-14T05:56:42] haku: even the new honda scooter. i know i want one lol
[2023-12-14T06:02:48] haku: bro i like wierd stuff lol. thats how trends are started 😂
[2023-12-14T06:04:31] haku: watch this honda scooter will be a trend in the US. so many honda fans here
[2023-12-14T06:06:40] Tommy ª: facts: the motocompacto is just another scooter also nobody talk about the mercedez m365, just stickers
[2023-12-14T06:06:46] haku: thats true. anything with a brand folks will buy.
[2023-12-14T06:07:32] haku: mercedes isnt a new concept its just rebadged yea?
[2023-12-14T06:08:08] Tommy ª: actually there is people in the world thinking that IS a mercedez scooter 😭
[2023-12-14T06:08:45] haku: the mercedes scooter i think
[2023-12-14T06:09:04] Tommy ª: a pro2
[2023-12-14T06:09:52] Tommy ª: i want the cyan charger cover 😭
[2023-12-14T06:09:54] haku: the new honda is a complete different concept.
[2023-12-14T06:10:06] haku: very weird looking
[2023-12-14T06:10:28] haku: it will be a collector item
[2023-12-14T06:11:17] Tommy ª: casually i can put some good battery in that box-shapped thing and some vescs and you know
[2023-12-14T06:11:40] haku: 😂
[2023-12-14T06:12:31] haku: i really wonder what parts they are using and what the build quality is like
[2023-12-14T06:13:32] haku: if its crap. its a lawsuit waiting to happen. imagine honda scootee fire. oh my
[2023-12-14T06:14:22] haku: is that really a generic alibaba frame with a honda logo?
[2023-12-14T06:14:42] haku: oh dear. i did not know that
[2023-12-14T06:14:50] Tommy ª: imagine that thing getting fire in the rear of your car in middle of the highway or your garage while sleeping
[2023-12-14T06:15:58] haku: folks that will mostly buy these scooters a folks that already drive evs. if that catches fire inside of one goodluck putting that out
[2023-12-14T06:16:55] haku: is that rebranded too?
[2023-12-14T06:17:01] Tommy ª: hm
[2023-12-14T06:17:45] Tommy ª: what they have tiers 😭
[2023-12-14T06:17:46] haku: dear lord. im just finding out abouy these supercar scooters
[2023-12-14T06:18:25] haku: buggati 10 max sounds hilarious
[2023-12-14T06:19:04] Tommy ª: yea i can make something better with that money
[2023-12-14T06:19:15] Tommy ª: (dont watch the tabs)
[2023-12-14T06:19:40] haku: jeez thats pricey
[2023-12-14T06:20:03] haku: it looks like a emove cruiser
[2023-12-14T06:20:23] haku: i think thats original concept yea?
[2023-12-14T06:21:42] haku: these models you guys posted is not available in the US i think. need to import. the honda one you can buy in dealerships
[2023-12-14T06:22:16] haku: my kin very innocent about scooter brands
[2023-12-14T06:23:55] Tommy ª: just 800€, worth it?
[2023-12-14T06:26:44] Tommy ª: they slapped a logo projector in the rear, they can overprice it only for that (?)
[2023-12-14T06:27:28] Tommy ª: time to eep!
[2023-12-14T06:29:38] Tommy ª: try to use that in this type of street
[2023-12-14T06:39:25] Tommy ª: <photos/photo_11566@14-12-2023_06-39-25.jpg>
[2023-12-14T06:39:26] Tommy ª: True rebranding😭
[2023-12-14T08:10:06] Happy Giraffe: What's the precision level you need?
[2023-12-14T08:11:42] haku: i would like a tool that can cut presice copper sheets maybe up to .5 thick. like random shapes. what is the tool for that?
[2023-12-14T08:12:51] Happy Giraffe: How about the tiny handsaw whats the name of it in english.
[2023-12-14T08:13:05] haku: lol. good idea
[2023-12-14T08:13:40] haku: i want it uniform everytime. someday i want to get into battery building in the US
[2023-12-14T08:14:27] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_11567@14-12-2023_08-14-27.jpg>
[2023-12-14T08:14:51] Happy Giraffe: Ask what other people use
[2023-12-14T08:15:04] haku: no machines eh?
[2023-12-14T08:15:25] haku: im sure there is but too pricey
[2023-12-14T08:16:28] haku: scissors is cool but when thicker copper it will be difficult.
[2023-12-14T08:17:49] haku: the dream is to print holders lime these and presice copper sheets

[2023-12-14T10:35:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure still what that means, sounds super shitty 😁 5 capacities killing me
[2023-12-14T10:38:11] Happy Giraffe: Propably
[2023-12-14T10:40:09] Gabe Enzo: 200c 5AH lipo can discharge at 1000a 200x5 = 1kA
[2023-12-14T10:40:37] Gabe Enzo: 100c 3ah lipo can discharge at 300a 100x3
[2023-12-14T10:46:21] Mirono escooters: 99% of new errors with script comes from your scoot xD
[2023-12-14T10:46:27] Mirono escooters: So weird. Maybe start all over🤔
[2023-12-14T11:19:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure even that's an error
[2023-12-14T11:20:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you turn off scooter Percentage counts back and for last thing you see red 2
[2023-12-14T11:21:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lipo discharge current a different thing
[2023-12-14T11:25:29] cihan: 5 times current of the rated capacity.
[2023-12-14T11:25:51] Mirono escooters: Ionno at this point
[2023-12-14T11:26:36] cihan: 15A discharge current for a 3000 mAh cell.
[2023-12-14T11:29:25] sombre_enfant: Yeah i mustve it too low voltage
[2023-12-14T11:29:57] Happy Giraffe: Alu TiG is tough on thin plates and I only tried it once before, so I have the courage to call this a success😂
[2023-12-14T11:38:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not a joke 😅🙈
[2023-12-14T11:43:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2023-12-14T12:19:38] sombre_enfant: Had that but for some second
[2023-12-14T12:23:10] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): Maybe your BMS cut off?
[2023-12-14T12:59:41] Happy Giraffe: I had that feeling once when I took random gloves filled with alu dust😂 Lasted 3 days lol
[2023-12-14T12:59:46] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_11573@14-12-2023_12-59-46.jpg>
[2023-12-14T13:00:13] Happy Giraffe: Sand blasted, will print end caps and mount to water bottle holes. It has 4 m4 slots
[2023-12-14T13:08:04] Mirono escooters: Charger box?
[2023-12-14T13:08:30] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-12-14T13:09:43] Gabe Enzo: Nope.
[2023-12-14T13:09:55] Gabe Enzo: correct
[2023-12-14T13:10:10] Gabe Enzo: Racism against batteries is a hard topic for some
[2023-12-14T13:10:30] Mirono escooters: C is generally used with every battery
[2023-12-14T13:13:49] Happy Giraffe: Yup, will 3D mount to bottle holes
[2023-12-14T13:17:30] Happy Giraffe: Omg those welds🙊
[2023-12-14T13:23:49] haku: 5yr old chinese kid are very talented kids

[2023-12-14T14:38:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am just having fun on that you have the eye now
[2023-12-14T14:39:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Whole works differently,i still say
[2023-12-14T14:40:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's about this dust never comes out from you and lot makes dementia at old age
[2023-12-14T14:40:55] Mirono escooters: Bro tf, C rate is C rate. Electron is right for once.
[2023-12-14T14:41:01] Mirono escooters: LifePo4, li ion, lipo, lead acid, all use it
[2023-12-14T14:48:42] Happy Giraffe: 5Ah cell , 3C (c=capacity) discharge = 15A😁 just like the new EVE 21700 5.8Ah cell rated 3C continuous
[2023-12-14T14:48:59] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_11574@14-12-2023_14-48-59.jpg>
[2023-12-14T14:49:01] Mirono escooters: Yes, as Electron said Idk what his point is with lipo now
[2023-12-14T14:49:14] Mirono escooters: C rate was correct Obviously lipo is different technology lol, but C is C
[2023-12-14T14:49:42] Gabe Enzo: easy to calculate example
[2023-12-14T14:49:58] Happy Giraffe: C is C, except when it means coulombs instead of capacity😁
[2023-12-14T14:50:04] Mirono escooters: 😁
[2023-12-14T14:50:14] puneDir: electron improves
[2023-12-14T14:50:20] Gabe Enzo: This physics lab dawg

[2023-12-14T14:51:15] Happy Giraffe: My fav is the amp, ohm and voltage pic with the anime girls
[2023-12-14T14:51:25] Gabe Enzo: punedir changing his pfp more than me
[2023-12-14T14:51:43] Mirono escooters: I'm OG

[2023-12-14T20:18:26] haku: thanks. ill check it out
[2023-12-14T20:41:21] haku: this is ancient tech. but if you have the "eye" it will work fine. ive seen folks take crazy photos with vintage polaroids and film leicas
[2023-12-14T20:41:59] puneDir: its nice actually
[2023-12-14T20:46:16] haku: thats good your using it. if you were in the US id give you some gear.
[2023-12-14T20:50:59] haku: i use some vintage lenses on my camera. i just use an adapter
[2023-12-14T20:51:23] haku: these lenses from the 70s and 80s still work perfectly fine
[2023-12-14T21:10:58] Paolo ⁭: I'm also with old tech
[2023-12-14T21:11:14] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_11579@14-12-2023_21-11-14.jpg>
[2023-12-14T21:21:06] haku: same but mirrorless is pretty modern
[2023-12-14T21:21:24] haku: the af is huge leap
[2023-12-14T21:22:28] Paolo ⁭: It's very old compared to modern machine, af sucks
[2023-12-14T21:22:51] Paolo ⁭: Probably lens worth more than the machine xd
[2023-12-14T21:22:54] haku: nah. a7ii is still good
[2023-12-14T21:23:19] haku: is that lens 85 f1.8?
[2023-12-14T21:46:50] haku: the batteries in eu does it have to be UL certified?
[2023-12-14T21:49:09] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2023-12-14T21:50:09] haku: very good lens. better than the 85 Gmaster version imo
[2023-12-15T00:09:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would send you ,but not my pics @XAP2P sent it earlier
[2023-12-15T00:10:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: what is that ?
[2023-12-15T00:11:42] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Just clamp for xiaomi

[2023-12-15T00:12:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 👀🫣🤭🤭
[2023-12-15T00:12:39] haku: its like battery certification. for safe handling. the US is trying to do that now
[2023-12-15T00:14:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure if something like this exist but sounds bullshit in a way

[2023-12-15T00:24:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically it doesnt matter
[2023-12-15T00:25:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You guys talk about in some third world markings 🤣🤣🤣
[2023-12-15T00:28:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fyi heat capacity is C Capacity can be C also
[2023-12-15T00:29:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And that's called load 🤷‍♂
[2023-12-15T00:29:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is ton of C like this 🤷‍♂
[2023-12-15T00:31:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like any of the C band knows what it means when Pamela Anderson offers you half C?
[2023-12-15T00:31:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @Bradhaku as i see you know it basically 🤣🤣🤣
[2023-12-15T00:33:54] haku: pamela brings me back lol

[2023-12-15T00:37:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Question is why, and why pics like these😅
[2023-12-15T00:39:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Even surroundings look old 👌
[2023-12-15T00:42:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For sure , i have cameraman in the fam she has few also ,near filters . Was doing shipwrecks for ngc
[2023-12-15T00:43:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean who is safe handling or ???
[2023-12-15T00:43:16] @Súperpatin: I have a 19s 6p battery with almost 59A amps and I want to make a scooter to gain more speed, but without burning the motor or the scooter control. vesc
[2023-12-15T00:44:50] @Súperpatin: it has only one engine
[2023-12-15T00:52:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also I do get it, 1c that a 10 ah full charged batt Has to be able to provide 10A for an hour, But this is kinda bullshit Near oue usage Also if Rs 🤔 Also if batt bit tired this will change so kinda pointless to say such

[2023-12-15T01:13:41] Happy Giraffe: Lol, but it is used for max current rating as capacity multiplied by the multiplier value and you have to just deal with it😂
[2023-12-15T01:13:45] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-12-15T01:20:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nah ,i just dont give a shit😎
[2023-12-15T01:47:05] haku: what esc is that? very small like vesc
[2023-12-15T01:50:39] haku: its tiny might be a vesc.
[2023-12-15T01:53:11] Кто? Я: Controller S1-ES9
[2023-12-15T02:03:58] haku: have you guys tried crimping these connectors? what crimper did you guys use?
[2023-12-15T02:04:33] haku: these are the connectors for the alu spintend. looks very small
[2023-12-15T02:25:00] Happy Giraffe: You have a strong willed and hard skull, both in good and bad ways😂 Even when you are more in a stubborn mood I still like you😄
[2023-12-15T02:26:42] Happy Giraffe: Now for the first time I might have a flat print bed. Stock heat insulation is too close to Y axis motor if you remove the extra thick magnetic plate😅 Now cut and peeled off the space foil tape and lets lets see😅
[2023-12-15T02:28:20] Happy Giraffe: Stock ender firmware so shit it won't even show you the flatness map it creates from probing data
[2023-12-15T02:28:52] haku: i already went thru almost 1kg spool of filament. my printer never stays un used
[2023-12-15T02:29:26] haku: printing and experimenting on prints
[2023-12-15T02:31:27] haku: ive noticed my petg brand is pretty brittle
[2023-12-15T02:38:14] Кто? Я: help me find an application for the controller S1-ES9
[2023-12-15T02:43:07] haku: <photos/photo_11587@15-12-2023_02-43-07.jpg>
[2023-12-15T03:15:59] Happy Giraffe: Show petg settings temp speed and cooling
[2023-12-15T03:20:21] haku: with petg can you rush the cooling like use a fan on it? or just leave it in the build plate to cool slowly?
[2023-12-15T03:21:16] haku: also with printing carbon filament do i need a specialized nozzle?
[2023-12-15T03:23:18] Happy Giraffe: Shouldnt matter after print is done but it really pops out in 2 minutes if you open printer door
[2023-12-15T03:23:28] Happy Giraffe: Hardened steel one, I bought a cheapo one 4$ each and now trying first big PETG CF print on it😁
[2023-12-15T03:24:02] Кто? Я: I think no
[2023-12-15T03:24:09] Кто? Я: I think no
[2023-12-15T03:28:07] haku: what size nozzle? is it ome size fits all?
[2023-12-15T03:28:30] Happy Giraffe: Nope, minimum 0.6mm for carbon fiber Thats good for speed and still has good quality
[2023-12-15T03:28:50] haku: gotcha. thank you
[2023-12-15T03:29:49] haku: cf petg would be ideal for deck spacers yea? but for battery holders just plain petg?
[2023-12-15T03:36:28] Happy Giraffe: Yeah if you have heated chamber then might be nice to try more exotic materials later
[2023-12-15T03:37:01] Happy Giraffe: Its cheapest CF material😁 Thats why I use it and supposedly should be very strong
[2023-12-15T03:41:47] haku: i will get some spools when i find it on sale😂
[2023-12-15T03:42:06] haku: also a filament drier
[2023-12-15T03:43:17] haku: i noticed even pla is pretty strong but wont last in las vegas heat
[2023-12-15T05:34:51] haku: is it okay to store filament like this on the open?
[2023-12-15T05:47:40] haku: or do i need an vacum storage?
[2023-12-15T05:47:40] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!

[2023-12-15T09:08:23] Happy Giraffe: Nylon and PETG only ones. Also TPU I think🤔 I just use for everything
[2023-12-15T09:20:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True , looks similar to another e600 what has some shitty app, yt or tik tok helps but Unsure if same 🤷‍♂
[2023-12-15T09:23:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I find it fun that there is this chinesium category in our head where lot shit exist ,but we cant say we dont use lot other Chinese stuff what's good, should invent another word🤔
[2023-12-15T09:26:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

[2023-12-15T09:57:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Try look in vesc archive chat you find crimped ones ,all you do is solder ,from crimping tools ,there is few and cant tell you righ size , I have much more tiny ones and up bigger what you show , hate them all Back in the day we made external and hidden lights and other stuff for undercover policecars ,but my mate has the pliers ,i even hate look at it 😅
[2023-12-15T09:59:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ok ,hope it solves prob for a while
[2023-12-15T10:00:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also that later on you find what makes the prob

[2023-12-15T10:53:17] Tommy ª: what happend with the temps? that is necesary? 💀
[2023-12-15T10:53:29] Izuna 生活: my temp sensor broke
[2023-12-15T10:54:05] Tommy ª: ah, makes sense
[2023-12-15T13:39:17] Gabe Enzo: If my 300w motor is clogging up, does that mean it's fully saturated?
[2023-12-15T13:39:59] Gabe Enzo: It's definitely not burning and cells are full. I'm about to ride it right now. 90a phase and 72v clogs it up, which is weird, I'd assume it would just blow up already. When I let it cool it can drive again
[2023-12-15T13:53:26] Mirono escooters: Or a bad tune Problably saturating and observer losing track
[2023-12-15T13:53:36] Mirono escooters: That's too much..
[2023-12-15T14:00:06] Gabe Enzo: i have no idea how to tune motor current and Batt current correctly
[2023-12-15T14:00:19] Gabe Enzo: all I know is motor current should be equal or more There is literally no calculation and rule of thumb for this.
[2023-12-15T14:01:39] Gabe Enzo: I also notice the motor makes getting raped noises (bearings dying) if the settings are too unbalanced. I don't know the physics behind this at all.
[2023-12-15T14:06:57] Mirono escooters: Its general logic and testing
[2023-12-15T14:07:24] Gabe Enzo: the smaller the more the more phase current you can set, correct?
[2023-12-15T14:07:32] Gabe Enzo: I'm trying out 25a batt 60a phase now
[2023-12-15T14:07:42] Mirono escooters: That's just saturation
[2023-12-15T14:07:46] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2023-12-15T14:07:58] Mirono escooters: You can have 5a battery and 300a phase
[2023-12-15T14:08:04] Mirono escooters: Won't be useful but whatever
[2023-12-15T14:08:14] Mirono escooters: Finally sensible values
[2023-12-15T14:08:39] Gabe Enzo: this is all so confusing to my pea brain.
[2023-12-15T14:08:42] Mirono escooters: The max you should go is 50/80 +-
[2023-12-15T14:08:47] Gabe Enzo: so like 1/2.5 is sensible
[2023-12-15T14:09:10] Gabe Enzo: Right. I'll try 😁
[2023-12-15T14:09:10] Mirono escooters: There's no good answer to that
[2023-12-15T14:09:21] Gabe Enzo: I need a scientific paper on this
[2023-12-15T14:20:00] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2023-12-15T14:20:02] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2023-12-15T14:20:36] Mirono escooters: Where's that photo explaining it.. gets shared every couple months..
[2023-12-15T14:23:06] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11595@15-12-2023_14-23-06.jpg>
[2023-12-15T14:23:10] Mirono escooters: There ya go *pats head*
[2023-12-15T14:23:26] Gabe Enzo: saturates at 25/60. too lazy to install the 800w rn haha
[2023-12-15T14:23:34] Mirono escooters: 🤦
[2023-12-15T14:29:13] Gabe Enzo: poor 300w
[2023-12-15T14:29:25] Gabe Enzo: it's roasting rn jej
[2023-12-15T14:29:37] Gabe Enzo: I've been tryna kill it for weeks and it just won't die
[2023-12-15T14:29:58] Mirono escooters: ...
[2023-12-15T15:07:16] Happy Giraffe: I think it would be easiest to be explained also with 50v battery having 1kv motor that goes 50kmh but I dont want to write another bible😁
[2023-12-15T15:14:35] Mirono escooters: Well the only videos I've ever seen was battery going nuts
[2023-12-15T15:14:39] Mirono escooters: And killing flipsky
[2023-12-15T15:53:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔 Happy Bible or Holy 🤔🤔
[2023-12-15T16:30:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Raped 😁
[2023-12-15T16:30:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont be lazy
[2023-12-15T16:31:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If motor isolation burns phases short and rapes esc Electron gets tiers for Christmas
[2023-12-15T16:45:37] Gabe Enzo: omg I can't imagine. I can't continue going to uni on my shitty fiido bike any longer
[2023-12-15T16:49:26] Mirono escooters: Time for 800w
[2023-12-15T16:56:38] Gabe Enzo: I'll wait for the Moli to just do the entire upgrade at once cause these pro cells are DEAD as hell dude
[2023-12-15T16:57:04] Gabe Enzo: Imma rip my current pack out and save good 18650s and trash the bad ones. I think I can measure resistance with ohm's law, smart RC discharger; shows voltage sag and amperage.
[2023-12-15T16:58:53] Mirono escooters: Not surprised
[2023-12-15T16:59:09] Mirono escooters: Goh, those chargers are far from reliable
[2023-12-15T16:59:15] Gabe Enzo: Would this work? logically it should. the cogs in my brain are turning
[2023-12-15T16:59:24] Gabe Enzo: Eh why not? it also shows exact mAh during cycling. I can trash the low mah cells.
[2023-12-15T17:02:43] Mirono escooters: That mAh is usually totally off
[2023-12-15T17:02:51] Mirono escooters: Depends wich 🤷

[2023-12-15T17:50:35] Windfire: Hi guys, for this motor what is the value to put for configuration ?
[2023-12-15T17:58:22] sombre_enfant: U dont need.
[2023-12-15T18:02:08] Mirono escooters: Inrunner And match the weight
[2023-12-15T18:05:53] Windfire: I need. Because if i use the default parameters, the power is very low
[2023-12-15T18:25:30] Mirono escooters: You need to tune..
[2023-12-15T18:25:41] Mirono escooters: Motor detection is only for values After, you need to configure power yourself.
[2023-12-15T18:35:58] puneDir: loop key* :(
[2023-12-15T18:36:14] puneDir: or no
[2023-12-15T19:18:05] haku: i have petg and different kinds of pla
[2023-12-15T19:19:04] haku: seriously what is the point of that? im trying to understand euro scooter culture.
[2023-12-15T19:20:27] Mirono escooters: PETG may like a dryer
[2023-12-15T19:20:31] Mirono escooters: Depending on where u live
[2023-12-15T19:20:43] Mirono escooters: And how quickly u use a roll hahah
[2023-12-15T19:22:10] haku: pla is okay to leave in open yea?
[2023-12-15T19:22:30] Mirono escooters: Good enough
[2023-12-15T19:22:38] Mirono escooters: Get some silica gel if worried
[2023-12-15T19:25:25] haku: what will happen to the filament if humid. just wondering. will it be brittle?
[2023-12-15T19:29:17] Jan: Bubbles in the print
[2023-12-15T19:29:36] haku: i see. thanks
[2023-12-15T19:29:46] Jan: PA12 extrudes like foam when completely wet
[2023-12-15T19:43:04] Face de Pin Sucé: This is Dubai hahaha
[2023-12-15T19:53:21] Rose: Hey there Wolve666💀, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-15T19:56:13] Wolve666: Hello everyone
[2023-12-15T19:59:33] haku: hello
[2023-12-15T20:54:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Desert area
[2023-12-15T21:44:29] sombre_enfant: Wtf i reach 97% but no fwk
[2023-12-15T22:00:33] haku: how does it not cut out when 0%
[2023-12-15T22:08:26] haku: on the first rip it did not cut out
[2023-12-15T22:10:59] haku: on my spintend it auto turns off when i hit a certain%.
[2023-12-15T22:12:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It should even limit you
[2023-12-15T22:14:02] haku: sorry to hijack the topic. but amazing your battery did not cut out.
[2023-12-15T22:16:31] haku: the only way to fix this battery sag is high discharge batteries? or more ah?
[2023-12-15T22:18:40] haku: gotcha. ty
[2023-12-15T22:20:38] sombre_enfant: I put -255A and 2.5v cell low 1
[2023-12-15T22:22:41] sombre_enfant: I had to reboot, dash freeze
[2023-12-15T22:44:49] Tommy ª: bro they using 140A for reach 40kmh 😭😭😭😭😭 💀
[2023-12-15T23:10:37] sombre_enfant: Its nothing...
[2023-12-16T01:45:57] haku: what is a good glue to use on pla/petg prints? clear epoxy?
[2023-12-16T01:46:35] haku: some glue thay wont have a chemical reaction to the print
[2023-12-16T01:50:01] haku: i need to glue this over engineered phone holder.
[2023-12-16T01:50:58] Gabe Enzo: most likely epoxy.
[2023-12-16T01:53:28] haku: ill try that. thank you. a little chemical reaction to bond plastic into one but not melt it would be great.
[2023-12-16T02:15:46] Jan: What battery config? 10s?
[2023-12-16T02:16:06] Jan: Feels like a 10s4p
[2023-12-16T02:17:29] Jan: Battery for sure doesnt like it
[2023-12-16T03:22:49] Ion: Isn't this on a Vsett 10+? @lBabacar so 16s?
[2023-12-16T05:26:00] haku: same with vsett 9+ it sags like crazy on the stock escs
[2023-12-16T05:29:08] Gabe Enzo: You should've seen the Kugoo G4 factory new cells. Sagged from 70 to 30% during the first week of use. Cancer.
[2023-12-16T05:29:49] Gabe Enzo: I sold it tho teehee
[2023-12-16T05:30:23] haku: vsett has a bunch of choices for batteries though. some models can come witg lg cells. idk if they are high discharge cells but quality cells
[2023-12-16T05:32:05] haku: i think most high performance scooters have these problems. they use 50amp esc and batteries that max out at 50a
[2023-12-16T05:34:14] Gabe Enzo: those engineers should be fired.
[2023-12-16T05:35:00] Gabe Enzo: "high performance'' I paid 1200$ for - death wobble - 25km range not 75km - 55kmh max speed not 70
[2023-12-16T05:35:10] Gabe Enzo: Won't even go more than 50 with the friend I sold it to
[2023-12-16T05:35:13] Gabe Enzo: and it's brand new
[2023-12-16T05:35:38] Gabe Enzo: At least he doesn't get the death wobble simply because it doesn't go that fast with him on it
[2023-12-16T05:35:38] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-16T05:35:56] haku: ive noticed no company really uses high discarge cells maybe exept for nami but non uses 40t or p42
[2023-12-16T05:38:30] Gabe Enzo: He wants it to go 70, I told him that'll take vesc and an extra 7s cell to make it 24s.
[2023-12-16T05:38:56] Gabe Enzo: The motor is 2kw it's absolutely massive. It's ice cold 247 no matter what It actually feels like a 5kw motor
[2023-12-16T05:40:00] haku: yea these generic china motors can do some miracles.
[2023-12-16T05:40:23] Gabe Enzo: I saw a kugoo G4 I really wanted to just screw the motor off but I'm not a fucker.
[2023-12-16T05:40:32] Gabe Enzo: intrusive thoughts tho
[2023-12-16T05:41:07] haku: ill move over to general discussion.
[2023-12-16T05:41:27] Gabe Enzo: If that were me then I'd taste a 12 gauge barrel @Bradhaku
[2023-12-16T05:41:31] Gabe Enzo: Imagine
[2023-12-16T05:43:17] haku: my cheapo scooter still waiting on parts from china. cant wait to finish this thing. it prolly take 2months.
[2023-12-16T05:44:13] haku: wider deck on the way. hopefully just bolt on. if not ill get it welded
[2023-12-16T05:45:03] haku: while waiting im slowly working on g30
[2023-12-16T05:47:02] Gabe Enzo: Jesus Christ that thing is thicc
[2023-12-16T05:47:44] haku: i havent inflates it still. it will get rounder
[2023-12-16T05:48:17] Gabe Enzo: Yeah I'm slowly doing my Pro 2 and an gonna start working on a second 15s pro 2 soon. Might actually switch the frames around with my mom's m365 so I can make an m365 sleeper.
[2023-12-16T05:48:43] Gabe Enzo: 20s3p Moli and an 800w motor. zip around the place and it'll look stock as hell
[2023-12-16T05:48:48] haku: thats the move. sleeper builds
[2023-12-16T05:50:01] haku: oh i see. that sucks.
[2023-12-16T05:51:55] Gabe Enzo: I'd love to keep my pro a sleeper but I simply need suspension.
[2023-12-16T05:52:06] Gabe Enzo: Totally skews the sleeper look.
[2023-12-16T05:52:39] Gabe Enzo: Roads here are shite. and speed bumps EVERYWHERE
[2023-12-16T05:52:46] haku: i know. and suspensions for these are pricey too
[2023-12-16T05:53:27] Gabe Enzo: Tell me about it. I just ordered a monoshit rear and I got a front. that's 100+100, 200€. that's an entire secondhand pro
[2023-12-16T05:54:06] Gabe Enzo: There are m365s being sold here on flea markets for 60.
[2023-12-16T05:56:29] haku: we dont get alot of xiaomis here.
[2023-12-16T05:56:50] haku: not very marketed brand unfortunately
[2023-12-16T05:57:27] haku: we should have a retailer to do that.
[2023-12-16T05:57:33] Gabe Enzo: I've came to terms that I'm dropping 1000$ In January on my pro.
[2023-12-16T05:58:26] Gabe Enzo: 1800* in total spintend, motor, dual suspension but I already bought those 3
[2023-12-16T05:58:33] haku: this is an expensive hobby. i try to wait for sales and buy affordable parts when i see them.
[2023-12-16T05:59:13] Gabe Enzo: Haha expensive? Nah not really. RC is more expensive. You KNOW Shit will break. arleast with this hobby it's built to last
[2023-12-16T05:59:43] Gabe Enzo: Escs burning on the monthly and constant buying of micro parts
[2023-12-16T05:59:52] haku: my motors and welder got it on 11.11 sale batteries black friday. my laotie i got it new for $700 lol
[2023-12-16T06:00:01] Gabe Enzo: But yeah I get you it's expensive tbh
[2023-12-16T06:00:59] Gabe Enzo: motor shredded the gearbox on a bad day? 20$ on a Traxxas 20pin cog. Other 25$ on a servo arm. 50$ on a servo when it gets water damage Oh god what a shit Hobby.
[2023-12-16T06:01:10] haku: my style still cheaper than a name brand scooter though and i get to pick quality compoments
[2023-12-16T06:03:33] haku: that might be it. also huwawei brand
[2023-12-16T06:04:20] haku: they think our scooters are listening on our conversations haha
[2023-12-16T06:05:10] haku: makes alot of sense. tarifs and stuff i dont want to get in to
[2023-12-16T06:06:52] haku: this is why US is so behind on scooter culture.
[2023-12-16T06:08:07] haku: ebikes are the thing. qs motor+ fardriver lol. only a few choices in upgrades. they dont even consider vesc
[2023-12-16T06:08:48] Gabe Enzo: they don't know what It is.
[2023-12-16T06:09:01] Gabe Enzo: not enough reach. even here
[2023-12-16T06:09:04] haku: probably
[2023-12-16T06:10:08] Gabe Enzo: I can prob say I'm the only vesc user in all of Ireland, serious.
[2023-12-16T06:10:16] Gabe Enzo: These ppl are primal
[2023-12-16T06:10:35] haku: theres a guy here from NY and he has a tronic 750. thats very rare for ebike guys
[2023-12-16T06:11:07] Gabe Enzo: the only reason I got into this shit is because I can't afford a car. it's 1500€ a year for insurance here. +500 road tax so 2k Like no thank you. fuck off.
[2023-12-16T06:11:20] Gabe Enzo: Rather scoot to uni.
[2023-12-16T06:11:48] haku: very true. if i did not have a kid ide ride scooters everywhere

[2023-12-16T08:32:44] puneDir: whats the best way to clean a motor
[2023-12-16T09:24:31] haku: is that the new motor?
[2023-12-16T09:25:43] haku: there is a youtube by a scooter channel that teaches you how to clean direct drives. try to find it.
[2023-12-16T09:39:42] haku: is there a way to get fusion 360 full version for free? 😂
[2023-12-16T09:41:31] Izuna 生活: be a student like me
[2023-12-16T09:42:01] Izuna 生活: Just parked my G30 at the school. Suddenly I hear it hissing. The wet leaves hit the brake disk 😂
[2023-12-16T09:42:12] haku: i have a college email. ill see of i can try that
[2023-12-16T09:42:23] haku: .edu email
[2023-12-16T09:42:42] puneDir: it wants student confirmation paper or something
[2023-12-16T09:43:00] puneDir: no second hand kaabo
[2023-12-16T09:43:39] haku: maybe i can get it under my college nephews name. $500 is steep for a noob learning
[2023-12-16T09:44:32] Mirono escooters: Epoxy, super glue, plastic glue
[2023-12-16T09:45:14] Mirono escooters: Ah rip
[2023-12-16T09:45:23] haku: your new motor you bought is what i meant. yes there is a way to clean that
[2023-12-16T09:45:35] Mirono escooters: A drill and a wire brush You "shoot" the rust out
[2023-12-16T09:45:50] Izuna 生活: That's good!
[2023-12-16T09:45:55] Mirono escooters: Succesfully did it once on a big motor that was worth it
[2023-12-16T09:46:00] Izuna 生活: I don't even have one and I still got access.
[2023-12-16T09:46:14] Mirono escooters: It'll take a while but 🤷
[2023-12-16T09:46:32] Mirono escooters: Yeah, I just have a normal hahaha
[2023-12-16T09:46:37] haku: there are chemicals too. i. not just sure wich.
[2023-12-16T09:46:46] Mirono escooters: A photo of my school pass was Enough
[2023-12-16T09:46:55] Mirono escooters: Heck, I can just download it pre activated from education site
[2023-12-16T09:47:09] Mirono escooters: Problem is that it leaves stuff behind
[2023-12-16T09:47:15] Mirono escooters: If u wire brush it not
[2023-12-16T10:24:20] Mirono escooters: You ain't listening 😭
[2023-12-16T10:26:50] sombre_enfant: It should give fwk no mather what
[2023-12-16T10:27:08] Mirono escooters: Stop abusing that thing like holy shit
[2023-12-16T10:27:17] Mirono escooters: Have a shit setup and then wonder why nothing works 🙈🙈🤯
[2023-12-16T10:29:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nees to reduce a bit
[2023-12-16T10:29:44] Mirono escooters: Nah, push it more, why not 😂😂
[2023-12-16T10:30:00] sombre_enfant: Ima do my own way
[2023-12-16T10:30:21] Mirono escooters: Aight then Don't come asking stuff everyday 😗
[2023-12-16T10:30:26] puneDir: sup guys
[2023-12-16T10:30:30] puneDir: im out for a while
[2023-12-16T10:30:45] Ion: You know I'm genuinely interested
[2023-12-16T10:30:47] puneDir: i dont have enough motivation to work on a scooter anymore lol
[2023-12-16T10:31:03] Mirono escooters: I don't understand how you guys have the energy to keep building those scooters with shit parts, I'd lose the energy. So much work for nothing.
[2023-12-16T10:31:25] Ion: How can you pull 130A from stock Vsett battery? I have the same thing, 16s8p, but it can deliver 10A per cell max, so 80A
[2023-12-16T10:31:26] sombre_enfant: Its not shit man stop trippin
[2023-12-16T10:31:57] Ion: So max I can do is 40A per controller
[2023-12-16T10:32:05] Jhinzuo ~~: Is amperage meter phase or battery current on vesc
[2023-12-16T10:32:20] sombre_enfant: Phase for both motor
[2023-12-16T10:32:36] Ion: Oh, not battery??
[2023-12-16T10:32:40] Mirono escooters: Look, I'm not in the mood. It's simple Or you start taking advice, or you can indeed "do it your own way" (and stop bothering us daily) Ok?
[2023-12-16T10:33:05] Mirono escooters: Default phase both Can config
[2023-12-16T10:33:34] Mirono escooters: Relatable
[2023-12-16T10:33:52] Jhinzuo ~~: That's nice cuz I didn't understand phase amps yet fully with battery amps I know how much I can use
[2023-12-16T10:33:52] Mirono escooters: The crash comes someday
[2023-12-16T10:34:20] Mirono escooters: You'll learn after a while, it's confusing at first
[2023-12-16T10:34:37] Mirono escooters: Try to understand the graph, it's a good step
[2023-12-16T10:34:54] sombre_enfant: It was just to say it dont push fwk amps, it was with flipsky and makerbase, now i will put 80100.dont worry i soon sell this battery idk how much its worth and build good 20s
[2023-12-16T10:35:08] Mirono escooters: Finally 🤦
[2023-12-16T10:56:04] Wolve666: Good morning, I have a problem with my spintend ubox V2 X2, it's possible my 12v light output not work? I have plug one led controller but can't work
[2023-12-16T11:25:03] Ion: Measure with multimeter
[2023-12-16T11:51:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why?
[2023-12-16T11:55:25] Mirono escooters: Burnout? 😛
[2023-12-16T12:02:30] puneDir: school,other works,gym and no time left to do
[2023-12-16T12:03:01] puneDir: also if canbus dies again im going to dump that in trash
[2023-12-16T12:03:37] puneDir: i could buy 2x ubox now but im not sure if its worth to do that much investigation on e scooter
[2023-12-16T12:04:07] puneDir: unreliability is just annoying
[2023-12-16T12:21:02] Mirono escooters: Mine is reliable..
[2023-12-16T12:37:07] Izuna 生活: mine is
[2023-12-16T12:41:28] Happy Giraffe: Skill issue😂
[2023-12-16T12:42:19] puneDir: you use smart bms with single setup
[2023-12-16T12:42:30] puneDir: same,no ignition and smart bms
[2023-12-16T12:42:33] puneDir: ignition mod ruins it
[2023-12-16T12:45:11] Mirono escooters: All* of my scooters have been reliable
[2023-12-16T12:45:27] Mirono escooters: 🤨
[2023-12-16T12:46:17] Tommy ª: bruh im the only using vesc with a relay? 💀
[2023-12-16T12:46:46] Mirono escooters: Relay?????
[2023-12-16T12:50:39] cihan: 75200 v2 arrived, this thing is huge. 🙃
[2023-12-16T12:51:36] cihan: BMS was also huge. Somehow sizes on paper always seem smaller than what they really are to me lately. 😁
[2023-12-16T12:53:22] Wolve666: Nothing. All 0. I have see one video with one remote button to command che lights
[2023-12-16T12:53:43] Wolve666: It's possible I have no consense to attivate the lights?
[2023-12-16T12:57:27] Mirono escooters: Its still one of the tinier ones ;)

[2023-12-16T15:52:11] Mirono escooters: Cool, seems like it worked
[2023-12-16T15:52:37] puneDir: yep
[2023-12-16T15:52:51] puneDir: now im going to order monorim for rear and front
[2023-12-16T15:53:02] puneDir: 50h rear 40-45h front good combo
[2023-12-16T15:53:11] Mirono escooters: You switched your mind about scooters really quickly
[2023-12-16T15:54:10] puneDir: my dad said lol he said make that thing best as possible so i wont need to carry you around 😁
[2023-12-16T16:36:40] rosheee: bought?
[2023-12-16T16:47:58] Mirono escooters: Don't question, had issues with installing apk
[2023-12-16T16:54:04] haku: take that advice seriously bud
[2023-12-16T16:55:01] haku: my dad said before he passed is dont let your dreams be memes.
[2023-12-16T17:22:39] Mirono escooters: 🥺

[2023-12-16T18:10:36] puneDir: can we install 50h to this w g30
[2023-12-16T18:31:03] Jan: Yes if you invert the forks and bend it even more outwards
[2023-12-16T18:31:25] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2023-12-16T18:32:59] Jan: Its really annoying to do if you hand bend it. Its 5mm steel
[2023-12-16T18:33:41] Jan: Bent fork with 50h front
[2023-12-16T18:33:59] Jan: Also my one of my oldest g30 picture
[2023-12-16T18:42:15] puneDir: can we extend it
[2023-12-16T18:42:24] puneDir: for more ride height
[2023-12-16T18:50:15] Mirono escooters: Evolved so good🥰
[2023-12-16T18:56:24] Yamal: Beautiful
[2023-12-16T19:39:26] haku: ive been thinking about this. so stupid if thats the case we only get clones that break and cause fires. maybe i can sell these xiaomis in the US
[2023-12-16T19:40:32] haku: black market scooter dealer.
[2023-12-16T19:49:54] haku: when you painted this how did you get the same texture and paint on the monorim and the frame
[2023-12-16T19:51:12] haku: but it looks like the factory paint on the frame. unless repainted
[2023-12-16T19:57:13] haku: do you guys have this type of ninebot in europe?
[2023-12-16T19:57:23] haku: this color
[2023-12-16T20:00:23] haku: smaller frame you mean? but doesnt all g30s have the same size frame? sorry im a noob.
[2023-12-16T20:02:04] Jan: Belton Metallschutzlack Anthrazit
[2023-12-16T20:02:51] haku: what? is that the paint brand?
[2023-12-16T20:03:02] Jan: The brand and type
[2023-12-16T20:03:14] haku: thanks.
[2023-12-16T20:56:38] cihan: It has to fit according to numbers but I'll have to bend the motor and battery wires which I don't really want.
[2023-12-16T20:58:51] Mirono escooters: What dis
[2023-12-16T21:01:09] haku: my heart rate after seeing the price on those things
[2023-12-16T21:02:15] Jan: 3shul #nofilter
[2023-12-16T21:03:29] Mirono escooters: It is noisy, but without more info, I have no idea what both graphs display (and how tested, setup?
[2023-12-16T21:03:54] Mirono escooters: Danks
[2023-12-16T21:04:10] Mirono escooters: Ain't no one winning from Trampa
[2023-12-16T21:05:11] Mirono escooters: You got the bucks?
[2023-12-16T21:07:24] Mirono escooters: Hmm
[2023-12-16T21:19:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's 3A max , should power up when vesc does
[2023-12-16T21:24:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔🤔well, he could donate in the best as possible part😁
[2023-12-16T21:44:54] Rose: Hey there Mehmet Ali, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-16T22:54:58] haku: @jamessoderstrom you are correct. its a shame
[2023-12-16T22:57:10] haku: probably still has a bad name in here
[2023-12-16T23:06:45] Paolo ⁭: China Is looking to blacklist apple
[2023-12-16T23:06:58] Paolo ⁭: What I will do😭
[2023-12-16T23:22:11] Mirono escooters: No way they'll do that
[2023-12-16T23:25:41] haku: this geo political tension is bad for us merikans. cant experience quality stuff just clones
[2023-12-16T23:26:45] Tommy ª: speedbumps and rocks when?
[2023-12-16T23:27:49] haku: does an F1 car need to worry about those 😂
[2023-12-16T23:28:15] Tommy ª: there is no asphalt 😭
[2023-12-16T23:52:18] Jan: Not in switzerland
[2023-12-16T23:52:20] Jan: 😬
[2023-12-17T00:14:32] haku: craftmanship of my new furniture is outstanding
[2023-12-17T00:25:55] haku: if anyone wants to buy one for $200 let me know. its made in the USA
[2023-12-17T00:30:37] Paolo ⁭: What you sell? This printed tool box?
[2023-12-17T00:30:58] haku: yes. made in the USA toolbox
[2023-12-17T00:32:11] Paolo ⁭: Isn't 200$ too much? Just my thought, in Europe wouldn't possible sell at that price :(
[2023-12-17T00:39:58] Jan: 200$? ^^
[2023-12-17T00:42:58] sombre_enfant: He def tripinn
[2023-12-17T01:01:49] haku: why not? folks will pay $7k for a rion 😂
[2023-12-17T01:15:13] Paolo ⁭: If people will pay it so yeah no problem
[2023-12-17T01:21:57] Jan: Yeah but when you calculate material and labor, the margin isnt that high
[2023-12-17T01:28:41] haku: hey im just kidding folks. my point is people will buy it because there is a brand and american made. look at benchmade knives for example ive seen chinese knives with equal quality sell for way less.
[2023-12-17T01:29:32] haku: another expample is rogue fitness gear.
[2023-12-17T01:33:12] haku: there is a market for these things. all im saying
[2023-12-17T01:33:28] Jan: Tbh it looks nice but technically its just a shelf...out of plastic. Injection molded shelfs of this size sell for like 10$ from china. You are competing against those with this
[2023-12-17T01:34:15] Jan: Unless it cures cancer, its probably a bit harder to sell it as in my opinion there is no selling point
[2023-12-17T01:34:23] haku: i know. but if i slap a made in the usa brand on it there are people that will buy it
[2023-12-17T01:35:07] Jan: Hmm i disagree but lets see the sales number in the future, looking forward
[2023-12-17T01:35:31] haku: it comes in black too if interested 😝
[2023-12-17T01:36:26] Jan: I sell a fork, made in switzerland with highest precision in sheetmetal manufacturing in the world. Even that i cant sell for ridiculous high prices
[2023-12-17T01:36:51] Jan: For me its almost a non profit part
[2023-12-17T01:37:16] Jan: And not many will buy it
[2023-12-17T01:41:33] haku: i see what you mean.
[2023-12-17T02:10:17] Paolo ⁭: Yes but it's still printed with china machine and material😂
[2023-12-17T02:17:55] haku: this is my point exactly. look at super 73. chinese parts on an american frame.
[2023-12-17T02:23:05] haku: im sorry to offend super 73 guys but this is what i mean. with the right marketing you can sell anything
[2023-12-17T02:25:20] haku: no idea. its expensive though. and its made in the usa
[2023-12-17T02:26:09] haku: like that honda scooter. its shit but i still want one 😂
[2023-12-17T02:30:04] haku: no idea. i think frame is only american. someone please correct me if wrong
[2023-12-17T05:07:51] Rose: Hey there Chris, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-17T05:11:22] Chris Culver: So I downloaded the firmware 6.2, and on the GitHub it's mistakenly labeled as 6.02. (maybe I have that backwards) so I had the bright idea to change the name of the firmware file before uploading it... Now it's not detected when I plug it into computer. :( Didn't even get to use it once.
[2023-12-17T05:13:35] Tommy ª: stlink moment
[2023-12-17T05:14:24] Chris Culver: On its way
[2023-12-17T05:36:52] Rose: Hey there .​, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-17T05:41:27] Chris Culver: I have Ubox 75v the purple one

[2023-12-17T13:04:44] Gabe Enzo: Holy shit that is some pro 2
[2023-12-17T13:05:58] Tommy ª: you have lOicense for drive that?
[2023-12-17T13:23:53] Finn: One question i have. There is a kid pretending that you can drive on two phases without any stuttering etc.😂
[2023-12-17T13:37:18] Mirono escooters: 🤨
[2023-12-17T13:37:36] Mirono escooters: If you wanna ride terribly inefficient, yeah sure But.. why?. What's his point?.
[2023-12-17T13:53:46] Tommy ª: what happend with the 3rd one? 💀
[2023-12-17T13:56:38] Gabe Enzo: I tried that before Looool when I was 12
[2023-12-17T13:59:26] Tommy ª: you always can use dc motors
[2023-12-17T13:59:27] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2023-12-17T14:00:51] Gabe Enzo: I had a brushless thruster and realized it had 3 wires and I was like bruh
[2023-12-17T14:01:07] Gabe Enzo: maybe I can use 2 escs to fill the other wire 💀
[2023-12-17T14:03:04] Gabe Enzo: DC not enough to propel an RC car with a thruster 😁
[2023-12-17T14:24:52] Paolo ⁭: Why not?
[2023-12-17T14:25:51] Paolo ⁭: Many train are DC as well , AC is just more efficient
[2023-12-17T14:28:18] Gabe Enzo: Not enough Kv
[2023-12-17T14:28:43] Gabe Enzo: brush less simply faster
[2023-12-17T14:28:45] Gabe Enzo: period
[2023-12-17T14:29:12] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom now getting back home to finish the charger holder😁 Print came out of print bed again (for fucks sake) but managed to print enough for it to still work if I drill 2 additional holes😁
[2023-12-17T14:30:16] Paolo ⁭: Yes but that's not related to DC or ac motor , that's brush or brushless motor
[2023-12-17T14:30:19] Happy Giraffe: Interesting to see how the screw in terminals handle it but 1.5A aint much😅
[2023-12-17T14:36:45] Happy Giraffe: @Mirono_escooters You had any luck finding upgraded springs for ender before taking glass bed?
[2023-12-17T14:43:29] Mirono escooters: Compare apples and pears 😀
[2023-12-17T14:45:48] Mirono escooters: Didn't bother, went bltouch
[2023-12-17T14:46:02] Mirono escooters: And thing came with glass bed?
[2023-12-17T14:48:22] Happy Giraffe: I have BL touch but bed wont stay level as the springs get loose or sometging after 10 hours of printing idk😂
[2023-12-17T14:48:54] Happy Giraffe: I dont have glass, PEI sheet I love but it requires a static not moving bed...
[2023-12-17T14:51:37] Mirono escooters: I think I got the V2 original springs
[2023-12-17T14:53:39] Happy Giraffe: Would be nice to know the exact height from the midpoint so I could just machine spacers for the corners to match Maybe need manually measure everything with metal ruler and light behind to check its level and then run Klipper on printer to make more advanced mesh and save it to printers firmware
[2023-12-17T14:53:49] Happy Giraffe: Then would always be level
[2023-12-17T15:04:24] sombre_enfant: Im more a hellcat guy
[2023-12-17T15:04:45] Mirono escooters: Uhm, ok?
[2023-12-17T15:29:49] Gabe Enzo: Retardalmost killed me
[2023-12-17T15:36:22] Mirono escooters: Has no use for this group or chat. Please stop and be mature.
[2023-12-17T15:41:10] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters I have the most use for this chat next to punedir
[2023-12-17T15:41:14] Gabe Enzo: 💀
[2023-12-17T15:43:15] Mirono escooters: Even this chat doesn't want some bullshit spam about drunk driving whatever. Behave

[2023-12-17T16:52:12] Happy Giraffe: What soldering irons you guys use for QS-8 connectors? @PaoloWu @jamessoderstrom @AJAJ1992 ?
[2023-12-17T16:52:42] Jan: 300W
[2023-12-17T17:00:48] Paolo ⁭: Is too big, is impossibile
[2023-12-17T17:11:14] Happy Giraffe: Thats pricey😂
[2023-12-17T17:38:39] Jan: Thats what she said
[2023-12-17T17:38:45] Jan: But seriously just put it in
[2023-12-17T17:38:55] Jan: It works a lot better when you have power
[2023-12-17T17:39:17] Jan: With a small one it doesnt solder through and you heat controller and cables for nothing
[2023-12-17T17:39:55] Paolo ⁭: 150w is even more than enough
[2023-12-17T17:49:25] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2023-12-17T17:52:40] Oreo huzky: He probably ment dc motors
[2023-12-17T17:53:13] Oreo huzky: But I’ve never seen that on any scooters other than the kids scooters that go 6kmh
[2023-12-17T17:55:27] Mirono escooters: It's not, perfect
[2023-12-17T17:55:43] Mirono escooters: Weller 80w (or something)
[2023-12-17T17:56:13] Mirono escooters: 50W do be on limit. But yeah, big tip, crank up heat, pre heat
[2023-12-17T17:59:46] Yamal: in Amazon ? No can fine..
[2023-12-17T18:04:04] Jan: I cannot solder it with 50W. The heat transfer is just so slow that i heat up the everything
[2023-12-17T18:04:39] Mirono escooters: I'm happy I got my Weller upgrade :)
[2023-12-17T18:04:45] Mirono escooters: Ceramic vs something actually good also matters
[2023-12-17T18:40:44] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-12-17T18:41:04] Gabe Enzo: @punedir 4kw HAHAHAHAHh
[2023-12-17T18:41:21] Gabe Enzo: HOW TF IS This not DEAD YET HAHAHA
[2023-12-17T19:00:10] haku: made in usa collectors edition black and white toolbox. only $180
[2023-12-17T19:11:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You mean the ones under?
[2023-12-17T19:11:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Get the silicone leg thingy for it bro
[2023-12-17T19:39:46] Happy Giraffe: Been thinking about those, but I need it to be exactly leveled. If those fit exactly the printer then I coul lathe same parts with 0.01mm accuracy😁
[2023-12-17T19:55:49] Gabe Enzo: regular industrial induction motor WAYYYY better for those. can push up to 70kw.. it's what I'm planning to do. Choosing for Ekart or E-Bike for summer. most likely ekart. cause easier
[2023-12-17T19:55:59] Gabe Enzo: also requires less complex welding
[2023-12-17T20:18:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ask slinky we have does ,springs annoyed him years ago
[2023-12-17T21:01:55] Happy Giraffe: My printer model not so common so I'm not sure how high the mid point of bed is🤔 can't really measure it either
[2023-12-17T21:02:43] Happy Giraffe: Well it would be 100kg max anyway so no need for anything more than 50kw😅
[2023-12-17T22:21:16] haku: would this work for cf filament? Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $1.99 81%OFF | Hardened Steel Nozzle 0.4mm 3D Printer MK8 Nozzles Tool High Temperature Wear Resistant for Makerbot Creality CR-10 Ender 3 Pro https://a.aliexpress.com/_msyLGD6
[2023-12-17T22:43:00] Rose: Hey there Electrocenter.​by, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-17T22:46:39] Ion: What causes being speed limited by duty cycle (in my case 98%), and would field weakening help? I do have FW set to 10A but don't see a real difference while driving. Does make it faster in air tho
[2023-12-17T22:54:34] Кирилл: Whats your real speed with load in >90% duty cycle?
[2023-12-17T22:55:38] Ion: 53km/h with 50H Vsett motor and 13S battery
[2023-12-17T22:55:40] NetworkDir: What Hardware
[2023-12-17T22:56:33] Ion: <photos/photo_11617@17-12-2023_22-56-33.jpg>
[2023-12-17T22:58:30] Кирилл: 10A is too little to go faster. Because the faster you go, the more current (power) you need in ^3, but with fw you decrease your motor torque. Additional current compensate it, but fw loads battery also and esc. So you have more sag on battery. The more fw current - more rpms you will get, less torque you will get (more speed needs also torque), more sag of V on battery you will have. The more battery sag - less volts, less rpms because of kv of the motor (kv = rpm/Vbatt).
[2023-12-17T23:00:09] Ion: yeah I understand. Sag is quite bad (50V to 45V, so 5V sag at least for example). So that's probably limiting factor
[2023-12-17T23:01:06] haku: chinese big deck. i love it
[2023-12-17T23:01:39] Кирилл: yes, you may encounter the fact that using a battery that is not powerful enough in terms of current, you will use more field weakening and thus the batteries will drain more, as a result, the speed will not increase because of more Vbatt sag
[2023-12-17T23:02:08] Кирилл: Ofc if other limiters is off
[2023-12-17T23:08:29] Happy Giraffe: No because its 0.4mm that would glog up instantly
[2023-12-17T23:08:35] Happy Giraffe: 0.6 min
[2023-12-17T23:09:05] haku: gotcha. it has to be hardened steel yea?
[2023-12-17T23:35:57] haku: need to find a local welder. wich is super $$$
[2023-12-17T23:36:58] haku: no neef for diamond ruby nozzle?
[2023-12-17T23:49:46] Happy Giraffe: Just hardened is enough
[2023-12-17T23:50:28] haku: thank you bud
[2023-12-18T00:02:21] Chris Culver: Ok so the ST-Link fixed me right up. Thanks guys
[2023-12-18T00:03:02] Chris Culver: Question: on the Ubox v2 purple, do I connect the CAN BUSes with that cable? Or no
[2023-12-18T00:16:48] Chris Culver: Also, I don't know my battery specs... Do I need to unwrap this thing to calc that?
[2023-12-18T00:20:31] haku: charge it to full then check on a voltmeter
[2023-12-18T00:21:23] haku: to check how many in parallel you need to open i think
[2023-12-18T00:39:07] Jan: FW feels like a jet afterburner, you need a lot of fuel just to go a little bit faster.
[2023-12-18T00:40:42] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: WTF IT'S A XIAOMI????????
[2023-12-18T00:49:57] haku: dam this vsett always out here to get me
[2023-12-18T01:10:13] Ion: that sucks, but don't ride in crocs pls
[2023-12-18T01:11:46] haku: i was walking my dog around the hood
[2023-12-18T01:12:15] haku: but yes lesson learned
[2023-12-18T05:56:01] haku: big deck. i dont even know if i want to use it. can fit 2 sabvoton 72200 in there
[2023-12-18T05:59:16] haku: <photos/photo_11621@18-12-2023_05-59-16.jpg>
[2023-12-18T06:57:15] haku: it was a joke lol. those things are huge
[2023-12-18T07:00:24] Izuna 生活: ay going to France by myself 😂 just booked the hotel yesterday near Paris.
[2023-12-18T07:00:32] Izuna 生活: Over new Year
[2023-12-18T07:01:18] haku: enjoy! never been. always wanted to see europa
[2023-12-18T07:19:27] Izuna 生活: Thanks. I'm from Germany, so it's not that far from home and going there by interrail pass trains. Going to be interesting how it's going to work out, never went somewhere by myself. If something goes wrong I'm alone 😂
[2023-12-18T07:33:16] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: to France on scooter only? 🌚
[2023-12-18T07:34:01] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Schengen borders makes life easier and better
[2023-12-18T07:34:27] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: For me something like this is big queue
[2023-12-18T07:34:47] Izuna 生活: Taking my G30 with me probably
[2023-12-18T07:36:57] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: just uhh Going to another country without passport and no queue and other bs, wow.
[2023-12-18T08:56:40] Gabe Enzo: In love 🥰
[2023-12-18T08:57:18] Gabe Enzo: I'm wondering how he got those 32mm handlebars on
[2023-12-18T09:04:21] Oreo huzky: Does it fit on ti 30?
[2023-12-18T10:22:29] haku: it doesnt bolt on. need to drill new holes. i will do that and maybe get it welded
[2023-12-18T10:48:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Jeez
[2023-12-18T10:50:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How come, i was planning Haga for nye
[2023-12-18T10:52:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes totally that
[2023-12-18T10:53:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I personaly saw worse before not scooter related , Crocs related pretty much hate that😅
[2023-12-18T10:56:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What's the plan
[2023-12-18T10:57:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hope you dont bolt it the same way as body next to it, dm if you want to know
[2023-12-18T10:57:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz that's bad shortly
[2023-12-18T10:58:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why
[2023-12-18T10:59:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If its the awd version its already connected
[2023-12-18T10:59:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How can that even happen?
[2023-12-18T11:48:02] Chris Culver: What do you mean? It's an aftermarket battery the previous owner bought and it has no label.... It's a Christmas miracle, I know
[2023-12-18T11:52:43] Yamal: 🔥‼️
[2023-12-18T11:54:01] Yamal: Mr Paolo 🫡😁
[2023-12-18T12:28:48] Gabe Enzo: is that a 3kw?
[2023-12-18T12:29:41] Yamal: 60h 22/3
[2023-12-18T12:29:46] Gabe Enzo: but what kw
[2023-12-18T12:29:52] Yamal: I don’t know
[2023-12-18T12:30:01] Gabe Enzo: Why can I see the windings lol
[2023-12-18T12:30:01] Gabe Enzo: haha
[2023-12-18T12:30:11] Yamal: Heh
[2023-12-18T13:57:45] Mirono escooters: Ultra cooling
[2023-12-18T14:36:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Buys random battery and know nothing about it ,🙈 how is that possible
[2023-12-18T14:36:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No plastic bottle?
[2023-12-18T14:39:40] Yamal: Of course , plastic bottle inside the box 📦?
[2023-12-18T14:44:03] Gordan Gizdic: Does anyone have a wprking logic board for 3shul C350. Mine dies, power board is fine. Not the latest version, mind you. The one before this new updated version. If you do and are willing to sell it, please let me know. Thnx.
[2023-12-18T15:42:32] Oreo huzky: No don’t weld
[2023-12-18T15:44:19] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Monorim handlebar adapter and adapter from bicycle
[2023-12-18T17:24:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Respect plastic bottles
[2023-12-18T17:24:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2023-12-18T17:25:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Moved it ,too its place 😁
[2023-12-18T17:44:34] Mirono escooters: No problemo
[2023-12-18T17:59:02] puneDir: is this a foc wave?
[2023-12-18T17:59:26] puneDir: yeah it is looks bad
[2023-12-18T18:11:14] Happy Giraffe: "brrrr"
[2023-12-18T18:16:59] Finn: Its a sine wave
[2023-12-18T18:17:09] Finn: Noise over noise
[2023-12-18T18:21:17] Кирилл: This is a fence at the countryside of the flipsky owner
[2023-12-18T18:22:20] Finn: Xd
[2023-12-18T18:25:25] Chris Culver: Bruh I bought the entire scooter sight unseen and it had the battery in it. That's what adults do, they buy stuff.
[2023-12-18T18:51:40] Rose: Hey there Beanr, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-18T18:51:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Adults mostly look after what they buy , so bruh your self 🤣 All what's known is aftermarket what means Ali usually
[2023-12-18T19:04:33] Happy Giraffe: It's okay to learn from mistakes, we all paid our learning money. This group might sometimes have rather direct and unfiltered reactions/ messages just don't take it personal😅
[2023-12-18T19:14:10] haku: what scooter is it?
[2023-12-18T19:16:03] haku: why whats wrong with welds?
[2023-12-18T19:19:06] Happy Giraffe: Both materials steel?
[2023-12-18T19:20:15] haku: crap aluminum from what i tested. it doesnt stick to magnets
[2023-12-18T19:21:07] Paolo ⁭: Alu never stick to magnet
[2023-12-18T19:21:13] Happy Giraffe: Alu isnt magnetic, neither is stainless steel but if you can easily scratch the surface and if it feels light its propably alu
[2023-12-18T19:22:10] Happy Giraffe: Alu welding much harder as its toxic and heat control is needed etc. need a good welder that knows what hes doing. Otherwise can be lot of problems
[2023-12-18T19:22:23] haku: thanks ill try that. i will ask the fabricator if this material is safe for welding
[2023-12-18T19:23:10] Happy Giraffe: It is, just need ventilated welding helmet that pro places have
[2023-12-18T19:24:29] haku: dam this labor from the welder will probably be the most expensive out of all the items on my project
[2023-12-18T19:24:56] haku: wish i knew how to weld
[2023-12-18T19:26:58] haku: i can always make new holes and just bolt it like the factory deck
[2023-12-18T19:30:06] Happy Giraffe: Idk your local guys but should be an hour job max
[2023-12-18T19:30:27] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2023-12-18T19:31:01] Happy Giraffe: Sometimes if TIG welded alu also needs to be cooled in between to continue with small bits each time
[2023-12-18T19:48:25] haku: i think it might be stainless steel. its hard to tell. whatever is cheapest im thinking that is what they will use
[2023-12-18T19:52:20] haku: sounds like steel yea?
[2023-12-18T19:53:08] Mirono escooters: Sounds a special indicator 😶
[2023-12-18T19:53:28] haku: seriously what material is that
[2023-12-18T19:53:29] Paolo ⁭: Just get a magnet
[2023-12-18T19:53:41] haku: it doesnt stick
[2023-12-18T19:53:53] Paolo ⁭: So it's probably alu
[2023-12-18T19:54:23] Paolo ⁭: Magnet stick strongly to steel, weakly to stainless
[2023-12-18T19:54:32] Denis Sebastien: <photos/photo_11624@18-12-2023_19-54-32.jpg>
[2023-12-18T19:55:28] Mirono escooters: Weight is a better indicator
[2023-12-18T19:56:13] haku: i will ask seller also. i dont know why i did not do this 😂
[2023-12-18T20:05:52] Happy Giraffe: Time to test stud tires on hard smooth ice that has water on top of it. Im scared to death lol
[2023-12-18T20:09:07] haku: be careful my guy!
[2023-12-18T20:14:41] Gabe Enzo: Paolos motor??
[2023-12-18T20:50:10] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: 105*30 rim? I have same
[2023-12-18T21:07:33] Oreo huzky: If something breaks and you want to replace it you will have a real hard time and I wouldn’t really trust welds at these critical parts
[2023-12-18T21:09:10] haku: good idea. the thing about this frame is so many available parts that are affordable. so i wouldnt mind doing that. i will still consider just bolting it.
[2023-12-18T21:09:35] haku: i just want to make sure it stays there and not break off because of my janky bolts
[2023-12-18T21:11:17] haku: if laotie does a $700 sale again ill def get another one and sell my ebike
[2023-12-18T21:17:49] Oreo huzky: Use good titanium bolts
[2023-12-18T21:18:12] Oreo huzky: I can get you one for factory price if you want to
[2023-12-18T21:19:24] haku: that be cool. i need to sell some stuff first. lol
[2023-12-18T21:19:36] Mirono escooters: Why titanium? No reason
[2023-12-18T21:19:44] Mirono escooters: Rvs304 exists. 12.9 steel exists
[2023-12-18T21:21:35] haku: also i got mine on bangood. they have a US warehouse
[2023-12-18T21:22:05] haku: the shipping from china will prolly kill the deal
[2023-12-18T21:24:41] Oreo huzky: I have direct contact to the manufacturer and shipping is not bad i paid 150€ shipping for my frame
[2023-12-18T21:25:14] Happy Giraffe: PETG-CF first layers scary af. Printing cookie cutters for christmas. Found one stl seller that had all kinds of Star Wars stuff done for 2$.
[2023-12-18T21:26:12] haku: i want to try that too. but im still a noob at printing.
[2023-12-18T21:26:22] Oreo huzky: I can also get you all the spare parts just hit me up with a message
[2023-12-18T21:27:44] haku: for sure. ill keep that in mind. thanks
[2023-12-18T21:27:50] Happy Giraffe: There are some theories that alu/titanium is better than steel. I havent made any conclusions about those but its interesting some people prefer them so different🤔
[2023-12-18T21:28:31] Happy Giraffe: Me too, printer being inconsistent with the print bed makes it harder to know when Im doing other stuff right or wrong
[2023-12-18T21:28:58] haku: how about magnesium and carbon?
[2023-12-18T21:29:22] haku: some scooters come in carbon frames now
[2023-12-18T21:31:29] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-12-18T21:31:37] Mirono escooters: Magnesium??
[2023-12-18T21:31:43] Mirono escooters: Carbon fiber? 1 crash and done
[2023-12-18T21:32:09] Jan: Define better
[2023-12-18T21:32:32] Gabe Enzo: Need.
[2023-12-18T21:32:43] haku: yep the stuff used in aeroplanes.
[2023-12-18T21:33:50] Oreo huzky: I prefer chinesium
[2023-12-18T21:34:30] Mirono escooters: I am not the best in chemistry, but isn't magnesium.. not for structural stuff?
[2023-12-18T21:35:31] Jan: Magnesium has its own problems but its actually really really nice for structural light weight applications
[2023-12-18T21:35:37] Mirono escooters: Apperantly magnesium based engines exist Learned something new again
[2023-12-18T21:35:58] Mirono escooters: Due to a reversible reaction with water Whatever, uh cool, didn't know. We didn't see magnesium yet
[2023-12-18T21:36:07] Mirono escooters: Material science just passed plastics and non ferro
[2023-12-18T21:36:27] Jan: The ultimate material in engineering is beryllium, it can do everything and is better in everything than anything else
[2023-12-18T21:37:03] Mirono escooters: Let me guess, rare? : D
[2023-12-18T21:37:17] Jan: toxic ^^
[2023-12-18T21:37:23] Jan: expensive
[2023-12-18T21:37:53] Mirono escooters: 0.006% of Earth's crust Hm
[2023-12-18T21:38:24] Mirono escooters: Can't be worse then my ex, and I'm still alive Pass me the beryllium
[2023-12-18T21:42:00] Jan: Crazy how one material (beryllium) is just better in everything
[2023-12-18T21:42:26] Jan: I really want a magnesium comeback
[2023-12-18T21:43:15] Jan: It has really nice properties for lightweight but since carbon fiber came, nobody is doing anything with magnesium anymore
[2023-12-18T21:44:37] Paolo ⁭: Hard steel is better as screw
[2023-12-18T21:44:57] Paolo ⁭: Titanium and alu are just for weight
[2023-12-18T21:45:45] haku: i remember that was a thing 20yrs ago. i remember having magnesium oakleys 😂
[2023-12-18T21:48:12] haku: wtf i shouldve kept it it cost so much now. i think it was $80 back in the day
[2023-12-18T21:48:14] Mirono escooters: Thank you
[2023-12-18T22:16:31] haku: how can you guys tell its hardened steel compared to regular steel?
[2023-12-18T22:17:53] haku: are the black screws,bolts hardened?
[2023-12-18T22:19:38] Jan: There must be a label on it
[2023-12-18T22:19:43] Jan: Either 8.8 or 12.9
[2023-12-18T22:19:48] Jan: else its a crap bolt
[2023-12-18T22:24:55] haku: thank you
[2023-12-18T22:28:11] haku: is it the higher the number the harder it gets? this one says 4.8 its bolts for a squat rack
[2023-12-18T22:29:44] Jan: This is quite a soft one
[2023-12-18T22:29:45] Mirono escooters: Yes. But more "brittle"
[2023-12-18T22:30:02] Mirono escooters: Worst is it bends : D
[2023-12-18T22:30:04] Mirono escooters: And he upgrade
[2023-12-18T22:30:13] haku: i get it now. thanks fellas
[2023-12-18T22:30:18] Jan: This relation is called youngs modulus
[2023-12-18T22:30:43] Mirono escooters: What a D in Facebook vesc group. Tried my best to help, said I had same flipsky issue as him, guy tells ME I don't know what I'm talking about Like sorry mister, but YOU are the one asking for help😂😂
[2023-12-18T22:31:03] Mirono escooters: He can figure it out himself now Facebook..😂
[2023-12-18T22:31:18] Jan: Youngs modulus = stress/strain
[2023-12-18T22:31:32] Jan: Youngs modulus is fixed for the material
[2023-12-18T22:31:50] Jan: If it can endure more stress, it will break after less elongation
[2023-12-18T22:32:03] Jan: Basically it gets more brittle
[2023-12-18T22:32:44] Mirono escooters: Have fun snapping 12.9 tho
[2023-12-18T22:32:50] Mirono escooters: But for safety, I'd actually recommend a bending bolt xD
[2023-12-18T22:33:05] Jan: Steel 210GPA Titanium 115GPA Aluminum 70GPA Magnesium 45GPA
[2023-12-18T22:33:43] haku: i dont know what that is but thank you
[2023-12-18T22:33:47] Jan: Steel is just a stronger material in total but you can make titanium also endure the same stress but it will fracture so brittle
[2023-12-18T22:34:10] Mirono escooters: And there is a bazillion types of steel
[2023-12-18T22:34:17] Jan: I would also google ultimate tensile strength
[2023-12-18T22:34:25] Jan: You need both to determine
[2023-12-18T22:34:31] Mirono escooters: And the curve, it's really fascinating
[2023-12-18T22:34:50] Mirono escooters: What was it again, permanently lengthening some type of steel made it better
[2023-12-18T22:34:55] Mirono escooters: I forgot wich🤦
[2023-12-18T22:34:56] haku: jeez this is another dimension in engineering
[2023-12-18T22:35:14] Mirono escooters: The class you don't regret taking is material science
[2023-12-18T22:36:55] haku: need to be humble when asking for help. i always teach this to my kid. beggars cant be choosers
[2023-12-18T22:38:48] Mirono escooters: Well, him telling me "you dont know what you are talking about" was the final drop
[2023-12-18T22:39:03] Mirono escooters: There's a reason he's on Facebook and not here 😀
[2023-12-19T00:01:00] Oreo huzky: The Indians got new vesc?
[2023-12-19T00:01:01] Oreo huzky: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeNa5FJ7/
[2023-12-19T00:13:35] haku: nah that is a viet not indian
[2023-12-19T00:22:35] haku: i wonder how it performs and if its affordable
[2023-12-19T00:23:15] Oreo huzky: Ye same same
[2023-12-19T00:23:47] Oreo huzky: Yes could be nice to see if it’s alternative to c350 it says it is 84v 200A
[2023-12-19T00:25:19] haku: how many mosfet is the c350?
[2023-12-19T00:25:46] Oreo huzky: 12 mosfet why you ask?
[2023-12-19T00:26:35] haku: just wondering. im new to vesc stuff and thats how i tell if good or not 😂
[2023-12-19T00:26:57] Oreo huzky: Nah that’s not really an indicator if good or bad
[2023-12-19T00:27:15] Oreo huzky: Flipsky 75300 also has 12 mosfet
[2023-12-19T00:27:27] haku: i see.
[2023-12-19T00:27:28] Oreo huzky: And flipsky popo
[2023-12-19T00:29:02] haku: in my head more mosfets is better 6/12/18...
[2023-12-19T00:29:17] haku: noob thinking
[2023-12-19T00:31:51] Oreo huzky: Well in a way it is better but its more of like all parts together if they are all somewhat good and reliable
[2023-12-19T01:20:51] Happy Giraffe: It was more likely a conversation opener that there are different places and opinions😁
[2023-12-19T01:23:42] Happy Giraffe: Lmao I had to see it😅
[2023-12-19T01:24:43] Happy Giraffe: All he had to say was "Im not sure if its that but I will try thanks"
[2023-12-19T01:26:36] Paolo ⁭: 75300 18 mosfet
[2023-12-19T01:43:35] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that is Thailand not Indian, and isn't the 3shul brand
[2023-12-19T04:01:07] haku: aluminum alloy is it different than aluminum? can aluminum alloy be welded?
[2023-12-19T04:05:10] haku: also is the g30 frame aluminum or aluminum alloy?
[2023-12-19T04:21:47] haku: thanks
[2023-12-19T04:25:55] haku: no worries. thanks though
[2023-12-19T04:36:58] haku: i tested most of the stainless steel stuff i have fork, knives etc. it seems to be magnetic. are you sure ss is not magnetic?
[2023-12-19T04:43:48] haku: its about 6.8kilos or 15lbs
[2023-12-19T04:48:34] Paolo ⁭: @Bradhaku
[2023-12-19T04:49:00] haku: thanks bud
[2023-12-19T04:49:13] Paolo ⁭: It's magnetic but less than normal steel, because it has less steel
[2023-12-19T04:50:04] haku: my son wondering why im sticking magnets and scratching metals. i hope he doesnt think dads a crackhead 😭
[2023-12-19T06:39:53] Oreo huzky: Oh bruh
[2023-12-19T06:40:10] Oreo huzky: My bad
[2023-12-19T07:15:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: hello, 100% of things are Aluminum Alloy , the aluminum in natural can vu used to do anything, it's oxyde but you have many alloy some weldable other not
[2023-12-19T07:18:59] Yamal: Raphael, morning , how is your Nami how is everything, I just listen you are in new proyect, I hope everything is okay machine‼️ greetings from Spain
[2023-12-19T07:48:42] Mirono escooters: Oh, I blocked him already😀
[2023-12-19T08:01:46] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11628@19-12-2023_08-01-46.jpg>
[2023-12-19T08:01:49] Mirono escooters: What a chonker
[2023-12-19T08:02:06] Mirono escooters: It looks, for once, actually well build
[2023-12-19T08:03:18] Mirono escooters: Isolated stepdown, many caps, tolt, 2usbc? Bluetooth, some relays I have no idea what they for, ...
[2023-12-19T08:12:23] haku: what is it?
[2023-12-19T08:19:34] Mirono escooters: Their new vesc
[2023-12-19T08:35:26] Konstantin: Tronic logo
[2023-12-19T08:35:42] haku: tronic? nvm i see the logo. dam those copper
[2023-12-19T08:38:13] Yamal: Where?
[2023-12-19T08:38:36] Yamal: Ah yes ..
[2023-12-19T08:39:14] Yamal: I just have Tronic 250,! No is the bigger but still amazing
[2023-12-19T08:39:18] Yamal: <sticker>
[2023-12-19T08:40:25] haku: if they price this at $300 it can compete
[2023-12-19T08:41:28] haku: how many mosfets under those copper heatsinks?
[2023-12-19T09:08:33] Konstantin: <photos/photo_11629@19-12-2023_09-08-33.jpg>
[2023-12-19T09:39:15] Face de Pin Sucé: 550USD without tax and shipping
[2023-12-19T09:58:39] Jesús: buy yourself some😎
[2023-12-19T10:00:33] Mirono escooters: I fail to see the point of the busbar
[2023-12-19T10:00:39] Mirono escooters: 300?? For tolt? No
[2023-12-19T10:01:56] Jesús: $550 is the x12 the x54 is priceless yet
[2023-12-19T10:06:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Hi, my Nami are good, yes I work on others projects but I can't talk about it, yes everything is OK 😉👌
[2023-12-19T10:31:44] Happy Giraffe: Should be very little to none magnetic. Tho there are different kinds of SS. All I use is non magnetic😂
[2023-12-19T10:58:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ no why would he sell such😅😅🙈
[2023-12-19T10:58:41] Unknown: My motor is chocking out at the start of each ride (if I turn off and on the vesc ) what is the fix ?
[2023-12-19T10:58:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No idea , kugoo m4 as i said
[2023-12-19T11:02:10] Mirono escooters: What do you mean, if you turn off and on the vesc
[2023-12-19T11:02:22] Mirono escooters: You mean cutout?
[2023-12-19T11:05:06] Gabe Enzo: In my dreams I do not see a hunk of steel cracking like that
[2023-12-19T11:06:39] sombre_enfant: Same
[2023-12-19T11:26:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah will never
[2023-12-19T11:28:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure coz top makes different sound
[2023-12-19T11:28:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But not alu
[2023-12-19T11:30:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also hope for not chinesium what i mean here is magnetic but non mig or stick sticks on coz material🙈 Older replacement metal fender for pro2 had such
[2023-12-19T11:32:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Steel rarely do such ,this is just casted alu
[2023-12-19T11:43:43] Unknown: Like not every time that I accelerate but only the first acceleration of the run cycle
[2023-12-19T11:50:39] Mirono escooters: Motor too cold?
[2023-12-19T11:52:55] Unknown: Can that affect the motor ?
[2023-12-19T11:53:24] Unknown: By the way me English is not the best to put it lightly
[2023-12-19T11:53:34] Mirono escooters: Yes, we discussed recently, with colder weather we all get stutter, until it is a little warmer
[2023-12-19T11:53:48] Mirono escooters: It's only a idea tho. It's weird, it would happen when you turn off on
[2023-12-19T11:55:29] Gabe Enzo: What prick.
[2023-12-19T11:57:05] Unknown: Like the motor don't know whare is the magnets happened to me when the sun was out (it's not cold in my country yet) and it's started happening (or happened a lot more) when I switched to an hybrid tyre (like road and off road)
[2023-12-19T12:09:55] Mirono escooters: Saturation? (But still. Can't be it) I would think, a bad connection on hall wires
[2023-12-19T12:10:01] Mirono escooters: Redo detection, I guess
[2023-12-19T12:25:13] Unknown: Maybe
[2023-12-19T12:40:55] Mirono escooters: Is my best guess, since a different tire shouldn't do anything
[2023-12-19T12:41:05] Mirono escooters: Except the work around it A: redo Cali B: try sensorless
[2023-12-19T13:37:07] haku: me too poor to afford made in USA 😢
[2023-12-19T13:42:19] haku: thats common in light weight car rims. it cracks like that
[2023-12-19T14:02:31] haku: x54 means 54 mosfets??
[2023-12-19T14:04:10] haku: i remember the ez components guy saying something like that.
[2023-12-19T14:09:22] Mirono escooters: I hope, finally
[2023-12-19T14:09:30] Mirono escooters: Tolt
[2023-12-19T14:10:38] haku: thats made for ebikes for sure. just too big for scooter if 54 mosfets
[2023-12-19T14:11:10] Gabe Enzo: instead of more fets why don't they just make bigger fets
[2023-12-19T14:11:17] haku: something to really power q273
[2023-12-19T14:12:18] Mirono escooters: Non
[2023-12-19T14:12:22] Mirono escooters: It's tiny mos. But many
[2023-12-19T14:12:30] Mirono escooters: Can't compare to like toll or to220
[2023-12-19T14:12:37] Mirono escooters: Loads of issues with that
[2023-12-19T14:12:41] haku: oh wow
[2023-12-19T14:13:33] haku: amy better come up with 108 mosfet spintend quick
[2023-12-19T14:14:32] Mirono escooters: I doubt spintend will touch tolt
[2023-12-19T14:20:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha
[2023-12-19T14:20:45] Mirono escooters: O whoat
[2023-12-19T14:20:53] Mirono escooters: Barely the specs of them tho?
[2023-12-19T14:21:06] Mirono escooters: And multilayer, forgor
[2023-12-19T14:29:12] Mirono escooters: Concept so good

[2023-12-19T14:34:35] puneDir: thanks i buy it according to your suggestion
[2023-12-19T14:34:41] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-12-19T14:34:45] puneDir: but guess whats missing
[2023-12-19T14:34:49] Mirono escooters: Uh
[2023-12-19T14:35:35] puneDir: scooter xd
[2023-12-19T14:40:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Shit made rims crack
[2023-12-19T14:41:32] Mirono escooters: Or thundercunting into a sidewalk at 69kmh
[2023-12-19T14:43:10] haku: its common in racing rims.
[2023-12-19T14:46:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's other story
[2023-12-19T14:46:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What kind of race
[2023-12-19T14:46:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But also other story
[2023-12-19T14:46:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Never saw a good bbs broken in normal use
[2023-12-19T14:48:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Same with keskin🤷‍♂
[2023-12-19T14:49:48] haku: rays te37. ive seen these crack.
[2023-12-19T14:50:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Good to hear about you ,for a sec we thought you to famous now 🤣🤣❤️
[2023-12-19T14:51:16] haku: maybe fake clones though lol
[2023-12-19T14:51:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Describe choking ,is it a sound? Like knocking from inside ,could you record a video maybe?
[2023-12-19T14:52:38] Gabe Enzo: you mean conking out? it's probably just saturated.
[2023-12-19T14:53:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Reallly depends on usage like as Miro said ,if you hit it to something it can crack ,but from the power of acceleration etc never should happen , also if race than they might be less thick than Street version coz of weight
[2023-12-19T15:19:28] Unknown: It doesn't happen in the air only under load but not too much load since it is happening without a rider on the scooter even
[2023-12-19T16:28:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_11632@19-12-2023_16-28-59.jpg>

[2023-12-19T16:31:58] Happy Giraffe: Error codes?
[2023-12-19T16:34:45] Unknown: Next time it'll happen I'll check and update
[2023-12-19T16:55:59] Jhinzuo ~~: No worked for me every time is the server running on the PC or other device
[2023-12-19T16:58:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: haha, no i am not, I just won 2 races, let's see next season, will have more challenge and challengers 💪
[2023-12-19T17:23:41] Mirono escooters: bridge is too handy
[2023-12-19T17:35:59] Gabe Enzo: should 10m nickel be enough for 20s7p @Mirono_escooters
[2023-12-19T17:36:47] Gabe Enzo: 0.15mm X 8mm. Not gonna push more than Meh maybe 5kw.
[2023-12-19T17:36:54] Gabe Enzo: I just ordered a 3L wildman don't think I need new 10awg wires I can just use 2x14awg.
[2023-12-19T17:39:27] Mirono escooters: Depends the layout and how many layers
[2023-12-19T17:39:41] Mirono escooters: That's a idea
[2023-12-19T17:40:01] Gabe Enzo: Compact honey no spacers. straight layer
[2023-12-19T17:43:56] Gabe Enzo: New tube definitely needed 🤣🤣
[2023-12-19T17:47:46] Gabe Enzo: Straight here but bent in the other pic. Very sus.... Cop or not?
[2023-12-19T17:47:46] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11635@19-12-2023_17-47-46.jpg>
[2023-12-19T17:48:07] Jhinzuo ~~: It's bent on both pics
[2023-12-19T17:48:40] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11636@19-12-2023_17-48-40.jpg>
[2023-12-19T17:48:53] Gabe Enzo: It should be this way and bent this way. It's bent in the wrong direction It has to bend outward
[2023-12-19T17:53:32] Gabe Enzo: These are correct but they're 10x2.5 but shouldn't be an issue I believe again same on the other pics it's the same story with the tip facing a different way in the video. What the fuck
[2023-12-19T18:07:39] Ion: I'd recommend CST 10x2 tubes, fit well even for 10x3 and have correct valve placement
[2023-12-19T18:11:43] Mirono escooters: Goh, 10m should be enough
[2023-12-19T18:12:00] Mirono escooters: You mean 1 long nickel? Buy the precut, save you time and make it nice
[2023-12-19T18:13:24] Gabe Enzo: you mean the zigzag precut?
[2023-12-19T18:13:34] Gabe Enzo: I'm excited as fk to do this project man
[2023-12-19T18:18:34] Gabe Enzo: Nice catch. The nickel roll was steel too. Little fuckers.

[2023-12-19T19:56:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Last year no rules on voltage, this year is 22S max
[2023-12-19T19:56:48] Face de Pin Sucé: But scooter on video is only 20S x)

[2023-12-19T20:14:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They should have defined and unlimited
[2023-12-19T20:15:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And this is what I mean,more category could mean more ppl racing
[2023-12-19T20:17:03] haku: is there a huge jump in power from 20s to 22s?
[2023-12-19T20:17:28] Gabe Enzo: What are the version names?
[2023-12-19T20:19:04] haku: 10% in a race can make or break it. but its also additional weight
[2023-12-19T20:42:47] Thierry: Same issue few hours ago

[2023-12-19T21:29:51] Izuna 生活: good that I made a no temp firmware... 💀
[2023-12-19T21:30:34] Izuna 生活: At the end of this week I will open it back up and do some fixing... And prepare for France.
[2023-12-19T21:31:26] Paolo ⁭: Just get a second scooter for wet condition
[2023-12-19T21:39:07] Izuna 生活: Yeah... I have... But not here.

[2023-12-19T22:54:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All is in that type what you showed Before you ask
[2023-12-19T22:55:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For what reason mate? Also why alone?
[2023-12-19T22:55:55] Izuna 生活: Because I have a free interrail ticket for 6 days within one month.
[2023-12-19T22:56:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Would be cool 😁
[2023-12-19T22:56:33] Izuna 生活: "won" it (eh I cheated but whatever).
[2023-12-19T22:56:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe one day you visit me
[2023-12-19T22:57:12] Izuna 生活: Haha. Where you from?
[2023-12-19T22:57:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Budapest, Hungary
[2023-12-19T22:58:33] Oreo huzky: Make scoot water tight will be wet in France i would guess
[2023-12-19T22:58:53] Izuna 生活: Yeah I will try again and also taking ESCs with me 😂
[2023-12-19T22:59:51] Oreo huzky: Bruh
[2023-12-19T23:00:23] Izuna 生活: But I won't drive that much, probably only to go to the next shop and around the city. Paris I will walk, too many people probably.
[2023-12-19T23:00:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well🙈🙈 if you ever make it here and you dont sort it till than ,i help you😁 My original daily job is to keep water out
[2023-12-19T23:01:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i would prefer spring ,so we could scoot and woman wear less clothes😁
[2023-12-19T23:02:05] Jhinzuo ~~: I love Hungary been there so often with my parents I always go here in summer
[2023-12-19T23:02:22] Jhinzuo ~~: Hungary girls in summer are so pretty 👀
[2023-12-19T23:02:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cool ,let me know if you are coming
[2023-12-19T23:02:45] Izuna 生活: Can't wait for spring/summer, so tired of cold weather already.
[2023-12-19T23:02:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats true we have a lot beautiful woman
[2023-12-19T23:03:18] Happy Giraffe: Gives me joy when printer does a 100% perfect flawless print😂
[2023-12-19T23:04:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont mind talking about it but should do it in off chat Btw earlier some ppl were here already just to meet up and have fun like Denis Yurev
[2023-12-19T23:06:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What's that the end of the chargerbox thingy?
[2023-12-19T23:08:01] Jhinzuo ~~: @Her0DasH ye ur right it's better suited for off topic. Do you know fonyód by chance? that's the village we always stay at
[2023-12-19T23:20:15] puneDir: plan changed now im going for 2x 50h zero 10x motors
[2023-12-19T23:27:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sure I know
[2023-12-19T23:30:12] Mirono escooters: The European thing??
[2023-12-19T23:31:02] Mirono escooters: To France? Voluntarily??
[2023-12-19T23:33:19] Izuna 生活: I don't want the ticket to go to waste and I have some time for myself + new year in france. Also the hotel was cheap af
[2023-12-19T23:35:12] Izuna 生活: Yes. The ticket costs like 200€ normal and I have it for free.
[2023-12-19T23:36:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Are you from Germany? Also how old? Do you know that we have new bike path from the capital to the lake ,also bike path around it ,some us already did that too
[2023-12-19T23:37:33] Izuna 生活: pretty neat
[2023-12-19T23:38:27] Izuna 生活: Ah actually, mine is a little better, it's 7 days. But I won't stay that long anyway and I doubt I'm going to take the train every day.
[2023-12-19T23:42:02] Izuna 生活: Tomorrow I will see if the scooter runs again, otherwise it's time to walk 3-4km to the train station xd
[2023-12-19T23:42:39] Yamal: Visit fastride! Hehe
[2023-12-19T23:45:42] Yamal: Holland, still okay now for e-scooter? Or no can ride yet ? Anybody know ?
[2023-12-19T23:46:05] Mirono escooters: How the F?
[2023-12-19T23:46:17] Jhinzuo ~~: I did ride already lots and seen couple people with xiaomi's as well
[2023-12-19T23:46:20] Mirono escooters: I forgot to even participate🤦
[2023-12-19T23:46:50] Mirono escooters: You trust to leave scoot there for so long?
[2023-12-19T23:47:04] Jhinzuo ~~: But only in Venlo because that's close to me 😅
[2023-12-19T23:47:15] Mirono escooters: I was gonna spend new year at sea. Till friends cancelled. Now, I'm alone 🤦😶
[2023-12-19T23:48:05] Izuna 生活: No, I go to school. I'm going to France on new year.
[2023-12-19T23:49:26] Izuna 生活: There was a contest, the first 20k or smth who are the first to claim to get the ticket. And since I'm a hacker man I was somehow able to access the registration page before anyone else. Also due to the huge demand on their server and a lot of flaws with their registration process it was a disaster. But I got my ticket so I'm happy. 😂
[2023-12-19T23:52:21] Izuna 生活: I'm using code server.
[2023-12-19T23:52:23] Izuna 生活: Works great.
[2023-12-19T23:53:11] Izuna 生活: With code server no issues at all.
[2023-12-19T23:53:48] Jhinzuo ~~: Yes Germany also im 25. Damn no didn't know sounds awesome to ride 🙈
[2023-12-20T00:06:56] Mirono escooters: Lucky you, such a cool opportunity
[2023-12-20T00:07:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,i would not force scooting in a big city, but ebike can be done, weed is also illegal but you can smoke it 😅🙈 Also in my language is the same as you said but it's not Correct locals would be pissed no calling it Nl
[2023-12-20T00:12:23] Yamal: No can ride ..
[2023-12-20T00:12:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I was guessing Germany ,coz you know too much from the lake 😁 even wrote city name correctly. And you possible know but kinda easy to be a German there , everything is written out, most of the seller ppl speaks it ,this was like this 20-30 years ago also. Age question was near you interest, few cities above there is huge night life near the beach , that's the capital off the area like that ,rest of the cities more calm
[2023-12-20T00:12:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: By law you cant
[2023-12-20T00:13:30] Yamal: ….👍
[2023-12-20T00:19:18] Jhinzuo ~~: Ye the problem is in Holland scooters without a seat aren't allowed they gotta change law but that's something that takes ages
[2023-12-20T00:22:29] Mirono escooters: Mmhm
[2023-12-20T00:22:44] Jhinzuo ~~: Yess on my first stay I was surprised how many germans I met. I only remember Siofok right now where I was in a night club 😅 we usually buy alcohol and drink at the house we rent
[2023-12-20T00:23:00] Jhinzuo ~~: How dis work
[2023-12-20T00:23:18] Mirono escooters: Not good 🤪
[2023-12-20T00:31:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yep Siófok the city i ment ,imagine a local youth ,being suprised that more ppl speaks other languages than the local. I dunno how it's now , but there were few bigger night clubs and rest is at the beach , different fun, but areas like that are near full off girls is policemagnet also
[2023-12-20T00:32:33] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters @punedir the 300w is officially roasted :)
[2023-12-20T00:33:13] Gabe Enzo: The spintend is alive and well. Absolutely amazing. Thanks @LizardDoggo for recommending me this Monster.
[2023-12-20T00:38:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: So server is dead?
[2023-12-20T00:40:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_11644@20-12-2023_00-40-09.jpg>
[2023-12-20T00:40:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: Server is responding to ping
[2023-12-20T00:45:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: I can do as well if you want to
[2023-12-20T00:51:55] Gabe Enzo: Summer and scooting around the girls.
[2023-12-20T00:52:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is there any docker to deploy or something?
[2023-12-20T00:52:43] Gabe Enzo: Always need a scooter strong enough to carry girlie on the back incase they ask for a ride
[2023-12-20T01:01:00] Gabe Enzo: @kawaiinekololis I got a quick question for you in dms
[2023-12-20T02:16:18] Happy Giraffe: A friendly reminder this is a troubleshooting room mainly, for other stuff vesc talk is the place
[2023-12-20T02:53:32] Tommy ª: inovation ☠️😭
[2023-12-20T03:13:00] Gabe Enzo: Guys we gotta go out racing gastards more often. These trolls need to get humbled.
[2023-12-20T03:13:06] Gabe Enzo: So much hate online.
[2023-12-20T04:25:56] Chris Culver: I have a vsett 10+, do I want to choose...large outrunner? Or what
[2023-12-20T04:27:26] Chris Culver: Ok also how do I turn on Bluetooth? Spintend Ubox v2
[2023-12-20T04:27:59] Chris Culver: Nrf or uart
[2023-12-20T04:32:06] Happy Giraffe: If using like a special rear hub for bike you could actually mount an extra sprocket on the disc side Or like Surron hub where you can put a beefy (even double so one for pedal one for motor) chain on the right side
[2023-12-20T04:32:19] Happy Giraffe: So many wild possibilities
[2023-12-20T04:33:44] Chris Culver: 120mm wheel diameter (w/tire?) ?
[2023-12-20T04:34:00] Chris Culver: Errr 240
[2023-12-20T04:37:23] Chris Culver: Or is it measured without tire
[2023-12-20T04:37:36] Chris Culver: No, why would it be
[2023-12-20T04:43:49] Chris Culver: Kk here goes
[2023-12-20T04:46:06] Chris Culver: Woah shit. Cool!
[2023-12-20T04:47:46] Chris Culver: Hmmm I thought my motors were sensored
[2023-12-20T04:48:28] Chris Culver: Vsett 10+, aftermarket battery
[2023-12-20T04:48:34] Tommy ª: bruh that is the starter motor of my bike, it draws more amps than the battery can produce 😭
[2023-12-20T04:49:21] Chris Culver: Oh heh I guess I need to plug the sensors in. Woops
[2023-12-20T04:51:31] Happy Giraffe: Those QS138 mid drives looking tasty af. Cant wait to fiddle with them later on. Also to use the advantage of chainspeed and gear ratios for higher kv motors and therefore more torque at less heat🤔
[2023-12-20T05:29:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: <photos/photo_11647@20-12-2023_05-29-56.jpg>
[2023-12-20T05:30:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 2024 date is that, and for watching the race I don't know yet if someone will make a live, let's see at this moment
[2023-12-20T05:31:36] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no problem for that, even 3 girls it's fine 😂
[2023-12-20T05:54:57] haku: yep im that guy
[2023-12-20T05:55:20] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: You bought Tesla?
[2023-12-20T05:56:07] haku: ive had one for a bit. i just parked at a gas station pump since couldnt get parking
[2023-12-20T05:57:06] haku: drove 4 hours to legoland
[2023-12-20T06:01:18] haku: california gas 😭
[2023-12-20T06:39:29] haku: while full charge $18 😂
[2023-12-20T07:08:26] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: because they want to limit the evolution of power when they know we already are at 35kW for legal and safety reason, and even after explained multiples time that the S not determine the Power they think limiting the S will limit the power... they are not capable to understand basic P=UI 🤷
[2023-12-20T07:33:37] haku: how about amps? is unlimited power??
[2023-12-20T07:34:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: No amp limit, 35kW limit but they can't verified it at all
[2023-12-20T07:35:41] haku: wow just like the early days of mma when steroids was a thing.
[2023-12-20T07:36:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: haha 😂, yeah but so I said to the organization if they really want to determine the max power how to do they don't listen me
[2023-12-20T07:36:45] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: the only way is to fix the max length and diameter of stator motor
[2023-12-20T07:36:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: physically disassembly and check for the competition
[2023-12-20T07:37:24] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's comparable with the cylinder volume in motor, like 1000cc
[2023-12-20T07:37:39] haku: agreed.
[2023-12-20T07:39:05] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: then, let's see how many steroid are used next season 😂
[2023-12-20T07:39:23] haku: 😂
[2023-12-20T07:39:46] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: In my case I will still performing with my drive and small motor
[2023-12-20T07:40:24] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: maybe I will use some rocket 🚀 in my back as a booster
[2023-12-20T07:40:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: isn't write in the rules is not legit
[2023-12-20T08:00:08] puneDir: :(
[2023-12-20T08:00:18] puneDir: time for good motor
[2023-12-20T08:37:26] haku: is this a good deal?

[2023-12-20T11:55:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on size and weight 🤣
[2023-12-20T11:57:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In my eyes all eyes are crap😁
[2023-12-20T12:02:14] haku: i was gonna recommend to my nephew.😄

[2023-12-20T12:58:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But main parts dont really fail and the rest repairable

[2023-12-20T13:44:11] Gabe Enzo: Get him a pro 2 or G30
[2023-12-20T13:44:15] Gabe Enzo: best.
[2023-12-20T13:44:50] Happy Giraffe: That's really cheap if you can get like 250-300 miles out it

[2023-12-20T16:01:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Have to take a second look or less "fog" needed when looking at it😅
[2023-12-20T16:20:07] Gabe Enzo: what's the max wattage one can pull from molicels if no copper is used?
[2023-12-20T16:20:12] Gabe Enzo: Pure nickel tho
[2023-12-20T16:38:45] haku: i had to go to a gas station mini mart and use the bathroom for me and my son. buy some water and food. fast charging stations still dont have those.
[2023-12-20T16:40:41] haku: the old models thats very common. but these model y's are pretty decent. i still cant work on them though
[2023-12-20T16:47:35] Mirono escooters: Uh weird🙈
[2023-12-20T16:47:53] Mirono escooters: You can stack like 10 layers of nickel and be fine
[2023-12-20T16:47:55] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-12-20T16:48:14] haku: sorry that was what im trying to say like $6 a gallon. full tank for a sedan is $70 and ev is like $18
[2023-12-20T17:03:03] Ion: If I were to put 2 different tires on a scooter (10+), should front or rear be the better one (1 pmt and 1 cst, both same size)
[2023-12-20T17:06:47] Tommy ª: bruh that dont work here 😭
[2023-12-20T17:07:00] Gabe Enzo: the one with the motor.

[2023-12-20T17:16:54] Rose: Hey there Guillermo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-20T17:20:50] sombre_enfant: Front
[2023-12-20T17:25:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends which drive scoot you have
[2023-12-20T17:26:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohhh

[2023-12-20T17:27:47] Finn: Here its 1,97$
[2023-12-20T17:28:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Still would say , its a matter of terrain and weather and brake's also , in my case rn I would do front too
[2023-12-20T17:29:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure why , was fast for me ,went over pictures fast
[2023-12-20T17:31:14] Izuna 生活: In case someone ever runs into the issue that even though both ESCs are found via CAN-Scan, they don't sync with ADC App: On the newer beta these options are turned off, causing the ESCs not to sync. Enable Status 1-4.
[2023-12-20T17:32:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah 1,7 🙈
[2023-12-20T17:34:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I run into such problem not too long ago ,but different reason
[2023-12-20T17:37:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you manage to get it ,let us know, disc adapter is pretty nice
[2023-12-20T17:40:04] haku: gotcha. also 72v for a first scooter might be too much for the guy. good price for 72v though
[2023-12-20T17:48:27] Izuna 生活: Not really an issue. It is just turned off by default and I was like, oh no what is broke now
[2023-12-20T17:48:37] Izuna 生活: but it was just these options being turned off...
[2023-12-20T17:53:53] Izuna 生活: idk
[2023-12-20T17:53:55] Izuna 生活: i think
[2023-12-20T18:18:52] Happy Giraffe: I meant context for the russian norwegian shipping thing as I didnt have any whats it about
[2023-12-20T18:20:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hyra rear suspension for g30 amd disc adapter Both fancy
[2023-12-20T18:21:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if he manages it ,he is somebody who could help you get it if you are from the EU
[2023-12-20T18:36:04] Happy Giraffe: @PaoloWu How conductive is PETG-CF? Is it ok to put a plug like this AC230v near it?
[2023-12-20T18:36:43] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_11654@20-12-2023_18-36-43.jpg>
[2023-12-20T18:37:52] Gabe Enzo: Carbon is only conductive in Graphene Form no?
[2023-12-20T18:37:57] Happy Giraffe: I think I put thin silicone layer on the PETG CF wall near this but wonder if its safe. I dont plan on pluggin it in with live 230v but if some kid or other person takes it out in middle of charging
[2023-12-20T18:38:28] Happy Giraffe: I'm not sure about that so that's why I ask. Havent done any research on the matter😁
[2023-12-20T18:56:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure how you mean near it ,but should not a be a problem, also i dont it's conductive , test it
[2023-12-20T19:46:26] Happy Giraffe: I don't have the equipment for testing other than getting ac shocked with my fingers😂
[2023-12-20T19:47:57] Happy Giraffe: It won't be removed under normal situation but if some idiot plugs it out I don't want my bike to burn. The idiot might get shocked but hey life's not fair
[2023-12-20T19:54:50] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/ReyHaqTUJzc?si=t0QRYTFKbdWRyVIY
[2023-12-20T19:59:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, all is basically secure, nothing should happen
[2023-12-20T19:59:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Way far from this

[2023-12-20T22:33:20] Chris Culver: On spintend Ubox v2, is there power to the "light" socket as long as the unit is on?
[2023-12-20T22:40:21] Chris Culver: Why
[2023-12-20T22:40:26] Chris Culver: Oh ok
[2023-12-20T22:40:32] Chris Culver: What about brake
[2023-12-20T22:40:59] Chris Culver: Err rather what can I use that is outputting 12v all the time
[2023-12-20T22:42:07] Chris Culver: Fan only? Heh
[2023-12-20T22:42:07] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Chris has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-20T22:55:11] Chris Culver: That's it?
[2023-12-20T22:55:58] Chris Culver: Where is it getting the input for the brakes
[2023-12-20T22:59:23] Happy Giraffe: Im yet to see the 100 gallon extinquishers and a co2 cannon
[2023-12-20T23:10:19] Happy Giraffe: Fusion starting to be buggy, need to export STL files twice in order to complete🙈 Fuking cloud based I want to use the muscle of my PC and not some Intel Pentium server😡
[2023-12-20T23:29:11] Gabe Enzo: @PaoloWu keep that 3kw motor for me I'm begging you
[2023-12-20T23:33:32] Happy Giraffe: Now Ender 3 S1P printer going 100mm/s, poor old boy but lets see the quality😂
[2023-12-20T23:46:38] Gabe Enzo: Has anyone had luck with 20s4p inside a 3L with honeycomb or is My dream out of reach?
[2023-12-20T23:46:58] Gabe Enzo: can't go with 4L Now
[2023-12-20T23:47:03] Gabe Enzo: already got 3l
[2023-12-21T00:21:38] Gabe Enzo: @PaoloWu
[2023-12-21T02:26:49] haku: new g30 or this badboy 😂
[2023-12-21T02:34:00] haku: consumerism has gotten out of hand
[2023-12-21T02:35:43] haku: told my son we can print a bigger one
[2023-12-21T04:25:44] Happy Giraffe: Lesson for life is never buy Lego at full price😂
[2023-12-21T04:28:07] Happy Giraffe: Gonna power the heated vest from handlebar usb port and have magnetic cable if I crash or fall😁 No more annoying cold winter mornings
[2023-12-21T04:44:36] Happy Giraffe: Bruh my moto jacket is so tight it cant fit a proper layer underneath :D Also I want to test out the crazy solutions I might have in mind
[2023-12-21T04:45:24] Happy Giraffe: Btw soon first maiden test of the mounted charger and its heat shedding capabilities😁
[2023-12-21T05:12:22] Happy Giraffe: When closing circuit with the button😁 Its weird as its silent now. Too bad I dont have anu thermo meter other than for human temperature😂 Alu box gets warm but not smoking hot as it seems to dissipate heat quick enough and it has a mass of around 500gram and lot of surface area🤔 Circuit open now, if voltage doesnt drop more than 0.1v in 8-10 hours it is a success I would say

[2023-12-21T12:27:10] Gabe Enzo: Well I would need the copper sheet with me here to measure resistance 💀
[2023-12-21T12:27:56] Mirono escooters: Shame no online calculators exist because copper doesn't have a given resistance per meter Oh wait
[2023-12-21T12:28:13] Gabe Enzo: I shouldn't have dropped physics in HS.

[2023-12-21T14:51:03] Mirono escooters: Btw this should fit
[2023-12-21T14:51:09] Mirono escooters: With some uggabuggas
[2023-12-21T14:52:05] puneDir: i gaved away my snsc suspension
[2023-12-21T14:53:05] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-12-21T15:09:04] puneDir: i gaved it to cengiz going to buy monorim so also proper motor on front also im going to order ubox next week
[2023-12-21T15:09:20] Gabe Enzo: What if I risk structural integrity? would you be able to walk me through?
[2023-12-21T15:10:39] Gabe Enzo: Oh shit, right!!!
[2023-12-21T15:11:48] Gabe Enzo: Bought this for no reason LOL
[2023-12-21T15:19:06] Mirono escooters: I've not done it in ages and hate monorim
[2023-12-21T15:19:18] Mirono escooters: I machined the spacers then sold whole scoot
[2023-12-21T15:19:25] Mirono escooters: Pro frame fit tho
[2023-12-21T15:19:29] Mirono escooters: Me was essential 🥰
[2023-12-21T15:19:33] puneDir: wish snsc was possible for 50h
[2023-12-21T15:19:44] puneDir: i need monofuck now
[2023-12-21T15:26:17] Happy Giraffe: Yeah haha, did that with the lights, I also dislike the spring systems so would need to solder nickel strip there as I dont have spot welder
[2023-12-21T16:23:32] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-12-21T16:23:38] Gabe Enzo: it looks weird
[2023-12-21T16:24:45] Mirono escooters: Its made for wheel. Not motor
[2023-12-21T16:24:47] Mirono escooters: Need mod
[2023-12-21T16:25:34] Gabe Enzo: Should I return it?
[2023-12-21T16:25:48] Gabe Enzo: In what way? I think drilling a hole is enough.
[2023-12-21T16:26:05] Mirono escooters: Ah yes, I love spinning axles
[2023-12-21T16:26:44] Gabe Enzo: Should be fine with a metal sanding knife right?
[2023-12-21T16:27:12] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-12-21T16:27:19] Gabe Enzo: To trim the metal to fit the axle
[2023-12-21T16:27:25] Mirono escooters: You need a torque washer or machine a torque hole
[2023-12-21T16:27:34] Mirono escooters: It's aluminum, and shit aluminum So problably
[2023-12-21T16:27:37] Mirono escooters: Recycled can aluminum
[2023-12-21T16:28:37] Gabe Enzo: seems like too much work. Is konyk for motors or will I have to do this cancer either way?
[2023-12-21T16:28:58] Mirono escooters: Konyk is easier to fit a torque washer so
[2023-12-21T16:29:35] Gabe Enzo: I can probably mod this suspension at a later date and just install one motor on the front right now.
[2023-12-21T16:29:42] Gabe Enzo: So much work to do
[2023-12-21T16:29:45] Gabe Enzo: and money to spend
[2023-12-21T16:30:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont hurt cans ,does from better alu
[2023-12-21T16:32:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's true but still needs lot work and he doesnt have any awd kit what has "solution" for that
[2023-12-21T16:37:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mostly they have 1% mg in it so pretty clean
[2023-12-21T16:40:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Xiaomi frame is dur alu ,they dont even try to recycle ,way to mg and other shit inside, to make it stronger,but would be really expensive to get it to "parts" molecularly , that's why airplane cemetery exist
[2023-12-21T16:53:25] puneDir: anybody extended front monorim for g30 (focused on higher ride height)
[2023-12-21T16:53:46] puneDir: @mrstealyogirI does your 800w motor fits to front
[2023-12-21T17:18:14] Mirono escooters: Longer spring?..
[2023-12-21T17:21:11] Happy Giraffe: If someone needs torque arms I can make those if you have dimensions and a drawing🌚
[2023-12-21T17:22:37] Mirono escooters: I forgot how I made my cheap Bluetooth. Fak
[2023-12-21T17:22:43] Mirono escooters: Let's re learn a skill
[2023-12-21T17:31:39] puneDir: esp
[2023-12-21T17:31:57] puneDir: <photos/photo_11667@21-12-2023_17-31-57.jpg>
[2023-12-21T17:32:03] puneDir: cant believe i have 50h
[2023-12-21T17:32:15] Gabe Enzo: what kw?
[2023-12-21T17:33:02] puneDir: idk
[2023-12-21T17:33:07] puneDir: kaabo wolf warrior x motor
[2023-12-21T17:33:18] puneDir: not something pretty common also according to the sealing and winding quality of this and zero 10x motor its safe to say g30 gen1 looks much more high quality and well engineered compared to these
[2023-12-21T17:33:45] Gabe Enzo: Hard to do dual in the future
[2023-12-21T17:34:33] puneDir: no i can find it but not so common in this group
[2023-12-21T19:28:42] puneDir: nevermind
[2023-12-21T19:32:00] Yamal: The happy night
[2023-12-21T20:15:54] haku: this is true. i have a ali heated jacket and ali diy powerbank its kinda sketchy. i dont know if the powerbank is the one heating up or the jacket 😂
[2023-12-21T20:17:19] haku: is that alu pcb too? looks exactly like spintend
[2023-12-21T20:19:31] haku: those tronics looks nice under there.
[2023-12-21T20:20:02] puneDir: yeah alupcb
[2023-12-21T20:20:54] haku: wow thats awsome. is it the same layout and design like 80/100 spintend?
[2023-12-21T20:21:21] puneDir: idk but probably no
[2023-12-21T20:21:25] puneDir: ubox 1000x better
[2023-12-21T20:22:30] haku: you never know. maybe its a ubox 1 to 1 clone
[2023-12-21T20:27:14] haku: when you say bushings you mean the washers? i dont have a monorim but i am intrested in his project
[2023-12-21T20:35:08] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2023-12-21T20:38:00] haku: just add washers?
[2023-12-21T20:38:17] sombre_enfant: Yes but large one, no sandwich
[2023-12-21T20:42:50] Mirono escooters: :( just machine a better spacer..
[2023-12-21T20:51:14] Gabe Enzo: Ironically it came with an extra long bolt. Bad news: I need two of them.
[2023-12-21T20:51:36] Gabe Enzo: It also came with bushings.
[2023-12-21T20:53:07] haku: why cant you just add thick washers?
[2023-12-21T20:53:08] Gabe Enzo: Ugh gonna have to spend cash on a bolt set. Another 12€ there.
[2023-12-21T20:53:19] Gabe Enzo: Thick washers are bushings
[2023-12-21T21:04:45] Gabe Enzo: Can 60h 22x3 hold 2.125 tyres or is it too wide? If so need to order 10x3 now
[2023-12-21T21:05:20] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_11669@21-12-2023_21-05-20.jpg>
[2023-12-21T21:05:53] Happy Giraffe: Will need to silicone vesc box shut then can remove the tapes and have cleaner look😂🙈
[2023-12-21T21:06:53] sombre_enfant: U going to mix 60h and 40h?
[2023-12-21T21:09:49] Gabe Enzo: Na im selling the 40h I already got a buyer.
[2023-12-21T21:10:11] Gabe Enzo: I'm going with single 60h for now. and buying another 60h in march for dual
[2023-12-21T21:13:55] sombre_enfant: We got electron dual motor before GTA6 thats crazy
[2023-12-21T21:18:22] Mirono escooters: I like to do things properly
[2023-12-21T21:19:29] sombre_enfant: <animation>
[2023-12-21T21:26:38] haku: nice. not too big 😊
[2023-12-21T21:28:23] Mirono escooters: It's been a while since I did questionable stuff
[2023-12-21T21:32:40] Gabe Enzo: character development here but same.
[2023-12-21T21:41:47] Mirono escooters: Character development xd
[2023-12-21T21:43:21] haku: hopefully this will give me unlimited burnouts. im not really a racer kinda guy.
[2023-12-21T21:48:21] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_11671@21-12-2023_21-48-21.jpg>
[2023-12-21T21:48:52] Happy Giraffe: Like that haha, for summer vesc box also will be alu. Now I dont wanna cool it too much
[2023-12-21T21:53:46] Gabe Enzo: Unlimited burnouts. Limited tyre money
[2023-12-21T21:55:17] haku: thats why im not planning on pmt. 😂
[2023-12-21T22:11:28] Happy Giraffe: Yes😂 now it reaches max 35°c so its perfect. No need for more cooling
[2023-12-21T22:12:02] Happy Giraffe: Also was easy to print the case. Next I try to CNC at school
[2023-12-21T23:37:26] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/PrrYBbjd9OU?si=X9gL6O3UCLHcqvAM
[2023-12-21T23:37:40] haku: now this is a cool china inovation
[2023-12-21T23:38:25] haku: is this amy from spintend?
[2023-12-22T00:16:50] Mirono escooters: I've seen this woman so many times with her surfboard
[2023-12-22T00:17:20] Mirono escooters: My friend builds those things. Extremely expensive, extremely fun
[2023-12-22T00:17:30] Mirono escooters: Mechanical Engineer btw, crazy stuff behind it
[2023-12-22T00:27:10] haku: this is an elecrtric motor yea? im sure you can go ham on the throttle because watercooled
[2023-12-22T00:27:30] Mirono escooters: Water-cooling adds like, 500% 😛
[2023-12-22T00:27:37] Mirono escooters: Tiny Escs
[2023-12-22T00:45:18] haku: size comparison if anyone cares.
[2023-12-22T00:46:39] Mirono escooters: The 200a is hefty
[2023-12-22T00:49:15] haku: it is. they did not bother with silicone idk why lol. the dual 100/100 has some
[2023-12-22T00:51:13] Paolo ⁭: Don't use the fuse if you have bmd
[2023-12-22T00:59:47] haku: whats bmd. sorry im a noob. spintend over sold me stuff
[2023-12-22T01:00:06] haku: bms?
[2023-12-22T01:00:39] Paolo ⁭: bms sorry
[2023-12-22T01:02:06] haku: amy. got me on that one 😂
[2023-12-22T01:25:57] Happy Giraffe: Sped up video but the way battery etc connection is handled is interesting
[2023-12-22T01:26:26] Happy Giraffe: Moving cold water to heatsink/spreader😳
[2023-12-22T01:41:30] francois schempers: had a little swipe issue 😂😂
[2023-12-22T01:45:36] Happy Giraffe: James at it again?
[2023-12-22T01:56:41] haku: dam im an idiot. i bought the left side 4 pison brakes
[2023-12-22T01:56:51] haku: when my scoot is right side
[2023-12-22T01:57:01] haku: <photos/photo_11674@22-12-2023_01-57-01.jpg>
[2023-12-22T01:57:16] haku: its ali brembo brakes
[2023-12-22T01:58:12] haku: is it possible to do a return on ali?
[2023-12-22T01:58:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-22T02:00:53] Happy Giraffe: Not sure if worth it, how much you paid for those? And how is the clearance from disc to the vehicle?
[2023-12-22T02:01:23] Happy Giraffe: I would need a very thin profile brakes to replace my rear shimano. Very tight spaces😅
[2023-12-22T02:01:51] haku: less than $100. and the clearance is similar with zoom
[2023-12-22T02:02:19] haku: i thought all ebikes scooters come standard on the right side
[2023-12-22T02:03:07] Happy Giraffe: Maybe could have bought them from you if you lived closer and tax+duty not needed😂
[2023-12-22T02:03:49] haku: for sure dude. i will sell it to you half off lol. but shipping and taxes will kill us both
[2023-12-22T02:04:48] haku: how do you tell if its left side brakes or right side. its very tricky
[2023-12-22T02:06:11] haku: sucks it comes with thick rotors too
[2023-12-22T03:21:00] Happy Giraffe: Have to watch picture and buy exact same😁
[2023-12-22T03:21:13] Happy Giraffe: How many mm thick?🤔
[2023-12-22T03:32:12] haku: i think 2mm
[2023-12-22T03:32:31] haku: thicker than my resin shimano
[2023-12-22T06:28:47] Yamal: <photos/photo_11675@22-12-2023_06-28-47.jpg>
[2023-12-22T06:41:46] haku: 24s thats badass
[2023-12-22T06:44:21] haku: the vesc express is what i want to see.
[2023-12-22T06:45:14] Tommy ª: ah sh*** i want
[2023-12-22T06:46:28] haku: i wonder how much it will be. that will be a dealbreaker if priced too high
[2023-12-22T06:46:47] Tommy ª: when your controller costs more than the battery 😭
[2023-12-22T06:51:27] haku: bleeding edge tech. i want vesc lords to play with this
[2023-12-22T07:38:31] haku: how do you guys fit 2 10awg wires into 1 8mm bullet? it looks like it wont fit
[2023-12-22T08:11:20] puneDir: put soldering iron in connector fill with solder wait for 10 seconds and insert the cable in wait 5 seconds and wait for solder gets cold
[2023-12-22T08:12:16] puneDir: if it doesnt fits use bigger bullet or remove some copper from tip of the cable
[2023-12-22T08:28:19] Jakub Szczypiór: <video_file>
[2023-12-22T08:28:22] Jakub Szczypiór: My 3shul cl350 just fucking exploded
[2023-12-22T08:28:39] Jakub Szczypiór: Only 150 phase amps
[2023-12-22T08:35:03] Yamal: Why?
[2023-12-22T08:39:04] Jakub Szczypiór: Idk, probably bad board
[2023-12-22T09:38:49] Rose: Hey there Ninebotextreme, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-22T10:57:38] Albert Rembisz: Hi, I have 75100 dual VESC from Flipsky. I added lisp script on 6.02 software to work with G30 dash, but only one motor is working (only this where dash is connected). How to make working both simultaneously by can?
[2023-12-22T11:24:05] Oreo huzky: me gusta
[2023-12-22T11:25:06] Oreo huzky: If you find out please let us know I have cl350 too and I don’t want it to break again
[2023-12-22T11:38:45] Yamal: ‼️😁
[2023-12-22T11:42:50] Oreo huzky: Ye
[2023-12-22T11:43:05] Oreo huzky: I don’t even know what that said
[2023-12-22T11:43:08] Oreo huzky: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeFR8NxX/
[2023-12-22T11:43:20] Oreo huzky: Would it fit on Xiaomi 1s?
[2023-12-22T11:47:10] Unknown: Hello guys Little question My vesc dont save trip on odometer, everytime After Power off my odometer reset. Any suggestion?
[2023-12-22T11:56:28] Gabe Enzo: it's not supposed to save. keep it on maybe?
[2023-12-22T11:56:36] Gabe Enzo: if you're doing telemetry testing
[2023-12-22T12:03:42] Unknown: Yes It not save
[2023-12-22T12:04:31] Unknown: Maybe bcs i restore vesc ti default parameter one time when i update firmware?
[2023-12-22T12:32:03] sombre_enfant: My vesc rebooted mid ride...
[2023-12-22T12:33:12] Unknown: 😅
[2023-12-22T12:38:08] puneDir: with 3d printed extender yes
[2023-12-22T12:51:52] francois schempers: found how ill do it, and it allow me to mount more powerfull light 👌
[2023-12-22T12:52:16] francois schempers: https://spintend.com/products/ewheel-adc-adapter-v2-for-diy-ebike-escooter
[2023-12-22T12:56:40] francois schempers: what does the logs file say ?
[2023-12-22T12:57:24] sombre_enfant: It rebooted no more log
[2023-12-22T12:57:47] Oreo huzky: I better mount two then to cancel out the torque twist
[2023-12-22T12:57:56] francois schempers: did you check ?
[2023-12-22T13:02:31] puneDir: fit to m365
[2023-12-22T13:03:25] francois schempers: try to ride while having the app connected, this way, when something happens, it stays in the phone's error log
[2023-12-22T13:05:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Asked our great Paolo can he get these 🤣back in time Looks bldc
[2023-12-22T13:08:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cant you swich sides ?
[2023-12-22T13:10:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did you used awd version of that?
[2023-12-22T13:13:38] Yamal: <video_file>
[2023-12-22T13:32:27] sombre_enfant: No not enough current, impossible
[2023-12-22T13:33:11] Gabe Enzo: I would kill myself.
[2023-12-22T13:34:19] Jakub Szczypiór: It worked fine before but when i charged my battery to around 120v it exploded almost instantly
[2023-12-22T13:34:41] Jakub Szczypiór: 3shul claims that it can handle 126v easily with regen
[2023-12-22T13:35:20] Jakub Szczypiór: V4
[2023-12-22T13:37:42] Jakub Szczypiór: Exactly
[2023-12-22T13:37:46] Jakub Szczypiór: Yup
[2023-12-22T13:40:23] sombre_enfant: Yes spintend
[2023-12-22T13:41:04] sombre_enfant: But how i got nothing connect to 5v or 12v
[2023-12-22T13:47:53] sombre_enfant: Yes but not possible
[2023-12-22T15:00:45] Unknown: Oh,Really? No way to save after reboot?

[2023-12-22T15:47:03] Happy Giraffe: Thats magura standard, TRP has some 2.3mm👍
[2023-12-22T15:49:13] Happy Giraffe: @kawaiinekololis He knows this stuff best, was there some special setting that was needed for awd?
[2023-12-22T16:24:07] Izuna 生活: 6.05 required.
[2023-12-22T16:28:13] Кирилл: Did you do fine tuning for your motor? What was your dead time dist value?
[2023-12-22T16:29:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Matrix hiccup ,he or some this to you days ago and you said the same thing or i saw the future 😁
[2023-12-22T16:32:49] Jakub Szczypiór: i spinned it with vesc arrows current controls and was acting normally
[2023-12-22T16:32:49] Jakub Szczypiór: don't remember now
[2023-12-22T16:38:00] haku: the latest batch of these spintend 85/200 uses 2x10awg when it used to be 12awg and the biggest bullet is only 8mm
[2023-12-22T16:39:30] haku: in the back yes but in the front i cannot unfortunately.😭
[2023-12-22T16:41:42] Кирилл: Is that euc you have?
[2023-12-22T17:17:35] Jakub Szczypiór: Yes
[2023-12-22T17:19:40] Кирилл: Thats bad, because 3shul doesnt have so much headroom for euc work. For 30s euc you need atleast maybe 160-200v headroom in esc.
[2023-12-22T17:20:16] Кирилл: 3shul (CL) is 135v
[2023-12-22T17:20:48] Jakub Szczypiór: I wasn’t even riding, just indoors with very limited power
[2023-12-22T17:22:26] Кирилл: No

[2023-12-22T17:27:46] Gabe Enzo: can't tap a new hole either cause it won't be straight anwyays
[2023-12-22T17:30:57] Кирилл: Just remove regen word
[2023-12-22T17:31:19] Gabe Enzo: need 20% voltage Headroom
[2023-12-22T17:31:24] Gabe Enzo: either way
[2023-12-22T17:32:12] Jakub Szczypiór: do you have data sheet for C350 cntroller?
[2023-12-22T17:32:14] Кирилл: Ninebot do 100% headroom

[2023-12-22T17:34:29] Jakub Szczypiór: are there some high voltage VESCs other than X12 tronic?
[2023-12-22T17:34:37] Gabe Enzo: define hV
[2023-12-22T17:34:38] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-12-22T17:34:49] Jakub Szczypiór: 30s with regen

[2023-12-22T18:00:47] Happy Giraffe: Need tronic x24 for QS138😁
[2023-12-22T18:01:17] Happy Giraffe: That thing eats current, even the 70H handles 400/700A😳😅

[2023-12-22T18:09:35] sombre_enfant: Thats nothing
[2023-12-22T18:10:19] Happy Giraffe: Kirill actually rode 30kw on street😁 You go out and do same😁 @roscheeee

[2023-12-22T18:14:22] Happy Giraffe: It's the same on air screenshot😂
[2023-12-22T18:17:50] Jan: For 10inch G30 its in acceptable range
[2023-12-22T18:20:57] Mirono escooters: Time to monitor batt and see if it really didn't cut
[2023-12-22T18:22:55] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/nlljQgT6MV8?si=ca2d9-51vKMyJT-i Yup, 30kw is plenty power. This clip from far driver esc. With vesc MTPA should be even more of a monster
[2023-12-22T18:24:01] Happy Giraffe: My bike has atm 2400w and its enough for the daily use😂 Tho I would like to keep the phase max current until topspeed. That will be achieved with a more powerful 20S batt😁
[2023-12-22T18:25:51] Happy Giraffe: All this with app log files and phone error log👍
[2023-12-22T18:41:16] Mirono escooters: Its super, duper pointless to just give minimal info and expect a solution
[2023-12-22T18:41:29] Mirono escooters: Especially since last issues were, due to quite unpredictable stuff..

[2023-12-22T18:55:14] Jakub Szczypiór: Have one in my ninebot and works flawlessly
[2023-12-22T19:37:41] haku: that on a ebike or scoot?
[2023-12-22T19:54:58] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom Still getting 1.62v max ADC1 from ADC module. Idk if adc module v1 is just crap as it gives 2.1v max for ADC2🌚 130x Throttle soldered so cant be bad connection😅
[2023-12-22T19:59:31] Happy Giraffe: Or if its the shity key switch making the losses, that also is soldered. I might try making it turn off the +5v instead of Signal🤔
[2023-12-22T20:02:16] Gabe Enzo: i think 3L is too much for 56 21700s. ugh
[2023-12-22T20:02:37] Gabe Enzo: Been a while since I had molicel so maybe I forgot how big they are.

[2023-12-22T20:16:35] haku: what is a furry? and why is my niece so interested in being one? is that a trend nowadays?
[2023-12-22T20:16:40] Paolo ⁭: Makerbase with included adc regulator?
[2023-12-22T20:23:45] puneDir: wish they also do same on 75100 alu
[2023-12-22T20:24:11] Happy Giraffe: I have ADC1 parallel with torque sensor so might affect it, only the signal tho
[2023-12-22T20:25:40] Happy Giraffe: But if I put 200A phase that I will never reach anyway with 40A batt current, then even a half throttle wants to give 100A🤔😂🙈 Not sure if values higher than possible with battery current is healthy tho
[2023-12-22T20:26:23] haku: nvm i googled. very interesting 😁
[2023-12-22T20:29:11] haku: is this the 12 mosfet makerbase?
[2023-12-22T20:29:38] puneDir: oh no

[2023-12-22T21:56:43] Happy Giraffe: Well your small tiny wheels wouldnt move a meter in our snow here so shussshhh😂 (Ps. Sitting on saddle on rough terrain/snow isnt good for your bollocks)
[2023-12-22T21:58:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sent in dm
[2023-12-22T22:03:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just playing 😁 Was out in fresh snow with customer scooters ,that was funish but all city tires , I am use to offroad tires,missing ex scooter for moments like that,but Snow was like for two days. Melting snow even worse . 🤷‍♂ Anyway we will have like 13-15 at Christmas, so i am not really worried about snow now
[2023-12-22T22:04:02] Happy Giraffe: Update: If I measure between 5v and signal its 3.4v and 5v-GND gives 4.9v🤔 so in theory it should work if I put it together now
[2023-12-22T22:05:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i rode bikes for years ,for fun also dh, everybody need to learn, that the Nut-cracker is not just an opera🤣
[2023-12-22T22:15:45] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2023-12-22T22:41:06] Happy Giraffe: 1.34😅 One way would be to put a tiny resistor to torque sensor so it would start the voltage at a lower state like 1v. Then throttle could also operate between 1-1.6v🤔
[2023-12-22T22:43:17] Happy Giraffe: Dream would be to have a powerful mid drive on a beefy DH bike or a minimoto. DH bikes could maybe handle 10kw power and be easily legal but then on the otherhand minimoto I can put 30kw+ and enjoy life😅
[2023-12-22T22:55:28] Happy Giraffe: But now its fucked? Or if I need to get momentary button to short the signal wire with 5v?😂
[2023-12-23T00:08:32] Oreo huzky: Hey quick question is it better to have a straight handle bar or one that’s slightly bend inwards
[2023-12-23T00:09:57] haku: i have a straight one. but i do like the look of bendy one.
[2023-12-23T00:13:47] Oreo huzky: It’s kinda like this but in black with slight dent inwards

[2023-12-23T00:19:56] haku: 2 qs273 would be badass
[2023-12-23T00:26:24] haku: i think there is science behind it. im not sure. it has an effect on tge handling
[2023-12-23T00:27:49] Paolo ⁭: Lower asset, higher stability at high speed
[2023-12-23T00:28:02] Paolo ⁭: But less comfort
[2023-12-23T00:33:39] Oreo huzky: Oof okay I will get one then maybe a nice one out of carbon I don’t know yet
[2023-12-23T00:35:45] Oreo huzky: I just had this one laying around it was from a motorcycle I painted it black and made it a bit thicker because it wasn’t 22,5mm where it mounts to the stem
[2023-12-23T00:38:07] Paolo ⁭: Carbon is good only for look
[2023-12-23T00:38:12] Paolo ⁭: Don't make sense otherwise
[2023-12-23T00:51:58] Wolve666: Some problem for me. Solved only with the ADC adapter V2. But it has no sense!!!
[2023-12-23T01:03:06] Wolve666: It's possible to find an STL for one enclosure for ADC adapter V2?
[2023-12-23T01:03:30] haku: good question. im lookig for one too
[2023-12-23T01:05:59] Wolve666: I'm not practical with 3d modelling, I will try to create something but probably in many days and full of imperfection. If someone is more able can do one

[2023-12-23T12:18:24] Newuser G: Guys! I accidentally click shutdown bms and now battery is off and I can’t find ble, solution for power on again?
[2023-12-23T12:21:33] Paolo ⁭: Put charger
[2023-12-23T12:25:18] Newuser G: Oh! I need put charge for restart?
[2023-12-23T12:26:27] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2023-12-23T12:26:32] Newuser G: Thx Paolo👌
[2023-12-23T13:44:39] cihan: If I buy a charger with higher voltage than I'll need but with correct max current, can I use it with a battery with lower voltage? Long story short I would like to buy a 3A 84V charger and use it for 42V ninebot and 54.6V navee. What confuses me is initial high voltage which could trip BMS and stop charging.
[2023-12-23T13:45:12] cihan: I'll use this 84V charger for future max 84V battery too.
[2023-12-23T13:50:47] sombre_enfant: No
[2023-12-23T14:01:21] cihan: Was this reply for my question?
[2023-12-23T14:11:33] Jhinzuo ~~: Yes
[2023-12-23T14:14:36] Gabe Enzo: Indeed.
[2023-12-23T14:17:33] cihan: Thanks, is it the initial high voltage which trips BMS and doesn't let me charge a lower voltage battery?
[2023-12-23T14:17:55] Gabe Enzo: The initial high voltage is incompatible with the maximum cell voltage.
[2023-12-23T14:18:12] Gabe Enzo: It doesn't trip the BMS. it kills it. The BMS isnt a transformer
[2023-12-23T14:24:24] Happy Giraffe: Also if bms fails it will be 100% your house on fire. If using 13s charger to 12s battery it might still survive the overvoltage but now no chance
[2023-12-23T14:27:21] Happy Giraffe: Talking about QS, not bad for 500$ motor (25mm2 phase)😂
[2023-12-23T14:41:31] Mirono escooters: Is there a min quantity 👀
[2023-12-23T14:48:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Me and my big mouth

[2023-12-23T14:51:11] Happy Giraffe: Not sure
[2023-12-23T14:51:49] Happy Giraffe: I think this can easily do 40-50kw, thermal mass unibody design already 22kg
[2023-12-23T14:57:15] NetworkDir: Looks Qss4 display
[2023-12-23T15:08:53] Mirono escooters: Ionno, efficienty low
[2023-12-23T15:09:11] Mirono escooters: And how they know wheel torque 🤔
[2023-12-23T15:35:24] Happy Giraffe: They have gearing for motor and wheel size listed
[2023-12-23T15:36:47] Happy Giraffe: Nah, efficiency numbers always bs. If you run this with 30s 3shul and 20s 3shul then efficiency is already worlds better at 20s vesc. Its just a useless number if laminations are thin and design modern at all
[2023-12-23T15:37:39] Happy Giraffe: +5Nm torque fullnerd, now that my throttle is fixed thanks to James😅
[2023-12-23T16:14:28] Mirono escooters: Motor efficienty and total with esc is different
[2023-12-23T16:24:09] cihan: In fact cells can easily withstand such short time high voltage but BMS is the problem.
[2023-12-23T16:34:12] Gabe Enzo: Ya risking fire.
[2023-12-23T16:35:16] cihan: Thank you, I don't know why connector should arch, voltage difference isn't big enough and high current can flow for only few milliseconds. I understand that there's no reason to risk BMS but batteries can withstand it with no problems if charger was directly connected to the battery without BMS.
[2023-12-23T16:37:07] Gabe Enzo: You can charge a lithium ion about 5 times with 5 volts before it explodes. That doesn't mean it can handle it.
[2023-12-23T16:37:25] cihan: You're right, 40V could be big enough maybe.
[2023-12-23T16:39:54] cihan: No, it doesn't. I revived zero lithium ion many times that way. Current limit drops voltage so fast.
[2023-12-23T16:40:44] cihan: Yes, terminating charge manually before 4.2V/cell is necessary with high voltage charger.
[2023-12-23T16:41:26] Yamal: <video_file>
[2023-12-23T16:42:41] cihan: It's the best choice but I don't know if there's such a charger with very wide voltage range. I have a cheap buck /boost converter, I'll use it for now. I have a bench power supply but I don't want to use it for regular charging.
[2023-12-23T16:42:43] Yamal: Stock battery, in a few week I get the new one🙏
[2023-12-23T16:43:26] Happy Giraffe: Kinda yes but kinda no😁 motor itself has its sweet spot but esc might kill or make it efficient if you play with Grin motor simulator and esc resistances
[2023-12-23T16:43:31] Yamal: Nami viper
[2023-12-23T16:43:33] Jan: 6kW at 110kmh? 🧐 My physics alarm bell just rang
[2023-12-23T16:43:48] Happy Giraffe: Which specs?
[2023-12-23T16:43:52] Jan: Either its downhill or wheel diameter cant be right
[2023-12-23T16:44:06] Yamal: I only do two time speed
[2023-12-23T16:44:16] Jan: two time speed?
[2023-12-23T16:44:40] Yamal: <video_file>
[2023-12-23T16:45:05] rosheee: what wheel diamenter xD?
[2023-12-23T16:45:05] Jan: Not possible sorry, please explain

[2023-12-23T16:45:54] rosheee: ok ^^
[2023-12-23T16:46:10] Yamal: The one I means , I try 2 time full speed
[2023-12-23T16:46:11] rosheee: not 16s xD
[2023-12-23T16:46:13] Happy Giraffe: GPS speedometer overlay seems to be what people want😂
[2023-12-23T16:46:21] Yamal: 32
[2023-12-23T16:46:55] Jan: Yeah but the values makes no sense
[2023-12-23T16:46:57] Yamal: Waiting 20s 10p 40t only need arrive the nikel..
[2023-12-23T16:47:01] Jan: <files/image (11).png>
[2023-12-23T16:48:29] Jan: Unless you use massive aero kits, your Cd value is around 0.75-0.8
[2023-12-23T17:01:08] Happy Giraffe: Nickel gonna heat a ton if pushed hard, really wants copper
[2023-12-23T17:01:58] Happy Giraffe: BMS should give overvoltage warning at that difference imo😂 but if Daly/Chinesium bms then ofcourse not
[2023-12-23T17:02:31] Jesús: It’s 279, I know I put it, don’t worry, it’s fine
[2023-12-23T17:04:14] Happy Giraffe: For real if my batt had thicker nickel or copper I would push it way harder😂 35A bms and 70A current easy
[2023-12-23T17:24:38] Mirono escooters: Any good motors should come with recommended values and sweet spots
[2023-12-23T18:11:15] Happy Giraffe: Propably in their product page, atleast other motors have those graphs
[2023-12-23T18:47:46] Yamal: They are going to make the battery with nikel and copper
[2023-12-23T18:49:44] Yamal: It is better not to talk about the torque, because it really already has the factory battery (29-E) But in top speed how much do you think I will gain with the Samsung 40T...?
[2023-12-23T18:59:26] Happy Giraffe: Depends on the sag that gets removed, if you sag 10 volt before and 3 volt after you get 7 volt worth of speed bit less than 10% And if you were power limited before it will increase the speed to voltage limit now
[2023-12-23T19:20:18] Yamal: 👍🔥
[2023-12-23T19:20:22] Yamal: Well, the first intention is not to weaken anything, and to be able to "release" the controllers, Let's see how it goes, and how far the e-scooter can reach comfortably, It is also true that you will see a lot of discharge with the 10p of 40t
[2023-12-23T19:40:32] haku: ive seen this before. on a gokart. where do you get these
[2023-12-23T20:00:22] Happy Giraffe: Order from QSmotor website or email them
[2023-12-23T20:03:54] haku: that is nice. that one is 50lt cells?
[2023-12-23T20:06:00] Yamal: No , is INR 18650 29E ………….
[2023-12-23T20:11:47] haku: i see. the reason im wondering is there are used affordable m50lt cells being sold here. i wonder how they perform.
[2023-12-23T20:12:12] Paolo ⁭: Possible with super conductor, but u spent more energy to keep it cool😂
[2023-12-23T20:18:24] Paolo ⁭: Btw flipsky definitely more powerful than tronic
[2023-12-23T20:18:37] Paolo ⁭: Tronic 250 I mean
[2023-12-23T20:35:38] Yamal: Flipsky lover 💫😁
[2023-12-23T20:39:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it can fit !
[2023-12-23T20:39:35] haku: 8mm bullets? on what wires?
[2023-12-23T20:41:05] haku: these expired preworkout from 2022 still works 😂
[2023-12-23T20:41:57] haku: <photos/photo_11697@23-12-2023_20-41-57.jpg>
[2023-12-23T20:45:45] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: why I answer at this question? to say yes it fit but I with 12 awg? 😂 i am not stupid of course it's same, 8mm bullet and 10 awg wire
[2023-12-23T20:47:29] haku: thank you! i got 10mm bullets from the help of our lord james. but i was considering doing this too with 8mm
[2023-12-23T20:48:09] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Bley
[2023-12-23T20:48:29] haku: gotcha thanks!
[2023-12-23T20:48:49] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 😉
[2023-12-23T20:49:15] Yamal: Raphael a good suspension for Nami,? The standard ones are soft and break seals.
[2023-12-23T20:50:37] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Not exist good suspension for Nami, the best suspension it's not suspension 😂
[2023-12-23T20:51:36] Yamal: But you thing is okay for ride everyday?
[2023-12-23T20:51:48] Yamal: <photos/photo_11699@23-12-2023_20-51-48.jpg>
[2023-12-23T20:51:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but seriously it's true it doesn't exist the good suspension, the range of force cs stoke on Nami fit with 0 suspension on the market on this size
[2023-12-23T20:52:09] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: not at all
[2023-12-23T20:52:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that even for track it's not good, it's too rigid
[2023-12-23T20:53:18] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I have still some millimeter of suspension, if not it's too hard, hard for the pilot but also for the frame
[2023-12-23T20:54:00] Yamal: <photos/photo_11700@23-12-2023_20-54-00.jpg>
[2023-12-23T20:54:17] Yamal: Infront……. Rear is okay
[2023-12-23T20:54:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes I know it is shit that
[2023-12-23T20:58:22] Yamal: There are some suspension, 165mm air, fox or rock shox type, but I don't know if they will work well.
[2023-12-23T21:00:31] Paolo ⁭: Too soft, so not
[2023-12-23T21:00:37] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: No they will not
[2023-12-23T21:01:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: because the range of force vs Stroke is needed fit with 0 suspension on the market on this size
[2023-12-23T21:02:06] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: isn't question of spring it doesn't care that
[2023-12-23T21:02:15] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's the hydraulic the problem
[2023-12-23T21:03:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Fail or not do his job because... the range of force vs Stroke is needed fit with 0 suspension on the market on this size
[2023-12-23T21:04:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's depend if you talking about hard/soft yes, it you talking about performance of suspension not
[2023-12-23T21:05:05] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you can put harder spring and it will be more hard right, but it will still be a spring not suspension
[2023-12-23T21:06:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: good suspension the hydraulic can be a opposite force of the spring and going back go relax position slowly, it's never the case because the spring force are far away more strong than the hydraulic capacity of this type of suspension
[2023-12-23T21:07:46] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and also it's very hard force but on small stoke, too small and the hydraulic do not work well on only some mm of stroke
[2023-12-24T01:50:48] haku: @PaoloWu have you used this material before? it came with the welder. is it more conductive than nickel or copper?
[2023-12-24T01:55:54] Jan: A 5 second google would reveal the answer
[2023-12-24T01:55:58] Jan: <photos/photo_11702@24-12-2023_01-55-58.jpg>
[2023-12-24T01:57:35] Jan: Unless there is some weird super lattice structure forming that makes it better than copper (No one figured out something better that is not superconductivity) then you got your answer
[2023-12-24T02:00:28] haku: thank you. ive never seen this material used before. very interesting stuff
[2023-12-24T02:01:13] haku: more conductive than nickel.
[2023-12-24T02:05:51] Jhinzuo ~~: Those are the best usually forbidden formula today
[2023-12-24T02:12:24] Finn: Hey can i just bridge the vcc and the en pin to enable the buck converter?
[2023-12-24T02:12:43] Finn: The EN Pad on the vesc isnt there any more 😅
[2023-12-24T02:25:08] Finn: Next time imma use silver
[2023-12-24T02:25:09] Finn: thanks
[2023-12-24T02:28:01] haku: its crazy that gold has lower conductivity than copper. i thought it was high on the list.
[2023-12-24T02:29:10] haku: i will use Ruthenium because it sounds fancy af
[2023-12-24T02:29:24] Finn: lets go with gallium
[2023-12-24T02:29:29] Finn: melts at room temperature
[2023-12-24T02:29:58] Finn: Only use scooter in temperatures under 10C
[2023-12-24T02:30:09] haku: lol
[2023-12-24T02:30:11] Finn: put it in the fridge hahah

[2023-12-24T02:43:24] haku: very true. if i remember 2012 pre had meth in it. 😂
[2023-12-24T03:37:51] Jhinzuo ~~: Yes some dmaa slapped hard back then
[2023-12-24T03:39:25] Paolo ⁭: Good
[2023-12-24T03:39:37] Paolo ⁭: Still using now
[2023-12-24T03:41:45] haku: you can still get dma here. but not in my state. lol
[2023-12-24T03:42:14] Paolo ⁭: Nah is easy to get it
[2023-12-24T03:42:36] Paolo ⁭: They even don't take care about fentanyl abuse in their state
[2023-12-24T03:43:00] haku: not in my local area. have to buy it out of state. cant even ship it lol
[2023-12-24T03:43:15] haku: agreed
[2023-12-24T03:43:43] Paolo ⁭: Yes, because actually you can get way more powerful formulas😂
[2023-12-24T03:44:05] Paolo ⁭: Like SARMs
[2023-12-24T03:44:36] haku: yes there is some. but they constantly change formulas.
[2023-12-24T03:44:47] Paolo ⁭: We drink everyday infinity amount of coffee, so caffeine don't work with us hahha
[2023-12-24T03:45:04] haku: old school pre is the best pre. like jack3d
[2023-12-24T03:47:08] haku: sarms not to popular here. dudes just get straight test and winstrol. very easy to get
[2023-12-24T03:47:36] haku: i dont do that stuff though. too old to be fake natty
[2023-12-24T03:55:39] Paolo ⁭: America not one of best state for health care😂
[2023-12-24T04:39:12] haku: agreed.
[2023-12-24T04:39:41] haku: its sad actually.

[2023-12-24T10:39:53] Gabe Enzo: I'm returning the nickel I bought 🤣
[2023-12-24T10:47:31] Yamal: I can't wait to see the scooter finished, I'm already in the final stretch, once I install the battery the only thing left to do is play with the toy and enjoy it, maybe later I'll do carbon fiber hydroprinting on the fenders, and I'll lower the curtain
[2023-12-24T12:43:22] Yamal: Gogogo 😂

[2023-12-24T14:53:22] Mirono escooters: Do make me wonder why that v divider is there.
[2023-12-24T14:53:25] Finn: Pull high on
[2023-12-24T14:53:37] puneDir: there was cengiz guide for ignition mod

[2023-12-24T14:53:55] Mirono escooters: Ah, ye. I thought it was a flipsky without turn off on
[2023-12-24T14:54:00] Finn: Nop
[2023-12-24T14:54:06] puneDir: Resistor mod for to turn off and on (tested with makerbase and flipsky 75100) For R1 The value of R1 is fixed at 10K Resistor. For R2 10s-20s works with 100K Resistor . For lower or higher voltages, you should check https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/voltage-divider-calculator/ The output voltage with your lowest voltage should not be below 1.5V, otherwise it will not work For R1 resistor gnd I'm not sure, but I think I had connected it to BE for GND, You can connect to any GND After this, if you give the battery voltage to R2, the vesc will turn on. So you can turn it on and off with any key By @fungus93 :)

[2023-12-24T15:07:10] Finn: so there is a reason i make it
[2023-12-24T15:08:09] Finn: The Sokil Clamp needs an Extender to work with the Monorim Front suspension otherwise the arms are touching the clamp

[2023-12-24T19:15:26] Finn: Import it into fusion and make it a mesh
[2023-12-24T19:15:42] haku: thanks.
[2023-12-24T19:17:37] Happy Giraffe: Resizing also can be done easily on slicer like bambu
[2023-12-24T19:25:51] Jan: I would not recommend editing STL files. Its a mess and the results are not precise
[2023-12-24T19:26:11] Gabe Enzo: That's why I'm asking for the file
[2023-12-24T19:26:22] Jan: What file?
[2023-12-24T19:31:36] haku: need to learn fusion but i dont want to pay for subscription while learning
[2023-12-24T19:32:58] Happy Giraffe: Fusion basically free
[2023-12-24T19:33:16] Happy Giraffe: You can have 500 files that you only edit 10 at a time
[2023-12-24T19:33:47] haku: there is a subscription. and the student free version
[2023-12-24T19:34:02] haku: i need to find my .edu email
[2023-12-24T19:36:14] haku: its like 70bucks a month or something

[2023-12-24T19:38:55] haku: the swiss really knows how to make watches 😂
[2023-12-24T19:44:31] Mario: I was referred here from r/ElectricScooters, I've been looking around for answers but they are hard to find. I have a dual motor electric riding lawn mower, slave ESC blew up, I want to replace third party as they are super expensive and very hard to find. I converted the mower over to LiFePO4, from the best research I could find through the Ryobi facebook group, the motors are rated 1200w 20A @ 60V. I was thinking about Flipsky 75200 Pro v2's, but was told those are unreliable and overkill at their specs. I was told a better solution would be https://makerbase3d.com/product/makerbase-vesc-75100/ which the motors and battery fit within the specs for. Would those work, and also I want to run them on/off without the need for a throttle. The RPM of the motors calculated out should be about 3600rpm, I just want zero when off and 3600rpm when on. Any advice?
[2023-12-24T19:45:36] Mario: I also don't hate the pricing of the makerbase 75100's, they are over $350 cheaper than the OEM slave ESC that is in there now and readily available.
[2023-12-24T19:51:09] Gabe Enzo: Can cause Fires.

[2023-12-24T20:24:40] Finn: Finally 120V 3A power supply
[2023-12-24T20:24:59] Finn: No more boom on first start😁
[2023-12-24T20:29:43] haku: thats a good power supply. might need to solder 4mm bannana plugs instead of those crimped connectors. thats what i did
[2023-12-24T20:30:23] Mirono escooters: Makerbase and flipsky is kinda the same. 75100 is lower power then 75200
[2023-12-24T20:30:43] Mirono escooters: You can just use a power button as "throttle"
[2023-12-24T20:31:16] Mirono escooters: 1200w motors are perfect for 75100 btw

[2023-12-24T20:39:31] Finn: Testing this boy
[2023-12-24T20:39:45] Finn: Obviously but not with a running motor
[2023-12-24T20:40:24] Paolo ⁭: With not? Precharge with resistor then put the discharge
[2023-12-24T20:40:43] Finn: A nice power supply is not a bad thing to have😂
[2023-12-24T20:41:03] Paolo ⁭: Yes obviously hahahah
[2023-12-24T20:41:15] haku: mine did not come with those. i had to make a jank one 😂
[2023-12-24T20:41:19] Paolo ⁭: But if the goal was only yo avoid spark there are many cheap ways
[2023-12-24T20:41:27] Finn: I had them laying arround
[2023-12-24T20:41:48] haku: what is that my guy?
[2023-12-24T20:41:49] Finn: They were still from my practical electronics exam
[2023-12-24T20:42:01] Finn: Xiao esc
[2023-12-24T20:45:57] haku: vape all dae
[2023-12-24T20:47:25] Mario: Thank you, sounds like I should just pick the cheaper of the two. The Makerbases are so cheap I wouldn't even care if I had to redo it after messing with them. All in, two of the 75100's are only $140 to my door.
[2023-12-24T20:47:38] Mirono escooters: Some chats dissapeared
[2023-12-24T20:47:57] Mirono escooters: Yeah, plenty cheap
[2023-12-24T20:48:02] Mario: @Mirono_escooters do you know if you can run them in master/slave or is that even needed? The corrent OEM setup runs their ESCs that way, but I was also told it wasn't required for something like this.
[2023-12-24T20:48:11] Mirono escooters: Yes, you can over CAN
[2023-12-24T20:48:24] Mirono escooters: But, you can just config separately
[2023-12-24T20:51:06] Mario: Can you run the power button parallel for each so they are controlled by the same on/off switch? I think I'm asking the same question differently with regards to the master/slave setup. Obviously in master/slave the slave would turn on when the master sees the signal. But if I wire them independently, can I just wire them to the same on/off switch? I assume yes, but I'm just confirming.
[2023-12-24T20:51:21] Mario: Actually typing that out, that's a dumb question, of course you can.
[2023-12-24T20:52:04] Mario: I think I am woefully overcomplicating this, the more complicated part is going to be the VESC settings in vesc_tool.
[2023-12-24T20:57:00] Mario: Is an anti-spark switch needed for this type of thing? The mower has a key to start/stop the power to the rest of the machine, then the two blade motors will obviously have their own on/off switch, should that be an anti-spark, what would the benefits be there?
[2023-12-24T21:07:51] Happy Giraffe: Student info not needed, but lets continue in offtopic
[2023-12-24T21:12:47] haku: my bad. thought this was on offtopic. thats where i always hang out 😂

[2023-12-24T21:36:42] puneDir: Theyre soo good but 30h
[2023-12-24T21:36:49] puneDir: Maybe best 30h
[2023-12-24T21:37:50] haku: i see. how hard can you push g30 motors? didnt you have one going 70kph?
[2023-12-24T21:39:18] puneDir: I did 80 with single g30 motor
[2023-12-24T21:39:28] puneDir: With dual cengiz maded 98 or something
[2023-12-24T21:39:34] haku: did you burn it?
[2023-12-24T21:39:37] puneDir: Yes
[2023-12-24T21:39:46] haku: i see.
[2023-12-24T21:39:59] puneDir: I pulled my biker friend up to an hill with single motor and 40a
[2023-12-24T21:40:09] puneDir: After few kilometers it burned

[2023-12-24T21:40:35] puneDir: Btw just isolation burned not windings
[2023-12-24T22:11:19] Unknown: New stupid law in my country mandatory license plate for ebikes/scooters
[2023-12-24T22:12:34] haku: dam that sucks.
[2023-12-24T22:17:11] Unknown: It's going to be chaos haha
[2023-12-24T22:18:01] haku: how will they be enforcing it? by watts? would child e scooters count?
[2023-12-24T22:19:13] Unknown: The legal limit of watts and speed is still the that's the stupid in that
[2023-12-24T22:19:30] Unknown: And about kids scooter I don't know
[2023-12-24T22:20:27] Unknown: Which means 250w 25kmh and you can't drive on the sidewalk haha in short if u want 2 wheels get a motorcycle
[2023-12-24T22:21:15] haku: dam
[2023-12-24T22:22:11] Unknown: But it is going to be hard to arrest everyone that doesn't have a license plate (the plate is for the rider not the scooter which means I can steal a plate from someone and he is going to be in so much debt)
[2023-12-24T22:23:24] haku: yea man. it will be hard enforcing that. it really depends on the cop if they are assholes or not
[2023-12-24T22:24:09] haku: meanwhile in the US you see kids in surrons on highways. 😜
[2023-12-24T22:25:14] Unknown: Shut up u made me cry 😭
[2023-12-24T22:25:56] haku: doing wheelies just to add. 😭
[2023-12-24T22:26:02] Unknown: No here every cop has a big reason to arrest me cuze they are going to see me as a car without a plate
[2023-12-24T22:26:15] Unknown: I can't do those Also
[2023-12-24T22:26:27] haku: oof
[2023-12-24T22:26:36] Unknown: To add insult to injury?
[2023-12-24T22:27:38] haku: well just be lowkey about it. pretend your in a 250w scooter lol
[2023-12-24T22:28:02] Tommy ª: use a essential motor
[2023-12-24T22:28:08] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2023-12-24T22:28:19] Unknown: In it's going to take affect start of next year thinking about getting a motorcycle license and leaving the scooter life

[2023-12-24T22:28:40] Unknown: We already pretending that
[2023-12-24T22:29:30] Unknown: On the nami motors in here written 250w 😀😃😃😄
[2023-12-24T22:29:38] haku: haha
[2023-12-24T22:30:44] Tommy ª: here in spain they want insurance and inspection on scooters in 2024 or something like that ima get out 30 screws for check the battery and wiring in the ITV station
[2023-12-24T22:31:27] Unknown: Wow so u are also afed .
[2023-12-24T22:32:00] Unknown: What is that with the law and getting in people's fun ?
[2023-12-24T22:32:42] Unknown: Like scooter accidents mostly have one victim= the rider
[2023-12-24T22:32:55] Unknown: Il
[2023-12-24T22:33:02] Unknown: IL
[2023-12-24T22:33:02] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. shlomo has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-24T23:13:33] Yamal: Anybody try this?
[2023-12-24T23:21:40] haku: its good.
[2023-12-24T23:23:42] haku: idk if its good for racing though. but for casual rides its awsome
[2023-12-24T23:23:53] Mirono escooters: Nah not for racing
[2023-12-24T23:24:00] Mirono escooters: Its for cruising
[2023-12-24T23:26:16] haku: its so good i rather have this than go 22s without regen
[2023-12-24T23:50:15] Jhinzuo ~~: Is it good for longer rides ? Normal thumb throttle kinda makes my thumb numb after 1hr ride 😂
[2023-12-24T23:57:36] Mirono escooters: Yeah, like a fake sticker is hard 🙈
[2023-12-24T23:57:49] Mirono escooters: They will never learn
[2023-12-25T00:00:25] Yamal: And is it good for strong acceleration and slightly more physical driving?😁
[2023-12-25T00:26:52] haku: its cool because your hand rests like this. and there is a cruise control feature too
[2023-12-25T00:27:39] haku: if i did not have the top buttons i think it would be more comfortable
[2023-12-25T00:56:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Merry Christmas to everyone
[2023-12-25T00:57:02] haku: merry christmas
[2023-12-25T01:03:58] haku: in europe do you guys celebrate on christmas eve or christmas day? the 25th?
[2023-12-25T01:04:10] Gabe Enzo: poles celebrate eve
[2023-12-25T01:04:17] Gabe Enzo: I got My presents already
[2023-12-25T01:04:26] haku: haha nice!
[2023-12-25T01:04:35] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11726@25-12-2023_01-04-35.jpg>
[2023-12-25T01:04:38] Gabe Enzo: this is such a headache
[2023-12-25T01:04:43] Gabe Enzo: printing spacers is the worst
[2023-12-25T01:05:00] Finn: Same
[2023-12-25T01:05:07] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11727@25-12-2023_01-05-07.jpg>
[2023-12-25T01:05:13] Finn: Not with the right printer
[2023-12-25T01:05:23] Gabe Enzo: Yeah, tis Ender 3 💀
[2023-12-25T01:05:39] Gabe Enzo: takes super skill to use
[2023-12-25T01:05:42] Gabe Enzo: not normie friendly
[2023-12-25T01:05:43] haku: enders are suppose to be workhorses so many upgrades you can do i hear
[2023-12-25T01:05:44] Finn: Had the same
[2023-12-25T01:05:50] Finn: First printer
[2023-12-25T01:05:54] Finn: God i hated it
[2023-12-25T01:06:11] Finn: Bambulab p1p is the best
[2023-12-25T01:06:30] Gabe Enzo: I want an upgrade but to be honest what else am I gonna print other than spacers
[2023-12-25T01:07:26] haku: yea that is standard now i guess. good thing i did not choose a different brand. i only had 1 failed print and ive been printing non stop
[2023-12-25T01:07:48] Gabe Enzo: always remember the rule of thumb. print at 30% speed for the first few layers
[2023-12-25T01:07:56] Finn: Same
[2023-12-25T01:08:24] haku: bambu is just auto. no fiddling around.
[2023-12-25T01:08:38] Gabe Enzo: this shit is like a manual toyota
[2023-12-25T01:08:42] haku: i dont even know how to reduce print speed
[2023-12-25T01:09:36] Finn: In the app
[2023-12-25T01:09:50] Finn: Or in slicer when you connect to the devixe
[2023-12-25T01:10:26] Finn: Bambu slicer is prob the best slicer out thete
[2023-12-25T01:10:36] haku: i just auto everything its stupid proof. even the supports are auto
[2023-12-25T01:10:39] Finn: With the comming support for other printers it will be great
[2023-12-25T01:11:40] haku: i want to test cf filament when i see a discount on one.
[2023-12-25T01:12:21] Finn: You should get a hardened nozzle for that
[2023-12-25T01:12:33] haku: that looks good though.
[2023-12-25T01:12:33] Finn: Will work without but its better with
[2023-12-25T06:57:28] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2023-12-25T06:58:00] Mirono escooters: Ender is pretty ok Try one of the older printers, like anet A8 💀
[2023-12-25T06:58:19] puneDir: it burns
[2023-12-25T19:30:00] haku: merry christmas!
[2023-12-25T19:47:33] Mirono escooters: Same to you🎄🥰
[2023-12-25T21:06:34] Mirono escooters: I'm trying to make the manual. I never did this before 🤷
[2023-12-25T21:06:39] Mirono escooters: As noob friendly as possible
[2023-12-25T21:18:47] sombre_enfant: The soldering job🤤
[2023-12-25T21:29:30] Rose: Hey there Amir, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-25T21:29:43] Happy Giraffe: Soon gonna replace the loose springs with silicone studs. If that doesnt work I machine spacers that will make it 100% even😂
[2023-12-25T21:33:44] Happy Giraffe: 130x Throttle very nice😁 I wonder if twist is comfy on a bike🤔
[2023-12-25T21:36:56] Mirono escooters: It's for flashing purposes only, please ignore.
[2023-12-25T21:37:19] Mirono escooters: I knew someone was gonna bitch. Those pads are so tiny, please try to be the better version of me
[2023-12-25T21:38:00] Nirel: Hi 👋 How can I maximize the 75100dual controller so that it gives me maximum torque?
[2023-12-25T21:38:13] Mirono escooters: A bazillion amps
[2023-12-25T21:38:16] Mirono escooters: Try mxlemming observer
[2023-12-25T21:38:36] sombre_enfant: I prefer dinner with Jay-Z
[2023-12-25T21:38:43] Mirono escooters: Shame
[2023-12-25T21:40:12] Tommy ª: casually i got better perfomance with ortega?
[2023-12-25T21:40:23] Mirono escooters: It differs
[2023-12-25T21:40:36] Mirono escooters: Most report more start torque but 3kmh lower with mxlemming
[2023-12-25T21:40:47] Mirono escooters: If your motor is saturating or values not perfect, Ortega is more friendly
[2023-12-25T21:41:22] Tommy ª: ah yep, i noticed more torque, but the motor struggles at mid speed
[2023-12-25T21:45:18] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11729@25-12-2023_21-45-18.jpg>
[2023-12-25T21:45:22] Mirono escooters: Das ist beter. tiny pads
[2023-12-25T21:45:43] Mirono escooters: Epoxy and no one will ever see
[2023-12-25T21:46:05] Tommy ª: bt?
[2023-12-25T21:46:43] Nirel: Sorry but what is odserver? 😅
[2023-12-25T21:48:33] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-12-25T21:48:45] Mirono escooters: Foc and advanced Its how your Esc follows your motor
[2023-12-25T21:49:33] Nirel: I try it on the morning Thank you very much
[2023-12-25T21:55:21] Rose: Hey there Fresh, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-25T21:56:07] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11730@25-12-2023_21-56-07.jpg>
[2023-12-25T21:56:14] Mirono escooters: That.. works.
[2023-12-25T21:57:18] Mirono escooters: Ffs, uart is closed. Need to find such a old USB cable
[2023-12-25T22:22:19] Mirono escooters: Only power no data usb cables, I hate you.
[2023-12-25T22:25:10] Omaid: Does anyone know the bearing size for the 70h Lonnyo motor ? I’m too lazy to check myself 😅
[2023-12-25T22:26:12] Gabe Enzo: 4 phase wires kek
[2023-12-25T22:26:13] haku: no idea but those sleeves looks sick
[2023-12-25T22:26:24] sombre_enfant: Hall.
[2023-12-25T22:26:53] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11732@25-12-2023_22-26-53.jpg>
[2023-12-25T22:26:55] Mirono escooters: V3.1 😂😂
[2023-12-25T22:27:54] haku: is that the 33x2?
[2023-12-25T22:28:09] Omaid: 22x3
[2023-12-25T22:28:38] haku: nice. what is the difference. i have 33x2 but ive never used it yet
[2023-12-25T22:29:13] Omaid: I have used 33x2 and 22x3 . 22x3 has more torque and 33x2 has more speed
[2023-12-25T22:29:13] Кирилл: Yes. 6003 and 6008
[2023-12-25T22:29:16] sombre_enfant: More speed 33x2
[2023-12-25T22:29:39] haku: can i still do unlimited burnouts with it?
[2023-12-25T22:29:54] Gabe Enzo: It's 3kw dude of course
[2023-12-25T22:30:02] sombre_enfant: If u have sucé controller maybe
[2023-12-25T22:30:25] sombre_enfant: Or u will do burnout but at 70kph...
[2023-12-25T22:30:28] Gabe Enzo: Need 12fet esc for that ya
[2023-12-25T22:30:32] Gabe Enzo: Haha
[2023-12-25T22:30:47] Mirono escooters: I cant seem to flash the 4.12 VESC (yes. It is old) I can't erase the bootloader, it times out. Stuck on 3.103 Edit: go to 5.2 first, then 6.02.
[2023-12-25T22:30:48] Gabe Enzo: like those gokarts
[2023-12-25T22:30:53] haku: i shouldve asked here first before buying
[2023-12-25T22:31:14] Кирилл: No, its range is 5000-7000w nominal
[2023-12-25T22:31:15] sombre_enfant: New RFP vesc will be sucé enough for this
[2023-12-25T22:31:21] Omaid: Are you sure ? Bearing is massive on the motor wire side
[2023-12-25T22:31:29] Кирилл: I have 70h
[2023-12-25T22:31:48] Кирилл: From the wire side is 6008
[2023-12-25T22:31:58] haku: i will be using spintend 86/200. hope that will do it
[2023-12-25T22:32:08] Gabe Enzo: that's 12 fet should be good
[2023-12-25T22:32:09] Gabe Enzo: I think
[2023-12-25T22:32:32] Gabe Enzo: I'm going to be running 2x 22x2 with 2x 6 fetd
[2023-12-25T22:32:42] haku: im to old to be racing but never too old for burnouts haha
[2023-12-25T22:32:42] Omaid: Any brand you recommend . The stock bearing was so shit
[2023-12-25T22:32:46] Gabe Enzo: Looking at pushing each motor to 12kw.
[2023-12-25T22:32:51] Кирилл: Ntn, koyo LLUC3 2RS is recomended
[2023-12-25T22:33:15] haku: sorry to jack the topic but i was just thinking
[2023-12-25T22:33:47] Omaid: I prefer 22x3 over 33x2 . I love how I can wheelspin both wheels 😁
[2023-12-25T22:34:07] sombre_enfant: What esc u use ?
[2023-12-25T22:34:21] Gabe Enzo: Uhhhh not a good idea
[2023-12-25T22:34:23] Gabe Enzo: hahs
[2023-12-25T22:34:57] Omaid: Kelly kls 7230 but I would like to get the 3 shul . I have never used vesc so I haven’t made the leap yet
[2023-12-25T22:36:33] Omaid: Is vesc easy to program?
[2023-12-25T22:36:46] Gabe Enzo: Yes just don't use Mac LOL
[2023-12-25T22:36:51] Gabe Enzo: 💀
[2023-12-25T22:37:03] Gabe Enzo: mac vesc doesn't work
[2023-12-25T22:43:41] Yamal: Nice !
[2023-12-25T22:48:44] haku: thats what i want. doing running burnouts
[2023-12-25T22:48:48] Gabe Enzo: @LizardDoggo does the 80100 get hot at 9kw?
[2023-12-25T22:49:00] Gabe Enzo: think it can handle 12kw no?
[2023-12-25T22:49:22] haku: hopefully still possible with spintend 12 fet and 33x2
[2023-12-25T22:49:29] Mirono escooters: Torque over speed
[2023-12-25T22:49:44] Gabe Enzo: Torque = get to uni faster
[2023-12-25T22:52:52] Yamal: 33/2= torque 0
[2023-12-25T22:53:05] haku: @XgunaX your motor is 33x2 or 22x3?
[2023-12-25T22:53:21] Gabe Enzo: Need le dual
[2023-12-25T22:53:35] Yamal: Only if you have 400A phase? X1 controller
[2023-12-25T22:54:04] Yamal: The one I means need many A for get torque with 33/2
[2023-12-25T22:54:14] Yamal: 22/3 more fun
[2023-12-25T22:54:31] Gabe Enzo: me going with dual 22/3 24kw 😉
[2023-12-25T22:54:50] Gabe Enzo: hoping for 150kmh honestly
[2023-12-25T22:55:00] Yamal: ?
[2023-12-25T22:55:05] Gabe Enzo: Idk how fast it'll go
[2023-12-25T22:55:21] Yamal: 150 With 22/3?
[2023-12-25T22:55:25] Gabe Enzo: Dual tho
[2023-12-25T22:55:34] Gabe Enzo: 120 I want
[2023-12-25T22:55:36] Gabe Enzo: merge on motorway
[2023-12-25T22:55:48] Yamal: Me to 120/130 no need more
[2023-12-25T22:56:09] haku: i dont even know what those windings mean. i just bought the most expensive one that can fit my laotie and thought that will do it
[2023-12-25T22:56:12] Gabe Enzo: We are only allowed on the 100kmh roads here
[2023-12-25T22:56:22] Gabe Enzo: 120kmh needs registration
[2023-12-25T22:56:34] Gabe Enzo: "only"
[2023-12-25T22:56:59] Gabe Enzo: would be fun to sneak on the 120 tho
[2023-12-25T22:57:32] haku: i do not have steel balls to do that on a standing scooter lol
[2023-12-25T22:58:49] Yamal: With 127/28/30 I’m happy
[2023-12-25T22:59:10] Yamal: No can wait for put the battery
[2023-12-25T22:59:50] Gabe Enzo: Would be cool to put an afterburner on scoot
[2023-12-25T23:00:00] Gabe Enzo: push to 200kmh
[2023-12-25T23:00:01] Yamal: But the one I really know the torque become really good
[2023-12-25T23:00:58] haku: ill get dumb kid to sign a waiver and do a top speed run for me 😂
[2023-12-25T23:02:09] Yamal: What engines are you going to put in?
[2023-12-25T23:08:39] haku: ly 70h 33x2
[2023-12-25T23:09:30] haku: battery is 40t 350a peak.
[2023-12-25T23:11:32] sombre_enfant: I killed an ubox how i can get warranty ?
[2023-12-25T23:12:33] Tommy ª: bruh how you do that
[2023-12-25T23:16:02] Yamal: The battery is 20s?
[2023-12-25T23:16:29] haku: still deciding if 22s or 20s with regen
[2023-12-25T23:16:34] Yamal: With this motor your can get more and 130km/h
[2023-12-25T23:17:05] Yamal: 140 easy I think 😂
[2023-12-25T23:17:34] haku: i have enough batteries for 20s 10p. but 22s seems like a good dumb idea
[2023-12-25T23:18:28] Yamal: For me 20 s 10 p no can other thing
[2023-12-25T23:18:42] haku: after the holidays i will start working on it.
[2023-12-25T23:18:48] Gabe Enzo: 20s is gold. 22s is platinum. aka useless
[2023-12-25T23:18:53] Gabe Enzo: Gold is better
[2023-12-25T23:19:01] Yamal: 24 s 11p my dream but no can no there are space
[2023-12-25T23:19:15] Mirono escooters: Contact Amy and pray
[2023-12-25T23:19:17] Gabe Enzo: Possible with dirty bags
[2023-12-25T23:19:22] Gabe Enzo: I was planning on 20s12p
[2023-12-25T23:19:28] Gabe Enzo: with Lishen LR21700
[2023-12-25T23:19:36] haku: but the euro boys @SibClimb use 22s on the scooter leagues. i want to be euro
[2023-12-25T23:20:17] Yamal: Yes, but no nice, the one can put down the feet, is okay
[2023-12-25T23:20:36] sombre_enfant: Im starting to hate vesc ngl
[2023-12-25T23:20:58] Mirono escooters: I love it
[2023-12-25T23:22:29] Rose: Hey there Fresh, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-25T23:22:43] Yamal: Soon I hope to be able to send videos of the top speed and acceleration tests, and also, videos about the vesc tool app giving the scooter a hard time to see how it goes...
[2023-12-25T23:24:00] haku: you guys have big balls to go on top speed runs. i dont want to leave my son an orphan with no inheritance but a busted scooter
[2023-12-25T23:24:34] Gabe Enzo: With a runway with no cars, body armour and a steering dampener there's not much that can go wrong
[2023-12-25T23:25:05] haku: i need to really get body armor. im just helmet and knee pad guy
[2023-12-25T23:25:08] Gabe Enzo: I think there is plane runways to rent.
[2023-12-25T23:25:15] Gabe Enzo: Need thick leather gear
[2023-12-25T23:25:23] Gabe Enzo: that's what I'm gonna do
[2023-12-25T23:25:30] Gabe Enzo: I'm not fkn dying
[2023-12-25T23:26:12] haku: its a skill issue on my part. need to really know my scooter
[2023-12-25T23:27:34] haku: how?
[2023-12-25T23:27:52] Jan: What battery size?
[2023-12-25T23:28:12] Jan: P42A can push 160W per cell
[2023-12-25T23:28:33] Gabe Enzo: 20s7p Moli and planning to push 47A per cell for peaks.
[2023-12-25T23:28:34] haku: what? how
[2023-12-25T23:28:41] Gabe Enzo: 3.7 X 45
[2023-12-25T23:28:48] Jan: 20*7*160W=Max
[2023-12-25T23:29:20] Gabe Enzo: then only 23kw max
[2023-12-25T23:29:21] haku: gotcha. sometimes i dont read properly. i thought 160a
[2023-12-25T23:29:55] Gabe Enzo: What happens if I push an extra amp lol
[2023-12-25T23:30:21] Gabe Enzo: Shouldn't explode like
[2023-12-25T23:31:17] Gabe Enzo: 166.5 if cooled at 45a but then only 22.6kw
[2023-12-25T23:31:22] Yamal: but the truth is that I really like Vesc technology, that energy efficiency, that smooth driving without a single noise, there is speed, there is torque, the temperatures are correct for now, this wave, pure and without a single step, that Take care of your engines and consume only what it needs at all times, it is taking all the points for the electronics of the year
[2023-12-25T23:32:07] Gabe Enzo: There's noise :) but only ppl with electro ears can hear it
[2023-12-25T23:32:24] haku: for me its either join the vesc lords or the fardriver queens.
[2023-12-25T23:32:24] Gabe Enzo: Haha
[2023-12-25T23:32:30] Yamal: To push a machine to its limits over and over again, you first have to like running.
[2023-12-25T23:33:03] Yamal: Second, confidence comes from practice.
[2023-12-25T23:33:46] Yamal: And third, you need a good straight line, without traffic, preferably with good pavement.
[2023-12-25T23:34:07] Gabe Enzo: vesc box also make a noise when standstill
[2023-12-25T23:34:20] Gabe Enzo: sooo quiet tho, gotta put your ear right to it
[2023-12-25T23:34:28] Gabe Enzo: I've dog ears
[2023-12-25T23:35:09] Jan: Voltage sag, => not much more power
[2023-12-25T23:35:27] Gabe Enzo: How much do molicels sag?
[2023-12-25T23:35:40] Jan: U=R*I
[2023-12-25T23:35:40] Gabe Enzo: at like low load
[2023-12-25T23:35:44] Gabe Enzo: right
[2023-12-25T23:35:45] Gabe Enzo: forgot
[2023-12-25T23:35:53] Jan: 12mOhms i guess for P42a?
[2023-12-25T23:36:00] Yamal: And since everything is a process, in which you climb and climb in speed, you feel safe, strong, you see that your scooter has no wobbles or anything and in the end you reach its limit, and when you have arrived, you stay calm.
[2023-12-25T23:36:04] Yamal: <sticker>
[2023-12-25T23:36:38] Jan: I felt so unsafe +60kmh on vsett
[2023-12-25T23:36:50] Gabe Enzo: Try 70 on 8.5"
[2023-12-25T23:37:01] Jan: Would like to
[2023-12-25T23:38:23] Yamal: Rafael 160 on red Nami for me this is the world record 😂🚀
[2023-12-25T23:39:12] sombre_enfant: Idk
[2023-12-25T23:41:45] haku: i want my scooter to have the american record. with the help of the vesc lords i know its possible.
[2023-12-25T23:42:04] Gabe Enzo: 2x 5kw at 50kw could do it
[2023-12-25T23:42:20] Gabe Enzo: Maybe need lipo for a run like that
[2023-12-25T23:42:33] Gabe Enzo: No physical way to hold molicels
[2023-12-25T23:43:16] Yamal: The fastest I have ever gone on a scooter was 132km/h in a few seconds and there is really no need for more top speed! Now that's it! Let him catch them by tearing your arms from your body, let him be indomitable, and you be the one who controls the acceleration with your thumb...
[2023-12-25T23:43:39] haku: dam thats fast
[2023-12-25T23:44:08] Yamal: You are from America?
[2023-12-25T23:44:32] haku: yea. i think record here is something 80+mph
[2023-12-25T23:44:55] Gabe Enzo: Paolo went 150kmh
[2023-12-25T23:44:56] Jan: 99mph @SibClimb
[2023-12-25T23:45:03] Jan: 158kmh
[2023-12-25T23:45:14] haku: balls of steel
[2023-12-25T23:45:23] Yamal: I'm glad to hear it! have a connection on the other side of the pond
[2023-12-25T23:45:24] Jan: MotoGP gear, closed racetrack
[2023-12-25T23:45:27] Gabe Enzo: Life flashes before Ur eyes at 70
[2023-12-25T23:45:31] Gabe Enzo: can't imagine more than double
[2023-12-25T23:45:41] Gabe Enzo: 70 is like warp 9
[2023-12-25T23:46:49] haku: thats ebike top speed bragging rights here
[2023-12-25T23:47:07] Gabe Enzo: We need to get faster than the gastards. Need a motorbike frame for it.
[2023-12-25T23:47:12] Gabe Enzo: Absolutely doable
[2023-12-25T23:47:23] Gabe Enzo: only a question of money
[2023-12-25T23:47:29] haku: cant imagine a standing scooter 99mph. jeez
[2023-12-25T23:48:00] haku: tech is not there yet. once better batteries come it will
[2023-12-25T23:48:29] haku: im really hoping for 4680s to be adopted by manufacturers
[2023-12-25T23:48:38] Gabe Enzo: Possible with nuclear actually... But uranium is controlled
[2023-12-25T23:48:44] Yamal: In America what is expensive are good high discharge batteries, right?
[2023-12-25T23:48:47] Tommy ª: i love it
[2023-12-25T23:49:02] Gabe Enzo: Nuclear would be way cooler than gas.
[2023-12-25T23:49:04] haku: molicel p42 is the go to here.
[2023-12-25T23:49:04] Gabe Enzo: Deadass
[2023-12-25T23:49:21] Gabe Enzo: "Oh is your bike electric?" Nah it's nuclear
[2023-12-25T23:49:52] Yamal: If have molicel, have everything in the life
[2023-12-25T23:50:01] Yamal: No need more
[2023-12-25T23:50:03] Yamal: 😂
[2023-12-25T23:51:19] Yamal: Although many of you don't care about the brand, you have many wepeds, more than here in Europe I would say
[2023-12-25T23:52:30] Yamal: of course Minimotors, you have a slack in North America, and some Rions that look good heh, now with the new Apex
[2023-12-25T23:52:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-25T23:52:32] haku: ive never seen one in las vegas. maybe in LA and NY.
[2023-12-25T23:53:01] haku: ive never seen a rion too. 😂
[2023-12-25T23:53:21] haku: lots of vsetts apollos and dualtrons. and chinese frames
[2023-12-25T23:54:47] haku: surrons and ebikes are the trend here. scooters not much
[2023-12-25T23:55:57] haku: ive not even seen a modded g30. but in this telegram
[2023-12-25T23:55:57] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-25T23:56:50] Yamal: This group a think 90% Xiaomi and g30?
[2023-12-25T23:57:30] Yamal: Some Vsset to, for me more nice 🔥
[2023-12-25T23:58:34] haku: this is why i want to mod my g30 frame that i found. very cool stuff. instead of the 8.5 vsett 😂
[2023-12-26T00:01:14] Yamal: For me, the good thing about modifying a Xiaomi or a G30 is that eyes will never be on you outside the home, you are the good one, the poor one who goes on his Xiaomi, no one will bother you or stop you.
[2023-12-26T00:03:06] haku: we do not have xiaomis here in the US but clones
[2023-12-26T00:04:53] Mirono escooters: i just uploaded the WT51822 cheap bluetooth manual. please have a read, filter out spelling mistakes and let me know if anything is unclear. i will update it with the proper screenshot later
[2023-12-26T00:04:59] haku: we do not judge what kind of scooters/ebike one rides. looks can be decieving.
[2023-12-26T00:05:21] Yamal: But today, I still can't conceive of a small scooter, I come from a dt thunder and now a nami, if you like to travel kilometers, it is more comfortable and has more battery...
[2023-12-26T00:07:05] haku: i was on a 700w ebike then scooters. the dual motors got me hooked
[2023-12-26T00:07:35] haku: then i found a $700 laotie. haha
[2023-12-26T00:11:08] Oreo huzky: What’s this
[2023-12-26T00:11:18] Mirono escooters: Check useful archive Group
[2023-12-26T00:11:28] Mirono escooters: It's a "no brainer how to flash" manual
[2023-12-26T00:11:42] Yamal: The good thing about dual motors is when your rear wheel skids.
[2023-12-26T00:11:54] Mirono escooters: I feel like I need to upload another dropbox file with the correct files for the NRF51822, but I'll do that when needed. Lol
[2023-12-26T00:12:00] Oreo huzky: Ah so this just Bluetooth Module
[2023-12-26T00:12:01] Mirono escooters: It is way easier to solder, must admit
[2023-12-26T00:12:07] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2023-12-26T00:12:13] Oreo huzky: Why the extra pins
[2023-12-26T00:12:13] Mirono escooters: Yes but not 25€ scam from resellers
[2023-12-26T00:15:07] Yamal: Having the front wheel skid is easy, the difficult thing is for the scooter to skid backwards😂
[2023-12-26T00:15:52] haku: reps for santa
[2023-12-26T00:18:39] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2023-12-26T00:19:32] Mirono escooters: I'm stuck with bldc , this hardware doesn't even like foc 😭
[2023-12-26T00:21:16] Paolo ⁭: No lol, never
[2023-12-26T00:31:12] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11733@26-12-2023_00-31-12.jpg>
[2023-12-26T00:31:18] Mirono escooters: Motor L: 0 Hmmm😂
[2023-12-26T00:48:17] Oreo huzky: Seems about right 💀
[2023-12-26T00:48:27] Happy Giraffe: Maybe 3 xiaomi and rest G30 and bigger😂
[2023-12-26T00:49:29] Oreo huzky: I use scetchy laotiee frame
[2023-12-26T01:02:47] Mirono escooters: Bug, now fixed
[2023-12-26T07:46:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, think can go faster on open road x)
[2023-12-26T07:58:21] Rose: Hey there Fresh, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-26T08:13:17] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: <photos/photo_11734@26-12-2023_08-13-17.jpg>
[2023-12-26T08:17:32] Yamal: Beautiful Nami
[2023-12-26T08:18:01] Yamal: Still have crazy torque with 33/2? Or not ?
[2023-12-26T08:42:37] Rose: Hey there Fresh, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-26T08:43:48] Rose: Hey there Fresh, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-26T08:44:09] Tommy ª: Actually i cant believe they sells 25-30$ for a BT module
[2023-12-26T09:22:17] sombre_enfant: Nope
[2023-12-26T11:06:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: crazy not, but at 350A it's same than 22x3 at ~200A
[2023-12-26T11:19:36] Mirono escooters: Me too, that's why I made this manual
[2023-12-26T11:19:51] Mirono escooters: It was confusing to figure out at first, difficult to flash
[2023-12-26T11:20:04] Mirono escooters: Even without soldering skills, you can make a Bluetooth module for 5€
[2023-12-26T11:36:09] Yamal: <photos/photo_11735@26-12-2023_11-36-09.jpg>
[2023-12-26T11:37:58] Yamal: I have bought this suspension for the moment, because mine is not going to last much longer, maybe I will change the spring for the one I have now, which is 1800lbs and little more...
[2023-12-26T11:39:20] Mirono escooters: I see many complains on internet on hackey not answering and such, seems like 3shul is kinda shady😬😢
[2023-12-26T11:39:35] Mirono escooters: But it's kinda the only high powered vesc maker so
[2023-12-26T12:10:28] Mirono escooters: Maybe simple question But bldc doesn't need correct motor values right? Only foc
[2023-12-26T12:25:56] Chris Culver: Are you meaning the 3 big wires? Sorry I'm new
[2023-12-26T12:28:18] Finn: What you mean by motor values?
[2023-12-26T12:32:33] Mirono escooters: The detection values. The R, L, etcetera
[2023-12-26T12:34:24] puneDir: i hate life
[2023-12-26T12:35:16] Tommy ª: Worst used vesc 😭💀
[2023-12-26T12:40:07] Face de Pin Sucé: He was on marriage, should be back at work now, but he has a lot of waiting work
[2023-12-26T12:51:48] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-12-26T13:04:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bro you burn lot other things too😅
[2023-12-26T13:10:40] puneDir: Anet a8 burns
[2023-12-26T15:28:00] Oreo huzky: Can you find out winding of motor if you have kv because mine has 26kv
[2023-12-26T15:36:35] Jan: Thats medium low
[2023-12-26T15:40:50] Happy Giraffe: Yes 3 big wires coming from motor
[2023-12-26T15:42:14] Happy Giraffe: And if motor hass them 5 very thin hall sensor wires also coming out they should also be used in correct order
[2023-12-26T15:43:46] Happy Giraffe: https://trampaboards.com/vesc-str500-100v-500a--p-35876.html

[2023-12-26T15:54:16] Gabe Enzo: Will definitely be my choice for my summer kart project.
[2023-12-26T16:29:33] Yamal: beans for the hobbit's pantry, winter is coming...
[2023-12-26T16:56:51] Oreo huzky: Yes I would guess low kv means high torque correct?
[2023-12-26T16:59:09] Mirono escooters: How?
[2023-12-26T16:59:13] Mirono escooters: I can only find foc
[2023-12-26T16:59:28] Mirono escooters: (but bldc needs motor values then)
[2023-12-26T17:00:00] Mirono escooters: Upper menu? I'll boot up pc and see
[2023-12-26T17:00:18] Mirono escooters: VESC 4 doesn't like foc 😬😂
[2023-12-26T17:02:37] Mirono escooters: No, the drv chip can't handle it So I'm told And I'm not gonna figure out if it's true or not
[2023-12-26T17:02:55] Mirono escooters: It works, and thats that :)
[2023-12-26T17:03:28] Rose: Hey there Antonio, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-26T17:16:28] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Guys, what's your opinion about flipsky 75100? My friend want one for ninebot max and future awd project on same motors, ubox for him is expensive
[2023-12-26T17:18:03] Mirono escooters: Very good bang for buck vescs If you aren't a complete moron, work fine
[2023-12-26T17:29:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Wish stator size ?
[2023-12-26T17:31:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: It's close to the 65mm in 22*3
[2023-12-26T17:31:14] Nirel: Hi friends I putting the value iQ target, I got crazy power but during acceleration The controller crashes and drops the battery voltage to 0. Does anyone know why this is happening?
[2023-12-26T17:31:43] haku: i really want this when i wanted a bomber back then. this will be big for a scoot.
[2023-12-26T18:00:41] Happy Giraffe: Think I'll get a stealth bomber ebike frame and mod it to house bigger battery etc🤔
[2023-12-26T18:01:35] Happy Giraffe: Dont use MTPA unless you have ipm motor like in mid drive surrons etc
[2023-12-26T18:15:24] Mirono escooters: BIGGER?
[2023-12-26T18:15:37] Mirono escooters: My man, have you seen the insides of a stealth bomber frame?
[2023-12-26T18:16:09] Mirono escooters: Your BMS shuts off. You are totally overpowering it
[2023-12-26T18:19:07] Oreo huzky: 70mm
[2023-12-26T18:20:37] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 70mm 22*3 it's ~28.6 kv
[2023-12-26T18:27:16] Oreo huzky: So high torque?
[2023-12-26T18:34:15] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: It's Middle, between very low KV and High KV
[2023-12-26T18:35:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but usualy it's the one named "High Torque"
[2023-12-26T18:35:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but in reality it exist one more like High High Torque lol
[2023-12-26T18:38:00] Face de Pin Sucé: High Torque, High Speed, MHS, MHT, XHS, ... those names were created by Rage Mechanics regarding the usage of the motors in a particular case, but it doesn't mean anything in reality.
[2023-12-26T18:39:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but it have sense, the extra low KV are useless in 99.9% of application, then tne 22*3 are considered as High Torque and 33*2 as High Speed, it's fine like that
[2023-12-26T18:39:39] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: M > Rim casted with the motor X > Wheel Separated
[2023-12-26T18:40:11] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: The, X it's better but need 300~400€ of extra cost due of the Rim
[2023-12-26T18:41:08] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: depend in wish range
[2023-12-26T18:41:15] Oreo huzky: Yes but I use it with 30s so should be fast enough
[2023-12-26T18:42:16] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes it's "High Torque", yes it can fit for 30S depending the Max speed you want
[2023-12-26T18:42:35] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's still slower than the High torque with 22S
[2023-12-26T18:46:41] Happy Giraffe: My man it will be a battery for QS138 propably😂
[2023-12-26T18:47:19] Happy Giraffe: So maybe 21700 20S10p etc but its a future project
[2023-12-26T18:47:23] Mirono escooters: My man that doesn't matter, you can fit your wife in that battery space
[2023-12-26T18:47:28] Mirono escooters: That fits, like easily
[2023-12-26T18:47:36] Oreo huzky: Calculated speed was 180 I think but I don’t know if that’s possible
[2023-12-26T18:47:41] Mirono escooters: You can fit +-500 21700 inside it, and have room for a sabvoton
[2023-12-26T18:47:56] Mirono escooters: Source: my delivery friend who rides daily way to many km
[2023-12-26T18:47:58] Happy Giraffe: Batt needs to be easily lockable and removable aswell so takes space
[2023-12-26T18:48:01] Mirono escooters: He delivers quicker then anyone else xd
[2023-12-26T18:48:03] Oreo huzky: How
[2023-12-26T18:48:09] Mirono escooters: Trust me, it fits
[2023-12-26T18:48:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no isn't, you will go at max 145~150
[2023-12-26T18:48:16] Mirono escooters: Sure possible
[2023-12-26T18:48:21] Mirono escooters: But not on road
[2023-12-26T18:48:21] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-12-26T18:48:39] Mirono escooters: Removing a 20s10p, rip back
[2023-12-26T18:48:46] Happy Giraffe: There are different size EEB frames there but yeah
[2023-12-26T18:49:06] Mirono escooters: My friend has the original not oversized one
[2023-12-26T18:49:15] Happy Giraffe: Nah, also Dual QS8 would take space. If running 400A batt current😅
[2023-12-26T18:49:19] Mirono escooters: Idk what my frame fits. Problably over 800 cells..😂
[2023-12-26T18:49:26] Mirono escooters: If you use the Weird shape till max
[2023-12-26T18:49:33] Mirono escooters: That is nothing..
[2023-12-26T18:49:40] Mirono escooters: You really underestimate it's size inside xD
[2023-12-26T18:50:03] Mirono escooters: Go Anderson or screw terminals Really, why do you guys hate them so much? It's, the logical choice. Everyone uses it at those power levels and is a fraction of the size
[2023-12-26T18:50:48] Oreo huzky: Why that ?
[2023-12-26T18:51:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: because Kv it's something, but the max power and max torque are something else 😆
[2023-12-26T18:51:26] Happy Giraffe: Batt connection kinda needs to be easily removable if needed so dual QS8😁 Might need to make frame stronger tho but as its steel its not issue. 30kw QS138 with aggressive reduction is no joke😂
[2023-12-26T18:51:35] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Do you think if the motor have the KV to go at the Light speed you can go at this speed ? 😆
[2023-12-26T18:51:42] Oreo huzky: 350phase 150dc per motor not enough?
[2023-12-26T18:51:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's same rules for 150 300 1000 10000 ...
[2023-12-26T18:51:52] Mirono escooters: Steel ❤️
[2023-12-26T18:52:13] Mirono escooters: And the frame takes 30kw, should if it's not totally garbage
[2023-12-26T18:52:21] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Double speed are *4 of power, and speed of light are infinity of power
[2023-12-26T18:52:25] Happy Giraffe: Yes, alu is so shit🤮 weak and hard to weld properly. Will be fun to ride 25kmh on main roads with more frequent police precense
[2023-12-26T18:53:08] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Haha, if you pull 350A in 22*3 winding, you will burn the motor before to get 150 kmh haha
[2023-12-26T18:54:01] Oreo huzky: Ooof
[2023-12-26T18:54:19] Yamal: I want put 20s 10 p 40t on 22/3 any problem?
[2023-12-26T18:54:39] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: the KV change just the "Electrical Gearbox" not the capacity of the motor or his max torque
[2023-12-26T18:55:11] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: So, on 22*3 the torque and heat are close the same at 200A than 350A on the 33*2
[2023-12-26T18:55:18] Oreo huzky: Will it still burn at 20s?
[2023-12-26T18:55:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Of course, it's not the voltage who made heat, it's current vs resistor
[2023-12-26T18:56:09] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's basic electronics
[2023-12-26T18:56:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: P = R.I²
[2023-12-26T18:58:40] Oreo huzky: But it hasn’t burned yet at 20s
[2023-12-26T18:58:49] Oreo huzky: And I maxed it out
[2023-12-26T18:59:35] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Because you are too fast at max speed and the phase current drop down very fast, it dont stay long at high current due of the KV vs Batterie voltage
[2023-12-26T19:00:06] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's like if you stay in second gear on car, you Can have long accélération and then long time with torque
[2023-12-26T19:00:49] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but when you pull in 4th grear you charge a lot the motor
[2023-12-26T19:01:31] Кирилл: If 100 kmh needs 6500-8000W, then double speed (200 kmh) will need (200/100)³ × 6500-8000W = range of 52000 to 64000W continuous power besides torque
[2023-12-26T19:01:49] Oreo huzky: Will it be dangerous if I add fw
[2023-12-26T19:03:02] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: dont need 8kw to stabilized speed at 100kmh i guess
[2023-12-26T19:03:13] Кирилл: Thats why i wrote range, yep
[2023-12-26T19:03:19] Кирилл: Depends on your pose
[2023-12-26T19:03:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Approx 6000W at 100Kmh stabilised without wind and on flat road
[2023-12-26T19:03:31] Кирилл: If standing like statue, then 8kw+
[2023-12-26T19:03:35] Face de Pin Sucé: haha yes
[2023-12-26T19:03:39] Jan: "without wind"
[2023-12-26T19:03:49] Jan: Thats everything
[2023-12-26T19:04:12] Face de Pin Sucé: No, I mean, without front wind
[2023-12-26T19:04:14] Jan: ah you mean non standing
[2023-12-26T19:04:16] Jan: got it
[2023-12-26T19:04:17] Face de Pin Sucé: not without air
[2023-12-26T19:05:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: But in my case, at stabilized speed at 158kmh i consume 26~28 kW
[2023-12-26T19:06:03] Oreo huzky: Wut I consumed 27kw at 110kmh
[2023-12-26T19:06:37] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: dont confuse with acceleration power and stabilized power
[2023-12-26T19:07:07] Oreo huzky: Ah yes I frogor
[2023-12-26T19:07:22] Oreo huzky: How far is my cl350
[2023-12-26T19:07:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: You can use 40kw to do 0 to 50 kmh and 1kW only to stay in 50kmh
[2023-12-26T19:08:47] Gabe Enzo: maybe he's just fat
[2023-12-26T19:09:03] Face de Pin Sucé: hahahaah
[2023-12-26T19:09:21] Oreo huzky: Nah I weight 68kg
[2023-12-26T19:10:02] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: The weight affect a lot the accélération, but not much the max speed or stabilized speed
[2023-12-26T19:10:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's affect the stabilized speed power due of the pressure on the tyre who incrase the friction, and the surface of wind, but it's all
[2023-12-26T19:10:51] Happy Giraffe: Btw how much does your bike weigh without battery or motor? Or in total and you remove those from the amount?🤔
[2023-12-26T19:14:11] Oreo huzky: Is there any way where I can use high torque motors and go 150+ without burning them
[2023-12-26T19:14:34] Кирилл: So much voltage and less amps. And be sure to have enough kt
[2023-12-26T19:14:40] Кирилл: More than 30s
[2023-12-26T19:14:49] Mirono escooters: I have no idea
[2023-12-26T19:14:52] Mirono escooters: Yes Loads
[2023-12-26T19:16:48] Oreo huzky: Cl 350 only goes to I think 32s
[2023-12-26T19:17:10] Кирилл: No, 30s without regen and 28s with regen
[2023-12-26T19:17:38] Oreo huzky: And a way where I don’t need to go above 30s
[2023-12-26T19:17:47] Oreo huzky: Ah okay
[2023-12-26T19:18:02] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: With the same motor, whatever if you are in 20 30 or 100S you will need the same phase current to get the same accélération, the différence will be how long you will can accélérate before to 1 be limited by the voltage or 2 limited by the torque/power of the motor
[2023-12-26T19:18:57] Кирилл: You cant go too close to fets max voltage because when you accelerating and pull much phase current your voltage on esc also rises on fets. But this is the other story. So 32s can easily destroy fets as fast as you pull throttle with even not so high amps
[2023-12-26T19:19:12] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: For exemple, of 33*2 70mm whatever of you use 30S or 22S you will not go up than ~150 with double motor in the sea level with someone stand up on the scooter
[2023-12-26T19:19:38] sombre_enfant: How i can ship the postcode dont exist on packlink...
[2023-12-26T19:19:59] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and the accélération will be the same also , the acceleration are affected by the phase current, not battery voltage
[2023-12-26T19:20:32] Oreo huzky: Okay but 30s completely fine even at high current
[2023-12-26T19:21:09] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes right
[2023-12-26T19:21:29] Кирилл: Good manufactures does 100% of headroom of fets. So if you do 30s and high currents, you need atleast 180v+ for headroom for spikes and very safe and good regen
[2023-12-26T19:21:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but 30S Esc use 150V mosfet, not 126v mosfet
[2023-12-26T19:21:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: As 20S use 100V mos not 80V
[2023-12-26T19:21:51] Кирилл: Cl350 has 135v🤷
[2023-12-26T19:22:01] Кирилл: Btw you know that
[2023-12-26T19:23:13] sombre_enfant: Next season u will still use 3shul? Different motor 90h?
[2023-12-26T19:25:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: That is secret, I have an opponent in this group and we hide from each other what we are planning 😆
[2023-12-26T19:25:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: then i will dont say anything about my next config
[2023-12-26T19:26:14] Oreo huzky: Will 90h high torque still burn at 350A phase
[2023-12-26T19:27:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's not the torque who burn the motor it's current
[2023-12-26T19:28:21] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: You can have High torque will low resistor and then not over heat at high current and torque, for exemple the Sotion FW1 motor on my Surron are very low resistor, and Even 800A he doens't care
[2023-12-26T19:29:23] Oreo huzky: Okay I will ask different what’s the max current that 90h can handle
[2023-12-26T19:29:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i dont know, i even dont know about wish motor you are talking about
[2023-12-26T19:31:05] Oreo huzky: Ah he has 80h
[2023-12-26T19:31:07] Oreo huzky: https://rage-mechanics.com/moteurs-trottinettes-/1510-224-moteur-xht75.html#/53-peinture_moteur-normale_noir
[2023-12-26T19:31:41] Oreo huzky: This motor what can it handle
[2023-12-26T19:33:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Around same as your, ~200A and ~350 in Speed version, but you know it's aproximative, because of course Even the Speed version can Handle 350 constant, and you cant 200A const either
[2023-12-26T19:33:27] Happy Giraffe: I decided now to become a fusion god and make my own bicycle frame from steel to install my current components😁 bike will be maybe 12kg heavier but atleast frame will take abuse and have all the needed space inside😂 Will make nice space for battery, bigger vesc and possible mid drive motor mounts for later First prototype might not be 100% perfect but I will never learn to make anything if I dont try
[2023-12-26T19:34:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Oh you are right, i didn't know sorry
[2023-12-26T19:35:03] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Then 126v for 135v mos, it's close but probably enough if the Indian use it 😆
[2023-12-26T19:37:12] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: on Rage Mechanics Webside it is write 32S capable, Then 134.4V for 135V mosfet i will be funny firework haha
[2023-12-26T19:38:03] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: <photos/photo_11740@26-12-2023_19-38-03.jpg>
[2023-12-26T19:38:31] Кирилл: Older cl350 has 150v
[2023-12-26T19:38:54] Кирилл: Nah, 32s will not work. Hackey said himself
[2023-12-26T19:39:00] Кирилл: Instant fet kill
[2023-12-26T19:39:03] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yeah, but i am not suprised, it's like the 12v3A dc/dc it's false, even 0.5A it can't handle
[2023-12-26T19:39:16] Кирилл: Better not use it at all?
[2023-12-26T19:39:26] Кирилл: External dcdc?
[2023-12-26T19:39:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's not better or not better, you can't use it lol, if you use it Even at 1A the voltage drop down at 8V and the IC overheat and cutoff, of die depending of your luck
[2023-12-26T19:42:50] Mirono escooters: Idk, if they are a reference 😢🙈
[2023-12-26T19:43:20] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Then CL350 are not 32S but 29~30S max without Regen and not Dc/Dc C350 are 22S max without Regen, and not Dc/Dc
[2023-12-26T19:43:47] Mirono escooters: 3shul likes to overrate stuff it seems
[2023-12-26T19:43:56] Mirono escooters: The high A buck converter story was funny
[2023-12-26T19:44:25] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2023-12-26T19:44:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, it's like the mosfet, he claim 0.9 mOhms in my memory, but isn't true, it's ~1.2 mOhms mos
[2023-12-26T19:45:16] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: he claim he made it too, also false
[2023-12-26T19:45:16] Mirono escooters: Yeah I don't like their shady practices
[2023-12-26T19:45:22] Mirono escooters: Enough examples exist. I was fan, now not
[2023-12-26T19:46:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, like of a little Indian can ask factory to do better mosfet for him and for couple of mille units lol
[2023-12-26T19:46:28] Mirono escooters: Everything is possible if you really want it 😀
[2023-12-26T19:46:35] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i think even for 1Billion of mosfet the factory dont talk with you lol
[2023-12-26T19:46:54] Mirono escooters: It is indeed weird
[2023-12-26T19:47:02] Mirono escooters: But they do work And take a good beating

[2023-12-26T19:47:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Infineon dont have the best Toll mosfet at all
[2023-12-26T19:49:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes and all this spec sheet is based on what 3Shul gives as information
[2023-12-26T19:49:47] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2023-12-26T19:49:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: And when all CL will come back burned because used at 32S the Indian will assume ?
[2023-12-26T19:50:23] Mirono escooters: "can I have some information about your VESCs please 3shul"
[2023-12-26T19:51:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Let's cross fingers, anyway, Rage Mechanics will always assume the warranty in the meantime
[2023-12-26T19:51:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you should complete the information by youself, it's like that since the start with 3Shul, and obviously this is still the case with this new information about the 135V mosfet
[2023-12-26T19:52:28] Mirono escooters: I don't understand why we still support them
[2023-12-26T19:52:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, Rage Mechanicals still assumes these responsibilities, I have never denied that !
[2023-12-26T19:52:38] Mirono escooters: They are just too shady, too.. unprofessional.
[2023-12-26T19:52:44] Mirono escooters: It's not acceptable behavior
[2023-12-26T19:52:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, but he have something working !
[2023-12-26T19:53:06] Mirono escooters: If that is the baseline..

[2023-12-26T19:53:30] Mirono escooters: Goh. If I spend 1.2k or whatever on a Esc, I prefer some better company behavior
[2023-12-26T19:53:40] Mirono escooters: You guys are so rich 😂
[2023-12-26T19:53:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Now i dont run anymore 3Shul for 22S use, but for 30S still dont have many other option especially at this price
[2023-12-26T19:54:01] Mirono escooters: It's time Vedder gets on it
[2023-12-26T19:54:13] Mirono escooters: Has a legal department
[2023-12-26T19:54:24] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Vedder are lost, look the official vesc choices ...
[2023-12-26T19:54:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Even the last one ... many features useless, and the performance are still not egual at something at the same price in the market
[2023-12-26T19:55:16] Mirono escooters: But it works and isn't as noisy as a radio antenna :)
[2023-12-26T19:55:52] Mirono escooters: And doesn't come with heaps of issues, vague statements and shady not following gpl stuff And I forgot UK company. Bit more spensive then indian
[2023-12-26T19:56:04] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Did you verify it ? with Spectrum analyzer ?
[2023-12-26T19:56:24] Mirono escooters: I wish I have that equipment and time
[2023-12-26T19:56:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yeah, but for me he overspec too
[2023-12-26T19:56:45] Mirono escooters: But I trust Vedder and his redesigning over years the same product Then some Indian who makes one in a month or 2
[2023-12-26T19:56:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it is just 12 Tolt mos who dont have crazy specs at all
[2023-12-26T19:57:09] Paolo ⁭: Don't recommend you to ship, it doesn't worth
[2023-12-26T19:57:30] Mirono escooters: But everyone buys what he wants and suits his needs :)
[2023-12-26T19:57:32] sombre_enfant: Wym my brother ?
[2023-12-26T19:57:40] Mirono escooters: But for now, I stay away from them
[2023-12-26T19:57:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: many 75/300 explode too ...
[2023-12-26T19:57:57] Paolo ⁭: High shipping fee, and they will ask you to pay
[2023-12-26T19:58:08] Mirono escooters: They dont have a bad DCDC, noise everywhere and shady stuff (ignoring the not respecting warranty directly to 3shul)
[2023-12-26T19:58:13] sombre_enfant: Ah shit, u have a price idea ?
[2023-12-26T19:58:15] Mirono escooters: But I am falling in repetition

[2023-12-26T20:10:02] Mirono escooters: It will end with spintend I have no respect for such behavior. It's Not their fault you killed it This is why companies make such a problem about warranty, and small companies suffer. It's ego behavior
[2023-12-26T20:10:06] sombre_enfant: At the end of the day they all have same motor conponent frame c'est le pilote qui fait la diff

[2023-12-26T20:57:39] Happy Giraffe: That batt cable doesnt look that thick in the pictures to carry 400A DC current

[2023-12-27T08:41:29] Nirel: Who know why I get disconnected from the motor?
[2023-12-27T08:41:56] Nirel: 140 amp phase and in middle acceleration this show me over current and disconnected from the motors
[2023-12-27T08:58:29] Nirel: With 130amp it’s ok
[2023-12-27T09:05:37] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes
[2023-12-27T09:28:29] Oreo huzky: How much?
[2023-12-27T10:04:18] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 3.5 if you want no problem, they will not explode
[2023-12-27T10:34:04] sombre_enfant: Yes now it wasnt here back then
[2023-12-27T11:34:44] Tommy ª: Mks Shitsky is blue or white
[2023-12-27T11:45:50] Rose: Hey there Guillermo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-27T12:00:33] Yamal: This is in home ? Or out side riding ,,?
[2023-12-27T12:07:39] Mirono escooters: Abs overcurrent🤷
[2023-12-27T12:20:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure is it a good idea ,lot to learn, also steel or alu welding with it is really different , really depends what you want to do , Also you might need more than just a welder, what if you need to mill something More tools upcoming and more to learn Maybe by this fact you need some who already has the tools and the knowledge
[2023-12-27T12:35:38] Unknown: https://youtu.be/l12JMohNEv0?si=xf2q7Kl--o20OZ-a
[2023-12-27T12:36:09] Unknown: This seems interesting
[2023-12-27T12:44:23] haku: thats true. i will get a pro to do this. but i do want to learn this skill someday.
[2023-12-27T12:50:38] Konstantin: Cool, yesterday saw on GitHub this feature xD
[2023-12-27T12:53:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think we were talking about such half years ago
[2023-12-27T13:15:51] Mihail: Very cool! Would be interesting to use it for generating futuristic or funny motor sounds. Maybe even a soft horn
[2023-12-27T13:17:16] haku: it is. i dont know if that is practical in everyday applications though. very cool anyways
[2023-12-27T13:33:52] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: so nice, do he shared the exact code he use to I try?
[2023-12-27T14:03:25] Ion: Out of interest, what is causing phase current limiting in this case? It stays at ~130A max, then battery current limit kicks in
[2023-12-27T14:04:14] Ion: It's set to 165A phase, 50A battery in settings. The ripple you see at close to 100% duty is FW, so ignore
[2023-12-27T14:59:08] Wolve666: good morning, I have a Kaabo Wolf Warrior 11 scooter with motors without hall and 35ah 60v Samsung 35e 100A battery, can you advise me on a good setting for a Ubox V2 spintend?
[2023-12-27T16:00:58] Tommy ª: @kawaiinekololis im using the m365 with the script everything ok but i cant figure to make work the ebrake, it just shutters and im getting only 10-15amps (i set at 30) i already calibrated the brake lever but same the thorttle and modes work as normal
[2023-12-27T16:02:02] Izuna 生活: You can't do anything about it. It's a bug with VESC 6.02 and the script, which was fixed with the new 6.05 ADC script.
[2023-12-27T16:02:49] Tommy ª: yep, im gonna to try
[2023-12-27T16:08:50] Mirono escooters: Resistances here and there? Wich motor?
[2023-12-27T16:14:40] Rose: Hey there Josias, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-27T16:21:12] Yamal: @thejosias 🎩
[2023-12-27T17:08:09] Ion: Sounds reasonable yea, Vsett 10+ hub
[2023-12-27T17:10:13] Mirono escooters: Is your speed off?
[2023-12-27T17:38:06] Ion: You mean wheel diameter? It's accurate enough. This was acceleration from 0 to 50 kmh
[2023-12-27T17:39:34] Mirono escooters: Batterij doesn't sag too much , Problably not hitting VESCs undervoltage limiting?
[2023-12-27T17:45:12] Ion: I'll take a look at the log and retry. Tho I do remember it sagging about 5V in some cases (cold and mostly empty).
[2023-12-27T17:45:26] Ion: This was with 70% tho
[2023-12-27T17:45:36] Mirono escooters: Check what your undervoltage is set to
[2023-12-27T17:45:50] Mirono escooters: The limiting one Altough I doubt its that
[2023-12-27T17:46:00] Mirono escooters: I'm more thinking resistances and or a bad motor config
[2023-12-27T17:53:10] sombre_enfant: @Happy_Giraffe wich courrier u used for spintend
[2023-12-27T17:54:16] Mirono escooters: Ah 13s, good point
[2023-12-27T18:02:41] Happy Giraffe: Cant remember anymore, I try to check
[2023-12-27T18:03:31] sombre_enfant: Broooo
[2023-12-27T18:05:10] Happy Giraffe: Used local Postnord😂 bruh it was like 2+ years ago
[2023-12-27T18:05:28] Mirono escooters: Go hand it in person 👀
[2023-12-27T18:05:49] sombre_enfant: What postcode u used i cant use it...
[2023-12-27T18:06:09] sombre_enfant: Im half black man😔😑
[2023-12-27T18:06:32] Mirono escooters: Uh
[2023-12-27T18:06:36] Mirono escooters: Im missing something
[2023-12-27T18:06:53] Tommy ª: no way
[2023-12-27T18:09:19] Mirono escooters: Script 6.05 on 6.02?
[2023-12-27T18:09:43] Tommy ª: 05
[2023-12-27T18:09:54] Mirono escooters: Ö
[2023-12-27T18:10:19] Happy Giraffe: What I used back then
[2023-12-27T18:10:36] Tommy ª: idk if i broke something
[2023-12-27T18:12:14] sombre_enfant: Yeah unfindable
[2023-12-27T18:15:29] Happy Giraffe: Try DHL and UPS
[2023-12-27T18:22:07] Tommy ª: casually with the g30 works as normal, just the m365
[2023-12-27T18:28:51] Ion: I remember the same error on 6.05 with old G30 ADC script, before it was updated a few weeks ago
[2023-12-27T18:29:18] Ion: @kawaiinekololis did you push all the updates from the G30 script over to m365?
[2023-12-27T18:30:12] Ion: yes, but that looks to be happening later in the graph (at the point battery amps reach 50, you can see motor amps decrease)
[2023-12-27T18:30:57] Ion: but yea ofc :) I'm pushing the tiny 13S4P battery quite a bit, so it's fine for me
[2023-12-27T18:32:21] Mirono escooters: Yeah same issue on G30 NoW fixed
[2023-12-27T18:32:24] Mirono escooters: Never used Xiaomi
[2023-12-27T18:32:49] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2023-12-27T18:33:36] Mirono escooters: Dhl will be spensiv I'm afraid
[2023-12-27T18:41:22] Paolo ⁭: You can use as well 518100
[2023-12-27T18:43:08] sombre_enfant: This ?
[2023-12-27T18:44:27] Paolo ⁭: Try writing "shenzhen"
[2023-12-27T18:44:35] Paolo ⁭: Then maybe will compare it
[2023-12-27T18:44:51] Paolo ⁭: And after write the whole address
[2023-12-27T18:45:13] Paolo ⁭: But since the company will pay tax，is cheaper buy new
[2023-12-27T18:46:20] sombre_enfant: How much tax ? She said to put 30€...free repair
[2023-12-27T18:46:38] sombre_enfant: New is 180€... With ship and taxes
[2023-12-27T18:47:35] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't even bother
[2023-12-27T18:47:43] Happy Giraffe: What are you buying? If James has it then buy from him
[2023-12-27T18:47:50] sombre_enfant: I can ship with my local for 30€
[2023-12-27T18:48:27] sombre_enfant: I will get a new one from a friend dont worry, i would like to repair this one if its for around 50€
[2023-12-27T18:49:01] Happy Giraffe: We need vesc repairshop in EU😁
[2023-12-27T18:49:53] Happy Giraffe: Spintend pays them 20€, customer pays 20€ and boom its financially possible to repair if takes less than one hour
[2023-12-27T18:50:19] Mirono escooters: The French can do some stuff
[2023-12-27T18:50:26] Mirono escooters: I can do basic stuff But it's ususally not worth it
[2023-12-27T18:50:43] Tommy ª: nvm, i tried the adc, awd and normal, same fault
[2023-12-27T18:51:00] sombre_enfant: Raphaël is doing it not really worth it for a 75100 tho
[2023-12-27T18:51:02] Paolo ⁭: Only shipping to China is 50€
[2023-12-27T18:51:12] sombre_enfant: 30€ for me
[2023-12-27T18:51:17] Mirono escooters: + tax
[2023-12-27T18:51:41] sombre_enfant: No tax i have method
[2023-12-27T18:51:45] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-12-27T18:51:48] Paolo ⁭: + repair fee
[2023-12-27T18:52:04] Mirono escooters: Under 50 no bueno
[2023-12-27T18:53:25] Mirono escooters: Just keep the thing as spares
[2023-12-27T18:53:30] Mirono escooters: I got a box full of dead VESCs xd
[2023-12-27T18:53:34] sombre_enfant: She said for free
[2023-12-27T18:53:53] sombre_enfant: Idk if she has to pay shipping fee to get it
[2023-12-27T18:54:07] sombre_enfant: Wich vesc ?
[2023-12-27T18:55:32] Mirono escooters: Random ones
[2023-12-27T18:56:26] sombre_enfant: Ah yes the random vesc package
[2023-12-27T18:57:13] Happy Giraffe: Spintend should pay Raphael to do it. If they pay with you it's far easier but Amy brain not braining😂
[2023-12-27T18:58:04] Mirono escooters: Tis a box full, I have no idea what is what
[2023-12-27T18:58:11] Mirono escooters: Some 75200, some spintends, 75100, ...
[2023-12-27T18:58:17] Mirono escooters: They'll never
[2023-12-27T18:58:41] Happy Giraffe: Yup, that's the problem. Easy in UK if trampa repairs locally
[2023-12-27T18:59:10] sombre_enfant: They might collab who knows
[2023-12-27T18:59:26] Mirono escooters: Why would they make it easier? For them to cost more money?
[2023-12-27T18:59:39] Mirono escooters: It doesn't make sense Yes it does for a honest world But not this one
[2023-12-27T19:01:16] sombre_enfant: Actually they could sell the powerstage or logic
[2023-12-27T19:01:20] Happy Giraffe: They could have a larger market in EU to have local repair and warranty
[2023-12-27T19:02:07] Happy Giraffe: But they are a bit delulu in every way
[2023-12-27T19:04:46] Mirono escooters: Thats another topic
[2023-12-27T19:05:00] Mirono escooters: €€€
[2023-12-27T19:05:07] Mirono escooters: No small Chinese company is going to do that
[2023-12-27T19:05:16] Mirono escooters: Europa too expensive, simple as that..
[2023-12-27T19:05:31] sombre_enfant: Powerstage should be cheap asl tho and fix the vesc 1/2 time
[2023-12-27T19:05:57] Mirono escooters: Why sell that for cheap, when they'll buy a new vesc for more €?
[2023-12-27T19:06:02] Mirono escooters: It's all business..
[2023-12-27T19:06:17] Mirono escooters: They aren't going to treat you like friends and do honest stuff because it's the best..😂
[2023-12-27T19:07:08] Happy Giraffe: Yes, need volume for support. But having that would make it a winner against other vescs in EU
[2023-12-27T19:07:18] Mirono escooters: 🤷 they won't..
[2023-12-27T19:07:34] Happy Giraffe: They lack marketing and a strategy
[2023-12-27T19:08:05] Mirono escooters: No, they are a dirt cheap small Chinese company with no interest in that stuff
[2023-12-27T19:08:13] Mirono escooters: It's normal. It doesn't make sense on this scale.
[2023-12-27T19:08:26] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, Amy makes sure of it😂
[2023-12-27T19:10:17] Happy Giraffe: Flipsky needs to be overtaken by Spintend but they need more power in their design
[2023-12-27T19:10:21] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-12-27T19:10:49] Mirono escooters: Flipsky >spintend Sry
[2023-12-27T19:10:59] Mirono escooters: 75200 is pretty powerful
[2023-12-27T19:11:15] Mirono escooters: Artem was gonna influence SPintend long ago Till he ran off😢😂
[2023-12-27T19:11:57] sombre_enfant: She didnt want...
[2023-12-27T19:18:13] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, sad he turned to dark side like Mike
[2023-12-27T19:19:04] Mirono escooters: Big shame, yeah.
[2023-12-27T19:19:17] Mirono escooters: I never liked him that much Guess my spider senses worked
[2023-12-27T19:19:21] haku: what do you mean dark side? like the sith fardriver user?
[2023-12-27T19:19:33] Mirono escooters: No, he scammed a few people and left
[2023-12-27T19:20:20] Paolo ⁭: With batteries ?
[2023-12-27T19:20:32] haku: what. he was cool to me. he was gonna replace my broken spinny. i just did not want to bother his with his time
[2023-12-27T19:20:44] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-12-27T19:20:57] Happy Giraffe: Yeah I dont understand that, I usually take payment after job is done but if I fail to provide its 100% money return
[2023-12-27T19:21:00] Mirono escooters: Meowdrone or whatev, then someone on fb, the whole Facebook spiny group was a hot mess
[2023-12-27T19:21:08] Mirono escooters: He did a exit scam
[2023-12-27T19:21:25] Mirono escooters: Excuse was "things were bad" but, no reason. Especially since he never refunded
[2023-12-27T19:21:40] Gabe Enzo: I give free tyre changes if the tyre pops a week after I install it.
[2023-12-27T19:21:43] Happy Giraffe: If someone did that to me they would find burned house and some bullet holes😂
[2023-12-27T19:21:54] Mirono escooters: Go find him then
[2023-12-27T19:22:02] Happy Giraffe: Didnt scam me😂
[2023-12-27T19:22:46] haku: he was cool to me bros. hope he comes back here
[2023-12-27T19:23:06] Mirono escooters: He won't and he isn't welcome
[2023-12-27T19:23:28] Happy Giraffe: Its same in spain if house squatters arrive, pay mafia to remove them or do it yourself😁
[2023-12-27T19:23:32] haku: jeez. cant we forgive amd move on
[2023-12-27T19:23:47] Happy Giraffe: No if he scammed 4000€ idk amount but its lot
[2023-12-27T19:24:01] Happy Giraffe: Batteries expensive af
[2023-12-27T19:24:20] Mirono escooters: Ahum, will you refund meowdrone
[2023-12-27T19:25:09] haku: i am not artem lol. he just dm to help me
[2023-12-27T19:25:23] Mirono escooters: I mean, if you want him back, you pay off his debts xd
[2023-12-27T19:25:34] Mirono escooters: Cant forgive the thousands € he scammed
[2023-12-27T19:25:37] Happy Giraffe: You will be added to scam line
[2023-12-27T19:25:57] haku: noo. im a good guy
[2023-12-27T19:26:17] Paolo ⁭: Sometimes people left business because of high demand for warranty or refund when the problem was of user, that's exactly why I left the business and being trader😁 The pressure is very high
[2023-12-27T19:26:43] Mirono escooters: Ahum, meowdrone bought bare cells and never got them
[2023-12-27T19:26:49] Mirono escooters: That is not a user problem
[2023-12-27T19:26:51] Paolo ⁭: I don't know if was his case
[2023-12-27T19:26:56] Mirono escooters: Why do we even defend him?
[2023-12-27T19:27:03] Paolo ⁭: But I did cuz of dis
[2023-12-27T19:27:17] Paolo ⁭: I don't defend him, I don't even know what happened
[2023-12-27T19:27:20] Mirono escooters: 🤷 it's a shame Excactly why Chinese companies will never settle in eu
[2023-12-27T19:27:22] Paolo ⁭: I just talking for me
[2023-12-27T19:27:30] Mirono escooters: And reason why small companies don't last or go extinct
[2023-12-27T19:28:36] haku: i have nothing to do with the dark side i swear
[2023-12-27T19:28:36] Mirono escooters: If I ever produce VESCs, no warranty xD
[2023-12-27T19:28:43] Mirono escooters: Sus
[2023-12-27T19:28:54] Mirono escooters: I once 3DP Darth Vader helmet. I'll show later
[2023-12-27T19:29:12] Paolo ⁭: That's why Amazon is the biggest e-commerce with 0 profit 😅 they earn because they refund everything, and with all the company cost they earn nothing
[2023-12-27T19:29:14] Happy Giraffe: You can deny warranty if customer damaged product with abuse but yeah EU is very seller heavy and pats criminals and law abusers on head
[2023-12-27T19:29:25] Paolo ⁭: Amazon earns basically from AWS only
[2023-12-27T19:29:38] Happy Giraffe: And thats why brands leave amazon leaving the low quality shit being sold there
[2023-12-27T19:29:44] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-12-27T19:29:53] Happy Giraffe: Amazon became aliexpress
[2023-12-27T19:30:14] Mirono escooters: Just quicker
[2023-12-27T19:30:39] Paolo ⁭: Yes, but they go to every group and doing negative post 😂
[2023-12-27T19:30:50] Mirono escooters: Ye : D
[2023-12-27T19:30:53] Happy Giraffe: Yep, works if you have prime and price about same
[2023-12-27T19:31:02] Paolo ⁭: Like what rosch did with tronic😂❤️
[2023-12-27T19:31:21] Mirono escooters: Some brands on alieexpress tho, I use for thermalpaste and whatnot
[2023-12-27T19:31:22] Happy Giraffe: Yeahh, but if your reputation is solid and product good you will be fine
[2023-12-27T19:31:38] Mirono escooters: Problably
[2023-12-27T19:31:46] Mirono escooters: Vesc market dangerous
[2023-12-27T19:32:10] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I should have used cheaper paste on my charger box but only had noctua in hand. Anyway 1€ vs 3€ doesnt matter if happens once, atleast paste wont dry😂
[2023-12-27T19:32:45] Happy Giraffe: Just needs good product page with a good specs and features explanation etc
[2023-12-27T19:33:06] Happy Giraffe: Which chinese companies fail 95% of the time. Also in EU its a load of crap usually
[2023-12-27T19:33:15] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-12-27T19:33:19] Paolo ⁭: You can't even know how much AliExpress sellers goes scammed
[2023-12-27T19:33:25] Mirono escooters: For now I can only make manuals 💀
[2023-12-27T19:33:57] Happy Giraffe: Amazon refunded my usb c 144hz portable monitor before it even arrived to them
[2023-12-27T19:34:40] Happy Giraffe: Tho I have bought 800€+ worth from there so it isnt like I abuse system. Also nice to buy 3D printer from there if Creality wants to fuck me😂
[2023-12-27T19:34:41] Paolo ⁭: And that's why I stopped selling on Amazon too😢
[2023-12-27T19:35:10] Happy Giraffe: It's good and bad at the same time. Buyer is protected but seller possibly fucked in ass😂
[2023-12-27T19:35:23] haku: this is why i directly buy in ali now. amazon is just ali with bezos tax
[2023-12-27T19:35:46] Happy Giraffe: It's like nowadays society, everyone has too much rights but little responsibility required from individuals

[2023-12-27T19:45:24] Mirono escooters: Any tech giant
[2023-12-27T19:45:51] Happy Giraffe: Nvidia AI makes a bank but now with China restrictions it might slow down a bit
[2023-12-27T19:49:19] sombre_enfant: 😅😅
[2023-12-27T19:52:07] Gabe Enzo: Competing against Tesla would be incredibly easy in theory.
[2023-12-27T19:53:18] haku: alot of china companies tried. neo etc. also US companies too. never seen a finished product from them
[2023-12-27T19:53:48] haku: im really hoping there will be a tesla competitor
[2023-12-27T19:54:14] Gabe Enzo: It seems all electric competitors have a secret contract to make low powered electric shit to lick Tesla ass.
[2023-12-27T19:54:20] Gabe Enzo: I'm unsure why.
[2023-12-27T19:54:23] Gabe Enzo: Like BMW etc
[2023-12-27T19:54:40] Gabe Enzo: With the BMW i3 and golf
[2023-12-27T19:54:56] haku: yea. idk why they use tesla tech. they should have thier own

[2023-12-27T20:00:35] Happy Giraffe: I would just want a smaller electric car with 200km range and 20,000€ price tag but thats too much to ask😁
[2023-12-27T20:00:43] Gabe Enzo: You can make one.
[2023-12-27T20:00:46] Mirono escooters: Compare the prices..

[2023-12-27T21:42:15] Tommy ª: But its from Github :'0
[2023-12-27T21:44:04] Tommy ª: Also actually the m365 is shorter than the g30 :s
[2023-12-27T21:44:32] Izuna 生活: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/tree/6_05_adc
[2023-12-27T21:44:38] Izuna 生活: pull it from the correct branch
[2023-12-27T21:44:42] Izuna 生活: there are different versions
[2023-12-27T21:44:55] Izuna 生活: main is for 6.02, 6_05_adc for vesc 6.05
[2023-12-27T21:47:07] Tommy ª: same thing
[2023-12-27T21:49:29] Mirono escooters: Did you update the Xiaomi script with the G30 error fix?
[2023-12-27T21:52:38] Tommy ª: i tried the g30 ((obviously knowing it wont work)) and no problems (except the screen not working, also no errors) also im not get any error if i unplug the screen
[2023-12-27T21:53:08] Tommy ª: casually screen fault? (i use 090 firmware)
[2023-12-27T21:53:28] Mirono escooters: Shouldn't get error if no screen tho?
[2023-12-27T21:53:45] Mirono escooters: Original or afterparty

[2023-12-27T22:59:41] Izuna 生活: hm
[2023-12-27T22:59:53] Izuna 生活: either the fix that I done was not applied to the m365 script
[2023-12-27T22:59:54] Izuna 生活: ooor
[2023-12-27T22:59:58] Izuna 生活: vesc has updated smth again
[2023-12-27T23:00:10] Izuna 生活: one sec
[2023-12-27T23:00:31] Izuna 生活: i think its my fault since I am only using G30 script
[2023-12-27T23:01:48] Izuna 生活: yeah i'm dumb
[2023-12-27T23:01:55] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2023-12-27T23:03:19] Izuna 生活: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/blob/6_05_adc/m365_dash.lisp ok try again

[2023-12-28T01:23:19] Mirono escooters: Thats, weird
[2023-12-28T01:26:16] Tommy ª: some bug list: >the field weakening gets some broken sometimes, the motor start to vibrates until you apply the script again >secret modes dont work unless you apply 100% deadband >min speed dont work >watts apply sometimes gets stuck at 400w (eco) >you can turn on the light with the scooter locked
[2023-12-28T01:28:15] Mirono escooters: G30 has none of those issues 😶
[2023-12-28T01:28:32] Mirono escooters: Light idk, I don't use lock
[2023-12-28T01:28:42] Mirono escooters: Secret mode thing defo not on g30
[2023-12-28T01:33:30] Tommy ª: i got various times a moron trying to stole it, i always lock it bruh also there is a lot of police stops for check the max speed
[2023-12-28T01:34:41] Mirono escooters: Sry, I meant electric lock
[2023-12-28T01:34:51] Mirono escooters: I turn display off and use a proper bike lock :)
[2023-12-28T01:35:04] Mirono escooters: I've never been stopped to check my speed
[2023-12-28T01:38:13] Tommy ª: nah they are so lazzy for broke a lock they just try to turn it up and run, if its locked they just ignores it this city is weird
[2023-12-28T01:38:55] Unknown: The i8
[2023-12-28T01:43:08] Mirono escooters: That's far from safe enough
[2023-12-28T01:43:15] Mirono escooters: A bike lock takes 10s
[2023-12-28T01:47:23] Gabe Enzo: I use a bike lock and a kryptonite chain. Mix it up for the robbers a bit.
[2023-12-28T01:47:50] Gabe Enzo: 2 locks makes them ignore it usually too. they look for an easier target.
[2023-12-28T01:48:03] Gabe Enzo: They wanna be seen in public for the least possible time
[2023-12-28T02:02:49] haku: hey are scooters big in new york? or mostly ebikes?
[2023-12-28T02:07:34] haku: i mean scooter modding
[2023-12-28T02:10:34] Gabe Enzo: It's not popular anywhere. normies don't know what a motor even is.
[2023-12-28T02:10:47] Gabe Enzo: My customers think their engines are at the rear on their pro 2s
[2023-12-28T02:11:00] Gabe Enzo: They're mind boggled when I tell them it's at the front
[2023-12-28T02:11:52] haku: i meant lots of ebike modders compared to scooter modders is what ive noticed
[2023-12-28T02:12:02] Gabe Enzo: I've only ever seen two.
[2023-12-28T02:12:04] Gabe Enzo: Yea
[2023-12-28T02:12:19] Gabe Enzo: think I've seen a scooter with a bag
[2023-12-28T02:13:02] haku: ive seen a burn-e with pmts and a stock gt2. very rare where i live
[2023-12-28T02:13:33] haku: a modded fido too
[2023-12-28T02:14:52] haku: alot of onewheels
[2023-12-28T02:28:34] Gabe Enzo: basically every Xiaomi driver here is driving on flat tyres
[2023-12-28T02:28:36] Gabe Enzo: it's hilarious
[2023-12-28T02:30:01] Tommy ª: same here, "its like that from about 8 months" man i cant drive the mine with less than 20 psi 😭
[2023-12-28T03:05:32] Happy Giraffe: Anyone had proper batt designer link? I only need dimensions on how many cells a space could take
[2023-12-28T04:09:45] Jhinzuo ~~: https://e4bike.ru/page/battery-shape-configurator
[2023-12-28T04:52:53] haku: anyone know what this means? i keep getting this message on bambu printer
[2023-12-28T04:55:47] haku: nvm im a dummy. i think i did not put the magnet thingy proprerly
[2023-12-28T04:56:36] haku: this printer isnt fully stupid proof 😂
[2023-12-28T05:19:18] haku: https://cellsaviors.com/battery-pack-designer?fbclid=IwAR3jfHsP3AweCOKIPrglNVWpgACKHZlaJpTuIs2d-Q7NR57twLbIzfCJWtw
[2023-12-28T06:14:30] haku: yea tried it a few times with little knick knacks. it prints fine with generic petg preset. i think i still have to mess with the settings to make it perfect
[2023-12-28T06:15:05] haku: i noticed my petg can crack sometimes. overture brand
[2023-12-28T06:16:34] haku: oh dang. that looks wierd. i really dont know what to tell you bro. im pretty new at this 😂. maybe @Happy_Giraffe can help
[2023-12-28T06:17:46] Face de Pin Sucé: What settings are you using ?
[2023-12-28T06:17:49] haku: mine looked like this with generic
[2023-12-28T06:18:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Because honestly, before having a Bambu, I've never really used 3D printings, but with Bambu, so easy to have a perfect result
[2023-12-28T06:18:30] Face de Pin Sucé: PETG Preset ?
[2023-12-28T06:19:11] Face de Pin Sucé: So weird
[2023-12-28T06:19:31] haku: that looks nice.
[2023-12-28T06:19:39] Face de Pin Sucé: This is with petg bambu filament?
[2023-12-28T06:19:55] Face de Pin Sucé: So weird
[2023-12-28T06:19:55] haku: did use the generic bambu benchy?
[2023-12-28T06:20:14] Face de Pin Sucé: But have to say, never tried bambu filament x)
[2023-12-28T06:20:55] haku: i see. maybe thats why. the generic bambu one works well
[2023-12-28T06:21:38] haku: idk bro. im really still learning this.
[2023-12-28T06:23:27] haku: then generic bambu you can even read the plate number of the boat. its pla though
[2023-12-28T06:32:04] haku: maybe that color petg is a bad batch. if all the black ones come out like that.
[2023-12-28T06:34:58] haku: im such a dummy i was printing right now and thinking wtf is going on print not sticking then i notice no print plate😂
[2023-12-28T06:36:28] Unknown: Good morning 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2023-12-28T06:50:22] Happy Giraffe: Can you make new g code from slicer and preview the way it makes layers
[2023-12-28T06:50:41] Happy Giraffe: Maybe there you find something interesting
[2023-12-28T06:56:20] Happy Giraffe: Maybe @Mirono_escooters has ideas
[2023-12-28T07:00:00] haku: does it only happen when you use black petg?
[2023-12-28T07:03:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe your PETG is fucked up
[2023-12-28T07:04:49] Happy Giraffe: That can also be, if dried on heated bed and melted idk. But that would mean 80°c direct contact🤔
[2023-12-28T07:05:26] Happy Giraffe: Only way would be to take different roll of petg and try
[2023-12-28T07:07:27] Happy Giraffe: Tinmorry is my favourite, never failed on me. Tried some eSun or other PLA and crap came out of printbed, never with Tinmorry😳
[2023-12-28T07:10:37] haku: i had trouble on my first petg batch and asked reddit this is what they said.
[2023-12-28T07:11:09] haku: i never followed up though
[2023-12-28T07:12:49] Happy Giraffe: Do a manual settings run I would say 80mm/s speed, 240°c nozzle, grid support, 2x nozzle size walls. 30% fanspeed. Minimum layer time 10s with improved cooling.
[2023-12-28T07:13:59] Happy Giraffe: Retract settings idk exactly for Bambu but Im using 40mm/s 0.9mm on direct drive extruder
[2023-12-28T07:14:34] haku: honestly i dont even know how to change settings 😭
[2023-12-28T07:15:26] Happy Giraffe: Also possible to download benchy from thingiverse and putting it to slicer and doing all manually
[2023-12-28T07:15:59] Happy Giraffe: Idk if you use model/gcode provided by Bambu
[2023-12-28T07:16:42] haku: yes there is one. its saved on the micro sd card
[2023-12-28T08:15:05] Happy Giraffe: And it worked for you?
[2023-12-28T08:16:01] haku: yes on pla. never tried a petg benchie
[2023-12-28T09:45:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ooo🙈
[2023-12-28T09:50:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wish i could help you do the setup ,but me not enough familiar

[2023-12-28T09:53:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He has huge experience with lot printer types and also has lot printers

[2023-12-28T10:13:58] Face de Pin Sucé: This is my best mate for printing
[2023-12-28T10:14:45] Mirono escooters: Nooo😢😢😢
[2023-12-28T10:14:52] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-12-28T10:15:01] Face de Pin Sucé: hahaha
[2023-12-28T10:15:06] Mirono escooters: Unless you print with super weird non sticky materials..
[2023-12-28T10:15:22] Mirono escooters: Bare glass.. perfect. I can lift whole printer with it when warm Pops off when cold
[2023-12-28T10:15:24] Face de Pin Sucé: I like to use insane speed of bambu with PETG
[2023-12-28T10:15:29] Mirono escooters: 3Dlac only needed for very big prints
[2023-12-28T10:15:52] Face de Pin Sucé: and I do big prints with sketchy shapes sometimes
[2023-12-28T10:16:18] Face de Pin Sucé: recently printed a mudguard for speedway leger, so, it had a very small surface on the bed

[2023-12-28T13:32:37] Gabe Enzo: Can anyone who is experienced in printers tell me why Ultimaker Cura is saying that my Ender 3 Pro Bed is smaller than it actually is? I'm unable to print something that is clearly small enough for the build plate. It won't let me slice.
[2023-12-28T13:33:36] Gabe Enzo: My printer literally cannot print spacers unless there is a skirt. It simply is unable to do so. the plastic needs to start flowing before it begins to print the first layer of the spacer.
[2023-12-28T13:34:36] Finn: Copper Bus Bar for my MP2😂
[2023-12-28T13:34:57] Finn: 2mm should be enough
[2023-12-28T13:35:16] Gabe Enzo: my printer is a tad bit bigger than the setting for Ender 3 Pro. It seems it uses the code for the ender 3. that is incorrect. The preset is to ender 3 Pro
[2023-12-28T13:37:32] Mirono escooters: No, you lose dimensions with skirt
[2023-12-28T13:37:36] Mirono escooters: (The gray area)
[2023-12-28T13:48:58] Gabe Enzo: I found a way to force it to print the skirt before, I think it was by using creality slicer.
[2023-12-28T14:03:23] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-12-28T14:03:27] Finn: Xd
[2023-12-28T14:03:30] Mirono escooters: You always print the skirt before
[2023-12-28T14:03:39] cihan: My scooter is just at 800km but I feel like front wheel bearings are out of oil, I hear some extra noise comparing past. Do you have a grease recommendation?
[2023-12-28T14:04:31] cihan: Should I also change the bearings once I dismantle it? It's a ninebot f2 pro. I think I'll use SKF for bearing, is there a better option?
[2023-12-28T14:06:11] Mirono escooters: Yeah I have this too
[2023-12-28T14:06:20] Mirono escooters: Just fill the bearing with new grease Not oil Replacing isn't needed
[2023-12-28T14:22:35] Gabe Enzo: It won't let me print the skirt bro
[2023-12-28T14:23:34] Gabe Enzo: I'm unsure why.
[2023-12-28T14:24:17] Gabe Enzo: claims it's out of bounds
[2023-12-28T14:24:42] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-12-28T14:26:45] Gabe Enzo: Heeeeeeelp mirono
[2023-12-28T14:26:54] Gabe Enzo: don't be ableist
[2023-12-28T14:45:06] cihan: Thank you, do you have favorite brand and viscosity? I think I need more viscous grease since old one has gone bad too quickly.
[2023-12-28T14:45:22] Mirono escooters: The local shop has bearing grease
[2023-12-28T14:45:34] Mirono escooters: Original is barely greased, don't worry
[2023-12-28T14:45:45] Mirono escooters: Just get bearing grease. I can check the brand, but it's just generic grease
[2023-12-28T14:52:56] Mirono escooters: Anyone know the max switching frequency for a makerbase 75100 alupcb?
[2023-12-28T14:53:24] Mirono escooters: Zero vector frequency is now 30khz
[2023-12-28T14:55:11] Rose: Hey there Pedro Leal, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-28T14:57:06] Rose: Hey there Dharmendra Chauhan, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-28T15:05:46] Rose: Hey there 🛸 Kathr!n Und!ne 🛸, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-28T15:48:38] haku: are you using the correct nozzle size on the slicer?
[2023-12-28T15:52:13] haku: its only that one part of the ships hull that gets messed up.
[2023-12-28T15:53:47] Happy Giraffe: If you use petg without compensation it will always have "elephants foot"
[2023-12-28T15:55:02] haku: thats what it is. i just shave those off with a deburring tool
[2023-12-28T15:55:54] Happy Giraffe: Try more😂 I went 30-31 just for shits and giggles. Didn't change anything
[2023-12-28T15:56:00] haku: ill mess around more with petg and see if i can replicate james issue
[2023-12-28T15:56:20] Mirono escooters: You mean 60?
[2023-12-28T15:56:34] Mirono escooters: Zero vector frequency*
[2023-12-28T15:56:56] Happy Giraffe: Have selected wrong printer in slicer
[2023-12-28T15:57:24] Happy Giraffe: And wrong print area
[2023-12-28T16:02:11] Happy Giraffe: No, 31khz. I gotta double check when connected to bike
[2023-12-28T16:04:04] Mirono escooters: But stock is 30
[2023-12-28T16:04:12] Mirono escooters: /2 is like 15khz
[2023-12-28T16:04:17] Mirono escooters: And Xiaomi Esc can do 16 lolol
[2023-12-28T16:31:53] cihan: Thank you. I think the manufacturer uses a grease considering the rider is 80kg average. I could use a more viscous oil since I'm heavier than 80kg. I'm not sure if it's a good idea though.
[2023-12-28T16:32:17] Mirono escooters: No, use real bearing grease
[2023-12-28T16:32:21] Mirono escooters: Oil just goes away to quickly
[2023-12-28T16:32:31] Mirono escooters: They just use cheap, little grease
[2023-12-28T16:39:39] puneDir: <photos/photo_11770@28-12-2023_16-39-39.jpg>

[2023-12-28T16:40:20] puneDir: I have 2 of them Has really nice light Its like car headlight Focused on a line
[2023-12-28T16:40:25] puneDir: Wont make everyone blind
[2023-12-28T16:40:25] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-28T16:54:05] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I didnt halve or double just put 1khz more and called it a day. Would be interesting to put back if anything changes
[2023-12-28T16:56:39] Mirono escooters: 1 more does little
[2023-12-28T17:19:57] cihan: I mean it, I want to use thicker grease since I'm heavier and maybe thicker grease film layer will be better for bearings.
[2023-12-28T17:20:51] Mirono escooters: Yes, bearing grease, from a brand
[2023-12-28T17:20:53] Mirono escooters: And loads : D
[2023-12-28T17:21:36] cihan: Thanks)
[2023-12-28T17:41:06] Rose: Hey there Kyle, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-28T17:49:31] Happy Giraffe: Did you manage to check the thickness? Currently playing around if 2mm thick tube would be strong enough🤔 otherwise would be so heavy. Making frame out of sheet is extra hard to get all straight as theres really not a point of reference nearby😁
[2023-12-28T18:36:04] Mirono escooters: 2mm only?
[2023-12-28T18:36:18] Mirono escooters: Mine is like 4-5 👀
[2023-12-28T18:39:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure what you talking About, but yeah real grease, also bearing should be kind hard to slide in ,if too easy you need loctite 648 ,coz bearing will spin in housing
[2023-12-28T18:43:55] Happy Giraffe: Im talkin about his eeb stealth ebike frame
[2023-12-28T18:44:20] Happy Giraffe: Measured?😅 Because 1x1m millimeter thick steel weighs 8kg
[2023-12-28T18:44:54] Mirono escooters: The frame is foktop heavy
[2023-12-28T18:45:14] Mirono escooters: But no, didn't measure yet
[2023-12-28T18:45:20] Mirono escooters: I'm lazy and busy : D
[2023-12-28T18:45:33] Mirono escooters: Later
[2023-12-28T19:04:30] Gabe Enzo: It's set to ender 3 pro
[2023-12-28T19:04:37] Gabe Enzo: No way to change it.
[2023-12-28T19:05:05] Mirono escooters: Now people on fb (yes. From all places..) say f405 adc is 5v tolerant, so fine to use throttle on it What is it now? I don't wanna go haywire if I don't know for sure I've always been told, 5v absoluut max, avoid
[2023-12-28T19:05:14] Mirono escooters: You can
[2023-12-28T19:05:20] Mirono escooters: But the margins are good, and for a reason
[2023-12-28T19:06:29] Gabe Enzo: The glass bed causes me so many issues. I ripped off the rubber that's heated
[2023-12-28T19:07:29] Mirono escooters: Glass is so noob friendly and ez
[2023-12-28T19:32:51] Face de Pin Sucé: it is tolerant until it is not
[2023-12-28T19:37:17] Mirono escooters: I'm not gonna discuss on fb I guess
[2023-12-28T20:10:14] haku: that looks cool. where do you get those?
[2023-12-28T20:23:07] Mirono escooters: Welp, up to them to kill their VESCs..
[2023-12-28T20:24:08] Tommy ª: casually i have the boxy and works nice at 32, i got more problems at 30
[2023-12-28T20:28:02] haku: lol. i was gonna make an account and check it out😂
[2023-12-28T20:46:51] Happy Giraffe: 2mm pipe and sheet 5.5kg not bad
[2023-12-28T21:19:05] cihan: I think gently hitting outer side of the bearing ring wouldn't hurt it.
[2023-12-28T21:40:39] haku: design a mini bomber with the fido 12" wheels
[2023-12-28T21:59:12] Paolo ⁭: Tiny molicel battery for drone
[2023-12-28T21:59:50] Mirono escooters: Cute
[2023-12-28T22:00:42] haku: thats a big drone then. lots of fpv drones use pouches
[2023-12-28T22:03:23] Paolo ⁭: 5 inch for long range
[2023-12-28T22:57:25] Rose: Hey there Rosticz, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-28T23:23:03] haku: @jamessoderstrom i printed a petg benchie to test. use this one on bambu studio

[2023-12-28T23:24:09] haku: its not perfect. maybe your nozzle clogged already? or bad petg roll. not an expert opinion though

[2023-12-28T23:39:00] Ion: The option "sample in v0 and V7" (or something like that) makes it double, right?
[2023-12-28T23:39:08] Ion: So then it actually runs at 30k
[2023-12-28T23:42:35] haku: yes i choose the bottom one
[2023-12-28T23:43:47] haku: <photos/photo_11776@28-12-2023_23-43-47.jpg>
[2023-12-28T23:44:00] haku: sorry this one
[2023-12-28T23:47:24] haku: yw
[2023-12-29T00:13:56] haku: nice you can print transparent petg battery holders with this. overture brand transparent filament
[2023-12-29T00:16:15] haku: with a transparent shrink wrap and acrylic deck this is cool imo
[2023-12-29T00:25:57] haku: now i can finally be a trans parent hehe
[2023-12-29T00:45:29] Rose: Hey there Franchesco, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2023-12-29T00:56:39] haku: 😂
[2023-12-29T01:00:26] Happy Giraffe: How it turned out?
[2023-12-29T01:01:08] Happy Giraffe: Btw I never printed a benchy, maybe I should with my carbon fiber petg to test it
[2023-12-29T01:01:52] Happy Giraffe: 1 hour preheat on dryer box and then heating while printing should make it dry enough
[2023-12-29T01:03:03] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): at first i thought those were Gel Tabs and was gonna ask how many μg
[2023-12-29T01:04:08] haku: https://www.reddit.com/r/BambuLab/s/lmY4IKcwJs
[2023-12-29T01:04:30] haku: i saw it on reddit. idk what that means
[2023-12-29T01:05:28] haku: i got a roll of amazon. its on sale. 😂
[2023-12-29T01:19:48] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): drug reference
[2023-12-29T01:20:33] Jan: Dont
[2023-12-29T01:20:41] Jan: Its master ass pain
[2023-12-29T01:20:55] Jan: Just laser cut pmma sheets
[2023-12-29T01:22:18] Happy Giraffe: Your benchy 4x faster than mine😂
[2023-12-29T01:22:39] Happy Giraffe: Motherfucker with Bambu
[2023-12-29T01:27:48] haku: i dont have that machine 😭
[2023-12-29T01:28:01] Jan: Same
[2023-12-29T01:28:34] Happy Giraffe: I wish I had the 10W ender module and that it could be tuned for more😂
[2023-12-29T01:28:43] haku: ill try it out though. it looks like a it will be difficult
[2023-12-29T01:29:31] haku: they said slow it down. real slow
[2023-12-29T01:30:11] haku: https://www.printables.com/model/15310-how-to-print-glass
[2023-12-29T01:34:10] Happy Giraffe: If you can do auto bed leveling it might help
[2023-12-29T01:34:33] Happy Giraffe: Hmm then again maybe machine is good and material junk
[2023-12-29T01:35:09] Happy Giraffe: Put oven to 50c and let it get to temp for 30min then put roll in without touching metal directly
[2023-12-29T01:35:32] Happy Giraffe: Use some enamel mug to lift it off a bit
[2023-12-29T01:36:08] Happy Giraffe: Might have been too agressive if putting in straight away
[2023-12-29T01:36:45] Happy Giraffe: Because those heat elements are 100c anyways at start I guess. My filament roll was molten and warped lol
[2023-12-29T01:38:09] Happy Giraffe: Check with caliper if its even 1.75mm lol
[2023-12-29T01:38:56] haku: maybe its not real bambu brand you got bambuzled hehe
[2023-12-29T01:39:46] haku: from what ive read bambu brand is just sunlu rebrand. idk if thats true
[2023-12-29T01:42:33] Happy Giraffe: Now doing 1hr 23min benchy, you fuckers with rocket motor printers have no idea about the true 3D printing experience😂
[2023-12-29T01:43:54] Happy Giraffe: If it fails I have isopropyl bottle nearby to help my thirst
[2023-12-29T01:45:35] haku: 1 hour 23mins on petg?
[2023-12-29T01:47:50] haku: atleast yours is sturdy. my prints are fast and breaks fast too.
[2023-12-29T01:47:56] haku: <photos/photo_11780@29-12-2023_01-47-56.jpg>
[2023-12-29T01:50:05] haku: now that im printing toys for my kid. i regret not getting the ams
[2023-12-29T01:51:33] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, CF petg likes bit different temperatures. Settings now in Cura: 0.6mm nozzle 0.24mm layer and first layer 0.6mm line width 2.4mm wall thickness (overkill) First layer horizontal expansion -0.1mm (to get rid of the bloated first layer) Infill 20% Pattern Grid 260°c hotend 80°c bed 80mm/s speed 50mm/s infill speed 25mm/s wall speed Initial layer speed 10mm/s Retraction for direct drive 0.9mm Retract speed 40mm/s Fanspeed 50% Initial fanspeed 0% , regular speed at layer 3 Minimum layer time 20s No supports
[2023-12-29T01:51:38] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-12-29T01:52:17] Happy Giraffe: Hmm then need to print hotter, less fan and less speed
[2023-12-29T01:52:26] Happy Giraffe: Combination effect of those
[2023-12-29T01:52:59] haku: i still need to figure out what all that means. 😂
[2023-12-29T01:53:00] Happy Giraffe: On extra strong parts I slow down PETG to 40mm/s and no fan at all except overhangs😁 Part is solid like metal
[2023-12-29T01:54:03] Happy Giraffe: Dont make it too complicated, your gut feeling propably is right when you look at the words to understand
[2023-12-29T01:54:34] Happy Giraffe: Also some slicers give helpful info when you hover mouse over the setting. Or they have a plugin that does that
[2023-12-29T01:55:19] haku: ill try this settings when i mess around with cf petg. thanks
[2023-12-29T01:56:19] Happy Giraffe: That should give a working part. This worked for me before. Ofcourse you need to adjust some setting for your specific part like supports if you have overhangs so it doesnt fail or try to print in mid-air😂 Soon we find out if it works at all. Also settings like (line width) are multiplier of nozzle size so I got 0.6mm nozzle and 4 lines giving 2.4mm
[2023-12-29T01:59:47] Happy Giraffe: Its that overhang that worries me the most😂 lets see if it fails
[2023-12-29T02:05:51] Tommy ª: low budget stm replacing 😭😭😭 at least it works
[2023-12-29T02:05:51] Tommy ª: <photos/photo_11782@29-12-2023_02-05-51.jpg>

[2023-12-29T02:18:25] Gabe Enzo: me when 3d printing spacers
[2023-12-29T03:05:42] Happy Giraffe: I should also do that😁 after getting my bed leveled. First with silicone socs and if it doesnt help then I do some CN machining for metal spacers so bed is always level no matter what😂
[2023-12-29T03:07:05] haku: how do you do that?
[2023-12-29T03:12:25] Happy Giraffe: Fukn flawless, well holes are hard to print vertically with petg😂
[2023-12-29T03:14:26] Happy Giraffe: Seems Ive underestimated by old lady ender again
[2023-12-29T03:14:34] Paolo ⁭: I stopped with 3d print
[2023-12-29T03:14:40] Paolo ⁭: No time for maintenance xd
[2023-12-29T03:15:04] Happy Giraffe: Grr, no need for that if bed is permanently leveled
[2023-12-29T03:16:03] Paolo ⁭: U need if print many pieces
[2023-12-29T03:16:12] Paolo ⁭: If you want to keep accuracy
[2023-12-29T03:16:31] Happy Giraffe: With Bambu should not be an issue🤔 Or even a Prusa
[2023-12-29T03:16:48] Paolo ⁭: Nah prusa was worse
[2023-12-29T03:17:11] Happy Giraffe: Just needs proper calibration. Mine is almost done. Just a little off when part is big and small are accurate
[2023-12-29T03:17:41] Paolo ⁭: Honestly I don't like a printer with mostly of parts printed😅
[2023-12-29T03:17:48] Paolo ⁭: Idk even why I bought it
[2023-12-29T03:17:58] Happy Giraffe: What model you have?
[2023-12-29T03:18:06] Paolo ⁭: Mk3s
[2023-12-29T03:18:10] Paolo ⁭: Now it's sold
[2023-12-29T03:18:28] Happy Giraffe: Was their best model😁
[2023-12-29T03:19:18] Paolo ⁭: Good but I prefer cheap Chinese machine
[2023-12-29T03:19:39] Paolo ⁭: Like the one 300x300x400 which I got for just 100€
[2023-12-29T03:20:39] Happy Giraffe: Printer doing 48 vs 48.1mm Z axis 31 vs 31.1mm Y and X is exactly correct 60 vs 60mm😁
[2023-12-29T03:20:59] Happy Giraffe: Damn, whats that?
[2023-12-29T03:21:17] Paolo ⁭: Sunlu S8
[2023-12-29T03:21:25] Paolo ⁭: Good for print big things
[2023-12-29T03:23:22] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, does it make good quality prints? If you can send pics
[2023-12-29T03:29:25] haku: what are basic printer maintanance?
[2023-12-29T03:32:47] haku: oil the belts?
[2023-12-29T04:03:16] haku: ill try this. is it a paid program?
[2023-12-29T04:05:03] Happy Giraffe: Just keep it clean and wipe bed with isopropyl daily to get rid of dust and grease from fingers/print leftovers
[2023-12-29T04:05:20] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2023-12-29T04:05:41] Happy Giraffe: belt tension check etc also good to do once in a while. Just keeping it nice and clean is enough
[2023-12-29T04:12:27] Happy Giraffe: Motherfucker seems to be calibrated for now...😁
[2023-12-29T04:16:18] Happy Giraffe: It works atleast, the mando helmet popped off from bed because one of the springs is fucked
[2023-12-29T04:55:21] haku: i want to make a mando helmet but my bed small and my head too big 😂
[2023-12-29T05:08:27] Happy Giraffe: Yeah and this one even maybe not big enough 300x300
[2023-12-29T05:21:03] haku: tried printing this in petg it did not come out clean. but its not bad.
[2023-12-29T05:21:03] haku: <photos/photo_11787@29-12-2023_05-21-03.jpg>
[2023-12-29T05:26:36] haku: why does it print like this on vertical parts
[2023-12-29T05:38:21] Happy Giraffe: Its trying to print in mid air bro😂
[2023-12-29T05:41:15] haku: lol i put supports.
[2023-12-29T05:42:48] haku: the sample print from thingiverse did not have this artifacts
[2023-12-29T05:55:33] haku: @Happy_Giraffe do you have experience with these filament pens? might be a good tool to fix messed up prints.
[2023-12-29T05:55:37] haku: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $3.99 92%OFF | SUNLU New 3D Printing Pen SL-300A Support PLA/ABS/PCL Filament 1.75mm Low Temperature & Speed Control & Adjustable Temperature https://a.aliexpress.com/_mqyXqMk
[2023-12-29T05:55:38] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-29T05:56:52] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but even then its hard for it
[2023-12-29T05:57:41] Happy Giraffe: Supports have many settings like how far they are to the model surface etc lot of different stuff going on
[2023-12-29T06:10:20] Happy Giraffe: I would rather use pastic filler pudding and paint it😅
[2023-12-29T06:10:35] Happy Giraffe: This seems like a toy
[2023-12-29T06:13:36] Happy Giraffe: 😅
[2023-12-29T06:14:06] haku: i think it is a kids toy lol. the only thing i see good about it is you can match filament color
[2023-12-29T06:23:51] puneDir: Some local turkish shop
[2023-12-29T07:54:17] haku: @Happy_Giraffe do i need a top of the line graphics card to render cad models? i only have a 3080
[2023-12-29T07:55:16] Happy Giraffe: Lmao nope, intel HD2000 is enough or gt710
[2023-12-29T07:56:13] Happy Giraffe: If you do something else than just CAD drawing like animation or work with graphics then its another story
[2023-12-29T07:59:34] haku: i use to edit videos and photos. photos is mostly cpu
[2023-12-29T07:59:58] haku: i know blender is gpu intensive. some folks use this for 3d modeling yea?
[2023-12-29T08:54:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh😁
[2023-12-29T08:57:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nope basically hammering not good and think over
[2023-12-29T08:58:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you insert and it doesnt stands strait you could help with plastic one , but basically should not happen
[2023-12-29T08:59:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And if you cant do else get a piece of old metal, what's flat and hammer both rings same time
[2023-12-29T09:00:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But there is nothing like Bearing puller, just you need different ones for different sizes
[2023-12-29T09:01:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also pullers help with an engine, but doesnt in a situation like m365 rear rim
[2023-12-29T09:03:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tell all your secrets,advise the ppl
[2023-12-29T09:05:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No idea about that, maybe others know
[2023-12-29T09:09:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also what you mean under modelling? Draw from zero? For that try fusion 360 , Happy uses it ,i will try soon Or if you mean a slicer I use simplify 3d Some who I know uses cura also didn't try but more easy for starters they say
[2023-12-29T09:09:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Simplify is easy too,just need to learn it before 😅
[2023-12-29T09:10:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And Yeah all 3 d progs eat machines
[2023-12-29T09:12:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Back in the day i made an intro with 3d studio and a run.bat And added to all cd dvd to start with it🤣 That 5 second intro took ages to count out🤣 that time
[2023-12-29T09:13:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you have bambo that should have its own slicer
[2023-12-29T09:20:10] Yamal: Bambo?
[2023-12-29T09:21:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bambu lab
[2023-12-29T09:22:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: A letter should not matter 😁

[2023-12-29T10:23:57] Yamal: Is the real Benjamin controller ?
[2023-12-29T10:33:48] Mirono escooters: Yes Very good, bit pricey
[2023-12-29T10:34:11] Mirono escooters: It got profiles? Cool
[2023-12-29T10:35:47] haku: yea. thats what i mean about 3d modlelig. drawn from 0. bambu you can knly asjust size and cut off/ add piieces.
[2023-12-29T10:41:58] Mirono escooters: Hah, koxx jumped on it
[2023-12-29T11:36:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: only ~100 components to solder 😅 let's go

[2023-12-29T11:39:34] Mirono escooters: I was right 😜😎
[2023-12-29T11:39:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: fully fonctionnal 🤣♥️
[2023-12-29T11:39:44] Mirono escooters: Are the files opensource? 👀🙈
[2023-12-29T11:40:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, i've never seen any opensource hw design 😵‍💫 i had to analyze the soft to determine the pinout
[2023-12-29T11:42:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also, it allow incremental soldering. testing circuit block by block and avoid burning the bord or soldering expensive components (like the 13$ 4g/gps chip) if the rest isn't working 😅😅
[2023-12-29T11:45:01] Mirono escooters: Sad
[2023-12-29T11:45:06] Mirono escooters: Ah good point!

[2023-12-29T13:29:03] NetworkDir: Ofc with extender
[2023-12-29T13:50:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 0 shorts. good sight. let's put some power !
[2023-12-29T13:57:50] Mirono escooters: The master
[2023-12-29T14:02:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oups... wrong topic. sorry
[2023-12-29T14:08:10] Mirono escooters: Still vesc related
[2023-12-29T14:27:58] Gabe Enzo: Where can I change the base size on ultimaker cura? @Happy_Giraffe
[2023-12-29T14:33:00] Mirono escooters: Bwuh
[2023-12-29T14:33:08] Mirono escooters: Manage printers and then in settings
[2023-12-29T14:33:15] Mirono escooters: Just keep it stock, it's there for a reason
[2023-12-29T14:44:01] Gabe Enzo: I'm printing a spacer for molicel. Im going with 23.5mm. 1.5mm extra for balancing cables etc. hope it's enough.
[2023-12-29T14:44:13] Gabe Enzo: And copper
[2023-12-29T14:44:21] Gabe Enzo: should be fine
[2023-12-29T14:48:39] Gabe Enzo: oh god forgot to edit the holes to be bigger for M4 hey @LizardDoggo should 23.5mm be ok?
[2023-12-29T14:48:40] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2023-12-29T14:48:58] Mirono escooters: Am I the only one who feels like this shouldn't be gas? That it should be inverted
[2023-12-29T14:49:06] Gabe Enzo: Same
[2023-12-29T14:49:23] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2023-12-29T14:49:23] Mirono escooters: This needs to be gas
[2023-12-29T14:49:40] Mirono escooters: You should pull your thumb in, not out And brake out, because you brake less (usually)
[2023-12-29T14:51:35] Paolo ⁭: Isn't bi directional?
[2023-12-29T14:56:41] Mirono escooters: 30/70
[2023-12-29T14:56:44] Mirono escooters: V2
[2023-12-29T15:42:08] cihan: I don't have such a press to dismantle and install bearings. How can I do it without hammering?
[2023-12-29T15:58:29] Mirono escooters: Just diy it. Costs, nothing
[2023-12-29T15:59:03] Mirono escooters: You get 2 big metal washers, with a threaded rod or screw through Then you put bearing on, screw through, start tightening, you pull bearing in I can show my contraption this evening
[2023-12-29T16:16:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Support in the making 😁with a lot of L'Oreal
[2023-12-29T16:34:49] Mihail: Yes.
[2023-12-29T16:35:24] Mihail: This is the prototype, to show what I mean by direct connection to the scooter case
[2023-12-29T16:35:24] Mihail: <photos/photo_11803@29-12-2023_16-35-24.jpg>
[2023-12-29T16:37:56] Mihail: This prototype is 88*69*25, the 1st option is almost the same, but with capacitors laying flat inside the case
[2023-12-29T16:42:44] Mihail: 3D case would be a lot cheaper, yes
[2023-12-29T16:44:47] Mihail: The alu box I'm looking at is a pre-made box from Hammond's catalog. I don't have the tools or money to make a custom metal box. In theory the 3D box could be machined out of metal
[2023-12-29T16:50:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes he could do that I would add Threaded rod should "match" inner bearing diameter and the washer should cover the bearings inner and outer ring , that's the side off instalion , outer side you can use old bearing as a washer ,its even better to do so , since sits same like on the otherside Make sure start is good and strait
[2023-12-29T16:52:32] Mirono escooters: Yes obviously. I thought that was obvious 😜
[2023-12-29T16:52:48] Mirono escooters: M12 threaded rod
[2023-12-29T16:53:39] Mirono escooters: You are so cool
[2023-12-29T16:53:46] Mihail: Yes that is the idea. A friend is daily-driving one of the prototypes with 15s battery at around 3 kw. He doesn't see max temperature go over 27c
[2023-12-29T16:54:27] Mirono escooters: 6fet? 12?
[2023-12-29T16:56:30] Mihail: 6fet, maybe at some point I can make 12 fet version. Problem is I don't have a vehicle that would benefit 12. My most powerful scooter is vsett 10 and it is only around 7kw(4 rear, 3 front)
[2023-12-29T16:56:42] Mirono escooters: 6fet already very cool
[2023-12-29T16:56:56] Mirono escooters: What would it cost? Problably easier assembly then MP2 🙈
[2023-12-29T16:57:02] Mihail: Max Ive tried is 60A bat, 160A phase
[2023-12-29T16:57:31] Mihail: I am scared to do more without bms, as the one in the vsett 10 is almost useless.
[2023-12-29T16:58:18] Mihail: It depends. Soldering to the alu-pcb is quite difficult
[2023-12-29T16:58:51] Mirono escooters: With hotplate, I didn't have issues
[2023-12-29T16:59:03] puneDir: Soon im going to get zero 10x
[2023-12-29T16:59:23] puneDir: to drive when i want a normal ride instead of teleporting with ninebot
[2023-12-29T16:59:53] Mirono escooters: Bweh zero 10x
[2023-12-29T16:59:56] Mihail: Yes, it is one of the ways
[2023-12-29T17:00:16] Mirono escooters: And " hotplate " is a 3DP plate with a psu hahaha
[2023-12-29T17:00:17] puneDir: idk what to get for my bday
[2023-12-29T17:00:19] Mihail: I use heatgun on the bottom and iron on top.
[2023-12-29T17:00:31] Mirono escooters: Anything except a zero 10x
[2023-12-29T17:00:40] Mirono escooters: I'm too scared to bend it
[2023-12-29T17:00:43] Mirono escooters: Hotplate works
[2023-12-29T17:00:46] puneDir: Like what
[2023-12-29T17:01:20] Mirono escooters: Vsett
[2023-12-29T17:01:21] Mirono escooters: Ninebot
[2023-12-29T17:01:32] Mirono escooters: Segway g2 P100
[2023-12-29T17:02:11] Mihail: Isn't that vsett 10s predecessor? Why not Mukuta 10+? It seems to be like vsett 10 but improved
[2023-12-29T17:26:26] puneDir: 10+?
[2023-12-29T17:29:06] Mirono escooters: Its worse in every way possible
[2023-12-29T17:47:01] Mihail: Hmm, looks better, with improved fenders(vsett fenders are practically useless), dual shocks and a proper horn. I would gladly exchange my vsett for it. But I have not ridden it to see if there are other issues.
[2023-12-29T17:47:25] Mihail: Why do you think it is worse?
[2023-12-29T17:47:49] Paolo ⁭: Your?
[2023-12-29T17:51:15] sombre_enfant: Buy iohawk
[2023-12-29T17:54:58] Mirono escooters: The pole snaps. The suspension is shit. Ultra little battery space. Loads of issues, worse motors
[2023-12-29T18:10:32] Mirono escooters: Yes zero 10x
[2023-12-29T18:14:27] Mirono escooters: Never heard of it
[2023-12-29T19:17:00] haku: vsett 9 also has removable battery like mukuta 9
[2023-12-29T19:17:21] haku: also better hydraulic brakes
[2023-12-29T19:17:46] haku: same crap 8.5 tires tho
[2023-12-29T19:18:49] puneDir: <photos/photo_11805@29-12-2023_19-18-49.jpg>
[2023-12-29T19:18:51] puneDir: New boy
[2023-12-29T19:19:47] Gabe Enzo: Literally a dual stock motor 13s Xiaomi hehe
[2023-12-29T19:20:33] haku: vsett really has to make 9 a 10inch and the 10 a 11 inch imo
[2023-12-29T19:21:06] Gabe Enzo: I have a plan with a friend to set up a company that actually makes good scooters. And will be self modifiable.
[2023-12-29T19:21:10] haku: this 8.5 tires are so 2023
[2023-12-29T19:21:11] Gabe Enzo: Easy to mod and access.
[2023-12-29T19:21:12] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2023-12-29T19:22:04] haku: these 8.5 tires are still tubed tires too
[2023-12-29T19:22:11] puneDir: 8.5 sucks
[2023-12-29T19:22:46] haku: only thing i like about the vsett 9 is i can carry it with 1 hand
[2023-12-29T19:23:55] Mirono escooters: Btw he deleted his comments
[2023-12-29T19:23:55] Mirono escooters: We won
[2023-12-29T19:24:11] puneDir: I like zero
[2023-12-29T19:25:02] Gabe Enzo: Will come with 10x2.5/3 stock. And 1-2-1.7kwh 12-15s. able to choose your build like an apple product. 50km+ range. no kidding around with low power shit. Somehow make it come with VESC, find a way to produce it nice. + antifreeze battery system. internal heating (powered by backup cell) I'm seriously sick of these mainstream scooters.
[2023-12-29T19:26:13] Gabe Enzo: A real vehicle
[2023-12-29T19:26:39] Gabe Enzo: robust
[2023-12-29T19:30:39] Gabe Enzo: Able to carry 2 people without overheating, constantly. Like a real motorbike. Something that doesn't scream "gay" It's gonna be the shit. 2035 maybe earliest?

[2023-12-29T20:09:04] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-12-29T20:15:07] puneDir: Zero 10x has good motors fine esc but shitty battery and low space But good looking design
[2023-12-29T20:15:20] puneDir: Vsett10+ is too expensive

[2023-12-29T20:24:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahaha
[2023-12-29T20:24:26] Mirono escooters: I know what it means
[2023-12-29T20:24:31] Mirono escooters: But why wouldn't I recommend it
[2023-12-29T20:24:47] puneDir: segway gt 200k liras Zero 10x non used 55k The one i found 32k
[2023-12-29T20:24:51] puneDir: Vsett is around 70
[2023-12-29T20:29:14] Mirono escooters: I just list wich scooters I like
[2023-12-29T20:29:21] Mirono escooters: Idk ur budget
[2023-12-29T20:29:28] Mirono escooters: Way better
[2023-12-29T20:33:55] puneDir: No money lol
[2023-12-29T20:33:59] cihan: For anyone interested in future: Maximum charge current for Ninebot f2 pro is 2.4A with stock BMS. It stops charging when I apply 2.5A.
[2023-12-29T20:36:16] Mirono escooters: You'll get a load of issues with 10x
[2023-12-29T20:36:18] Mirono escooters: As you ride
[2023-12-29T20:44:15] NetworkDir: Vsett expensive for specs
[2023-12-29T20:45:32] puneDir: Why
[2023-12-29T21:11:38] haku: vsett 10 sale in US for $1500
[2023-12-29T21:12:52] haku: agreed. but the build quality is really good. i just dont know if its worth it
[2023-12-29T21:14:02] haku: link to this drama please. i want to see haha
[2023-12-29T21:17:45] Mirono escooters: Well it's not much now
[2023-12-29T21:19:19] haku: if i can find a cheap zero 11x frame. that is the jam
[2023-12-29T21:28:04] haku: this dude on discord has a cnc machine. so cool. is this machine really half a million dollars or can i get it cheaper on china?
[2023-12-29T21:32:23] Paolo ⁭: I don't know the exactly model of this machina, but seems 3 axis. It starts from 30/50k for cheap china super basic to over million
[2023-12-29T21:32:43] Mirono escooters: You'll pay plenty for it
[2023-12-29T21:33:32] Paolo ⁭: In china probably is way cheaper
[2023-12-29T21:33:54] haku: this is an investment. need to pump out made in the USA scooters if someone buys this
[2023-12-29T21:33:58] Mirono escooters: You'll still pay plenty for it
[2023-12-29T21:34:14] Mirono escooters: And shipping and importing it? Rip Let alone parts and maintenance Bweh
[2023-12-29T21:34:17] Paolo ⁭: Is so cheap that escooter factory like dualtron and Nami have them in the factory directly
[2023-12-29T21:34:28] Mirono escooters: Well yeah, in china
[2023-12-29T21:34:35] Mirono escooters: They pay resources so cheap
[2023-12-29T21:34:40] Paolo ⁭: Dualtron even cast metal pieces in their factory lol , idk how it worth
[2023-12-29T21:35:16] haku: my new scooter company will be called vesc lords aprentice scooters
[2023-12-29T21:36:22] Paolo ⁭: Dualtron made everything in house
[2023-12-29T21:36:27] Paolo ⁭: Their controller PCB also
[2023-12-29T21:36:36] Paolo ⁭: They've smt assemble machine 🙈
[2023-12-29T21:36:46] haku: wow. i did not know that
[2023-12-29T21:37:04] NetworkDir: Except controllers yes also trail isnt super good
[2023-12-29T21:40:17] Mirono escooters: Vsett trail is really ok
[2023-12-29T21:41:47] haku: not the 9. it gets sketchy at 29mph
[2023-12-29T21:42:48] Mirono escooters: Yes, I'm talking the good one 😜
[2023-12-29T22:12:43] Paolo ⁭: I don't know, in one of video of factory tour I saw that
[2023-12-29T22:13:01] Paolo ⁭: I never visited them even they're 250km near my home
[2023-12-29T22:14:50] Happy Giraffe: Imagine if I succeed with bike frame and building those would come a hobby. So many high power escooter frames to sell😂
[2023-12-29T22:15:49] Happy Giraffe: Problem is tools available outside school😭 Would have to rent a work hangar with equipment
[2023-12-29T23:28:12] haku: dayum
[2023-12-29T23:28:53] haku: not bad investment if you make pev parts.
[2023-12-29T23:29:25] Paolo ⁭: That's waterjet
[2023-12-29T23:29:43] haku: isnt thay machine water not lazers?
[2023-12-29T23:29:48] Paolo ⁭: Only support 2d cutting for small thickness
[2023-12-29T23:29:57] haku: oh i see
[2023-12-29T23:30:06] Paolo ⁭: And also this type of waterjet is for wood cutting
[2023-12-29T23:30:31] Paolo ⁭: For metal you need a "wire"
[2023-12-29T23:31:04] haku: right. ive seen those on youtube
[2023-12-29T23:38:09] haku: someone in the US needs to invest in this half a million machine and make a scooter worthy of competimg in france. USA needs to be in the podium atleast
[2023-12-29T23:38:40] Paolo ⁭: Rion bought many CNC machines with scammed money
[2023-12-29T23:38:53] haku: haha
[2023-12-29T23:39:26] haku: thats unfortunate that they do scams
[2023-12-29T23:45:26] Happy Giraffe: Dream would to make own CNC mill machine to car garage from solid steel frame and proper heavy duty parts😁
[2023-12-29T23:46:13] Paolo ⁭: Solid block cost you more than finished bike hahaha
[2023-12-29T23:46:24] Paolo ⁭: Not cheap for us to buy solid material
[2023-12-29T23:46:36] Face de Pin Sucé: haha can't wait to see that :D
[2023-12-29T23:47:28] Paolo ⁭: Us guys race directly in road lol
[2023-12-29T23:47:36] Paolo ⁭: Check at their past videos on YouTube
[2023-12-29T23:47:48] Face de Pin Sucé: send link
[2023-12-29T23:47:50] Paolo ⁭: They pass with red light
[2023-12-29T23:48:09] Face de Pin Sucé: haha honestly, you won't see me respect any redlight in my city xà
[2023-12-29T23:48:11] Face de Pin Sucé: x)
[2023-12-29T23:58:34] haku: this is true. but the track is more professional.
[2023-12-30T00:05:45] haku: functional printing baby
[2023-12-30T00:07:31] haku: petg so brittle
[2023-12-30T00:30:27] Gabe Enzo: PLA the best of all worlds .
[2023-12-30T00:54:27] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2023-12-30T00:54:35] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-12-30T00:54:44] Mirono escooters: Dry good PEtg not
[2023-12-30T00:55:27] haku: small parts keep breaking on mine
[2023-12-30T00:57:07] haku: ill try this same print on pla and see if its more flexible
[2023-12-30T00:59:48] Mirono escooters: Then its shitty crappy petg
[2023-12-30T00:59:59] Mirono escooters: Pla is far from flexible Tpu is
[2023-12-30T01:00:49] haku: maybe. its overture brand. it only cracks when forced. no flex at all
[2023-12-30T01:01:14] Mirono escooters: Thats, normal
[2023-12-30T01:01:25] haku: i will try sunlu next time or elegoo
[2023-12-30T01:01:28] Mirono escooters: Dry it. Petg loves water
[2023-12-30T01:02:37] haku: its bambu brand? i will avoid that unless on sale
[2023-12-30T01:03:34] haku: the bridge test looks good though
[2023-12-30T01:05:03] haku: let me try this test. is it on thingiverse?
[2023-12-30T01:05:40] haku: ty
[2023-12-30T01:21:34] Happy Giraffe: How?😂 Your settings are fucked
[2023-12-30T01:22:22] Happy Giraffe: PETG will need max fanspeed for overhangs
[2023-12-30T01:22:34] haku: no idea. i just set it to generic petg?
[2023-12-30T01:22:51] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-12-30T01:23:42] haku: i think just need to play with the settings
[2023-12-30T01:25:42] Happy Giraffe: Definitely, take some from internet and do heat tower etc
[2023-12-30T01:25:50] Happy Giraffe: But need to have dry filament
[2023-12-30T01:26:50] Happy Giraffe: Max
[2023-12-30T01:27:20] Happy Giraffe: Try temperatures from 230-260c. Petg wont need 260+
[2023-12-30T01:27:47] Happy Giraffe: If extruder motor skips or clicks then need to add temperature
[2023-12-30T01:28:26] Happy Giraffe: Maybe put fan at 70% and just see what 230-260 looks like at 120mm/s speeds
[2023-12-30T01:31:02] Happy Giraffe: Lmao ofcourse its shit then😁
[2023-12-30T02:59:00] haku: maybe the outer layer of your roll got in contact with water?
[2023-12-30T03:28:10] Happy Giraffe: Room humidity sometimes more than enough after 12hours it needs drying again 😁
[2023-12-30T03:39:13] haku: my test not perfect too. bridge test failed and some overhang underneath failed.

[2023-12-30T03:41:58] Happy Giraffe: You got so much speed on the settings
[2023-12-30T03:42:30] haku: its stock bambu speed. what speed should i do?
[2023-12-30T03:44:32] haku: <photos/photo_11814@30-12-2023_03-44-32.jpg>
[2023-12-30T03:44:49] haku: 75 degrees not too bad though
[2023-12-30T04:05:13] haku: this is the settings
[2023-12-30T05:40:06] Happy Giraffe: Halve it
[2023-12-30T05:40:43] Happy Giraffe: Overhang speed kinda ok tho, might even go 30mm/s
[2023-12-30T05:41:04] Happy Giraffe: You got P1S right?
[2023-12-30T05:41:50] Happy Giraffe: If it has 0.4mm nozzle then try reducing also layer height to 0.16
[2023-12-30T05:44:09] haku: yea p1s. i will try that. thank you
[2023-12-30T05:45:30] haku: i dont see a p1s setting so i just use x1c
[2023-12-30T05:45:36] Rose: Hey there McGregor, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2023-12-30T06:06:25] Happy Giraffe: Would be stupid of them not to release same profile even at different name on launch day
[2023-12-30T06:07:07] Happy Giraffe: Companies seem to really lack integrity nowadays, everything launched unfinished
[2023-12-30T06:07:54] haku: i think the p1s and x1c is pretty similar aside from lidar, aluminum frame and display
[2023-12-30T06:09:24] haku: the a1 is a completely different design. kinda want one with ams for my "sons toys" 😜
[2023-12-30T06:35:43] haku: testing 18650 battery holders. too big

[2023-12-30T09:10:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Forgot I activated the time lapse function x)
[2023-12-30T09:24:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: looool
[2023-12-30T09:33:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Where can this be found ? I want to launch it before going to the workshop
[2023-12-30T09:37:54] Mirono escooters: Thibgiverse test print
[2023-12-30T09:38:09] Mirono escooters: Rlly handy to tune fan
[2023-12-30T10:32:03] haku: https://makerworld.com/models/111384
[2023-12-30T10:32:48] haku: this is what i used. i coudnt find the full scale one james used
[2023-12-30T10:38:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No space for bigger tbh like blade mini
[2023-12-30T13:58:09] KierreKikkeli: question, can i use a stepdown circuit in reverse to step up my adc v2 throttles voltage? it has started to go nuts with brake handle and throttle coz of similiar voltages or whatever, as in acts like the brake lever is both throttle and brake.
[2023-12-30T14:13:04] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-12-30T14:13:23] haku: petg battery holders. need to make my owm design and learn fusion
[2023-12-30T14:13:26] Mirono escooters: And what you describe is unlogical and weird.
[2023-12-30T14:14:54] Mirono escooters: Seems like you setup wrong, bidirectional or so Brake can't do that with proper setup
[2023-12-30T14:24:00] Paolo ⁭: Why only circles? It result weak to be battery holder
[2023-12-30T14:26:51] haku: yea. i just found this on thigiverse
[2023-12-30T14:27:23] haku: i want to make it more rigid
[2023-12-30T14:34:01] Gabe Enzo: One table to study and one table workshop
[2023-12-30T14:34:03] Gabe Enzo: Made my own workshop bench. waiting for a new table. I've decided I'm keeping it.
[2023-12-30T15:20:31] KierreKikkeli: it has been troubleshooted alot here previously
[2023-12-30T15:20:53] KierreKikkeli: new vesc frimware bug and similiar output voltages makes it confused
[2023-12-30T15:46:44] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-12-30T15:47:04] Mirono escooters: Downgrade then Because a reverse stepdown is funny
[2023-12-30T16:21:02] puneDir: guys
[2023-12-30T16:21:05] puneDir: i bought zero :D
[2023-12-30T16:21:15] puneDir: will Came in 6 january
[2023-12-30T16:21:27] puneDir: btw zero is trash ninebot is better
[2023-12-30T16:21:34] puneDir: my hearth beats for ninebot
[2023-12-30T16:21:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-30T16:22:10] francois schempers: agreed ^^
[2023-12-30T16:22:25] francois schempers: I'm modding my max g2, steel frame
[2023-12-30T16:22:53] francois schempers: <animation>
[2023-12-30T17:50:31] Mirono escooters: Its such a lovely frame
[2023-12-30T18:30:13] Happy Giraffe: @XAP2P didnt like its forks😂
[2023-12-30T18:52:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Gives file 😁
[2023-12-30T18:53:48] Mirono escooters: Well me neither, but I am pretty sure that'll be fixed/is fixed.
[2023-12-30T18:53:56] Mirono escooters: They took forks out of production for a few weeks
[2023-12-30T18:56:23] Happy Giraffe: So maybe I need to redo whole fork for our T-800, fuck me I guess😂
[2023-12-30T19:00:33] francois schempers: if it comes to that, should be too hard, and you'll be well payed ;)
[2023-12-30T19:01:05] francois schempers: steel fork shouldnt bend like original
[2023-12-30T19:07:48] Mirono escooters: T watte
[2023-12-30T19:08:07] Mirono escooters: You'll get rid of suspension?
[2023-12-30T19:09:05] francois schempers: no, just replace the week piston by a steel one
[2023-12-30T19:09:48] Mirono escooters: Isn't the stock hardened steel already?
[2023-12-30T19:09:58] Mirono escooters: I mean, I don't know how you'd make a piston otherwise Chinese do impress me everyday
[2023-12-30T19:11:17] haku: make that plywood thicker bro. that will bow under weight
[2023-12-30T19:12:18] haku: speaking from a guy thats using a flimsly plastic table 😂
[2023-12-30T19:16:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Workshop? Where is all the shit
[2023-12-30T19:17:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Conan is that you😅
[2023-12-30T19:21:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: To be honest not even sure what you say ,but i am under🤔 unsure what you would say
[2023-12-30T19:25:32] Happy Giraffe: If its some hollowed aluminium I will eat my boxers
[2023-12-30T19:26:23] Mirono escooters: You don't make a piston from aluminum. Let alone hollowed out
[2023-12-30T19:26:32] Mirono escooters: Anyone knows this
[2023-12-30T19:27:07] Mirono escooters: It's just a "tiny" piston for the load. Ofcourse it bends with a hard hit But that isn't the problem, problem was steering loose. Play. But is fixed, supplier told me
[2023-12-30T19:27:41] Happy Giraffe: Proper steel alloy even when only 16mm or whatever thick would hold just fine
[2023-12-30T19:28:18] Happy Giraffe: Would be tanky af even when axle being longer
[2023-12-30T19:30:52] Mirono escooters: Goh, you don't know how people hit stuff front wise with this
[2023-12-30T19:31:07] Mirono escooters: Anyway it's a good fork and only some bend, and seeing the condition of the scooters, you know it's abused
[2023-12-30T19:31:44] Mirono escooters: As long as wobble gone, good sus
[2023-12-30T19:32:01] Mirono escooters: Still prefer Snsc but G2 sus no bad
[2023-12-30T19:35:18] Happy Giraffe: It sure is fine for designed use at 25kmh
[2023-12-30T19:35:39] Happy Giraffe: But add our T-800 on it at 60kmh and things change a bit😅
[2023-12-30T19:43:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tbh not sure what you all talking about but drunk atm,,,~~
[2023-12-30T21:13:49] haku: this elegoo rapid petg any good? $10 per roll on sale
[2023-12-30T21:16:06] haku: will this shrink rapidly hehe
[2023-12-30T21:17:58] Happy Giraffe: No, I would say. Amazon sells such crap nowadays with fake rewievs
[2023-12-30T21:18:12] Happy Giraffe: Pay 5$ more for proper brand
[2023-12-30T21:18:50] Happy Giraffe: Tinmorry is good if exists in Murica
[2023-12-30T21:19:27] haku: gotcha. i got 1 roll though. can return if crappy.
[2023-12-30T21:19:38] haku: i have to check if we have that
[2023-12-30T21:22:12] Happy Giraffe: Or the brand that I linked way back in time. Very cheap and if works for print farms works for us too😁
[2023-12-30T21:22:39] haku: wich one was that?
[2023-12-30T21:23:54] Happy Giraffe: Don't remember anymore as can't order from US myself
[2023-12-30T21:24:45] haku: ive only tried bambu and sunlu pla+ wich is good and overture petg wich i have right now.
[2023-12-30T21:25:47] haku: petg settings can be finicky with bambu from what ive read. have to really dial it in
[2023-12-30T21:25:58] haku: like you said
[2023-12-30T21:36:29] Paolo ⁭: Best verified brand here in eu are Extrudr and Filoalpha
[2023-12-30T21:47:41] haku: what about prussament? isnt that eu brand?
[2023-12-30T21:52:58] Happy Giraffe: Expensive usually
[2023-12-30T21:53:51] haku: yes. it is but is that quality stuff? or overhyped?
[2023-12-30T22:00:52] haku: im doing junk test prints right now. i dont want to waste the good stuff. once i am the master of this machine i will play around with the boogie stuff
[2023-12-30T22:01:35] haku: when i make battery holders i want the good stuff
[2023-12-30T22:06:35] Paolo ⁭: It's good but not like the one I said
[2023-12-30T22:07:14] haku: gotcha. ill try to find it locally

[2023-12-30T23:37:37] haku: what the heck is that and why is there a baller giving out money on the side?
[2023-12-30T23:38:12] Paolo ⁭: It's sticker to hide the room in the back 😂
[2023-12-30T23:38:37] haku: what kind of magic is that?
[2023-12-30T23:38:42] haku: the welding
[2023-12-30T23:39:23] Paolo ⁭: Arc
[2023-12-30T23:40:26] haku: thats next level. is it pretty consistent?
[2023-12-30T23:42:21] haku: for what pev is this? scooter or bike?
[2023-12-30T23:42:48] Cengiz Han GENÇALİ: Vsett 9+
[2023-12-30T23:43:06] Cengiz Han GENÇALİ: 13s 10p
[2023-12-30T23:43:22] haku: 13s? nice how does that fit? vertically?
[2023-12-30T23:44:10] haku: please show us the fitment. im very interested in this
[2023-12-30T23:45:08] haku: if that can fit you can prolly fit a 20s inside too
[2023-12-30T23:46:44] haku: that might be bms cutting buddy. drain to 0. im not sure though
[2023-12-30T23:48:02] Yamal: no, it hasn't cut me off at any time
[2023-12-30T23:49:26] Yamal: Anyway in a few weeks new battery 🙏‼️
[2023-12-30T23:50:00] haku: that will be fun! congrats bro
[2023-12-30T23:50:31] Yamal: How is your project going?
[2023-12-30T23:50:34] haku: im still deciding 20s 21s or 22s.
[2023-12-30T23:50:43] Yamal: Which controller
[2023-12-30T23:50:44] haku: i need to get frame welded
[2023-12-30T23:50:54] haku: 85/200 spintend
[2023-12-30T23:51:08] Yamal: Still have one before? (Frame)
[2023-12-30T23:52:15] haku: yes. the old one will only fit 20s and its really tight. i have to mount the esc outside. im also still deciding on that. after the holidays i will start on it
[2023-12-30T23:52:39] haku: too busy right now.
[2023-12-30T23:53:09] Yamal: Which cell?
[2023-12-30T23:53:16] haku: 40t
[2023-12-30T23:53:25] Yamal: Same me 👍
[2023-12-30T23:53:36] Yamal: Engine?
[2023-12-30T23:53:43] haku: recomended by vesc lords
[2023-12-30T23:53:48] haku: 70h 33x2
[2023-12-30T23:53:58] Yamal: Vesc lord,,?🧐
[2023-12-30T23:54:28] haku: the guys that help me out and give out good advice
[2023-12-30T23:55:05] Cengiz Han GENÇALİ: I will share the 3D drawing when it is finished.
[2023-12-30T23:55:23] haku: the masters of this realm. and the heads of the council
[2023-12-30T23:56:13] haku: the code gods and immortal kings
[2023-12-30T23:56:46] Yamal: 250A phase?
[2023-12-30T23:57:16] haku: as much as the 12fet spintend can do 😂
[2023-12-30T23:58:12] Yamal: But what is the maximum they give?
[2023-12-30T23:58:27] haku: according to spintend 400a
[2023-12-30T23:58:34] haku: lol
[2023-12-30T23:58:52] Yamal: 400ax2?
[2023-12-30T23:59:00] Кирилл: 250A battery and 450A phase maximums with strong cooling
[2023-12-30T23:59:30] Yamal: 900A the two controller ?
[2023-12-31T00:00:40] Кирилл: Your front wheel will spin forever. So no 900A in working range. The rear will be the most loaded on acceleration. The more power on rear, the less will be on front
[2023-12-31T00:01:53] haku: this is from my new girlfiend amy.
[2023-12-31T00:01:54] haku: <photos/photo_11823@31-12-2023_00-01-54.jpg>

[2023-12-31T00:02:20] Yamal: Yeah ,! but what I am referring to is that there is no dual controller, there would be 2 spinted and the sum would be 900 phase and 500 battery
[2023-12-31T00:02:40] haku: some guy in russia is building a super scooter according to her and this is what he tested
[2023-12-31T00:02:44] Кирилл: In theory, yes
[2023-12-31T00:03:02] Yamal: Amazing 😎🎩
[2023-12-31T00:03:30] Yamal: 500a battery 😅
[2023-12-31T00:04:06] Yamal: Still okay your 33/2👍🔥
[2023-12-31T00:04:27] Yamal: Ly motor ?
[2023-12-31T00:05:21] haku: honestly idk what im doing. im just doing research and going along with what is recomended. i will not push it like this guy though. i just want it to do strong burnouts
[2023-12-31T00:05:50] haku: yes
[2023-12-31T00:06:20] Yamal: Man, riding what you are going to ride, you would like the speed, right?
[2023-12-31T00:07:43] haku: my own brand motors actually.
[2023-12-31T00:08:11] haku: yea sometimes i will gun it when needed

[2023-12-31T00:08:43] haku: ty.
[2023-12-31T00:11:08] haku: i havent seen someone build a fast scooter in the US too. alwayd fast ebikes
[2023-12-31T00:11:33] haku: build from the garage is what i mean. home made
[2023-12-31T00:13:03] haku: ty.
[2023-12-31T00:13:39] Yamal: Ebikes a lot yes,, can see in diferent Chanel in YouTube
[2023-12-31T00:13:55] haku: yea thats what im thinking too. atleast 15mm spacer
[2023-12-31T00:15:13] haku: even in my city. i want to be different.
[2023-12-31T00:17:24] Yamal: 150/160kmh?😂
[2023-12-31T00:17:27] haku: can 12fet spintend really do that? thats crazy
[2023-12-31T00:18:03] haku: no idea. lol maybe i can get a 50kilo rider to test it out. im too heavy
[2023-12-31T00:19:54] Yamal: More than 100kg?
[2023-12-31T00:21:01] haku: yea. 105 kilo. average weight in the US 😂
[2023-12-31T00:21:30] Yamal: Still okay
[2023-12-31T00:21:37] Yamal: I’m 95kg
[2023-12-31T00:21:52] Yamal: You can get more than 140kmh really
[2023-12-31T00:22:22] haku: if i would try that i will go to a drag strip. there is one near me.
[2023-12-31T00:22:38] haku: not a drag strip club. theres one of those too
[2023-12-31T00:27:32] Yamal: There are Weped in your city,,?
[2023-12-31T00:27:33] haku: whats the best motor that can fit a vsett 9?
[2023-12-31T00:28:23] haku: or stock is only option

[2023-12-31T00:42:16] haku: rich kids on thier nice parks with surrons and namis
[2023-12-31T00:42:52] Yamal: Namis still good, and nice price from Alliespress
[2023-12-31T00:44:37] Yamal: You have there the Rion Apex with the new tronic x12
[2023-12-31T00:45:01] Yamal: But hight price..
[2023-12-31T00:45:57] haku: yea. im building the budget version 😂
[2023-12-31T00:52:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Available to buy?
[2023-12-31T00:56:57] Yamal: The scooter or the controller ?
[2023-12-31T00:56:59] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha
[2023-12-31T00:57:03] Face de Pin Sucé: The scooter
[2023-12-31T00:57:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Just saw 8.399$
[2023-12-31T00:57:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Same price as some old carbon versions...
[2023-12-31T00:57:34] Yamal: Apex no is carbon
[2023-12-31T00:58:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2023-12-31T00:59:21] Yamal: ?
[2023-12-31T01:00:17] Yamal: <photos/photo_11831@31-12-2023_01-00-17.jpg>
[2023-12-31T01:00:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_11832@31-12-2023_01-00-30.jpg>
[2023-12-31T01:00:41] Yamal: <photos/photo_11833@31-12-2023_01-00-41.jpg>
[2023-12-31T01:02:25] Yamal: I have those photos of the Apex, and as far as I know, the mast, handlebars and fenders are made of carbon.
[2023-12-31T01:02:25] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-31T01:04:16] haku: i imagine some rich kids in hollywood probably riding these
[2023-12-31T01:06:54] haku: in my hood we dont own such things.
[2023-12-31T01:08:16] haku: we ride with our pitbulls and laoties
[2023-12-31T01:14:30] Yamal: In Europe there are some, but generally there are not many
[2023-12-31T01:16:49] Yamal: another scooter that has come out new, with vesc it is the moment tricher, but the aesthetics are not from very far away..
[2023-12-31T01:17:58] Yamal: The inverted suspension system has to work well, honestly, and not many scooters have them.
[2023-12-31T01:24:45] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2023-12-31T01:27:27] haku: in my hood gotta keep a lookout on the opps
[2023-12-31T01:27:54] haku: you never know the las vegas trenches
[2023-12-31T01:28:07] Yamal: Look nice the area heh
[2023-12-31T01:28:11] Yamal: Nice road
[2023-12-31T01:28:23] haku: dis the hood bro
[2023-12-31T01:28:56] haku: this is how walk our pitbulls
[2023-12-31T01:29:13] Yamal: But your dog no is Pitbull
[2023-12-31T01:29:29] haku: he is to me 😂
[2023-12-31T01:30:37] Yamal: Soon you will be drawing black tire lines on that road.
[2023-12-31T01:37:21] NetworkDir: LG MH1 cells fine with 31 IR 3100mAh capacity at 5A discharge and 3000mAh at 10A ?
[2023-12-31T01:38:00] NetworkDir: I plan to make 20s6p on frame with MH1 and 20s5p stock zero cell at bag
[2023-12-31T01:38:28] NetworkDir: for 72V 32Ah - 100A continuous discharge with jkbms
[2023-12-31T01:38:38] Gabe Enzo: Hmm? seperate cells?
[2023-12-31T01:38:45] Gabe Enzo: Orrr
[2023-12-31T01:39:17] Gabe Enzo: Yeah stop it's such a drag looking for oops when scooting
[2023-12-31T01:40:07] NetworkDir: different battery packs
[2023-12-31T01:40:38] NetworkDir: Parallel
[2023-12-31T01:40:52] Gabe Enzo: Why not make it one big one
[2023-12-31T01:41:03] NetworkDir: Not enough space :)
[2023-12-31T01:41:30] Gabe Enzo: If you weld it different you can no? I'm doing 13s7p 7s7p.
[2023-12-31T01:41:40] NetworkDir: No
[2023-12-31T01:41:44] NetworkDir: Max space 120 cells
[2023-12-31T01:41:46] NetworkDir: with spacer
[2023-12-31T01:42:06] Gabe Enzo: You can route the wires out to the external in series
[2023-12-31T01:42:07] Gabe Enzo: hmm
[2023-12-31T01:42:10] Gabe Enzo: but you do u haha
[2023-12-31T01:42:14] Gabe Enzo: your needs
[2023-12-31T01:42:15] NetworkDir: i dont have a any problem with parallel i just ask mh1 quality and reliability
[2023-12-31T02:15:43] Jan: I smell 11inch
[2023-12-31T02:16:52] haku: it comes with 3 rim styles 11,12 and 13. im going with 12 for now just to see how it rides. rough roads sometimes here
[2023-12-31T03:00:55] haku: this is what i mean by brittle petg. is it suppose to snap like this?
[2023-12-31T03:06:11] haku: even the bigger parts snap with 100% infill.
[2023-12-31T03:07:51] haku: .
[2023-12-31T03:07:51] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-31T03:17:42] haku: thats something to do with the first layer yea? does yours do this?
[2023-12-31T03:19:10] haku: i have to figure this out. playing around with temp and speed settings. im still debating if i want to use this stuff on my scooter
[2023-12-31T03:20:18] haku: yea. batteries too right? im still thinking if should print holders or use the ones i got.
[2023-12-31T03:20:55] Happy Giraffe: Printer screen getting some new firmware🌚
[2023-12-31T03:21:49] Happy Giraffe: Also went to Marlin professional firmware for printer. Klipper git I had problems installing on my old laptop so didnt wanna bother
[2023-12-31T03:21:56] haku: these. dont mind the predator in the back 😂
[2023-12-31T03:22:55] Happy Giraffe: How many of these do you fit on them?
[2023-12-31T03:23:19] haku: nice.
[2023-12-31T03:24:17] Happy Giraffe: I would never print a firearm. But it would be dang interesting to do it in a test environment that legally makes it possible
[2023-12-31T03:24:24] haku: what is klipper i always see that word thrown in printing stuff
[2023-12-31T03:24:35] Happy Giraffe: Printer firmware that kicks ass
[2023-12-31T03:25:49] haku: the holders? im still figuring out what glue to use for it.
[2023-12-31T03:26:21] Happy Giraffe: It requires external processing unit for it as 32-bit printers not powerful enough. It is supposed to be used with Arduino. I tried to make my laptop to use Linux and run the processing on it but failed
[2023-12-31T03:26:27] NetworkDir: 5:26AM working for digital pot :D
[2023-12-31T03:31:41] Happy Giraffe: Fucking Linux gits cant install because some errors that fuk it up and I do exactly as in the tutorial😡
[2023-12-31T03:35:49] Happy Giraffe: I mean Mac is horrible as Apple doesnt trust its customers to have more control, Windows just fucks your pc overall with spyware and Linux you spend 10 hours googling some error
[2023-12-31T03:36:34] Happy Giraffe: RPC failed
[2023-12-31T03:39:04] Happy Giraffe: yeah I installed linux mint mothercucker on my old laptop as primary OS
[2023-12-31T04:01:19] Happy Giraffe: yeah it wanted to do an hour update at 128kb/s so I called it a day and shut it off from power button
[2023-12-31T04:05:21] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, too late now as gods pointed me at this way xd
[2023-12-31T04:12:16] haku: <photos/photo_11840@31-12-2023_04-12-16.jpg>
[2023-12-31T04:13:02] haku: good fit? do the cables need to touch the bottom or the sides will do? bottom is pretty deep
[2023-12-31T04:13:54] Happy Giraffe: Bottom would be best to also have. The closer/bigger contact area the strands have with connector : the better the connection
[2023-12-31T04:15:12] haku: gotcha thanks.
[2023-12-31T04:16:11] haku: thickes lt solder i have. this should fill it up.
[2023-12-31T04:16:32] haku: my next size down is 1mm.
[2023-12-31T04:16:57] Happy Giraffe: Just makes sure both surfaces get hot and tip is wet when heating those. Also bit of flux is good to use
[2023-12-31T04:17:23] haku: gotcha. ill take after pics and you guys rate me haha
[2023-12-31T04:18:13] Happy Giraffe: I wonder whats the shipping cost from US to EU. We should make a group buy of Lead solder Tin from you but lets take it to offtopic 😁
[2023-12-31T04:20:20] haku: im not a solder pro. i just use what i find in amazon or home depot 😂
[2023-12-31T04:20:45] haku: you guys have stannol stuff there according to james
[2023-12-31T04:23:47] Happy Giraffe: @Bradhaku We dont have lead solder in EU. Only some company names can buy it😁
[2023-12-31T04:24:29] Happy Giraffe: 1kg spool of lead solder would be enough for years to come and might be worth the taxes and duties
[2023-12-31T04:42:20] haku: i dont even know what are good branded solder here aside from kester
[2023-12-31T04:42:47] haku: ali can be a hit or miss. 😭
[2023-12-31T04:44:05] haku: i also got this flux. its american its not too bad but it leaves a mess
[2023-12-31T04:48:11] Happy Giraffe: Ok with the battery one day I take 500g xd
[2023-12-31T04:48:28] Happy Giraffe: not meant as a snack
[2023-12-31T04:49:11] Happy Giraffe: printer works, tomorrow will make offsets etc start calibrations
[2023-12-31T04:51:30] haku: dang this guy made a giant printer and printed a statue of himself. crazy stuff
[2023-12-31T04:51:35] haku: https://youtu.be/PxcP74W-PgE?si=MiMeb4RpykQkpWV9
[2023-12-31T04:52:34] Happy Giraffe: Not every ender 3 has a preview Image🌚😂
[2023-12-31T04:53:02] haku: thats a nice display. enders come with that or its aftermarket?
[2023-12-31T04:53:47] Happy Giraffe: Nope, this display is on ender 3 s1 and the Pro/Plus variants
[2023-12-31T04:55:03] Happy Giraffe: I love it how much control I have over printer now, can't wait to do more accurate mesh bed leveling with firmware telling me how to adjust bed. Before it stored some fucked up G-Code in its ass and failed first layer if bed fucked xd
[2023-12-31T05:21:19] haku: nice. this is what im saying about enders. its open source. and so much aftermarket support
[2023-12-31T05:23:38] haku: but it just takes knowledge to use.
[2023-12-31T05:36:54] haku: is this what you guys use to compress wires?
[2023-12-31T06:13:04] haku: is this ok? first tikme doing double wires on a qs8
[2023-12-31T06:30:46] Happy Giraffe: If solder seam to copper is smooth and doesnt have any sharp edges telling about bad bonding of the materials
[2023-12-31T06:31:17] haku: i cant fully fit the cover
[2023-12-31T06:32:54] haku: i dont like it. i will re do it on a new qs8
[2023-12-31T06:33:43] haku: its crappy
[2023-12-31T06:44:32] Happy Giraffe: I usually just used double heatshrinks and then one really big one half covering plastic, half on the cables
[2023-12-31T06:55:07] haku: i cant get it to completely snap in but its so close. these double 12 guage is thick

[2023-12-31T09:12:12] Izuna 生活: Alright, on my way to France now.
[2023-12-31T09:12:38] Izuna 生活: I even cleaned the scooter, so it's not too dirty for the hotel room 😂
[2023-12-31T09:22:36] puneDir: Have a nice journey izuna :)
[2023-12-31T09:28:47] haku: enjoy bud! happy new year!
[2023-12-31T09:29:59] haku: is your motor faulty?

[2023-12-31T09:33:09] KierreKikkeli: refuses to work at 3-4v, only worked for like 15mins at 7-8v before i tried to lower the voltage back to 3 and after that it just never worked again even tho the wires are indeed getting the power xd
[2023-12-31T09:33:09] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. KierreKikkeli has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-31T09:35:44] haku: i dont know much geography but what is the way from germany to france? the adennes?
[2023-12-31T09:36:04] haku: or thru belgium?
[2023-12-31T09:37:59] KierreKikkeli: Also to work around the issue where my 1v brake and 2.7v throttle refuse to work properly i need to do input setup with "current" mode and only do it for the throttle, which after i need to go and manually set the values for the brake, any other method results in the 1v brake lever working as both
[2023-12-31T09:39:11] Face de Pin Sucé: This is the shittiest design ever
[2023-12-31T09:41:10] Izuna 生活: No, directly to France. Last train goes from Karlsruhe to Paris.
[2023-12-31T09:45:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Where are you going in France ?
[2023-12-31T09:45:32] Izuna 生活: Paris
[2023-12-31T09:47:47] Izuna 生活: I might also give Lyon a visit for a day if I have enough time.
[2023-12-31T09:48:12] KierreKikkeli: 11V and barely working XD
[2023-12-31T09:48:38] Finn: Dont die there in paris. Good luck😁
[2023-12-31T09:53:04] haku: is paris pretty thugish ruggish? i always thought of it as a nice place with historical buildings
[2023-12-31T09:56:12] Face de Pin Sucé: How much time do you stay ?
[2023-12-31T09:56:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes good luck in Paris
[2023-12-31T09:56:37] Izuna 生活: 5 nights, arriving today and staying till 05.01
[2023-12-31T09:56:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh please come to Lyon to visit Rage Mechanics 😁
[2023-12-31T10:03:08] Yamal: Visit fastride!
[2023-12-31T10:05:35] Izuna 生活: What is the scooter legal situation in France btw? I have not done much research. 😂
[2023-12-31T10:05:48] Izuna 生活: I heard about the ban of rental scooters, but that's it
[2023-12-31T10:07:26] Yamal: must stops in france, fastride, ragemechanic, funtrott, xerider and red Nami, That would be the tourism I would do in the Gabacho country, I also have some friends in the north,,
[2023-12-31T10:09:40] Yamal: Italy Paolo Motors.. 😎😁
[2023-12-31T10:15:39] haku: finish the connectors yay. next i will find a welder 😁
[2023-12-31T10:40:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Xerider ???
[2023-12-31T10:40:44] Face de Pin Sucé: 25Kmh Front and rear light Use bicycle lanes or roads
[2023-12-31T10:41:06] Face de Pin Sucé: When in Paris, be careful and respect 25Kmh
[2023-12-31T10:41:16] Face de Pin Sucé: When in Lyon don't care, go as fast as you can
[2023-12-31T10:41:59] Izuna 生活: Good that I'm German, going to tell them mine only goes 20 😂
[2023-12-31T10:42:28] Izuna 生活: But Paris yeah will be careful, but probably going a lot by foot. Too big city for scooting around.
[2023-12-31T10:42:29] Face de Pin Sucé: x)
[2023-12-31T10:43:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, regarding the population, I recommend you to scoot more than using subways for example
[2023-12-31T10:43:26] Face de Pin Sucé: And if you use scoot, never let it outside, always pick with you
[2023-12-31T10:43:51] Izuna 生活: Yes. Never going to leave my scooter out of sight. Never never
[2023-12-31T10:44:16] Izuna 生活: Got Bluetooth tracker and shit in my bag but eh not going to help if I lose it.
[2023-12-31T10:44:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Especially in Paris x)
[2023-12-31T10:45:07] Izuna 生活: Are stores open in France on Sunday?
[2023-12-31T10:45:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Some are, it depends
[2023-12-31T10:45:38] Face de Pin Sucé: But no escooter shop
[2023-12-31T10:45:50] Izuna 生活: grocery store
[2023-12-31T10:46:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh yes no problem
[2023-12-31T10:46:34] Izuna 生活: I was like, eh going to buy drinks for the trip today in Germany and my mom was like: it's Sunday 😂
[2023-12-31T10:47:00] Izuna 生活: All stores closed so no energy drinks for me :/
[2023-12-31T10:48:08] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2023-12-31T10:48:51] Yamal: I don’t know 😅, they have slack and hunter quad
[2023-12-31T11:04:07] Jan: Its the worst, everywhere else in france is so much nicer
[2023-12-31T11:09:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Hunter Quad is shit
[2023-12-31T11:09:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Slack is average at least
[2023-12-31T11:09:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Xerider is shit company
[2023-12-31T11:31:34] haku: never heard of this. where is it made? western made?
[2023-12-31T11:35:28] haku: i checked its french store. how good is this.
[2023-12-31T11:36:13] haku: looks too much engineering
[2023-12-31T12:13:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Very bad store
[2023-12-31T12:18:42] Mirono escooters: Not again😭
[2023-12-31T12:19:33] Mirono escooters: Man Is discovering current regulated leds. Lol
[2023-12-31T12:20:21] Mirono escooters: Please get education about leds and how to drive them, before messing again. You are fucking around and blaming everything except the problem xD
[2023-12-31T12:47:02] KierreKikkeli: ?? If its rated at 3.3v and something like 0.5A and it doesnt work at at 3.3v at 0.5A it is faulty
[2023-12-31T12:49:28] KierreKikkeli: The fact it worked just fine at 11V without burning the stepdown or led points at it being faulty, especially after i lowered it down back to 3.3v and the light amount just decreased until it was off at around 5v what did i do wrong?
[2023-12-31T12:55:16] francois schempers: how about you use the right tools for the job ? spintend specifically cell a board to use non conventional throttle and light like xiaomi ones, you would save a lot of work and possibly you Vesc by using it instead of butchering it ^^

[2023-12-31T12:56:06] KierreKikkeli: Guess wtf that is
[2023-12-31T12:56:29] francois schempers: then why are you sending 11v to throttle ?
[2023-12-31T12:56:45] KierreKikkeli: Im not?
[2023-12-31T12:56:50] KierreKikkeli: The headlight
[2023-12-31T12:57:04] KierreKikkeli: The 3.3v 0.5A headlight that refuses to work
[2023-12-31T12:57:15] KierreKikkeli: Until at 11v, and that worked until i decreased it back to 3.3 and the light turned off at 5v
[2023-12-31T12:57:39] francois schempers: humm, sorry I misread the thread going through it
[2023-12-31T12:57:51] KierreKikkeli: Np np
[2023-12-31T12:57:53] francois schempers: should work at 5v though
[2023-12-31T12:58:24] francois schempers: you kept the ble ?
[2023-12-31T12:58:47] Mirono escooters: Not learning the basic stuff about leds
[2023-12-31T12:59:49] KierreKikkeli: Tell me what went wrong
[2023-12-31T13:00:14] Mirono escooters: "led current limiting" -google
[2023-12-31T13:01:37] Mirono escooters: But.. why? We have lead solder in eu 😂
[2023-12-31T13:02:01] Mirono escooters: I can go and buy stannol within 5min xD
[2023-12-31T13:02:05] Tommy ª: That led uses 6.7v @170ma
[2023-12-31T13:02:27] Mirono escooters: "blabla 0.5a no current limiting stepdown blabla" 😂
[2023-12-31T13:02:43] Mirono escooters: 11v way to go
[2023-12-31T13:08:42] francois schempers: I think you just burned the shit out of it ^^
[2023-12-31T13:09:04] francois schempers: buy spintend's led, fully compatible, works like a charm
[2023-12-31T13:12:20] Mirono escooters: Problably best idea
[2023-12-31T13:14:15] francois schempers: just one thing though @KierreKikkeli, for help, go in help section, not the general one ;)
[2023-12-31T13:14:31] Mirono escooters: But led spam can go in offtopic ^^
[2023-12-31T13:14:46] Jan: Why?
[2023-12-31T13:18:11] KierreKikkeli: yeah, seems like on mobile i dont have the caregories, mb
[2023-12-31T13:19:30] francois schempers: <photos/photo_11861@31-12-2023_13-19-30.jpg>
[2023-12-31T13:21:40] Izuna 生活: <photos/photo_11862@31-12-2023_13-21-40.jpg>
[2023-12-31T13:22:00] Mirono escooters: So, tldr, ohm's law, 6.7v 170ma 39ohm resistor series (find whatever closest)
[2023-12-31T13:22:07] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_11863@31-12-2023_13-22-07.jpg>
[2023-12-31T13:23:17] Mirono escooters: Weird
[2023-12-31T13:23:28] KierreKikkeli: Yeah i had the amps wrong, didnt frie it but blasted it with 3A and everything between 1 and 11.4V
[2023-12-31T13:23:43] Mirono escooters: I've noticed that ^^
[2023-12-31T13:24:14] KierreKikkeli: Weird, would assume that more -> more light by logic but eh 🤣
[2023-12-31T13:24:28] Mirono escooters: Doesn't work like that (Well yes, but your led doesn't take it.)
[2023-12-31T13:25:18] KierreKikkeli: Also the led has a resistor on it for that purpose? Or is it on the stock display by default?
[2023-12-31T13:26:18] KierreKikkeli: yea, moped lights it is then i guess -.-, "woo" for one of the strictest places with traffic rules :)))))
[2023-12-31T13:28:47] Mirono escooters: Oh no
[2023-12-31T13:29:04] Mirono escooters: Some leds got it on pcb, some got it on display board, some use pwm
[2023-12-31T13:31:13] KierreKikkeli: seems like this one has it on the board
[2023-12-31T13:33:35] Happy Giraffe: Easiest solution to get Led that supports 12-90v
[2023-12-31T13:36:04] NetworkDir: You should update your telegram version
[2023-12-31T13:38:40] KierreKikkeli: easiest and safest solution for future registration as moped is to slap the previous moped/motorbike headlight back onto it, cant nit pick about vehicle light power requirements or whatever in the category if its the same as any other XD
[2023-12-31T13:39:39] KierreKikkeli: do you happen to know the specs for the rearlight?
[2023-12-31T13:39:58] Tommy ª: 5v 120ma
[2023-12-31T13:40:12] KierreKikkeli: thanks
[2023-12-31T13:40:59] KierreKikkeli: telegram x and latest version, time to go back to stock build and hope my acc doesnt get stolen again with my number
[2023-12-31T13:41:19] Happy Giraffe: https://www.magicshine.de/en-gb/kauf-monteer-8500-und-seemee180/ME-StVZO-100-LUX-Fahrradlampe-zum-Direktanschlu%C3%9F-an-das-E-Bike-Grundset-ohne-Powerbank-p535818330
[2023-12-31T13:41:37] Happy Giraffe: Honestly best light there is, suits even German regulation
[2023-12-31T13:42:21] Happy Giraffe: 6-12v from 6v2A to 12v 1.5A so can use with vesc 12v port
[2023-12-31T13:43:09] KierreKikkeli: ye i have it bookmarked, just had a read on the laws and regulations on registering vehicles as a moped and came to the conclusion everything will be moped based, throttle, blinkers lights switches everything
[2023-12-31T13:43:26] KierreKikkeli: easiest way out
[2023-12-31T13:43:35] Happy Giraffe: No need for that
[2023-12-31T13:48:29] Mirono escooters: Not the moped stuff again
[2023-12-31T13:50:03] KierreKikkeli: pain, could get through but based on others experience on similiar things ill just play it safe and go with the guranteed pass
[2023-12-31T13:51:26] Mirono escooters: Well return if it works out, good luck^^
[2023-12-31T13:51:57] KierreKikkeli: ye will do, thanks
[2023-12-31T13:59:41] Happy Giraffe: Nice sleeper
[2023-12-31T13:59:53] Izuna 生活: Thanks
[2023-12-31T14:00:49] Happy Giraffe: Most regular cops wont even bat an eye if not trained for that😁 Prepare for motherfuckers with a small bench roller in the trunk😂
[2023-12-31T14:12:08] Yamal: All most the same I have,, I think

[2023-12-31T14:15:41] Mirono escooters: Omg the front hydraulic wire 😢
[2023-12-31T14:16:48] Izuna 生活: will have to stay like this forever xd
[2023-12-31T14:17:15] Mirono escooters: Nooooo
[2023-12-31T14:17:19] Mirono escooters: Why 😢
[2023-12-31T14:18:01] Izuna 生活: no idea how this oil stuff works and the screw to bleed is completely fucked after the crash
[2023-12-31T14:27:45] Gabe Enzo: in a nutshell everything is cancer
[2023-12-31T14:31:51] Mirono escooters: Oh lol
[2023-12-31T14:32:27] Mirono escooters: Oil stuff is pretty ez to learn If u ever change brake caliper, I would do it Little work, great result
[2023-12-31T14:32:32] puneDir: anybody wanna gift me 2 75100 for my bday?
[2023-12-31T14:33:16] Izuna 生活: I don't even know where to get the tube with the correct length
[2023-12-31T14:33:23] Izuna 生活: and if I can cut it if it's too long
[2023-12-31T14:34:22] Mirono escooters: Sure can @jamessoderstrom teached me
[2023-12-31T14:34:41] Mirono escooters: It's ezpz ^^ And great to know
[2023-12-31T14:34:56] Mirono escooters: Only negative of oil, wire easier But eh
[2023-12-31T14:42:54] KierreKikkeli: ah, correction, i measured the amps wrong, not 3A 0.10A so the led was either faulty or not getting enough A
[2023-12-31T14:48:39] Yamal: 1000lms is little

[2023-12-31T14:49:37] Unknown: Wowowowo
[2023-12-31T14:49:47] Paolo ⁭: ?
[2023-12-31T14:49:53] Unknown: Tig?
[2023-12-31T14:51:02] Face de Pin Sucé: So long to explain, but they always have bad products and know nothing about escooters
[2023-12-31T14:56:23] Yamal: <voice_message>
[2023-12-31T14:58:15] Paolo ⁭: You're friend of Jesus?
[2023-12-31T14:58:47] Yamal: Is just reggae music of the end of year
[2023-12-31T14:58:51] Yamal: You?
[2023-12-31T15:01:59] Paolo ⁭: You
[2023-12-31T15:02:23] Yamal: But I don’t know which Jesus you say
[2023-12-31T15:02:53] Yamal: Mr Paolo tell me
[2023-12-31T15:04:34] Mirono escooters: At wrong voltage :)
[2023-12-31T15:04:53] Mirono escooters: Eh tis dead, find something else 🤷 enough lamp stuff
[2023-12-31T15:05:11] Unknown: Good choice of music. I’m actually Jamaican
[2023-12-31T15:05:11] Yamal: You listen before Alborosie ,,? Is from Italy..
[2023-12-31T15:06:07] Paolo ⁭: The One with rion
[2023-12-31T15:06:11] Yamal: I listen many different music in my life , but reggae from 12 years old , is my side 😂
[2023-12-31T15:06:15] Yamal: Yes why ?
[2023-12-31T15:06:24] Unknown: Alborosie is great & also Gentleman
[2023-12-31T15:06:33] Paolo ⁭: Because the rion you ride with is the same as his one
[2023-12-31T15:07:10] Yamal: The only Rion I ride, is his Rion
[2023-12-31T15:07:20] Unknown: Yeah man same say so
[2023-12-31T15:07:26] Yamal: I have a Nami/Rion
[2023-12-31T15:08:09] Yamal: Like I put everything the Rion in Nami , waiting the battery
[2023-12-31T15:08:44] Yamal: 🔥
[2023-12-31T15:10:02] Jan: No matter how much hate the Rion gets for its performance and scam reputation of the brand. The design and materials are so unique that it will be a topic for a long time
[2023-12-31T15:14:24] Yamal: 🔥
[2023-12-31T15:14:58] Yamal: I like
[2023-12-31T15:15:32] Yamal: There are a lot of people who hate the kidney and criticize it,
[2023-12-31T15:17:23] Yamal: everyone can like it or not, but it's strong when someone tells you no! Rion is shit
[2023-12-31T15:17:26] Yamal: I do it better in the oven at home
[2023-12-31T15:17:26] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2023-12-31T15:20:17] Jesús: Inundaciones??? Que pasa no puede decir lo que quiera ? 🫨
[2023-12-31T15:20:24] Mirono escooters: English
[2023-12-31T15:20:45] Jesús: Floods??? What’s up, can’t you say what you want? 🫨
[2023-12-31T15:22:01] Jesús: I think it’s very bad that a person is silenced for saying what he thinks.
[2023-12-31T15:22:44] Mirono escooters: Lol, you misunderstand 😂 It is when you send 4 msg in a short time, aka "spamming"
[2023-12-31T15:22:58] Mirono escooters: And it's only 2 mins, lol
[2023-12-31T15:23:14] Jesús: He hasn’t said anything bad or disrespected anyone for that to be done to him already 2 times
[2023-12-31T15:23:59] Mirono escooters: If he doesn't learn, he will keep getting muted Don't spam, compress msg, put together Not that hard
[2023-12-31T15:24:40] Jesús: That both should be removed.
[2023-12-31T15:24:57] Jesús: It’s just an opinion.
[2023-12-31T15:25:00] Mirono escooters: Lol, no. It's here for a reason Read why we introduced it. You are ignoring my msg xD
[2023-12-31T15:31:12] Happy Giraffe: I will defo be like this with my new fancy firmware
[2023-12-31T15:32:12] Happy Giraffe: TIG🌚
[2023-12-31T15:32:56] Happy Giraffe: Atleast the torch, I love TIG so much. Insane pen on steel
[2023-12-31T15:33:30] Happy Giraffe: Best there is value wise. Great choice my friend👍
[2023-12-31T15:34:30] Happy Giraffe: Not that little when focused on a beam. Lumen is not a good indication of light to the road. Lux is better👍 it takes lens etc beam pattern into account aswell
[2023-12-31T15:34:35] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2023-12-31T15:34:58] Happy Giraffe: Hahaha
[2023-12-31T15:35:38] Happy Giraffe: So the small pinchets/snippers are your ground?😁
[2023-12-31T15:37:25] Happy Giraffe: Cant wait to get to walking the cup again. Need to practice for the steel bike frame
[2023-12-31T15:39:23] Mirono escooters: Good point
[2023-12-31T15:40:32] Happy Giraffe: 90% of the cyclists here point their lights at the sky so I get flashbanged and they cant see shit of the road😂 kinda wish us to have the german regulation aswell
[2023-12-31T15:40:49] Mirono escooters: Yeah this weird
[2023-12-31T15:40:57] Mirono escooters: Annoying af
[2023-12-31T15:41:28] Mirono escooters: Also car lights sometimes blinding.. good scoot stands high. Moped not
[2023-12-31T15:41:31] Happy Giraffe: But lets continue halogen on off-topic😂
[2023-12-31T15:52:37] Yamal: For me, the light is not enough for long routes outside the city, but it is what there is... it is what I have... there are better options but more expensive
[2023-12-31T15:53:19] Yamal: Maybe for a Xiaomi or a G30 they are fine... for a Nami no!😁
[2023-12-31T15:55:56] Mirono escooters: Prefer nowhere but eh, offtopic better (Or denis group) 🌚
[2023-12-31T15:59:12] haku: ran out of petg mid print and used pla after. thats good to know you can do that. bambu poop chute
[2023-12-31T16:01:48] haku: also messing around with petg 21700 holders
[2023-12-31T16:11:02] Gabe Enzo: Guys I'm so fucked for this physics exam 💩
[2023-12-31T16:37:27] Happy Giraffe: Dis is how we steal bike cellar energy
[2023-12-31T16:45:35] puneDir: im going to make shittiest new year joke soon
[2023-12-31T17:01:22] Gabe Enzo: what does 30kmh-¹ mean?
[2023-12-31T17:01:52] Mirono escooters: I'm curious
[2023-12-31T17:01:56] Mirono escooters: Context
[2023-12-31T17:02:04] puneDir: see you next year
[2023-12-31T17:02:07] Mirono escooters: That's one hefty bike
[2023-12-31T17:03:04] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11873@31-12-2023_17-03-04.jpg>
[2023-12-31T17:03:32] Gabe Enzo: I'm getting kicked out dawg
[2023-12-31T17:08:47] Mirono escooters: The unit "30 km/h⁻¹" means "30 kilometers per hour per second." It represents the rate of change of speed over time. It's commonly used in physics and mathematics. Best I can do
[2023-12-31T17:09:17] Gabe Enzo: I see. so it's asking me for per second. That's ez.
[2023-12-31T17:09:22] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2023-12-31T17:09:37] Mirono escooters: Possible, no idea. Haven't touched physics in ages
[2023-12-31T17:41:24] Mirono escooters: Well why import from merika then, eu ez
[2023-12-31T17:48:37] Mirono escooters: Still some certainties in life!
[2023-12-31T17:50:15] Mirono escooters: Funny government restricting stuff, Acting like we are toddlers🌚
[2023-12-31T17:54:52] Mirono escooters: That here too, that's a EU thing I mean restricting regarding health stuff
[2023-12-31T18:04:24] Happy Giraffe: 37kg
[2023-12-31T18:26:08] Mirono escooters: Right I forgot to measure bomber
[2023-12-31T18:42:24] Happy Giraffe: No worries
[2023-12-31T18:43:16] Happy Giraffe: Blue silicone spring replacement, lets see
[2023-12-31T18:44:20] Happy Giraffe: Damn printer got some speed now when homing😳 Thing becoming soon a beast, now with the 260°c limit removed as I have a bi-metal heatbreak it can do 300°c now🌚
[2023-12-31T19:35:19] Jesús: Do you know that it can be the blue light flashing from the controller? Apparently it doesn’t work.
[2023-12-31T19:36:36] Tommy ª: dead regulator or power supply or bms
[2023-12-31T19:37:44] Jesús: Bms I don’t think it’s it has nothing to do with the controller
[2023-12-31T19:38:34] Tommy ª: just measure 3.3v and 5v lines if it flashes like the led
[2023-12-31T19:41:13] Paolo ⁭: I think is BMS too
[2023-12-31T19:41:57] Tommy ª: hmm in my situation my vesc can handle his own charge on capacitors for at least 1 or 2 seconds
[2023-12-31T19:48:34] Jesús: Bms? The other controller works correctly, I don’t have bms bypass free discharge
[2023-12-31T20:03:22] Mirono escooters: Whoat
[2023-12-31T20:03:53] Tommy ª: if you disconect the battery it keeps on for some seconds
[2023-12-31T20:04:02] Mirono escooters: Ah, lol, yes
[2023-12-31T20:06:18] Finn: Obviously the caps are charged😂 and supply the dc dc with power
[2023-12-31T21:05:33] haku: lmao
[2023-12-31T21:09:21] Happy Giraffe: Has anyone seen vesc being used succesfully with Bafang BBSHD? I might get a good DH frame ~400€ to install one on and the motor for ~200€. Then 80100 vesc on it would be kickass combo for dirt cheap
[2023-12-31T21:10:58] haku: ty. i dont want to show the solder job 😭
[2023-12-31T22:15:44] Izuna 生活: I have finally arrived at the hotel. Room seems good, but it's at 4th floor 💀
[2023-12-31T22:16:33] haku: nice check for hidden cameras 😂
[2023-12-31T22:16:34] Izuna 生活: I was carrying the scooter around so much today. I can't move
[2023-12-31T22:16:37] Mirono escooters: No lift?
[2023-12-31T22:16:44] Izuna 生活: No :/
[2023-12-31T22:16:46] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2023-12-31T22:17:03] Izuna 生活: And I forgot to ask if they could give me room at 1 floor
[2023-12-31T22:17:03] Mirono escooters: I already died with stairs and my g30 Yours is at least +15kg
[2023-12-31T22:17:12] Izuna 生活: whatever
[2023-12-31T22:17:17] Izuna 生活: now too bad I'm strong
[2023-12-31T22:17:19] Mirono escooters: Good hotel? Nice location?
[2023-12-31T22:17:21] Mirono escooters: Alone?
[2023-12-31T22:17:25] Izuna 生活: Yes
[2023-12-31T22:17:28] Mirono escooters: You Alpha male luckily
[2023-12-31T22:18:15] haku: is it true in paris girls have hairy armpits?
[2023-12-31T22:18:16] Izuna 生活: Hotel seems alright, room is clean and everything I need included. However the location is a little bit industry like, but some nice hills for me to push
[2023-12-31T22:18:17] puneDir: 2024
[2023-12-31T22:18:44] Izuna 生活: Have to be careful tho 😂 still running no temp sensor setup
[2023-12-31T22:22:10] Mirono escooters: Uh oh
[2023-12-31T22:22:54] Mirono escooters: After I carried g30 upstairs, girlfriend Xiaomi was left. Man, that thing weighs NOTHING in comparison. Easy 1 hand lift😂 And that has full suspension 🙈
[2023-12-31T22:30:52] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters I'm in luck.
[2023-12-31T22:31:08] Gabe Enzo: Maybe Ireland doesn't suck after all

[2023-12-31T22:36:17] haku: at 7:30 mark he has the scooter i wanted to build last summer. still thinking if i want that frame
[2023-12-31T22:38:35] haku: if i want to max out and go fast with 70h motors. i think sitting down might be a safer option 😂
[2023-12-31T22:44:50] haku: thats awsome.
[2023-12-31T22:45:19] haku: 2awg wires on a scooter 😭
[2023-12-31T23:03:29] Happy Giraffe: QS180/90H would be insane motor for emoto
[2023-12-31T23:05:43] haku: that little white seated scooter is pretty cool. i was thinking of getting the frame.
[2023-12-31T23:07:31] Happy Giraffe: Which one?
[2023-12-31T23:08:11] haku: <photos/photo_11877@31-12-2023_23-08-11.jpg>
[2023-12-31T23:08:44] haku: this one its around the 7:30 mark on the youtube video
[2023-12-31T23:09:18] haku: the dropouts are 160mm. perfect fit for my motors
[2023-12-31T23:33:21] Andrew Edwards: I have had issues with my first motor we’re it blew up my controller so I replaced the motor and controller and now my rear motor is making a bad noise and when I pulled old motor apart to have a look it was full of rust I was wanting to find a that has better water resistance
[2023-12-31T23:35:06] haku: im not a pro at motors. but we have vendors on the eu here if you need a new one. wait for them to pm you. very helpful folks
[2023-12-31T23:37:39] Andrew Edwards: okay well hoping I can get a bit of incite and or help
[2023-12-31T23:38:19] haku: @ vesclords help this fella
[2023-12-31T23:38:45] Tommy ª: how people can rust a motor inside?
[2023-12-31T23:38:48] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2023-12-31T23:39:26] haku: bad seal im sure.
[2023-12-31T23:40:03] haku: very hard to do though
[2023-12-31T23:40:45] Andrew Edwards: <photos/photo_11878@31-12-2023_23-40-45.jpg>
[2023-12-31T23:40:46] Andrew Edwards: <photos/photo_11879@31-12-2023_23-40-46.jpg>
[2023-12-31T23:40:46] Andrew Edwards: <video_file>
[2023-12-31T23:41:34] haku: can you show photos of your motor. the rust parts
[2023-12-31T23:42:33] Andrew Edwards: Yeah but it has happened and I think it’s happening again if not overloaded it by towing
[2023-12-31T23:43:51] Andrew Edwards: Not atm but I can get pictures
[2023-12-31T23:45:22] Andrew Edwards: I can send a video of the motor I have on the king now making a weird noise
[2023-12-31T23:52:10] Mirono escooters: Very suce, if you nEed disconnect Otherwise screw terminals
[2023-12-31T23:52:23] Andrew Edwards: <video_file>
[2023-12-31T23:54:12] haku: sounds normal to me. only thing not normal is no vesc 😂
[2023-12-31T23:59:25] Andrew Edwards: That’s only the rear motor and it is loud compared to the front motor
[2023-12-31T23:59:56] haku: open it and check. maybe rusty bearings.
[2024-01-01T00:10:45] Happy Giraffe: This I probably might use for next batt😂 Only if it had mounted version....
[2024-01-01T00:22:39] Mirono escooters: Nothing a load of epoxy can't fix
[2024-01-01T00:23:54] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I kinda want a box in a box situation where only cable I have to connect is the big power one. Batt box would have a handle to pull it out xd
[2024-01-01T00:25:26] haku: i have a xt60 version of what your saying. can be mounted on a surface
[2024-01-01T00:30:20] francois schempers: happy new year !
[2024-01-01T00:30:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, saw that already x)
[2024-01-01T00:30:55] haku: happy new year eu! 8hrs to go for me
[2024-01-01T00:31:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Happy new year guys 🔥
[2024-01-01T00:36:36] Happy Giraffe: You too! Happy New Year! ;)
[2024-01-01T00:37:20] Happy Giraffe: Yeah I have the XT90 but it only mounts the male plug what I have. I will look at it later
[2024-01-01T00:48:43] francois schempers: go for qs8-s much better than xt90
[2024-01-01T00:50:27] Happy Giraffe: I want a single connector that handles 200A
[2024-01-01T00:50:47] Happy Giraffe: QS10 if it exists haha
[2024-01-01T01:01:35] Happy Giraffe: Now first test print, a bag closing clip. Will give printer its fastest ride yet at 120 mm/s. Poor bed slinger Also put some thermal paste around the heating unit so should be better now xd
[2024-01-01T01:04:31] Mirono escooters: Happy new year bbs
[2024-01-01T01:04:55] haku: is there a quality and difference in print on bedslingers? i want an a1 with ams.
[2024-01-01T01:06:27] haku: if it goes on sale i really want multicolor printing
[2024-01-01T01:07:45] haku: i think they are also releasing a bigger version of the a1. i forgot what its called
[2024-01-01T01:11:51] Happy Giraffe: Why bother with it when already have better
[2024-01-01T01:12:21] Happy Giraffe: Wait for something else or get AMS to current. Perhaps they do XL version later
[2024-01-01T01:12:27] haku: true dat. just looking for an excuse to get another one hehe
[2024-01-01T01:12:33] Happy Giraffe: Lol, this old grandpa printer seems to have become a beast. Never seen or believed it to be capable of these speeds😳
[2024-01-01T01:12:45] haku: agreed an xl bambu would be cool
[2024-01-01T01:13:28] haku: i think ill just purchase an ams. full price though
[2024-01-01T01:14:13] haku: you have the know hows of printing. thats why.i couldnt learn all that
[2024-01-01T01:15:48] Happy Giraffe: I have the know how to watch a youtube video and use github as I got no idea how to make my own FW xd
[2024-01-01T01:16:44] Happy Giraffe: Gotta remember to donate bit to the developer when I get more money xd
[2024-01-01T01:17:04] Jhinzuo ~~: Happy new year !!
[2024-01-01T01:43:28] haku: this black petd not behaving. or printer settings suck
[2024-01-01T01:44:15] Happy Giraffe: Carbonfiber PETG at 120mm/s😁
[2024-01-01T01:44:45] haku: container for drill bits and soldering bits
[2024-01-01T01:45:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes it does
[2024-01-01T01:45:58] Happy Giraffe: How many grams of filament?😂
[2024-01-01T01:46:55] Happy Giraffe: That would be perfect then👍 So awesome
[2024-01-01T01:51:10] haku: <photos/photo_11883@01-01-2024_01-51-10.jpg>
[2024-01-01T01:51:21] haku: ill still use it oh well
[2024-01-01T01:52:09] haku: my aliexpress tool collection. i just need pegboards in the back and more shelves and this is a solid solder/spot weld station
[2024-01-01T01:59:59] haku: i think so. this overture black filament
[2024-01-01T02:02:42] haku: its some tricky stuff. pla prints perfectly. i have no idea why this petg prints like this
[2024-01-01T02:06:24] Happy Giraffe: How about you two give us settings you use? I use 120mm/s boom works
[2024-01-01T02:06:31] Happy Giraffe: Don't go 150+
[2024-01-01T02:06:44] Happy Giraffe: Maybe even stay at 120, back in time 60mm/s was fast for PETG
[2024-01-01T02:08:31] haku: ill try that next when prinnting tools. thanks bud
[2024-01-01T02:08:57] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_11886@01-01-2024_02-08-57.jpg>
[2024-01-01T02:09:26] Happy Giraffe: And show us your "retraction" setting
[2024-01-01T02:10:23] haku: ill try to find that setting. its hiding under all these words somewhere 😂
[2024-01-01T02:22:35] Happy Giraffe: just use search
[2024-01-01T10:30:25] Izuna 生活: Got a flat.
[2024-01-01T10:30:26] Izuna 生活: Fuck me
[2024-01-01T10:30:28] Izuna 生活: 😂
[2024-01-01T10:30:38] Izuna 生活: Hotel is some kilometres away
[2024-01-01T10:53:04] Izuna 生活: <video_file>
[2024-01-01T10:53:31] Izuna 生活: Going to swap the tire tonight or smth, first of all eat my breakfast that I bought and then drive to Paris center
[2024-01-01T10:55:58] Izuna 生活: Always the rear 🙄 I'm too fat
[2024-01-01T11:06:58] Face de Pin Sucé: What pressure you using ?
[2024-01-01T11:24:32] Izuna 生活: Usually ~2.5-3, but I think it lost pressure
[2024-01-01T11:24:56] Izuna 生活: I have replacement tube with me and tools, I just hope I have not tightened the screws too much since I don't have torque wrench
[2024-01-01T11:50:40] sombre_enfant: Put 3.6
[2024-01-01T14:39:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Happy new year 😁 https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1jxXXhMB1z/?igsh=cGk1ZjUxNnUydnV5
[2024-01-01T21:32:26] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters starting to like this a bit 👀
[2024-01-01T21:32:33] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11887@01-01-2024_21-32-33.jpg>
[2024-01-01T21:33:29] Mirono escooters: Finally : D
[2024-01-01T21:49:44] haku: happy new year fellas! looking forward to 2024 with more knowledge and new PRs
[2024-01-01T22:20:21] Chris Culver: So uh, I need a 3k resistor and don't have one. Can I just put 3 1k resistors in series? Lol
[2024-01-01T22:24:13] Chris Culver: Woah holy crap I can
[2024-01-01T22:36:17] Mirono escooters: Yes, lol
[2024-01-01T23:33:26] Nirel: Question 🙋🏻‍♂️ Is it possible to connect Flipsky 75200 pro with flipsky 75100 ?
[2024-01-01T23:38:20] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/hSBrjDxvtFc?si=pScispBPKS-tEyJL
[2024-01-01T23:38:32] haku: as an american im so embarassed
[2024-01-01T23:39:12] haku: dude needs to kick it with the vesc lords
[2024-01-01T23:41:16] Happy Giraffe: Fastest ninebox max🌚 thats like if you slap 15s battery on it with some fw😂
[2024-01-01T23:43:05] haku: @AJAJ1992 is this true what hes saying? 😂
[2024-01-01T23:43:52] Jan: 😅
[2024-01-01T23:43:55] Jan: 😬
[2024-01-01T23:44:21] haku: maybe first in america. i wanted that title. bro stole my idea
[2024-01-01T23:44:29] Jan: XD
[2024-01-01T23:45:04] Jan: This dude knew that there are faster ones, but decided to post it anyway as Fastest Ninebot Max to get comments (to boost algorithm)
[2024-01-01T23:45:26] haku: i know lol
[2024-01-02T00:07:52] Happy Giraffe: Modern world in single message
[2024-01-02T00:08:11] Happy Giraffe: Whoring for attention in social media
[2024-01-02T00:16:34] haku: this is why i dont have personal social media aside from youtube and reddit
[2024-01-02T00:20:59] Jan: By the cost of credibility
[2024-01-02T00:31:38] haku: agreed. but im still subed to him. not alot of scooter channels that i know
[2024-01-02T00:36:53] haku: scooters are just not a trend in the US. these guys think thier stock store bought stuff is the shit.
[2024-01-02T00:40:40] haku: fortunate for you guys telegram is not a popular platform in the US. i got lucky and found this
[2024-01-02T00:50:29] NetworkDir: i don't like another social media like all Meta brands (instagram, facebook, whatsapp)
[2024-01-02T00:50:32] NetworkDir: telegram on top
[2024-01-02T00:53:58] Happy Giraffe: Meta apps is just misinformation and scam ads😂
[2024-01-02T00:55:00] haku: EU is just so ahead in scooters. this guy wearing full racing gear and doing the scooter dance back in the 2000s. https://youtu.be/989-7xsRLR4?si=WVFQy0D0KI7A7luG
[2024-01-02T01:26:49] Gabe Enzo: Lol same. it's hilarious them riding on their stock Surrons.
[2024-01-02T01:28:51] haku: dont get me wrong bro. there are monster surrons here but not in my city.
[2024-01-02T01:31:34] haku: mostly kids with stock surrons, talaria and the onewheel thing.
[2024-01-02T02:33:35] haku: hey guys ive had this iphone for about 2 months and no ones claiming it. is there a way for me to use it as a vesc display?
[2024-01-02T02:49:07] Oreo huzky: If cloud locked buy new unlocked iPhone 11 mainbord replace it and install vesc software on it that’s the easiest way there are also ways to remove iCloud lock with software but that’s really hard and takes a lot of effort
[2024-01-02T03:29:15] haku: thanks. would it be a good display though? do iphones work well with vesc?
[2024-01-02T04:45:45] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if apple made it like their home button previously that when you replace it without apple code your phone stops just working "apple things"
[2024-01-02T04:49:22] Tommy ª: actually there is a screen compatible like phone size?
[2024-01-02T04:49:45] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/VOZwbD05p-w?si=Y934mUmaIXi-R6R5
[2024-01-02T04:50:11] Happy Giraffe: Only if someone used Vesc with Bafang BBSHD, I would never want to buy a BAC855😭 Its inrunner motor so should work good but I would be the first ones to use vesc it seems... One guy spotted with Flipsky https://youtu.be/ItzcSAl6Ry0?si=oKpIvLYFxtg-8ADm
[2024-01-02T04:52:00] Andrew Edwards: Well no point trying that the motor is not working
[2024-01-02T05:04:39] haku: are talarias sold in the europe?
[2024-01-02T05:07:11] Happy Giraffe: Yup, they might be the best police magnet I think
[2024-01-02T05:18:09] haku: this is the reason for chosing an ebike over a scooter. an inrunner can do these ofroad. scooter in small wheels is kinda sketchy
[2024-01-02T05:19:14] Tommy ª: You have loicense for that?
[2024-01-02T05:19:21] haku: someday ill get a used surron.
[2024-01-02T05:22:00] haku: dam these transparent wraps look kinda cool
[2024-01-02T05:22:44] Tommy ª: Imagine casually if the wrap gets broken and you don't notice
[2024-01-02T05:23:35] haku: thats true
[2024-01-02T05:24:19] Tommy ª: 4 tubes in 2 days, I love it
[2024-01-02T05:24:53] haku: oh no 😭
[2024-01-02T05:32:32] Happy Giraffe: Friend could sell me bbshd that just need stator replacement. If I get old DH bike cheap, might slap it to that and call a day. Then would have 2 bikes😁 QS90 sadly seems too wide for bicycle frames with it's 90H magnet lol
[2024-01-02T05:42:17] haku: @Happy_Giraffe check this out. petg bearing. no assembly needed.
[2024-01-02T05:44:06] Happy Giraffe: Haha, abs would work better I think to have cleaner surface
[2024-01-02T05:45:08] haku: for abs i would need to print in a well ventilated place yea?
[2024-01-02T05:45:20] Happy Giraffe: Plan B, if motherfuckers dont wanna sell bikes at reasonable prices I slowly learn framebuilding everyday and make jigs ready for that and make my own that would fit a QS90😁
[2024-01-02T05:46:09] Happy Giraffe: Wait, its 6:45 AM. I meant PLA I'm intoxicated the first minutes of waking up
[2024-01-02T05:47:24] haku: thats the move bro.
[2024-01-02T05:47:31] Happy Giraffe: Yeah that's a thing with abs but as you have an enclosure you could maybe seal it a bit from sides and make a tube with a fan to push air outside window or a filter
[2024-01-02T05:48:37] haku: if i had welding skills i would build a mini bike. kinda like the fiido but bigger battery and motors.
[2024-01-02T05:49:31] Happy Giraffe: Even making a scooter frame is hard AF, it has easier geometry than bike but even small misaligment at 100kmh/60mph speeds makes it wobbly. Steel ones need additional support arms to counter the wobble at highspeed
[2024-01-02T05:50:26] Happy Giraffe: Yeah welding not the hardest actually I think. One needs a frame jig and a setup to perfectly align and set everything level
[2024-01-02T05:51:17] Happy Giraffe: QS90 is 120mm diameter haha http://www.cnqsmotor.com/en/article_read/QSMOTOR%2090%201000W%20Mid%20Drive%20Motor%20With%20Belt%20Shaft/899.html Im editing these not to cause spam lol
[2024-01-02T05:53:09] Happy Giraffe: Real men print PEEK
[2024-01-02T05:53:21] Happy Giraffe: 370°z nozzle and 120°c bed
[2024-01-02T05:56:23] haku: isnt that the engineering filament? very expensive stuff
[2024-01-02T05:58:15] haku: good lawd
[2024-01-02T06:04:02] haku: mid drive scooter. reminds me of the old razor e scooters
[2024-01-02T06:21:32] Happy Giraffe: I wish someone would try this. I think it would be insanely powerful if used with 10kw and a reduction😳
[2024-01-02T06:22:44] haku: that would be cool to see. i think they sell the whole dropout assembly.
[2024-01-02T06:25:09] haku: i have no idea how they would mount this on a frame
[2024-01-02T12:04:22] Mirono escooters: How
[2024-01-02T12:04:27] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't have the energy to repair that
[2024-01-02T12:31:23] Jan: I usually printed it at 400°C nozzle and 200°C bed
[2024-01-02T12:31:34] Jan: But its really ass
[2024-01-02T12:31:45] Jan: I recommend PEKK >>> PEEK
[2024-01-02T12:36:33] Jan: You dont need peek unless you plan to have 3d printed parts for med tech certification
[2024-01-02T13:14:21] Happy Giraffe: Damn still 50°c above my nozzle and 20°c above bed...
[2024-01-02T13:14:36] Happy Giraffe: Seems I gotta stick with CF Nylon12
[2024-01-02T13:15:01] Jan: Thats an alright material
[2024-01-02T14:00:39] Mirono escooters: That needs a whole heated isolated room, right? (That's the only way I see in FB groups, xD)
[2024-01-02T14:01:03] Mirono escooters: I'm not dedicated enough to build such a printer. PEtg works fine for me 🙈
[2024-01-02T14:01:06] Jan: It somewhat works without but the warp is shit
[2024-01-02T14:01:36] Jan: Its also useless when you dont plan to spend 500$/kg filament
[2024-01-02T14:01:50] Mirono escooters: XD fair
[2024-01-02T14:03:54] Happy Giraffe: I got best cooling ever
[2024-01-02T14:06:02] Mirono escooters: -30*?
[2024-01-02T14:17:04] Happy Giraffe: -16°c to -20 something today I dont have meter at home
[2024-01-02T14:18:11] Happy Giraffe: Gotta love that 5% infill for bank account reasons
[2024-01-02T14:43:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Wow
[2024-01-02T15:28:14] puneDir: Wouldnt if it be funny if i install gen1 on zero 10x
[2024-01-02T15:28:19] puneDir: And zero motors on ninebot
[2024-01-02T15:32:27] Mirono escooters: 😢
[2024-01-02T15:33:41] puneDir: Fuck 50h All my homies use gen 1
[2024-01-02T15:35:23] Finn: Naah 1s motor for the win
[2024-01-02T16:55:35] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: haha
[2024-01-02T17:01:45] Mirono escooters: Es4 motor 😍
[2024-01-02T17:12:03] Izuna 生活: Well, time to go to the next hardware store and pick up an allen key. FML why did I bring a fucking screw driver instead of torque wrench+ forgot to bring the correct allen bit.
[2024-01-02T17:13:49] Izuna 生活: @PaoloWu What size of Allen key do I need for the tire screws?
[2024-01-02T17:14:15] Izuna 生活: At home I always choose what fits 😂
[2024-01-02T17:17:00] Izuna 生活: Ah shit, it's already too late to go to the hardware store. Going to do it tomorrow.
[2024-01-02T17:18:17] Tommy ª: spain roads
[2024-01-02T17:18:41] Tommy ª: i slapped my vesc directly at my ximi frame, i got over 3º temps
[2024-01-02T17:49:43] Mirono escooters: You never get a day off xd
[2024-01-02T17:52:22] Gabe Enzo: I'm pretty sure the reason why your rear tyre keeps popping is because of no suspension. Your front never pops. And obviously weight is equally distributed unless you're using a seat, which you arent.
[2024-01-02T17:52:40] Gabe Enzo: Even if not, suspension would lower the chances.
[2024-01-02T17:55:04] Mirono escooters: More weight on rear. I think, he just needs more pressure.
[2024-01-02T18:57:53] Izuna 生活: Found these short ass Allen keys at a supermarket, as well as this screw driver and now I use it to extend it for more torque/grip. I'm brilliant
[2024-01-02T18:58:22] Izuna 生活: and then I forgot which way the screws unscrew 💀
[2024-01-02T18:59:15] Tommy ª: M365= Best friend
[2024-01-02T18:59:56] Izuna 生活: Yes I think it just lost pressure before and then fucked itself up.
[2024-01-02T19:00:22] Izuna 生活: Because I was already feeling it when starting to ride and was like eh, going to pump it up after the ride. That was too late 😂
[2024-01-02T19:08:31] Izuna 生活: This was works even better, neat
[2024-01-02T19:16:34] Mirono escooters: Good its not alu inbus
[2024-01-02T19:16:37] Izuna 生活: Urgh one of the screws is damaged
[2024-01-02T19:17:21] Mirono escooters: Hammer a torx in
[2024-01-02T19:17:24] Izuna 生活: can't get the Allen key inserted fully, the torx would work but can't turn because no grip.
[2024-01-02T19:18:23] Mirono escooters: Hammer allen in
[2024-01-02T19:19:47] Izuna 生活: Tomorrow
[2024-01-02T19:19:56] Izuna 生活: If I find something to hammer with
[2024-01-02T19:19:58] Gabe Enzo: oh god
[2024-01-02T19:20:01] Gabe Enzo: praying for you
[2024-01-02T19:20:04] Izuna 生活: Besides the screw driver which doesn't work
[2024-01-02T19:20:14] Izuna 生活: With the right tools no problem
[2024-01-02T19:27:53] Mirono escooters: Use your head (Literally)?
[2024-01-02T19:28:22] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2024-01-02T21:02:28] Happy Giraffe: Torque sensor seems fucked now, was a surprise that bike wheel spun at full power luckily had stud tire on wet ground on smooth rock floor so didnt have any grip...
[2024-01-02T21:02:28] Happy Giraffe: Gotta love 0.74 idle float voltage to 1.58v jumps
[2024-01-02T21:04:33] Happy Giraffe: Yeah that was my reaction, this torque sensing bottom bracket cost fucking 200€ Worked the warranty year and then fucked up
[2024-01-02T21:05:29] Finn: Obv it worked the warranty year
[2024-01-02T21:05:33] Finn: Its made to break
[2024-01-02T21:06:00] Finn: We live in a capital oriented time
[2024-01-02T21:06:26] Tommy ª: Best noise ❤️
[2024-01-02T21:07:19] haku: i had that same issue with my throttle attached to adc adaptor
[2024-01-02T21:07:44] Unknown: Fun fact the time in the in an accident feels like 3-5 minutes
[2024-01-02T21:07:55] haku: maybe different problem idk
[2024-01-02T21:07:56] Happy Giraffe: This issue goes away when torque sensor disconnected and just throttle and brake connected on adc module
[2024-01-02T21:08:02] Unknown: From recent experience
[2024-01-02T21:08:52] haku: i see
[2024-01-02T21:09:16] Happy Giraffe: I need to 3D print a "ladder" step next to my throttle so I can cruise at 20/50% max power Rest thumb against the plastic part
[2024-01-02T21:09:26] Mirono escooters: Oh no
[2024-01-02T21:09:46] Happy Giraffe: -20°c is nothing
[2024-01-02T21:09:56] Mirono escooters: For alpha happy giraffe
[2024-01-02T21:10:04] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2024-01-02T21:10:24] Mirono escooters: Wdym?
[2024-01-02T21:10:40] Mirono escooters: Eh can go another 1000km with some oil ;) 😂
[2024-01-02T21:10:58] Tommy ª: it was like that for 2 years 💀
[2024-01-02T21:11:10] Happy Giraffe: I mean battery I take with me to warm space after -10°c but other than that everything should work...my grandpa had sex outside in -35°c forest with just a blanket
[2024-01-02T21:11:31] Mirono escooters: Whoat
[2024-01-02T21:11:42] Mirono escooters: So cold 🤏
[2024-01-02T21:12:10] Happy Giraffe: Its interesting vesc booted up no problem after leaving 7 hours -20°c
[2024-01-02T21:12:19] Mirono escooters: Why wouldn't it
[2024-01-02T21:12:58] Unknown: I've been In an accident like 15 minutes ago. A car pulled out on me I was on 50-60kmh direct hit
[2024-01-02T21:13:19] Mirono escooters: Oof, no good. do you have speed limits?
[2024-01-02T21:13:41] Happy Giraffe: Ask the torque sensor😂
[2024-01-02T21:13:45] Mirono escooters: Yeah, cheap and good
[2024-01-02T21:14:07] Happy Giraffe: Hmm that might be, how is it for thermals? Havent even thought about it
[2024-01-02T21:14:15] Mirono escooters: Good
[2024-01-02T21:14:26] Tommy ª: in mine i cant go more than 27 bc i have essential battery 😭
[2024-01-02T21:14:29] Mirono escooters: My Esc and batt is potted. I love it And no scared for water
[2024-01-02T21:14:44] Unknown: Not my fault there I honked twice
[2024-01-02T21:15:01] Mirono escooters: Except weight and money 😜😜
[2024-01-02T21:15:07] Mirono escooters: And that
[2024-01-02T21:15:12] Unknown: I was very visible
[2024-01-02T21:15:18] Happy Giraffe: Weight not a problem if I do steel frame anyways
[2024-01-02T21:15:28] Unknown: I thought he saw me
[2024-01-02T21:15:44] Happy Giraffe: Well warranty gets send to you haha😂😂😂
[2024-01-02T21:15:58] Mirono escooters: Well, if you have 25kmh rules, its still your fault (I don't make the rules 😜)
[2024-01-02T21:16:16] Happy Giraffe: And Spintend Amy is cursing
[2024-01-02T21:16:19] Mirono escooters: Going 50-60, I never do unless good road where basically no one can cut me off. I don't want a accident again🙈
[2024-01-02T21:17:01] Tommy ª: i remember in my motorcycle going at 60 on an avenue and literally a bulldozer pulled out without even watch rip my 110 😭
[2024-01-02T21:19:01] haku: i hope your okay buddy
[2024-01-02T21:21:04] Mirono escooters: 😢
[2024-01-02T21:21:32] Unknown: Was a very good road usually
[2024-01-02T21:21:57] haku: run with traffic guys i dont trust the bike lanes
[2024-01-02T21:23:31] Unknown: For now but the pain in the neck bacuse helmet is annoying
[2024-01-02T21:23:48] haku: what potting brand is best @jamessoderstrom
[2024-01-02T21:24:30] Unknown: I was with traffic he pulled out didn't look or anything Im pretty visible
[2024-01-02T21:24:37] haku: the 80/200 doesent even come with silicone seals
[2024-01-02T21:25:27] Mirono escooters: This one from alieexpress is great:
[2024-01-02T21:25:53] Mirono escooters: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_m0cS0aE
[2024-01-02T21:25:58] Mirono escooters: Shame :(
[2024-01-02T21:26:07] Mirono escooters: Good you had gear
[2024-01-02T21:26:30] haku: im always a defensive driver. i dont trust any car.
[2024-01-02T21:26:53] Mirono escooters: Haha, most are morons
[2024-01-02T21:26:59] Tommy ª: cars dont look also scooter users are supposedly unconscious by the law (bruh)
[2024-01-02T21:27:04] Mirono escooters: RGB scooters seem to be good for one thing then, visibility
[2024-01-02T21:27:30] haku: would it still be possible to repair?
[2024-01-02T21:27:51] haku: can you still pick it?
[2024-01-02T21:28:26] Tommy ª: man i have a 12 led bar in my razor, white scooter, big ass led at rear, fluor helmet and most of drivers still with the "i cant see you"
[2024-01-02T21:28:43] Mirono escooters: The soft yes Hard no
[2024-01-02T21:29:43] Finn: The soft is like ninebot battery
[2024-01-02T21:29:56] haku: also think about it from a car perspective. most drivers underestimate how fast scooters go.
[2024-01-02T21:30:15] Unknown: Yes the ones who don't listen to honking or look for slim and fast objects running down the road
[2024-01-02T21:30:51] Unknown: Yes also for motorcycles but the case here it's not that
[2024-01-02T21:32:00] Mirono escooters: Feel safe in their hump of metal
[2024-01-02T21:32:00] Unknown: Waiting for leg scan results can move fingis maybe not a break
[2024-01-02T21:32:05] Mirono escooters: Hope so
[2024-01-02T21:32:10] Tommy ª: with me is a bit reversed they thinks that im going to go at 15kmh and always honks at me *pushes to 70kmh and dissapears*
[2024-01-02T21:32:44] Mirono escooters: I used hard, simply because it's the only in bigger quantities 😜 And, because I'm never ever ever repairing this battery (with or without epoxy, impossible)
[2024-01-02T21:33:15] Unknown: If I didn't had a helmet I was now fourhaedless
[2024-01-02T21:34:18] Mirono escooters: Good u had
[2024-01-02T21:36:57] haku: do you pot your batteries?
[2024-01-02T21:37:48] Mirono escooters: Only when customer wants it
[2024-01-02T21:38:10] Mirono escooters: Or when I have a special reason (No wrap, 0.4mm plastic isolating 1.8kwh. good enough argument for safety😜😜)
[2024-01-02T21:38:33] Mirono escooters: It helps with Cooling, bonus But its more for safety, becomes a permanent brick (in this scenario)
[2024-01-02T21:46:47] haku: im thinking of doing this just to cool batteries in the summer
[2024-01-02T21:47:23] haku: do you make a custom enclosure?
[2024-01-02T21:47:50] Mirono escooters: If you are pushing cells, yes
[2024-01-02T21:47:55] Happy Giraffe: Put it to archive
[2024-01-02T21:47:56] Mirono escooters: Yes, because epoxy goes everywhere
[2024-01-02T21:48:18] Mirono escooters: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_m0cS0aE
[2024-01-02T21:48:38] haku: will it be difficult to replace bad cells 😭
[2024-01-02T21:52:40] Mirono escooters: Kinda. I just go with the Mindset "good cells don't fail" and if they do, its after x years
[2024-01-02T21:53:12] Finn: Not lishen cells
[2024-01-02T21:53:16] Finn: They will last forever
[2024-01-02T21:53:19] Finn: Trust me💀
[2024-01-02T21:54:32] haku: it barely rains here honestly and if it does i dont ride in it. it gets dusty though
[2024-01-02T21:55:43] haku: i just want potting for the cooling effect like you said
[2024-01-02T22:03:29] haku: in the summer it can get to 48c and the roads hotter
[2024-01-02T22:21:51] Mirono escooters: Yep! Just more € and work and weight But those 3 things are nothing for builders, 30€ for a 600€ pack? Weight? 500g extra. Time, ez
[2024-01-02T23:21:58] Unknown: Update no break but pain in feet (left) going to charge him money for the scooter damage well how we say it is caprat ahconot hahah
[2024-01-02T23:23:56] Unknown: Bo and the neck and I think it'll going to be more painful tomorrow morning 😞
[2024-01-02T23:25:15] haku: in the US getting hit is a huge payday lmao
[2024-01-02T23:25:33] haku: hope your okay bud
[2024-01-02T23:25:56] Finn: Bro is getting an upgrade
[2024-01-02T23:26:25] haku: you will be riding a weped soon bud
[2024-01-02T23:27:50] haku: in the US you hit a pedestrian or your in the wrong. they can sue for emotional damage. haha
[2024-01-02T23:28:38] Gabe Enzo: Can sue for emotional damage but can blow someone's head off with a shotgun
[2024-01-02T23:28:40] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-01-02T23:30:04] haku: its so petty sometimes. but freedom baby
[2024-01-02T23:33:13] Happy Giraffe: Arduino controller battery heating system😁
[2024-01-02T23:34:30] Mirono escooters: @PaoloWu Sorry for disturbing, but I know you use these meters. Option a: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mMyOTzI Option B: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mPBJ1Eo Wich and why?
[2024-01-02T23:38:48] Happy Giraffe: Now as we have some winter weather I asked the guys how the systems have worked, lets see...
[2024-01-02T23:40:24] haku: how cold does it get on these nordic countries?
[2024-01-02T23:40:34] Mirono escooters: 75100 box from makerbase back at 52€ 😃
[2024-01-02T23:40:57] Tommy ª: Now do the shunt mod before you burn something after update
[2024-01-02T23:41:58] haku: thats the same as the flipsky box yea?
[2024-01-02T23:42:18] sombre_enfant: Yes, but take alu
[2024-01-02T23:42:33] Mirono escooters: I've never burned anything..
[2024-01-02T23:42:50] Mirono escooters: Idk aluminum price, just passed by Box is cool to mod without box, mount vertical
[2024-01-02T23:43:30] Tommy ª: The box model has the design flaw in the shunts, only works normal in shipped firmware
[2024-01-02T23:43:39] Mirono escooters: Non, just flash correct fw lol
[2024-01-02T23:44:14] Tommy ª: In my 3 controllers don't worked, just fails like using wrong fw
[2024-01-02T23:44:54] Mirono escooters: Maybe latest model, idk
[2024-01-02T23:45:01] Mirono escooters: The many i bought 11/11 all ok
[2024-01-02T23:46:01] Tommy ª: Hmm i think old models works normal The last ones failed like sh***
[2024-01-02T23:46:23] Happy Giraffe: -25 to -30°c usually coldest days in southern finland
[2024-01-02T23:48:03] Yamal: Cold for ride, I like the good weather and summer ………
[2024-01-02T23:49:04] haku: i would love to bring my dog in those conditions. i think he was originally bred for sledding
[2024-01-02T23:50:21] Mirono escooters: Noo then I'm sweating my ass off 😂
[2024-01-02T23:51:28] Tommy ª: Casually I have cold sweat Sweating at -3 is weird 💀💀
[2024-01-02T23:52:45] Happy Giraffe: Lets continue weather on off-topic tho. My opener was just to talk about battery heating systems😂
[2024-01-03T00:03:25] Gabe Enzo: Ya methinks of minibike too
[2024-01-03T00:17:09] Paolo ⁭: I only use 1035+, other idk
[2024-01-03T00:19:53] Mirono escooters: Then it must be good
[2024-01-03T00:24:27] haku: i cant see the link to option b 😭
[2024-01-03T00:34:43] Tommy ª: i got 3 of them failed and a friend 2 them failed and a friend of a friend got 5 of them failed, all the mks box version every of them needed to made the shunt mod and use the 0005ohm firmware to make it work
[2024-01-03T00:36:18] Mirono escooters: So weird. So you remove 2 of 3 shunts?
[2024-01-03T00:36:21] Tommy ª: i remember when some comments in the page says about the shunt design flaw, but they deleted all reviews
[2024-01-03T00:36:39] Mirono escooters: I mean, shouldnt be too hard for them
[2024-01-03T00:37:43] Tommy ª: you have 3 resistors sandwiched in every "shunt" they tried to archive 3 resistor advantajes just.. using 3 resistors in parallel per phase in sandwich way you need to remove 2 of them in every phase and it works nice also ITS HARD, i needed to use my hot air station at 500 and iron at 500 for actually remove it
[2024-01-03T00:37:56] Tommy ª: <photos/photo_11898@03-01-2024_00-37-56.jpg>
[2024-01-03T00:41:26] Tommy ª: is the sandwich™
[2024-01-03T00:42:50] Tommy ª: also there is 2 revisions of the 75100, the v1 and v2 i think most of v2, even the flipsky comes with this fault i have 2 mks v2 and 1 flipsky v2, all of them with the same fault
[2024-01-03T00:45:53] Mirono escooters: No one knows why too, since wasn't needed
[2024-01-03T00:46:51] Tommy ª: they took 3 resistors in literal way
[2024-01-03T01:34:31] Happy Giraffe: Hahahhahaah
[2024-01-03T01:36:21] sombre_enfant: Mph

[2024-01-03T01:42:38] Happy Giraffe: My xiaomi would have smoked it with fw
[2024-01-03T01:43:11] Happy Giraffe: They propably have 15A bms
[2024-01-03T01:43:31] sombre_enfant: Wich controller tho ?

[2024-01-03T01:55:23] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: slow.
[2024-01-03T01:55:43] haku: funny that guy has been doing scooters for a while now and he thinks his is worlds first. 😂
[2024-01-03T01:56:21] Happy Giraffe: Scooter noobs still get amazed by 32kmh unlocked xiaomis and ninebots
[2024-01-03T02:13:12] haku: my fellow countrymen need to be humbled sometimes. its so embarassing
[2024-01-03T02:14:24] haku: and i thought his channel was credible. 😭
[2024-01-03T02:25:15] NetworkDir: 120km/h on 20s (130A)
[2024-01-03T02:25:16] NetworkDir: lol

[2024-01-03T02:26:15] haku: i talked to the owner. he got it for 600
[2024-01-03T08:23:31] Finn: I have to say that my g30 also only reaches 67kmh witg fieldweaking
[2024-01-03T08:23:54] Finn: The problem is not that it stopps to accelerate, it starts to wobble😁
[2024-01-03T08:26:57] Finn: Yes and more body weight
[2024-01-03T08:34:17] Unknown: The damage

[2024-01-03T09:00:43] Izuna 生活: Going to Lyon tomorrow if there is no rain. 😁
[2024-01-03T09:02:30] Izuna 生活: I would go today, but I have a ticket to go on Eifel Tower at 15:30. The weather seems better in Lyon than in Paris right now.
[2024-01-03T09:07:43] Izuna 生活: I have seen quite a range of scooters so far from worst ass, 2cm width motor to big ass dualtron-like scooters.
[2024-01-03T09:18:20] Izuna 生活: Lmao rly?
[2024-01-03T09:18:27] Izuna 生活: Fucking shit tube
[2024-01-03T09:19:50] Izuna 生活: Honestly at my hotel the streets are so bad, there is no way to drive anything else than a full suspension scooter 😂 I felt like dropping off the cliff at some potholes.
[2024-01-03T10:09:34] Izuna 生活: I usually have, but this time I had to use the tubes that I had shipped with tires.
[2024-01-03T10:10:53] Face de Pin Sucé: Amazing, keep me updated
[2024-01-03T10:47:23] Izuna 生活: Booked my seat

[2024-01-03T11:28:19] Izuna 生活: Seat. I can take TGV for free otherwise
[2024-01-03T11:28:40] Izuna 生活: Otherwise it would be 100€+ too.
[2024-01-03T11:29:35] Andrew Edwards: No that’s my kaabo wwkgt motor that fucked out on me and now a nother has done the same thing
[2024-01-03T11:29:54] Yamal: Nice motor
[2024-01-03T11:30:02] Yamal: 60h 22/3?
[2024-01-03T11:30:53] Yamal: One friend have this motor in his Nami

[2024-01-03T11:54:31] Gabe Enzo: Dead cells
[2024-01-03T12:06:00] haku: its either you restore this motor or get a new one. this motor really rusted likw crazy though
[2024-01-03T12:12:09] haku: there are restoration videos on youtube. but if ill just get a new one and avoid the hassle of troubleshooting it
[2024-01-03T12:13:34] haku: i think @punedir had this same motor too and he got his clean
[2024-01-03T12:40:46] Mirono escooters: Isn't that a normal train?
[2024-01-03T12:55:55] Gabe Enzo: I can clean that
[2024-01-03T12:56:27] Gabe Enzo: looks sexy
[2024-01-03T12:56:30] Gabe Enzo: 👀
[2024-01-03T13:01:58] Mirono escooters: Yeah fixable
[2024-01-03T13:29:57] puneDir: Yes its cleanable

[2024-01-03T13:31:25] puneDir: But kaabo motor sucks at water resistance
[2024-01-03T13:44:58] Happy Giraffe: All you had to do was to put tiny bit of silicone around the side seam that opens up😅
[2024-01-03T13:45:29] Happy Giraffe: Bearings etc should make quite a good seal if some lithium grease used there
[2024-01-03T13:46:22] Gabe Enzo: Skill issue!
[2024-01-03T13:46:33] Gabe Enzo: RTV silicone
[2024-01-03T13:57:21] puneDir: No
[2024-01-03T13:57:38] puneDir: I bought this motor for cheap cuz water damage
[2024-01-03T14:01:37] puneDir: So that why elshan getting shit power?
[2024-01-03T14:13:33] eriickk_05: does anyone know how I can limit and delimit the maximum truth of the kelly KLS7212S controller? In other generic drivers it is possible to use a relay, in kelly it is also possible?
[2024-01-03T14:21:37] Unknown: You’re gonna strip the screws with that Allen key. Get proper tools if you’re going to do your own work. You definitely need a long T handle
[2024-01-03T14:22:37] Happy Giraffe: Finnish guy on forest with Talaria, I wish I had the 4kw BBSHD build already to do the same...
[2024-01-03T14:22:54] Izuna 生活: No, this Allen key is fine. I'm not at home, therefore relying on what I got.
[2024-01-03T14:23:46] Unknown: Ok that makes sense. You definitely have to improvise ❤️
[2024-01-03T14:24:52] Happy Giraffe: Yeah and something like a lighter will heat up the threadlock if stuck
[2024-01-03T14:28:19] Happy Giraffe: Usually those m5 type bolts shouldnt be even tightened as much as people usually do them. Will wear the threads on alu etc really fast
[2024-01-03T14:37:19] haku: that looks fun haha
[2024-01-03T16:21:29] Happy Giraffe: Making TIG practice tool that has a slot for a pen🌚
[2024-01-03T16:22:34] Happy Giraffe: Damn hard to design it in a modular way for easy printing and adjustable cone and "tungsten" lenght
[2024-01-03T16:26:46] Mirono escooters: This is a vesc group.
[2024-01-03T16:32:31] Happy Giraffe: Vesc, Anti-Kelly group
[2024-01-03T16:56:13] eriickk_05: 😂😂😂
[2024-01-03T17:12:00] puneDir: Build the whole shit Go cheap on 1 cent resistors Nice

[2024-01-03T17:47:37] Tommy ª: casually yes, i remember struggling when i needed more than 30amp by the vesc now i push 120-130 without problem
[2024-01-03T18:07:26] Jhinzuo ~~: So that's why they say only their 5.2 fw works. Fix was desoldering 2 of the 3 shunts and use r005 fw right?
[2024-01-03T18:20:19] Tommy ª: Yep, 2 in every phase If you can tell me how it works after that :3 Also take a cap of your detection before and after, it changes a lot
[2024-01-03T18:27:15] haku: wow that 20s fit in there? good job
[2024-01-03T18:29:41] Cengiz Han GENÇALİ: Fits easily but this battery is 48v 26ah
[2024-01-03T18:29:51] haku: spacer looks like it came with the vsett. very cool
[2024-01-03T18:30:36] Jhinzuo ~~: Will do thanks :)
[2024-01-03T18:32:17] haku: the only thing thats keeping me from doing this mod is the 8.5 wheels. it gets sketchy at high speeds.
[2024-01-03T18:32:59] haku: maybe i can claim worlds first 20s vsett 9 @jamessoderstrom 😂
[2024-01-03T18:33:11] Cengiz Han GENÇALİ: I think it will go very well, even with 48v it goes well.
[2024-01-03T18:33:39] haku: good job bro. you have good cad skills
[2024-01-03T18:36:18] haku: wow you designed this?
[2024-01-03T18:48:37] Happy Giraffe: Only the drawn model below the mesh
[2024-01-03T18:49:14] Happy Giraffe: It wont be as beautiful because it needs to house a big pencil inside with threads etc
[2024-01-03T19:03:49] Happy Giraffe: Wrong message😂
[2024-01-03T19:15:14] haku: @Happy_Giraffe do you use a 3d scanning camera? btw what is a good affordable one?
[2024-01-03T19:16:50] Finn: Iphone is the answer
[2024-01-03T19:29:28] Mirono escooters: Creality had a cool one
[2024-01-03T19:30:48] haku: i saw that. it was on sale last black friday for $200 i think.
[2024-01-03T19:34:44] haku: any iphone with lidar would do right? what app do you use?
[2024-01-03T19:35:45] haku: nah i meant this for chengiz. the spacer for the vsett 9 is cool. vsett has a odd shaped deck
[2024-01-03T19:37:07] Happy Giraffe: Aah haha, which message was that?
[2024-01-03T19:37:25] Happy Giraffe: Caliper and my eye😂
[2024-01-03T19:37:56] Happy Giraffe: I like to draw my designs as a newbie. Dont want to deal with that scanning mess

[2024-01-03T19:41:35] Happy Giraffe: That looks clean👍 Very stealthy
[2024-01-03T19:42:41] haku: i want to scan my head. for medical reasons ofcourse 😂
[2024-01-03T19:46:32] Happy Giraffe: Lol, print a facemask for face ID if too drunk to have a normal face

[2024-01-03T20:14:54] Cengiz Han GENÇALİ: If I had vsett 9+ I would do it
[2024-01-03T20:15:05] Happy Giraffe: Its not complicated but finding features is annoying and the troubleshooting why something is not behaving like you want. Also Fusion just seems to slow down sometimes as its a cloud based crap afterall

[2024-01-04T07:03:22] haku: i orinally want p42a. but 40t was on sale for 3.85 on black friday. they say it has similar performance
[2024-01-04T07:05:12] Tommy ª: i have these, also after 2 years they lost like half of capacity 💀
[2024-01-04T07:05:48] haku: battery hookup sold out of the $2.00 M0lt too 😭
[2024-01-04T07:06:21] haku: 40ts? does it really?
[2024-01-04T07:07:30] Tommy ª: im running at 2p 60a and they literally gets these 60amp without problem very rock cells, i like it

[2024-01-04T11:26:56] Izuna 生活: On my way to the train Station in Paris now. Hopefully the TGV is not too full. Also need to buy some food again 😅
[2024-01-04T11:28:15] Izuna 生活: And hopefully one charge of 2,7kWh is going to be enough
[2024-01-04T11:28:35] Izuna 生活: cuz charger too big to carry around like that
[2024-01-04T11:28:42] Izuna 生活: need a smaller one for travel purposes
[2024-01-04T11:29:15] Izuna 生活: Fan in Hotel room was like VROOOOOOM, I was already waiting for someone to knock on my door and wsk wtf I am doin

[2024-01-04T11:30:55] Izuna 生活: 😂
[2024-01-04T11:30:59] puneDir: :D
[2024-01-04T11:31:04] puneDir: Diy slicks
[2024-01-04T11:32:12] Izuna 生活: France roads are killing me btw at least the bike paths and streets outside of Paris are horrible
[2024-01-04T11:33:03] Izuna 生活: Bike path is like this ???
[2024-01-04T11:33:19] Izuna 生活: and all the pot holes 🕳️
[2024-01-04T11:33:32] Izuna 生活: can't speed but eh Lyon probably better
[2024-01-04T11:36:56] haku: thats debatable. depending on mods id say. g30 with 50h just sounds badass
[2024-01-04T11:38:56] Izuna 生活: 60h with 20s9p 😎
[2024-01-04T11:39:24] Izuna 生活: and shit escs 😭

[2024-01-04T11:56:12] haku: yes under the colored plastice there seems to be braided insulation. kinda like the heat resistant one
[2024-01-04T11:57:25] haku: im thinking if i put another layer of sleeving it will be to thick. idk ill try it first
[2024-01-04T12:10:11] haku: yours 60h nice! did you mod the frame to fit?
[2024-01-04T12:23:52] Izuna 生活: No
[2024-01-04T12:24:37] Izuna 生活: Alright 12:52 my train and I am already exhausted because I'm absolutely lost here 😂
[2024-01-04T12:41:20] Yamal: Enjoy the life no? 😁
[2024-01-04T12:41:41] Izuna 生活: It is happening again 💀
[2024-01-04T12:41:49] Izuna 生活: Hopefully it does not fall over

[2024-01-04T12:44:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: What happen?
[2024-01-04T12:45:45] Izuna 生活: Scooter in the hall
[2024-01-04T12:45:54] Izuna 生活: Everything was already filled with bags
[2024-01-04T12:45:59] Izuna 生活: and I'm early early

[2024-01-04T12:47:09] Izuna 生活: 2h ride and nothing to do
[2024-01-04T12:47:28] Izuna 生活: no hacker time on the train
[2024-01-04T13:33:28] Jan: Get proper esc's then ^^
[2024-01-04T13:33:55] Jan: Jrev Speedfork front 😬
[2024-01-04T13:34:50] Mirono escooters: Clash of clans
[2024-01-04T13:38:35] Izuna 生活: after winter
[2024-01-04T13:41:58] Mirono escooters: Sponsor me 😢
[2024-01-04T13:45:05] Jan: ^^
[2024-01-04T14:04:48] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11937@04-01-2024_14-04-48.jpg>
[2024-01-04T14:13:54] Happy Giraffe: Tell us, did you get a real Baguétté?
[2024-01-04T14:30:55] Izuna 生活: idk I ate many different baguette 😂 from the bakery made like a sandwich, from the supermarket etc
[2024-01-04T14:31:10] Izuna 生活: Almost there
[2024-01-04T14:34:59] Happy Giraffe: Show us Lyons biggest and baddest Baguette
[2024-01-04T14:59:43] Izuna 生活: <photos/photo_11939@04-01-2024_14-59-43.jpg>
[2024-01-04T15:00:12] Happy Giraffe: Scooter is best in trains and buses, really handy👍
[2024-01-04T15:00:52] Paolo ⁭: Definitely not hahah
[2024-01-04T15:01:07] Paolo ⁭: Big scooter never fit
[2024-01-04T15:01:17] Paolo ⁭: That's why mono wheel best for travel
[2024-01-04T15:01:52] Gabe Enzo: Best to have mono wheel and scooter and emoto.
[2024-01-04T15:01:54] Izuna 生活: No no no
[2024-01-04T15:01:54] Izuna 生活: Heavy
[2024-01-04T15:01:54] Izuna 生活: Not handy
[2024-01-04T15:01:54] Izuna 生活: 😂
[2024-01-04T15:01:54] Izuna 生活: This time was fine, found good spot to store
[2024-01-04T15:01:55] Izuna 生活: But sometimes I block the path of anyone. But so far no one got mad
[2024-01-04T15:02:45] Mirono escooters: Big scooter is useless
[2024-01-04T15:02:52] Mirono escooters: Totally fucks the point of scooters imo :)
[2024-01-04T15:03:55] Paolo ⁭: Big scooter I mean normal scooter like Nami, Wolf vsett and similar
[2024-01-04T15:04:23] Mirono escooters: Wrong chat? Xd
[2024-01-04T15:06:19] Mirono escooters: Anyway uh NAMI and such users don't ususally transport them with train and such. Ride them I find those big scooters useless. Point of escooter is small and compact, lightweight. If you want something powerful and heavy, bike is better in every way 🤷
[2024-01-04T15:10:57] Izuna 生活: @SibClimb If you tell me where, I will pay you a visit 👍 For now I will find a bakery
[2024-01-04T15:15:51] Mirono escooters: Baguette
[2024-01-04T15:17:15] Happy Giraffe: Try a bike then😂
[2024-01-04T15:17:38] Happy Giraffe: 30kg xiaomi flew like a feather in ans out of train
[2024-01-04T15:17:42] Gabe Enzo: Scooters are the best
[2024-01-04T15:17:49] Gabe Enzo: Pro 2 small enough to fold onto the bus
[2024-01-04T15:18:06] Gabe Enzo: Could be a bit smaller. maybe molicel m365 someday.
[2024-01-04T15:18:19] Gabe Enzo: For my brother
[2024-01-04T15:18:48] Happy Giraffe: I would take a big folding scooter anyway. DIY support for folded steering tube and put bag there and sit😂
[2024-01-04T15:19:02] Happy Giraffe: Friend just bought G30 used today
[2024-01-04T15:22:19] Happy Giraffe: My fabrication fetish wants to make a steel scooter frame but never really could ride one with our police. 4kw Bafang BBSHD bike is legal even at 72v as it looks ok Steel scooter frame and QS90 motors in swingarms🤔
[2024-01-04T15:26:05] Izuna 生活: Pain au chocolate, that's all I eat
[2024-01-04T15:28:40] Happy Giraffe: Put ketchup in a baguette at a fine hotel breakfast to see if you are kicked out
[2024-01-04T15:30:28] Izuna 生活: So many Xiaomis that look like from the scrape yard
[2024-01-04T15:31:15] puneDir: Im getting the upper one
[2024-01-04T15:31:38] Mirono escooters: We know
[2024-01-04T15:32:36] puneDir: (i hava wate but still not opened the box)
[2024-01-04T15:32:53] Gabe Enzo: Need
[2024-01-04T15:34:46] Mirono escooters: If it drives it's ok for the French
[2024-01-04T15:34:54] Mirono escooters: Top gear once made mockery about it, was funny
[2024-01-04T15:50:32] Izuna 生活: and they don't have any road rules
[2024-01-04T15:50:48] Izuna 生活: I kept following other escooter and bikes because they always ran red lights
[2024-01-04T15:50:56] Izuna 生活: And I was like, am I supposed to stop???
[2024-01-04T15:52:00] Mirono escooters: The French
[2024-01-04T16:35:27] Izuna 生活: <video_file>
[2024-01-04T16:42:03] Gabe Enzo: guys when I put the tube in I cant close this motor or it'll puncture the tube wtf
[2024-01-04T16:42:11] Gabe Enzo: isn't split rim supposed to be easy??
[2024-01-04T16:42:26] Gabe Enzo: might just change this the Xiaomi way
[2024-01-04T16:48:06] sombre_enfant: Dont inflate or like 0.3 bar then close dont tighten hard af then inflate it
[2024-01-04T16:48:19] NetworkDir: Lmfao I asked 10 times and said that this is a shunt problem They all said no, the way he wrote and everything he wrote is correct. And they told me "Skill isuse" for the problem😂
[2024-01-04T16:48:47] Tommy ª: i need to figure it myself bc im getting same comments
[2024-01-04T16:48:53] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-04T16:49:01] sombre_enfant: Skill issue
[2024-01-04T16:49:46] puneDir: Saying skill issue is everything turns this group to a toxic place
[2024-01-04T16:53:53] Gabe Enzo: +1.
[2024-01-04T16:55:51] Gabe Enzo: Little lube should help too 💦
[2024-01-04T16:56:32] Tommy ª: use the feet while you are putting it
[2024-01-04T16:56:45] Gabe Enzo: ?
[2024-01-04T16:56:47] Gabe Enzo: Feet?
[2024-01-04T16:57:42] S1m 0n: You only need to press it firmly together once and it will be easier after that
[2024-01-04T16:58:04] Mirono escooters: Put lil bit air in
[2024-01-04T16:58:24] Mirono escooters: But funny
[2024-01-04T17:00:52] Gabe Enzo: In using 10x2.5 could be the issue it's a 10x2 tyre
[2024-01-04T17:00:53] Gabe Enzo: eh
[2024-01-04T17:01:06] Gabe Enzo: as always I buy the wrong shit and waste money
[2024-01-04T17:01:31] Gabe Enzo: Tbh not comparable to the money I wasted when a weed addict Imagine what scooter I could've made with the money.
[2024-01-04T17:05:38] haku: big scooter for big people. freedom size baby 😝
[2024-01-04T17:06:32] Tommy ª: here in spain they put limits in dimensions on legal scooters 🤑
[2024-01-04T17:08:02] haku: i am a noob. wouldnt the bottom one is better? more components?
[2024-01-04T17:09:21] Izuna 生活: <photos/photo_11942@04-01-2024_17-09-21.jpg>
[2024-01-04T17:10:18] Izuna 生活: downhill was nice, perfect time for brake failure and death
[2024-01-04T17:10:48] Izuna 生活: no power and accelerated without stop 😂 had to brake at 50km/h
[2024-01-04T17:11:29] Tommy ª: casually my vesc under field weakening in downhill, touch the brake is a death sentence 💀
[2024-01-04T17:12:24] Izuna 生活: Now I'm a little lost on where to go 😬
[2024-01-04T17:12:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: https://youtu.be/zlRomsGw3tw?si=gyxSlt0kpDm5w7fp
[2024-01-04T17:12:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: New esc from flipky

[2024-01-04T17:13:37] Mirono escooters: Try Taking it on a train..
[2024-01-04T17:14:12] Mirono escooters: What
[2024-01-04T17:14:34] Izuna 生活: What? MP2
[2024-01-04T17:14:40] Izuna 生活: What
[2024-01-04T17:14:53] Izuna 生活: I said, I without pushing the throttle
[2024-01-04T17:14:59] Mirono escooters: Wtf is their proprietary firmware
[2024-01-04T17:14:59] Jan: For next summer too?
[2024-01-04T17:15:20] Mirono escooters: Coat MP2 with the liquid silicon, perfect waterproof then
[2024-01-04T17:15:24] Izuna 生活: Idk probably, if I get genius enough I make my own based on MP2
[2024-01-04T17:15:26] haku: no public trains in my city. but we do have alot of pickup truck beds.

[2024-01-04T17:17:30] haku: not vesc? looks like a vesc
[2024-01-04T17:18:08] Tommy ª: It cancels field weakening in some way that locks the wheel at max speed voltaje For example without fw you go at 50kmh, with fw you go at 65 If you brake it locks the wheel at 50kmh
[2024-01-04T17:18:20] Yamal: Ragemechanic work in kitchen..? Naahhh😁 I don’t know…
[2024-01-04T17:19:15] Tommy ª: Ban the bot
[2024-01-04T17:21:29] Tommy ª: I always happened on my old razor (chain with inrunner) Also with the Xiaomi makes something similar but you need to go like 70kmh and it start to cogs if you release the thorttle
[2024-01-04T17:22:26] Izuna 生活: I was already there idk
[2024-01-04T17:22:30] Izuna 生活: It's just a door to apartment
[2024-01-04T17:22:45] Tommy ª: 75100
[2024-01-04T17:23:10] Yamal: Your top speed on g30?
[2024-01-04T17:23:35] Tommy ª: I need someone with a inrunner at 10krpm for test Looks like with outrunners like wheel based this is not usual
[2024-01-04T17:24:35] Izuna 生活: 103km/h but it can do more

[2024-01-04T19:48:12] Izuna 生活: I can't tell how much I have driven but not having to worry is so nice
[2024-01-04T19:52:51] Gabe Enzo: Yeah Ikr, that's why I'm going with a giant cell too.
[2024-01-04T19:52:56] Gabe Enzo: range anxiety is horrible.
[2024-01-04T19:53:06] Izuna 生活: Yes absolutely
[2024-01-04T19:53:33] Gabe Enzo: Worth every single penny.
[2024-01-04T20:03:16] Izuna 生活: <video_file>
[2024-01-04T20:03:17] Izuna 生活: Back to Paris (and tomorrow back home) 😢
[2024-01-04T20:03:52] Paolo ⁭: They pay you everything or only France Germany train ticket?
[2024-01-04T20:03:55] Izuna 生活: This time I was able to fit my scooter inside the cargo space, neat
[2024-01-04T20:04:04] Izuna 生活: Everything
[2024-01-04T20:04:12] Paolo ⁭: Also Paris Lyon?
[2024-01-04T20:04:22] Izuna 生活: Yes Paris Lyon
[2024-01-04T20:04:36] Izuna 生活: The only thing I pay here is bus and substation
[2024-01-04T20:05:17] Izuna 生活: All high speed trains for free for me :)
[2024-01-04T20:05:43] Izuna 生活: When I am back in Germany, I will continue to use it to travel inside Germany I think on the weekend.
[2024-01-04T20:05:51] Izuna 生活: Meet some people or smth
[2024-01-04T20:06:00] Paolo ⁭: That's so cool
[2024-01-04T20:06:14] Paolo ⁭: How much time Germany to France in train?
[2024-01-04T20:07:55] Izuna 生活: 8h~
[2024-01-04T20:08:45] Mirono escooters: Pretty ok
[2024-01-04T20:08:52] Mirono escooters: I'd do SolidWorks or steamdeck
[2024-01-04T20:09:45] Paolo ⁭: Very fast, in china to travel from shenzhen to Shanghai I need about 10h
[2024-01-04T20:12:34] haku: wish we had trains here. i hear rumors of a tesla train or tunnel that will be built from vegas to LA.
[2024-01-04T20:13:08] haku: thats usually a 4hr drive
[2024-01-04T20:13:14] Paolo ⁭: Maybe Hyperloop , who know hahah
[2024-01-04T20:13:37] haku: maybe. hyperpoop for now. all rumors
[2024-01-04T20:15:46] Izuna 生活: From Paris to Lyon it takes about 2h
[2024-01-04T20:15:58] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2024-01-04T20:16:22] haku: drive or train?
[2024-01-04T20:16:58] sombre_enfant: Train car is 4/5 hours
[2024-01-04T20:17:28] Izuna 生活: High speed Train
[2024-01-04T20:17:49] Face de Pin Sucé: TGV
[2024-01-04T20:17:53] Izuna 生活: well not high speed atm😂
[2024-01-04T20:35:28] Happy Giraffe: Specs?
[2024-01-04T20:36:18] Happy Giraffe: Gave up on Fusion?😂
[2024-01-04T20:36:24] Izuna 生活: 72V 37,8Ah
[2024-01-04T20:36:31] Happy Giraffe: Damn, nice
[2024-01-04T20:36:59] haku: wow!
[2024-01-04T20:37:45] Happy Giraffe: I wait a bit for my new batt, want to see EVE 21700 40PL in action and Moooch tests. Meanwhile buying tanky DH bike frame and Bafang BBSHd for it😁 End of hub drives is over for me
[2024-01-04T20:38:20] haku: when is that new eve coming out?
[2024-01-04T20:38:43] Mirono escooters: What? I never used fusion. School gives me SolidWorks lessons+ license. It's better anyway : D
[2024-01-04T20:39:12] Mirono escooters: I need to draw my powerwall and some batteries out asap. I have a cool quick connect idea in my head, to parallel more packs when I make them.
[2024-01-04T20:39:26] Happy Giraffe: Damn, I wish I had solidworks/fusion lessons
[2024-01-04T20:39:35] Happy Giraffe: I need to learn it the hard way
[2024-01-04T20:39:43] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2024-01-04T20:40:03] Mirono escooters: It's pretty awesome. When you think you know all the tricks, you don't. Something new and awesome to make it easier pops up😂
[2024-01-04T20:40:35] Happy Giraffe: Atleast I have still free steel and alu on smaller projects😅
[2024-01-04T20:41:10] Mirono escooters: I wanna integrate 7 banana plugs (it's a 7s powerwall) in the sides of my holders. I just assemble my first 300 cell pack, wire each series group to the bullet, and when i make another, its just a matter of Clicking together. I hope it works out. 😬
[2024-01-04T20:41:17] Happy Giraffe: Fun thing is, school has a 3D printing course but none of teachers can even print lmao. They ask me why tool stands crack etc😂
[2024-01-04T20:41:20] haku: but fusion is industry standard yeah? kinda like premiere pro for video?
[2024-01-04T20:41:28] Happy Giraffe: Both are
[2024-01-04T20:41:32] Mirono escooters: No
[2024-01-04T20:41:44] Happy Giraffe: Well, Inventor
[2024-01-04T20:41:49] Mirono escooters: SolidWorks and autocad. Mostly SolidWorks If you really advance in 3D drawing/engineering. It's SolidWorks.
[2024-01-04T20:42:09] Mirono escooters: The advanced simulations are out of this world, it's just, better 200k per year for the top license.😬
[2024-01-04T20:42:39] Happy Giraffe: Lol, Fusion good for hobby but slows down when you have 4 components at same screen😂
[2024-01-04T20:42:44] haku: good lawd
[2024-01-04T20:42:52] Happy Giraffe: I want to use power of my pc and not some shity server
[2024-01-04T20:43:18] Mirono escooters: Well, I'm talking real engineering job, what I should end up with
[2024-01-04T20:43:21] haku: what cad software uses pc power?
[2024-01-04T20:43:23] Mirono escooters: But why not use for hobby too :)
[2024-01-04T20:43:30] Mirono escooters: SolidWorks
[2024-01-04T20:43:47] Mirono escooters: I don't understand why fusion does it Tinkercad ok 😂
[2024-01-04T20:44:26] Finn: Hm these motors seems good for the original ximi and ninebot controller...
[2024-01-04T20:44:35] haku: they use both gpu and cpu?
[2024-01-04T20:45:04] Mirono escooters: Goh, no, really bad brand, using recycled magnets and shitty hall sensors, I'd avoid
[2024-01-04T20:45:36] Mirono escooters: Who tested that motor again. I forgot. Wasn't it Francois
[2024-01-04T20:45:53] Happy Giraffe: Mechanical engineering?
[2024-01-04T20:46:16] Gabe Enzo: Electrical
[2024-01-04T20:46:28] Gabe Enzo: Mechelec*
[2024-01-04T20:46:55] Happy Giraffe: It literally needs internet to convert into STL and uses like 1 core of your CPU. My overclocked grandpa wants to use all cores
[2024-01-04T20:47:14] Happy Giraffe: Mechanical engineering underrated
[2024-01-04T20:47:21] Mirono escooters: Is the plan
[2024-01-04T20:47:41] Mirono escooters: Hard af😭
[2024-01-04T20:47:59] Happy Giraffe: I might also do it later, must seek a stable job and then do what heart desires
[2024-01-04T20:47:59] Paolo ⁭: And fake claiming power
[2024-01-04T20:48:37] Mirono escooters: Yep, my reasoning too
[2024-01-04T20:48:42] Mirono escooters: Obviously ;)
[2024-01-04T20:49:05] Paolo ⁭: Is very confusing topic chat hahaha

[2024-01-04T20:49:41] Happy Giraffe: It's so nice to spam here
[2024-01-04T20:49:44] Mirono escooters: It makes the group usable
[2024-01-04T20:50:05] Mirono escooters: Remember the glory days of spam in 1 chat and losing everything?
[2024-01-04T20:50:29] Paolo ⁭: I just see all topic together because I can't check every topic xd
[2024-01-04T20:50:39] Paolo ⁭: Too much time
[2024-01-04T20:50:54] Mirono escooters: That is not telegram fault , you dont use as intended lol
[2024-01-04T20:51:05] Mirono escooters: Quick read through at evening, no problem
[2024-01-04T20:51:11] Mirono escooters: Ignore if no interests
[2024-01-04T20:52:23] haku: off topic discussion is mostly me and my personal struggles in life. so if you want to be my therapist for the night. check it out
[2024-01-04T20:55:25] Paolo ⁭: Yes I'm sorry
[2024-01-04T20:55:40] Paolo ⁭: New "job" takes me a lot of time
[2024-01-04T20:56:14] Paolo ⁭: I'm not active like previously I was :/

[2024-01-04T21:06:32] Paolo ⁭: Idk I don't trade stocks
[2024-01-04T22:04:44] Izuna 生活: <photos/photo_11949@04-01-2024_22-04-44.jpg>

[2024-01-04T22:05:00] Izuna 生活: Casually took the whole bag space for my scoot
[2024-01-04T22:05:59] haku: how much does your 20s scooter weigh?
[2024-01-04T22:21:16] Gabe Enzo: @kawaiinekololis how many cells are In your 3l again?
[2024-01-04T22:22:19] Gabe Enzo: I did the math and the 3L can hold 56 Cells without honeycomb and disregarding the odd shape. (too lazy to find area of a trapezoid) I've been thinking to go over board and do 20s8p.
[2024-01-04T22:23:34] Gabe Enzo: I'll have 1k by February so I can do what I want
[2024-01-04T22:25:09] Happy Giraffe: Pay me 1K to make you a battery box from alu that houses more cells and has a lock🌚
[2024-01-04T22:26:24] Gabe Enzo: Bold of you to assume I'd leave that shit anywhere for a second
[2024-01-04T22:26:32] Gabe Enzo: Kek
[2024-01-04T22:28:20] Happy Giraffe: But for real if you want I could do a box if you 3D print mount, use pipe fitters or something😂
[2024-01-04T22:28:43] Happy Giraffe: 56 cells is a bit tiny😅
[2024-01-04T22:30:24] Izuna 生活: 20s3p
[2024-01-04T22:32:01] haku: how much does your scooter weigh?
[2024-01-04T22:39:08] Yamal: Go fastride!🤣

[2024-01-04T22:56:59] haku: wow you made that?
[2024-01-04T23:00:55] haku: thats pretty clean.
[2024-01-04T23:01:51] Gabe Enzo: Id fuck
[2024-01-04T23:02:30] Gabe Enzo: I'm stealing your style for when I do mine
[2024-01-04T23:02:46] Gabe Enzo: Well, 8p not 6p but you get the stick
[2024-01-04T23:03:09] haku: what are those circle thingys on top of the welds?
[2024-01-04T23:03:46] Gabe Enzo: Make it look sexy I suppose
[2024-01-04T23:05:22] haku: for 3p would nickel be enough?
[2024-01-04T23:06:18] Paolo ⁭: Don't care how much p, depends by current you going to use
[2024-01-04T23:06:57] Gabe Enzo: 135a peak. Ehhhh
[2024-01-04T23:07:03] Gabe Enzo: Maybe double nickel layer
[2024-01-04T23:07:07] Gabe Enzo: Just use copper it's so much easier
[2024-01-04T23:07:19] Gabe Enzo: Everything should be copper Nickel is old school kinda
[2024-01-04T23:08:02] haku: kinda. depends on how muxh current like paolo said.
[2024-01-04T23:09:01] haku: im not a pro but 135a i think you can get away with nickel.
[2024-01-04T23:10:46] haku: very clean though im jelly.
[2024-01-04T23:16:04] Happy Giraffe: My nickel heats up at 8A per cell lol
[2024-01-04T23:16:28] haku: what thickness?
[2024-01-04T23:16:35] Happy Giraffe: No idea
[2024-01-04T23:22:21] Gabe Enzo: There is no reason to not go with copper it's literally the same price.
[2024-01-04T23:22:32] Gabe Enzo: 10€ for a roll of 1m
[2024-01-04T23:22:38] Gabe Enzo: which Is 10cm wide
[2024-01-04T23:22:53] Gabe Enzo: That's enough for 20s10p
[2024-01-04T23:25:13] haku: copper just expensive to weld due to welder. glitter and kweld setup will run $500
[2024-01-04T23:25:34] haku: k weld you need kcaps and power supply
[2024-01-04T23:25:45] Gabe Enzo: Im loaded
[2024-01-04T23:25:51] Gabe Enzo: Ah
[2024-01-04T23:25:52] haku: or a 200 battery
[2024-01-04T23:26:14] Gabe Enzo: I think I'll have luck with a 5p MOS set with 1700a at 12V
[2024-01-04T23:26:19] Gabe Enzo: Hopefully....
[2024-01-04T23:26:52] haku: and cutting copper is harder than nickel. nickel kinda softer
[2024-01-04T23:27:02] sombre_enfant: Def trippin
[2024-01-04T23:27:13] Gabe Enzo: Fuggggg, what do?
[2024-01-04T23:27:24] Gabe Enzo: Glitter welder?
[2024-01-04T23:27:27] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-01-04T23:27:29] Gabe Enzo: Gotta wait another month then
[2024-01-04T23:27:31] Gabe Enzo: Eeeeeeeee
[2024-01-04T23:27:55] sombre_enfant: Sell drug or vape idk
[2024-01-04T23:28:42] haku: no shame in onlyfans
[2024-01-04T23:30:21] haku: i think @Mirono_escooters has malectrics and that can do copper too
[2024-01-04T23:30:56] Mirono escooters: Kweld
[2024-01-04T23:31:38] Gabe Enzo: Thought about it
[2024-01-04T23:33:43] Gabe Enzo: Might
[2024-01-04T23:33:55] Gabe Enzo: <sticker>

[2024-01-04T23:41:28] Tommy ª: i can weld with my 1953 spot welder?
[2024-01-04T23:41:40] Paolo ⁭: Wtf is 1953
[2024-01-04T23:42:22] Tommy ª: a very old one in the workshop, they used them for weld some car parts
[2024-01-04T23:42:25] Gabe Enzo: A spot welder from 1953
[2024-01-04T23:42:26] Gabe Enzo: duh

[2024-01-04T23:43:25] haku: im just helpimg the chinese economy at this point. overspending
[2024-01-04T23:44:33] Tommy ª: the chinesse worker knowing they get nothing: 💀
[2024-01-04T23:45:57] haku: capitalism 😂
[2024-01-04T23:46:40] Izuna 生活: On my way to the hotel because I did not expect that the bus does not drive anymore 😂 now at a McDonald's...

[2024-01-04T23:47:32] Mirono escooters: Doable no?
[2024-01-04T23:47:40] Izuna 生活: Ye absolutely, seems so
[2024-01-04T23:47:51] Izuna 生活: Otherwise I call Taxi to take me

[2024-01-04T23:51:06] Mirono escooters: + VESC % is with margin, a lot
[2024-01-04T23:53:04] haku: extreme capitalism
[2024-01-04T23:54:10] Paolo ⁭: You can do but not directly like glitter does
[2024-01-04T23:54:17] Paolo ⁭: You have to do sandwich with nickel
[2024-01-04T23:55:29] haku: im fine with that. would those welders need alot of finessing and modding?
[2024-01-04T23:56:22] Paolo ⁭: I don't know since I don't use
[2024-01-05T00:02:12] Gabe Enzo: For sandwiching with nickel!
[2024-01-05T00:02:15] Gabe Enzo: nah
[2024-01-05T00:03:26] haku: sandwich nickel isnt bad though. its just unheard of in the PEV scene here in the US about direct copper welds
[2024-01-05T00:06:31] Gabe Enzo: Americans don't know jack shit Dude.
[2024-01-05T00:06:42] Gabe Enzo: they don't even know algebra

[2024-01-05T00:07:05] haku: depends. with ebikes they ive seen some great ones
[2024-01-05T00:07:15] Gabe Enzo: no more than 5kw
[2024-01-05T00:07:17] Gabe Enzo: Ever
[2024-01-05T00:07:25] Happy Giraffe: 🦅 vs. 🇪🇺 again😂
[2024-01-05T00:07:57] Happy Giraffe: They have many builders who even make frames from scratch👍
[2024-01-05T00:08:08] haku: nah dude. there are real moto builds here. and gokarts
[2024-01-05T00:08:27] Gabe Enzo: ah the gokarts are real shi
[2024-01-05T00:08:44] Gabe Enzo: Molicel gokaet 👀👀👀
[2024-01-05T00:08:50] haku: scooter and vesc is very unpopular unfortunately
[2024-01-05T00:08:56] Gabe Enzo: 20s30p
[2024-01-05T00:08:58] Gabe Enzo: Ye

[2024-01-05T00:10:06] Happy Giraffe: Neat lil mid drive that wheelies from throttle at 60kmh
[2024-01-05T00:10:33] Happy Giraffe: DIY frame and QS90
[2024-01-05T00:11:35] haku: https://youtu.be/LG2rh7dUxmE?si=TQsjXtWgCjbJhbhh
[2024-01-05T00:11:49] haku: electric very unpopular
[2024-01-05T00:13:30] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_11961@05-01-2024_00-13-30.jpg>
[2024-01-05T00:13:30] Happy Giraffe: Bike Im gonna buy, built like a tank
[2024-01-05T00:14:15] haku: nice very small triangle though.
[2024-01-05T00:14:36] haku: fox is best
[2024-01-05T00:14:45] Happy Giraffe: Batt will be under frame tube or over. Steel casing👍
[2024-01-05T00:15:12] haku: good idea
[2024-01-05T00:16:06] Happy Giraffe: If frame survives 4kw bbshd motor then gonna slap 10Kw LR motor on it😅
[2024-01-05T00:17:26] Happy Giraffe: https://lightning-rods10.mybigcommerce.com/single-stage-big-block-middrive-rhd/ Your countrymen built the motor and made reductions, mounts and drive
[2024-01-05T00:18:48] Happy Giraffe: Friend has the step bigger motor on his bike and easily does 120kmh😅
[2024-01-05T00:20:53] haku: i think ive seen that motor on a bmx. very cool
[2024-01-05T00:28:08] haku: i think rion was the first that i know of to directly weld copper but they used a different welder
[2024-01-05T00:32:12] Yamal: RION RACE ‼️🙈😂
[2024-01-05T00:33:30] Happy Giraffe: Copper on shit cells gg
[2024-01-05T00:33:32] Happy Giraffe: https://www.3dxtech.com/product/thermax-pps/
[2024-01-05T00:33:41] Paolo ⁭: Nickel weld isn't strong when oxygen is much
[2024-01-05T00:33:55] Happy Giraffe: Almost can print this at home, missing ~15°c on nozzle and 20°c on bed
[2024-01-05T00:33:56] Paolo ⁭: Battery pack well sealed then no prob
[2024-01-05T00:34:25] Paolo ⁭: That's also good brand @Bradhaku
[2024-01-05T00:34:37] Happy Giraffe: $$$
[2024-01-05T00:34:38] Paolo ⁭: U can find it in USA
[2024-01-05T00:35:15] Paolo ⁭: Yeah if you don't need make professional parts a 10$ filament is enough
[2024-01-05T00:35:51] Happy Giraffe: https://www.3dxtech.com/product/max-g-pctg/
[2024-01-05T00:36:19] Happy Giraffe: I like so far the Tinmorry PETG-CF, under 30€/kg and real carbon and not dust shit
[2024-01-05T00:38:48] Paolo ⁭: I don't even use cf materials, since the fiber isn't melted and form a strong fiber , it don't give you real advantage of cf
[2024-01-05T00:39:23] haku: i need to master petg first before messing around with this stuff
[2024-01-05T00:44:16] Gabe Enzo: Master PLA first
[2024-01-05T00:46:49] haku: pla is easy. its auto
[2024-01-05T00:52:24] Happy Giraffe: It's so damn tough still, much stronger than regular PETG😳 Less flex and not brittle. It has chopped fibers that align randomly to create the structural benefit so dont think it needs any more🤔
[2024-01-05T00:52:47] Happy Giraffe: Some CF filaments use powder that are weaker than vanilla filaments
[2024-01-05T00:54:35] Happy Giraffe: Today I used PETG CF on a lathe lmao
[2024-01-05T01:03:20] Mirono escooters: If it's not powder, it really does make it stronger
[2024-01-05T01:03:41] Mirono escooters: This
[2024-01-05T01:04:52] haku: doesnt it have to be chopped carbon?
[2024-01-05T01:08:58] Mirono escooters: Not powder= strings
[2024-01-05T01:09:05] Izuna 生活: Left it outside of the McDonald's, it got cold and I couldn't do the last 3,5km 💀 had to take a bolt ride (Taxi freelance)
[2024-01-05T01:10:56] Izuna 生活: But eh, worth a try.
[2024-01-05T01:11:01] Izuna 生活: Almost did it.
[2024-01-05T01:11:27] Mirono escooters: :(
[2024-01-05T01:11:28] Izuna 生活: And I could have walked the last 3km, but nah I got eye bags already
[2024-01-05T01:12:22] Izuna 生活: Charging it now until the fan kicks in and then tomorrow full charge
[2024-01-05T01:12:58] Izuna 生活: Back to Germany 😭
[2024-01-05T01:17:04] @Súperpatin: Hello!!! Could someone help me, I can't finish programming my controller.
[2024-01-05T01:17:14] Jan: Guys dont over-do it with crazy special filaments
[2024-01-05T01:17:15] @Súperpatin: <photos/photo_11963@05-01-2024_01-17-15.jpg>
[2024-01-05T01:17:23] Jan: Its not worth it
[2024-01-05T01:17:55] Jan: PETG probably enough for 90% of applications
[2024-01-05T01:18:38] Jan: If you really insist on a crazy material that is unique to print insane stuff, google FOAM PLA
[2024-01-05T01:19:38] @Súperpatin: It gives me an error when trying to detect the motor.
[2024-01-05T01:21:44] Izuna 生活: Read.
[2024-01-05T01:21:47] Izuna 生活: What it says.
[2024-01-05T01:22:05] Mirono escooters: It literally tells you what to do Figure out the error
[2024-01-05T01:22:28] Mirono escooters: Yee 100% infill crazy strong
[2024-01-05T01:30:03] @Súperpatin: I'm new to this, I've never programmed any.
[2024-01-05T01:32:09] @Súperpatin: I tried many times to detect the motor and no matter how hard I tried, the same error always came out, I have tried more than 15 times
[2024-01-05T01:34:30] sombre_enfant: Yeah it need 16 time to get it alright
[2024-01-05T01:35:00] @Súperpatin: I set the voltage and poles correctly and also the wheel size and I'm still getting the error.
[2024-01-05T01:35:08] Mirono escooters: Fix the error lol
[2024-01-05T01:35:32] Mirono escooters: Go to RT, figure out error, fix it.
[2024-01-05T01:38:01] @Súperpatin: Thanks for that 16 times over, I really appreciate your help...
[2024-01-05T01:41:36] @Súperpatin: I guess you are a crack at this, from what I see you were born with the programs in your navel
[2024-01-05T01:49:56] haku: a 5mm petg 100% infill i can snap it easily
[2024-01-05T01:50:56] haku: i want some plastic that is as strong as legos
[2024-01-05T02:04:43] Mirono escooters: Ignore it
[2024-01-05T02:05:03] Mirono escooters: Polyharder vs plaster
[2024-01-05T02:09:47] haku: what does that mean. im a noob
[2024-01-05T02:10:46] Mirono escooters: You can't re melt some plastics, they burn and brittle (Almost?) All 3DP is plaster. Reusable
[2024-01-05T02:11:09] Mirono escooters: You are trying to make injection mold harder plastic with plaster, doesn't work :( Need spensive stuff
[2024-01-05T02:13:19] haku: this part is called the nozzle right? why does it have heatsinks. different from the alibaba ones?
[2024-01-05T02:13:44] Mirono escooters: Check out some yt videos how hotends work, need to get rid of heat in break
[2024-01-05T02:13:57] Mirono escooters: Heatbreak and nozzle is different stuff
[2024-01-05T02:14:53] haku: gotch thanks. i want to get .6 hardened nozzle ant try out stronger filaments
[2024-01-05T02:19:58] haku: ok i see now what it is
[2024-01-05T04:49:44] Ion: Out of curiosity, I've been looking at 21700 cells for a potential battery. This site has some offers https://www.nkon.nl/de/rechargeable/li-ion/21700-20700-size.html
[2024-01-05T04:50:19] Ion: With some cells being "re wrapped" or reclaimed/ older production, but therefore cheaper
[2024-01-05T04:50:37] Ion: Looks like most is sold out, but would something like that be worth it?
[2024-01-05T05:02:18] haku: what is a good digital caliper from aliexpress? i cannot afford the mitutoyos. something acurate but reasonably priced
[2024-01-05T05:09:25] haku: it really depends on what esc your using. and what motors you have. not a pro opinion though
[2024-01-05T05:10:34] haku: also if you want range over pumpum
[2024-01-05T05:15:00] Mirono escooters: Problably any with a .02 precisie
[2024-01-05T05:16:21] haku: would you recomend any from ali?
[2024-01-05T05:16:31] haku: my old caliper took a dump
[2024-01-05T05:34:14] Mirono escooters: Yes, from nkon it's very good, all tested and quality assured. Great way to safe a buck and still have quality
[2024-01-05T06:06:59] Happy Giraffe: Pick one from harbor freight instead
[2024-01-05T06:07:32] Happy Giraffe: 20$ one is enough
[2024-01-05T06:18:20] haku: thats what i had 😂
[2024-01-05T06:18:56] haku: <photos/photo_11966@05-01-2024_06-18-56.jpg>
[2024-01-05T06:19:20] haku: i had this for 6yrs and finally took a dump. i want a 12 inch one or 300mm
[2024-01-05T06:23:12] haku: i need some engineering tools for the less fortunate brand
[2024-01-05T06:49:18] haku: i also have 2 rotors. seems like to be 1.8mm-2mm would this still be good for scooter use. the shimano is resin only it said
[2024-01-05T06:49:19] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-05T06:49:19] haku: <photos/photo_11968@05-01-2024_06-49-19.jpg>
[2024-01-05T07:11:36] Happy Giraffe: Buy same brand if possible
[2024-01-05T07:11:54] Happy Giraffe: It works but not great
[2024-01-05T07:12:04] Happy Giraffe: Really want 2mm minimum also gotta ride bit more gently with thin discs and use regen
[2024-01-05T07:13:15] haku: resin only means the material used for rotors is soft?
[2024-01-05T07:16:44] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, that means no metallic or sintered pads. I use on mine but I use regen 90% of the time so resin discs can do one emergency stops without a catastrophe
[2024-01-05T07:18:20] haku: gotcha thanks. ive always been thinking about brakes. i think i will play it by ear and upgrade if necessary
[2024-01-05T07:19:05] haku: magura seems cool but i cant find a right side brakes because bikes have it on the left
[2024-01-05T07:20:23] haku: also shimano is all left side
[2024-01-05T07:23:13] Happy Giraffe: Right side scooter brake is interesting tho😂
[2024-01-05T07:24:10] haku: i know. i wonder why manufacturers chose that since most brakes are left side
[2024-01-05T07:25:33] haku: i can always switch sides but the front fork will look funky
[2024-01-05T07:25:40] Yamal: Brembo brake for e-scooter
[2024-01-05T07:26:11] haku: hope is that brand vesc lords say
[2024-01-05T07:27:24] haku: i really dont need that stopping and cooling unless in a track
[2024-01-05T07:27:26] Happy Giraffe: Brembo moto stuff👍
[2024-01-05T07:27:39] Yamal: What brakes would you like to put on?
[2024-01-05T07:27:58] haku: idk yet. right now zoom 😂
[2024-01-05T07:28:55] haku: shimano is what i like but all left side
[2024-01-05T07:29:07] Yamal: Shimano saint?
[2024-01-05T07:29:34] haku: no idea. the middle priced model
[2024-01-05T07:30:17] Yamal: The pistons are said to be ceramic and transmit little heat.
[2024-01-05T07:30:44] haku: i will be using regen mostly
[2024-01-05T07:31:53] Yamal: I'd rather wear out brake pads than risk regenerative brakes.
[2024-01-05T07:32:00] haku: thats also what impressed me about vesc. variable e-brake and regen
[2024-01-05T07:32:23] haku: is regen really that bad?
[2024-01-05T07:33:54] Yamal: I am no expert, but since I started this, all the people around me do not advise using them....
[2024-01-05T07:34:44] haku: i see. maybe overvoltage. i wanted 22s but 20s with regen sounds better
[2024-01-05T07:35:02] Gabe Enzo: Need e brake for Rainy weather
[2024-01-05T07:36:20] Yamal: Better not to ride electric scooters in the rain, right?
[2024-01-05T07:36:26] Yamal: Heheh
[2024-01-05T07:40:08] haku: we should have a poll aboit regen
[2024-01-05T07:45:03] Yamal: https://youtu.be/vNfDnLyyf_w?si=eG2V6ffxuwh_IPD0
[2024-01-05T07:45:13] Yamal: Your city ?
[2024-01-05T07:46:14] haku: a poll here in vesc telegram 😂
[2024-01-05T07:48:00] haku: this is my city.
[2024-01-05T07:48:46] haku: i was gonna buy 3shuls from them but they never replied to my email
[2024-01-05T07:50:25] haku: so i just gave my money to china 😂
[2024-01-05T07:52:01] Yamal: Nice shop! Heh
[2024-01-05T07:52:42] Yamal: I never know alien rides have a shop in Las Vegas
[2024-01-05T07:53:27] haku: i think they have 2 locations. thier hq is in california i think
[2024-01-05T07:55:36] haku: i was really intrested on cl350s at one point. they never replied to my questions. i always want to support local buissnes but amy always replies back to me
[2024-01-05T07:56:48] Yamal: but as you explained the other day, your controllers seem more powerful than the Shull ones, I was impressed
[2024-01-05T07:58:05] haku: idk man. ill see if i try it. maybe spintend marketing 😂
[2024-01-05T07:59:53] haku: i believe the folks here that claim its a good vesc though
[2024-01-05T07:59:59] Yamal: You are in the right country! Go find Benjamin Vedder and tell him you want to be a magician's apprentice.
[2024-01-05T08:06:24] Yamal: But the truth is that I would like to try a lot of types of Vesc in the future, except all of them 🐬!
[2024-01-05T08:29:38] Izuna 生活: magic🪄 (20A charging always does funny stuff)
[2024-01-05T08:32:59] Yamal: Your best friend 😁🔥👍
[2024-01-05T08:55:16] Gabe Enzo: how else u gonna go to the store or to school
[2024-01-05T08:55:18] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-01-05T08:56:45] Izuna 生活: idk legs?
[2024-01-05T08:57:48] Yamal: walking, cycling, bus, car, motorcycle, train, horse or pony, flying?
[2024-01-05T09:18:57] Gabe Enzo: ah forgot y'all aren't wanted

[2024-01-05T11:55:32] francois schempers: gonna do great on a ninebot 🤣
[2024-01-05T11:55:55] haku: yea bro these things are heavy af
[2024-01-05T11:59:44] sombre_enfant: U asked for custom wire ?
[2024-01-05T12:00:48] haku: that will be an awsome 9bot. burnouts all day
[2024-01-05T12:04:04] Gabe Enzo: Oh god
[2024-01-05T12:10:27] sombre_enfant: No burnout on single
[2024-01-05T12:16:25] Mirono escooters: SEE
[2024-01-05T12:16:30] Mirono escooters: ITS ALL ZERO 10X
[2024-01-05T12:16:52] Mirono escooters: You can not physically seal it properly
[2024-01-05T12:21:23] francois schempers: yup 6mm²
[2024-01-05T12:22:32] francois schempers: at the power I'll be running it, it will burnout don't worry 😂
[2024-01-05T12:23:30] puneDir: Why?

[2024-01-05T12:25:00] puneDir: looks good actually but it feels unsafe when going faster than 35-40
[2024-01-05T12:25:18] Gabe Enzo: Death wobbles?
[2024-01-05T12:25:18] puneDir: i was more comfy with ninebot even while going 90
[2024-01-05T12:25:32] puneDir: No wobbles but stem is short for me
[2024-01-05T12:26:15] puneDir: Btw my g30 with gen1s was feeling much more faster than this 😭
[2024-01-05T12:26:31] Gabe Enzo: Y did you buy a stock scooter
[2024-01-05T12:26:33] Gabe Enzo: When u got g30
[2024-01-05T12:29:55] Mirono escooters: Because shit
[2024-01-05T12:30:59] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters how do I calculate watt radiation from nickel?
[2024-01-05T12:31:40] Gabe Enzo: nvm
[2024-01-05T12:31:42] Gabe Enzo: resistance
[2024-01-05T12:33:07] Gabe Enzo: Wtf I can't find the resistance for nickel online
[2024-01-05T12:40:38] Mirono escooters: Ohm's law exist
[2024-01-05T12:41:02] Mirono escooters: Sure can... Btw, have to calculate for ur strip. It's not universal 😂
[2024-01-05T12:46:18] Gabe Enzo: So I only need to test for one piece of strip. it won't matter if it's in another shape later on etc?

[2024-01-05T15:24:22] francois schempers: tooks weeks more on delay, but worth it
[2024-01-05T15:25:12] francois schempers: oh that he did 😂
[2024-01-05T15:28:12] Izuna 生活: yes it's impossible

[2024-01-05T15:34:47] Mirono escooters: My friend earns alot with ebike delivery
[2024-01-05T15:46:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Actually, this is 10AWG so it is 5.5mm² and not 6mm² as I don't have 6mm² anymore here, but it is the same for me
[2024-01-05T15:47:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Factory isn't able to do it, so I do it
[2024-01-05T15:52:18] Jan: Whats a lot?
[2024-01-05T15:53:42] puneDir: Conclusion Looks good Nice suspenion Nice brakes (really good after ninebot stops instantly) Good buttons (eco turbo dual single) It has sooo nice motors And heres the more important things It barely does 55 It accelerates good until 30 after 30 it feels like xiaomi accelerating It feels so unsafe (i cant take corners fast or make some dangereus stuff) Stem is soo thin and short for me Handlebar is too long Its fucking 52v 18.5 amps with feb18650 (32ir cells) Shit water resistance (but battery and escs have some isolation) Rear mudguard makes 0 job (it looks like i shitted to my pants) Speedometer is so laggy No field weakening Cant place cells vertically Inside is so small Stock escs are 25-25 amps (thats why its slow) For around 2000 euros its not worth buying I bought for 1000 and im thinking 50/50 about that purchase It sometimes make me sad and sometimes happy Stem feels like it bends and gonna snap on every brake Anyways Im thinking about building it with 20s7p + damper + vescs on summer
[2024-01-05T15:55:28] Mirono escooters: Nothing compared to what a degree makes But I meant, he delivers way more then other, even registers as car. For no degree, good money
[2024-01-05T15:55:45] Finn: Even a G30 has more space then this
[2024-01-05T15:56:00] puneDir: Yes
[2024-01-05T15:56:16] puneDir: I really like the design of the zero
[2024-01-05T15:56:25] Gabe Enzo: Lmao like the kugoo G4 I bought that was advertised as 70kmh but could barely go 55. Same my handlebars were soo long
[2024-01-05T15:56:26] Finn: What are the motors wattage rating? And do you know the magnet length?
[2024-01-05T15:56:31] puneDir: Zero = getting girls xD Ninebot= flying
[2024-01-05T15:56:37] Gabe Enzo: It seems that the new Zero is literally just a kugoo G4 and they go for 900
[2024-01-05T15:56:38] puneDir: 50h 1200w
[2024-01-05T15:56:46] Jan: Its an illusion that a degree makes you decent money 😅
[2024-01-05T15:56:55] Gabe Enzo: Nah ninebot = getting girlies
[2024-01-05T15:56:58] Gabe Enzo: Trust
[2024-01-05T15:58:02] Jan: Electric scooters =/ getting girls
[2024-01-05T15:58:08] Jan: Sorry to break the illusion
[2024-01-05T15:58:35] Jan: And if you have a fancy car to get girls, these are the girls you dont want ^^
[2024-01-05T15:58:36] puneDir: were 16
[2024-01-05T15:58:42] puneDir: girls are 16
[2024-01-05T15:58:57] Jan: At that age i traded Pokemon cards, not STD's
[2024-01-05T15:59:03] Jan: 😬
[2024-01-05T15:59:39] puneDir: i sell random rocks on street as fairy rocks for 2000usd
[2024-01-05T16:02:25] Mirono escooters: It can help, in industries...
[2024-01-05T16:02:38] Mirono escooters: Don't tell me someone filling racks earns as much as a engineer.. 😂
[2024-01-05T16:02:53] Jan: Not even double here
[2024-01-05T16:03:17] Jan: Pilot is 20% more than filling racks at ALDI
[2024-01-05T16:03:19] Mirono escooters: Welp, Belgium ok then. Uncle makes more then us on his own ; D Pharmacy. Oil. All good industries
[2024-01-05T16:03:34] Mirono escooters: Pilot is undervalued.. you pick out the some jobs
[2024-01-05T16:04:05] Jan: Demands is not as big and there are many people who want to become a pilot
[2024-01-05T16:04:12] Jan: => salary dumping
[2024-01-05T16:04:14] Mirono escooters: Voila
[2024-01-05T16:04:24] Mirono escooters: So, if you want your dream job, you accept the consequences with it
[2024-01-05T16:04:38] Mirono escooters: Idk anyone doing a job for the money only. You can't.
[2024-01-05T16:12:50] Jan: Yes
[2024-01-05T16:13:59] Mirono escooters: I get depressed when I think how much money and studies I still need to make xD
[2024-01-05T16:14:26] Jan: At least university is more enjoyable than school
[2024-01-05T16:14:34] Jan: You work on topics that you somewhat like
[2024-01-05T16:15:07] Jan: After that its all about doing something you like or making money ^^
[2024-01-05T16:17:36] Face de Pin Sucé: I did 3 in the same day
[2024-01-05T16:17:42] Face de Pin Sucé: forgot how I hate that
[2024-01-05T16:17:59] Face de Pin Sucé: but I have good experience, doing that before on ALL motors we had x)
[2024-01-05T16:27:08] Happy Giraffe: In Denmark I remember on weekends easily 22-23€/h pure profit as electricity was free for me and 8% tax😁 On very good days ~30€/h on evenings. I only did the 4 best hours of evening until empty battery.
[2024-01-05T16:43:02] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_11981@05-01-2024_16-43-02.jpg>
[2024-01-05T16:43:18] Mirono escooters: Hammer and flat screwdriver Remove thermal paste ok
[2024-01-05T16:43:31] Mirono escooters: I'm gonna coat it with silicon
[2024-01-05T17:04:23] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2024-01-05T17:04:25] Mirono escooters: @kawaiinekololis idea for you ^^ Idk how I will reach the fets. Problably jank too much on it
[2024-01-05T17:09:10] Paolo ⁭: Poorest external insulation
[2024-01-05T17:09:28] Paolo ⁭: And maybe made the hole bigger
[2024-01-05T17:32:44] Oreo huzky: If you ever want to repair it 💀
[2024-01-05T17:37:59] Mirono escooters: Silicon peels off 😜😜😜
[2024-01-05T17:38:08] Mirono escooters: And I'm done repairing 60€ VEscs
[2024-01-05T18:05:25] Happy Giraffe: Who loves offensive jokes?
[2024-01-05T19:00:42] puneDir: zero is weird
[2024-01-05T19:00:55] puneDir: 10 percent throttle and 100 is same
[2024-01-05T19:01:05] puneDir: Shit top speed
[2024-01-05T19:02:32] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2024-01-05T19:02:55] puneDir: im kinda sad
[2024-01-05T19:03:03] Mirono escooters: Didnt listen to me
[2024-01-05T19:03:21] puneDir: yeah
[2024-01-05T19:03:29] puneDir: But it has nice suspenion
[2024-01-05T19:03:36] puneDir: for jumping
[2024-01-05T19:03:54] puneDir: i recorded some vids
[2024-01-05T19:40:42] haku: this zero is bone stock. wait till you put vescs and good batteries in it.
[2024-01-05T19:42:19] puneDir: It feels unsecure
[2024-01-05T19:48:57] haku: i want zero11x frame or vsett 11 frame
[2024-01-05T19:51:56] Yamal: Very heavy….
[2024-01-05T20:04:34] haku: see what i mean about these motors. there are white braided insulation under the plastic sleeve. is it okay to just remove the colored sleeve and just use the white ones underneath?
[2024-01-05T20:04:34] haku: <photos/photo_11983@05-01-2024_20-04-34.jpg>
[2024-01-05T20:04:56] Mirono escooters: That's risky
[2024-01-05T20:05:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Nooooooo don't touch the hole, too dangerous
[2024-01-05T20:05:21] Face de Pin Sucé: PTFE is perfect for that
[2024-01-05T20:06:10] Mirono escooters: Sus
[2024-01-05T20:08:39] haku: they even gave me extra cables that doesnt have the colors
[2024-01-05T20:09:21] Paolo ⁭: I mean I see heatshrink only and not rubber insulation as normal motor cable , that's why it fits
[2024-01-05T20:23:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, rubber insulation is too big and not good, heats up wires
[2024-01-05T20:51:04] Gabe Enzo: Thermal past? thermal cement?
[2024-01-05T20:51:40] Tommy ª: how you remove the silicon?
[2024-01-05T20:52:16] Mirono escooters: Peel off
[2024-01-05T20:52:16] Mirono escooters: Thermal glue
[2024-01-05T20:57:29] haku: is it. i want a big compartment. if i can get a teverun frame that would be the best
[2024-01-05T20:58:55] haku: i think jppl has is a vsett11 and that that etorros guy from youtube. decked to the gills
[2024-01-05T21:09:55] Yamal: but in the end you don't mount everything on the one you already have?
[2024-01-05T21:15:54] haku: ill finish this super laotie first then i will see in the future if i need a better frame 😂. honestly if i can fit this all in a g30 i would do that. super sleeper
[2024-01-05T21:17:13] haku: i like to make things thats odd and doesnt make sense. things that doesnt belong there
[2024-01-05T21:20:19] haku: like sandbagging people. i had years of wrestling experience and competed in a novice jiujitsu tournament. smoked all the guys 😂
[2024-01-05T21:28:48] Yamal: 22s, 70h 33/2 in a g30 no please
[2024-01-05T21:28:54] Yamal: Heh
[2024-01-05T21:29:33] haku: with the help of the vesc lords im sure it can be done
[2024-01-05T21:30:29] Tommy ª: guys anyone knows the cutoff voltaje on xiaomi bms?
[2024-01-05T21:34:07] Mirono escooters: 2.75 I think
[2024-01-05T21:34:41] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-05T21:41:24] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/6f78Z_SVj7Y?si=Kf80kGLxGII0M57_
[2024-01-05T21:41:48] haku: do you guys have these brands of tools in the eu? 😂
[2024-01-05T21:44:00] Paolo ⁭: Swiss tool, were, beta, usag all good
[2024-01-05T21:44:04] haku: my milwaukee drill batteries going strong for 8yrs now
[2024-01-05T21:45:18] haku: ofcourse makita knows 😂
[2024-01-05T21:46:16] Tommy ª: I never seen that
[2024-01-05T21:49:07] haku: im thinking of buying a quality grinder. i already have some milwaukee tools and batteries.😭
[2024-01-05T21:50:56] Paolo ⁭: Probably yes haha, I just use Chinese 20/30$ tools
[2024-01-05T21:51:44] haku: me too. but powertools i want good batteries
[2024-01-05T21:52:10] cihan: I bought Wera torque wrench and it's quality, I liked it. And I also bought Wera electronic screwdriver set and it's steel quality was unfortunately subpar, it was so soft and bending easily. Such hard steel is not necessary for small screwdrivers but I still returned it to Amazon even though I bought it for a very good price for that set. All in all Wera hand tools differ in quality, not all the same.
[2024-01-05T21:52:28] cihan: Did anyone see Izeltaş hand tools being sold out of Turkey?
[2024-01-05T21:54:06] cihan: Milwaukee is always good as I've seen reviews, maybe among best 10% for most of what they manufacture.
[2024-01-05T21:54:29] sombre_enfant: Aeg for the win
[2024-01-05T21:56:24] cihan: I have no idea if they're being sold abroad but you can buy Izeltaş eyes closed as long as you find them cheap, you can compare prices from some Turkish sites if you notice them being sold. They can have bad ergonomics but steel is always quality. I have to pay at least 3-4 x price in Turkey if I want to buy something better than İzeltaş.
[2024-01-05T22:00:09] cihan: An orthodontist friend cuts steel wires all the time and he swears by İzeltaş. He uses diagonal pliers all the time and he told İzeltas is better than Gedore and Knippex. Only diagonal cutters he has better than İzeltaş is from American Orthodontics and with carbide coating. But it costs 120 USD and you can never drop down something carbide coated, it breaks easily.
[2024-01-05T22:00:36] Thierry: New LY motors have removable cover on both side, much easier to change stator 😃
[2024-01-05T22:01:21] francois schempers: if I'm not mistaken this one too, no ? @SibClimb
[2024-01-05T22:01:39] Thierry: Anyway these motors are awesome
[2024-01-05T22:02:07] francois schempers: I'll put ferofluild inside, it will need it 😂😂
[2024-01-05T22:02:57] Thierry: Not both side removable cover
[2024-01-05T22:03:31] Thierry: <photos/photo_11985@05-01-2024_22-03-31.jpg>
[2024-01-05T22:03:56] Thierry: Finally
[2024-01-05T22:04:29] Thierry: I think 65H but I didn't take the pic
[2024-01-05T22:04:35] Thierry: It is from LY
[2024-01-05T22:05:52] Thierry: I don't know
[2024-01-05T22:06:00] Thierry: Hopefully 115mm
[2024-01-05T22:06:08] francois schempers: once I start working on the scooter I'll open everything and share it here
[2024-01-05T22:06:25] Thierry: Be careful when removing stator
[2024-01-05T22:06:30] francois schempers: 125 on mine
[2024-01-05T22:06:30] francois schempers: <photos/photo_11986@05-01-2024_22-06-30.jpg>
[2024-01-05T22:07:18] francois schempers: I might leave it in place, I just need acces for ferofuild
[2024-01-05T22:07:38] francois schempers: yeah
[2024-01-05T22:07:45] Thierry: Very tricky to remove stator without damaging phase cable
[2024-01-05T22:08:10] sombre_enfant: 65h with 125mm dropout ? Thats crazy, 33x2???
[2024-01-05T22:08:20] francois schempers: 60h
[2024-01-05T22:08:33] francois schempers: custom steel forks ^^
[2024-01-05T22:08:36] Thierry: 65H is available on previous gen
[2024-01-05T22:08:56] Thierry: 125mm I mean
[2024-01-05T22:09:06] sombre_enfant: U build another g30 ?
[2024-01-05T22:09:21] Thierry: It is still ongoing
[2024-01-05T22:09:23] francois schempers: 8mm thick steel, won't bend any time soon 🤤
[2024-01-05T22:10:00] sombre_enfant: For the race ?
[2024-01-05T22:11:04] Thierry: No just for hanging out
[2024-01-05T22:11:30] Thierry: Are you gonna take part of championship?
[2024-01-05T22:11:49] sombre_enfant: No im broke and cooked
[2024-01-05T22:12:48] Thierry: Come to see at least
[2024-01-05T22:13:04] sombre_enfant: Got no car atm
[2024-01-05T22:14:24] Ion: these motors look cool, and best there is for 10 inch, right?
[2024-01-05T22:14:37] Ion: you building single or dual motor?
[2024-01-05T22:14:39] sombre_enfant: Its broke again i killed a spintend, i got a mks now and im rebuilding brake, soon display and xt lever
[2024-01-05T22:15:03] Gabe Enzo: Most beautiful things on earth; Motors cells
[2024-01-05T22:15:07] Thierry: Yes
[2024-01-05T22:15:09] Gabe Enzo: And that's about it
[2024-01-05T22:17:11] haku: they have removable split rims tubeless rims yea?
[2024-01-05T22:18:01] haku: i see. these motoes are 10?
[2024-01-05T22:23:45] haku: my cutters and pliers mostly china stuff. idk if good brands can keep an edge for a long time. so i just replace them when needed
[2024-01-05T22:38:30] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2024-01-05T22:39:15] Gabe Enzo: 850€ will spend in Feb and I'll have the moneyyy 💲💲💲
[2024-01-05T22:50:16] haku: for new motors do you guys replace bearings with better ones? or you just use the factory bearings?
[2024-01-05T22:51:18] haku: im thinking of getting those strong bearings. i forgot the brand but its from the eu made
[2024-01-05T22:51:56] Ion: SKF probably
[2024-01-05T22:52:40] haku: yes that one. should i replace new factory bearings with that?
[2024-01-05T22:53:17] haku: will it add +10hp?
[2024-01-05T22:54:03] sombre_enfant: Bro casually showing ud his alcoholic trouble
[2024-01-05T22:54:33] sombre_enfant: Atleast 500 watts
[2024-01-05T22:54:55] sombre_enfant: You re cooked brother
[2024-01-05T22:55:53] sombre_enfant: @Mirono_escooters delete this haram stuff pls
[2024-01-05T22:56:31] haku: just make a only fans and spit something else 😂 $$$
[2024-01-05T22:59:58] haku: serious talk though. is it ok to trust factory brearings for high speed motors?
[2024-01-05T23:00:19] Mirono escooters: Man deserves his drink
[2024-01-05T23:00:24] Mirono escooters: Posted in the good Group too
[2024-01-05T23:00:33] Mirono escooters: Why not
[2024-01-05T23:09:28] Face de Pin Sucé: No, 105 or 110 max
[2024-01-06T00:18:02] Happy Giraffe: All batteries in tools suck big time, really need some DIY 21700 cell magic
[2024-01-06T00:18:29] Happy Giraffe: Tho Ryobi 18v 120w soldering iron is nice and cheap for 55€
[2024-01-06T00:24:01] Happy Giraffe: TorqueTestChannel on Youtube benchmarked most of the tools😁
[2024-01-06T00:24:42] Happy Giraffe: So 60A?
[2024-01-06T00:27:03] Paolo ⁭: Where you get datasheet?
[2024-01-06T00:27:59] Happy Giraffe: This is good, I wanna buy P42A at 2€
[2024-01-06T00:29:27] Ion: where 😅
[2024-01-06T00:33:16] Paolo ⁭: Where!
[2024-01-06T00:33:49] Paolo ⁭: It's impressive if is 4000mah
[2024-01-06T00:46:43] haku: testing out transparent filament hopefully this wont look like crap
[2024-01-06T00:56:12] Pandalgns: The "transparent" filament is not 100% transparent, you will have something like this
[2024-01-06T00:56:56] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2024-01-06T00:58:25] haku: oh i see. cant make it print glass?
[2024-01-06T01:00:15] haku: with that angle of back plate it must be easier to do wheelies
[2024-01-06T01:01:39] Pandalgns: The closest thing to totally transparent that you could get would be with a resin printer, and it would come out totally transparent.
[2024-01-06T01:03:05] haku: those things are expensive and only used for toys and costumes yea?
[2024-01-06T01:04:41] haku: <photos/photo_11988@06-01-2024_01-04-41.jpg>
[2024-01-06T01:04:59] haku: i saw this on reddit with this same brand filament
[2024-01-06T01:09:57] haku: maybe tonight or tomorrow morning. i will update you guys.
[2024-01-06T01:10:29] haku: there are some special settings to get the super transparent
[2024-01-06T01:28:38] haku: these are bambu settings from reddit
[2024-01-06T01:51:23] Finn: Ok
[2024-01-06T01:51:29] Finn: Use default
[2024-01-06T01:51:34] Finn: Works best
[2024-01-06T02:02:02] NetworkDir: How much A phase/battery current zero 10x stock motor cables can handle? Continuous and peak
[2024-01-06T02:44:08] Rose: Hey there Rosticz, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-06T02:52:22] haku: i still cant get one of my tubeless split rim to bead. wtf
[2024-01-06T02:53:15] haku: i can only inflate one. seems like its leaking by the gasket 😭
[2024-01-06T02:54:50] haku: size comparison 11" and 12" if anyone interested
[2024-01-06T03:15:51] haku: ill try that. also i will double check the gaskets. thanks
[2024-01-06T03:16:39] haku: these guys living the american dream. im so jelly.https://youtu.be/6yYGLeMI7H8?si=Q8CWWaQr2xlRs1Zb
[2024-01-06T03:20:46] haku: thats a crazy gokart. i wonder how much this build will cost
[2024-01-06T04:35:19] haku: finally got it to bead 😂
[2024-01-06T04:38:17] haku: lol. no compressor. 😭
[2024-01-06T04:38:50] haku: someday when im racing in france i will need one of those 😜
[2024-01-06T05:15:42] haku: i knew it. i need atleast 2mm washers and extend the forks.
[2024-01-06T05:16:24] haku: or i might just buy the 11" rim. but i really want 12
[2024-01-06T05:20:04] haku: <photos/photo_11994@06-01-2024_05-20-04.jpg>
[2024-01-06T05:20:04] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-06T10:35:24] Gabe Enzo: Show us how you fit that motor on that monorim rear
[2024-01-06T10:35:34] Gabe Enzo: I need to know what measurements of bolts to buy and shit
[2024-01-06T10:40:35] TrentXWB: Hello - my Flipsky 75100 only accept software up to v5.02 / The problem if I connect Flipsky TFT display the motors make noise and don’t work properly. When I upgrade to v6.xx the TFT works fine but motors are not working properly. Any idea to connect TFT correct?
[2024-01-06T10:42:20] TrentXWB: Note: 75100 accepts software >v5.02 but doesn’t work (also with phase filter off).
[2024-01-06T11:55:22] Mirono escooters: Newer firmware should work fine. Wich do you flash? Is it the correct?
[2024-01-06T11:55:33] Mirono escooters: I like the dash idea
[2024-01-06T11:55:47] Mirono escooters: Explain "motors not working properly"
[2024-01-06T11:58:42] Mirono escooters: Resin is only for tiny stuff More spensive and slow and tiny
[2024-01-06T12:11:28] Pandalgns: with many modifications, enlarging the axle hole, changing screws, spacers, rigidity axle...
[2024-01-06T12:12:00] Pandalgns: and mounting it in a very specific way
[2024-01-06T13:39:57] Gabe Enzo: The engineer
[2024-01-06T13:40:00] Gabe Enzo: The Duracell fast charger broke so I made my own
[2024-01-06T13:40:05] Mirono escooters: Oh god
[2024-01-06T13:41:15] haku: also isnt resin not as strong as fdm printers?
[2024-01-06T13:42:24] haku: yea. i get that alot.
[2024-01-06T13:43:21] haku: after the 3 topics vesc group that started to happen
[2024-01-06T13:43:26] Mirono escooters: Some
[2024-01-06T13:43:51] Mirono escooters: U use official app? I no issue
[2024-01-06T13:44:18] TrentXWB: All software versions work properly up to incl 5.02. If I flash versions (e.g. 6.2) motors making noise and don’t work properly (rattling). I think this issue is known by Flipsky they write it in their offers (eg AliExpress). But the problem is the TFT display works only with later versions (eg 6.2). With my 5.2 software motors make noise and moving…
[2024-01-06T13:46:25] TrentXWB: <video_file>
[2024-01-06T13:47:58] Mirono escooters: You didn't redo motor Cali? Or did
[2024-01-06T13:48:13] TrentXWB: I did
[2024-01-06T13:48:23] TrentXWB: If I remove TFT all is fine
[2024-01-06T13:48:38] TrentXWB: (Disconnect connector)
[2024-01-06T13:50:03] Mirono escooters: Super weird.
[2024-01-06T13:50:08] TrentXWB: Yes strange
[2024-01-06T13:50:40] Mirono escooters: Tried 6.05?
[2024-01-06T13:50:59] TrentXWB: Yes. Maybe I have to use another connector for data lines (eg UART2 instead of COMM)
[2024-01-06T13:51:02] TrentXWB: Yes
[2024-01-06T13:51:10] TrentXWB: 6.05 works fine with display
[2024-01-06T13:51:24] TrentXWB: But does not work with cheap 75100
[2024-01-06T13:51:41] TrentXWB: Motors make crazy noise etc
[2024-01-06T13:52:05] TrentXWB: Oh really
[2024-01-06T13:52:13] Mirono escooters: You can try
[2024-01-06T13:52:15] TrentXWB: But not the cheap version?
[2024-01-06T13:52:27] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter
[2024-01-06T13:52:35] TrentXWB: Ok
[2024-01-06T13:52:42] sombre_enfant: Maybe use stock display...
[2024-01-06T13:53:13] TrentXWB: I will try again
[2024-01-06T13:53:34] Mirono escooters: Try different comm port
[2024-01-06T13:53:38] TrentXWB: Ok
[2024-01-06T13:53:52] Mirono escooters: I fail to see how display interferes with motor xD But universe can be weird
[2024-01-06T13:54:05] Mirono escooters: Doubt it does that
[2024-01-06T14:08:24] Mirono escooters: If anyone has suggestions to fix ebrake Messing with g30 dash button .. When hard ebrake and stop, sometimes light turns on😂 And when I was at red light just pushing braking when bored, it went into lock mode 😂😂
[2024-01-06T14:08:32] Mirono escooters: I'm thinking higher resistance resistor/ a ceramic cap on signal line
[2024-01-06T14:13:06] Tommy ª: non, use a 470 resistor the mine gets crazy at 600 (dont think about using 1k), with 470 is fine and perfect
[2024-01-06T14:13:12] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-06T14:13:49] Mirono escooters: I forgot wich I used. I think 1k 🤔
[2024-01-06T14:15:18] Tommy ª: most of my friends got problems with 1k and 890ohm
[2024-01-06T14:15:25] Mirono escooters: :(
[2024-01-06T14:16:23] Tommy ª: imagine me using a injection logic level mosfet for the rear light 😭
[2024-01-06T14:18:14] Mirono escooters: Ok yes I used 1kohm Let's try 470
[2024-01-06T14:18:53] Tommy ª: Also I used a 15000uf goofy cap in 5v line ☠
[2024-01-06T14:20:12] Unknown: My kaabo Mantis 10 Kelly controller 💥
[2024-01-06T14:24:12] Mirono escooters: That's stupid, risk burning 5v chip
[2024-01-06T14:24:18] Mirono escooters: It's like a short circuit when u power it on
[2024-01-06T14:24:22] Mirono escooters: I got 470uF
[2024-01-06T14:25:17] Tommy ª: It just uses the cap as battery 😭😭😭 Jk, I don't use nothing, just the resistor
[2024-01-06T14:29:22] Mirono escooters: Ok lol
[2024-01-06T14:29:33] Mirono escooters: I use BCS i dont trust flipsky caps on board
[2024-01-06T14:30:32] Tommy ª: I want to made my own 75 series but without design issues 😭
[2024-01-06T14:31:29] Mirono escooters: Go for it
[2024-01-06T14:31:41] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-06T14:32:49] Yamal: 7212?
[2024-01-06T14:33:22] Unknown: No
[2024-01-06T14:34:24] Unknown: 7230
[2024-01-06T14:34:29] Unknown: There 300a
[2024-01-06T14:37:48] Mirono escooters: Do be vesc chat tho
[2024-01-06T14:55:15] Mirono escooters: It's not like I have such powerful ebrake Must be flipsky moment
[2024-01-06T14:55:23] Mirono escooters: I Try 470 now 🤷
[2024-01-06T14:57:00] Mirono escooters: Hmm. 1zuna and me got idea to delay button activation to 1s after stopping
[2024-01-06T14:57:52] Mirono escooters: Sucks, how does Xiaomi do it xd
[2024-01-06T14:58:20] Mirono escooters: Idk, it's always when I stop hard on ebrake
[2024-01-06T15:04:14] Mirono escooters: Not here
[2024-01-06T15:04:36] Mirono escooters: I was surprised I triggered lock mode xD Button led press ok, but lock mode?

[2024-01-06T15:07:05] puneDir: I learned how to do wheelies without pulling the stem
[2024-01-06T15:08:13] Tommy ª: Xiaomi uses the 36v directly from the battery So yes, with og controller you have 36v in the button
[2024-01-06T15:10:07] Mirono escooters: No, all
[2024-01-06T15:10:49] Tommy ª: It's 36v just for the button, the dash works at 5v
[2024-01-06T15:14:14] Tommy ª: At 5.2v you are turning on the front light, probably you burn it at 8v The 36v thing works in some same way than the 3.3v on vesc, just a pull down (or up? I don't remember)
[2024-01-06T15:15:03] Tommy ª: Also I need to put a diode in Serie with the 5v line, my vesc is pushing 5.1v and the front light is like always turned on
[2024-01-06T15:15:33] Tommy ª: It has some small step ups and downs, but his voltaje is 5v
[2024-01-06T15:16:27] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_11997@06-01-2024_15-16-27.jpg>
[2024-01-06T15:16:34] Tommy ª: 😭
[2024-01-06T15:17:12] NetworkDir: I'm thinking how can it be a wheelie with 12kW😂
[2024-01-06T15:18:12] Tommy ª: In the "rx" line is just connected to the button In the og controller it uses some resistors for down the voltaje for the MCU In vesc just use the 3.3v line and you fine (with a resistor, the button is grounded)
[2024-01-06T15:19:25] Tommy ª: Just use 470Ω
[2024-01-06T15:20:43] Tommy ª: Fairly stock 😭
[2024-01-06T15:27:35] puneDir: :D
[2024-01-06T15:31:24] Gabe Enzo: wishing you had your pro now ye
[2024-01-06T15:50:37] Happy Giraffe: Kelly is Kryptonite here
[2024-01-06T15:52:20] Tommy ª: I think I killed my halls
[2024-01-06T15:59:16] Mirono escooters: Fak, I lost 1zuna dash manual I think I switched 2 wires ^^
[2024-01-06T16:01:15] Mirono escooters: A found, my German is rough
[2024-01-06T16:10:40] Happy Giraffe: Tho vesc doesnt have a strong start vs cheaper esc on large hubs that have big wheels🤔
[2024-01-06T16:11:22] Happy Giraffe: Thats also why I like to switch for mid drive, get full power from IPM motor
[2024-01-06T16:12:00] Mirono escooters: Use bldc mode, fixed Use high phase amps, fixed
[2024-01-06T16:14:55] Happy Giraffe: Would be interesting to find the limit on how much phase the hub can take without saturation
[2024-01-06T16:17:02] Mirono escooters: With halls, dont care about saturation 😜
[2024-01-06T16:17:13] Mirono escooters: I know ppl who did 2000a phase
[2024-01-06T16:31:12] Ion: Not great for the stem
[2024-01-06T16:33:06] Gabe Enzo: Yea
[2024-01-06T16:33:11] Gabe Enzo: You think
[2024-01-06T16:40:50] Happy Giraffe: I need to fine tune mine to get rid of the cold weather cogging
[2024-01-06T16:43:06] Gabe Enzo: Or just high phase amps lol
[2024-01-06T16:43:09] Mirono escooters: Redo setup Lower R
[2024-01-06T16:43:22] Mirono escooters: Bldc has more aggrisive spikes
[2024-01-06T16:43:35] Gabe Enzo: Why didn't my motor work with bldc?
[2024-01-06T16:44:20] Mirono escooters: Magic
[2024-01-06T16:44:21] Mirono escooters: Use foc, better in every way
[2024-01-06T16:45:20] Gabe Enzo: Isn't it apparently more rpm no?
[2024-01-06T16:45:26] Gabe Enzo: or is that a lie
[2024-01-06T16:45:39] Gabe Enzo: more heat definitely tho
[2024-01-06T16:45:40] Mirono escooters: You can ususally just switch from foc to bldc without issue
[2024-01-06T16:45:50] Mirono escooters: A liiiitle
[2024-01-06T16:47:11] Jhinzuo ~~: Does g30 motor fit on Xiaomi yes or? With reversed monorim, but I gotta extend the phases right
[2024-01-06T16:47:31] Mirono escooters: Yes recersed
[2024-01-06T16:49:45] Gabe Enzo: Of course.
[2024-01-06T16:50:56] Happy Giraffe: I give you a screenshot of it tomorrow, basically it should use halls only at start but still cogs a little. Lowered resistance and inductance a tinybit
[2024-01-06T16:53:32] Jhinzuo ~~: U know if phases are long enough too lazy to disassemble and check
[2024-01-06T16:54:48] Gabe Enzo: You mean the wires? why wouldn't they be.
[2024-01-06T16:54:57] Gabe Enzo: I've no clue actually
[2024-01-06T17:00:50] Happy Giraffe: They are easy to make longer, just get one gauge thicker cable and solder properly👍
[2024-01-06T17:01:29] Mirono escooters: https://cjeastwd.blogspot.com/2020/04/steering-trail.html?m=1
[2024-01-06T17:01:48] Happy Giraffe: If using same size thin multi strand wire you will increase resistance a bit
[2024-01-06T17:22:42] Tommy ª: casually my vesc crashed or something like that i just rebooted it and worked, i noticed when this happends i got this vibration and the usb stops working, but after reboot is fine
[2024-01-06T19:26:44] Happy Giraffe: Ebike = Milfs, can confirm
[2024-01-06T19:27:27] Happy Giraffe: Or maybe it was the cat stickers
[2024-01-06T19:27:33] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-01-06T19:34:58] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-01-06T20:34:06] haku: they are attracted to burnout smoke 😂
[2024-01-06T20:50:04] Gabe Enzo: Girls love power. No pun intended.
[2024-01-06T20:50:15] Gabe Enzo: Or was it
[2024-01-06T20:51:25] Mirono escooters: Are you high
[2024-01-06T20:55:20] haku: thats a nice view my guy. electric surf board looks fun in that straight away
[2024-01-06T20:56:00] Gabe Enzo: After a 2 day bender
[2024-01-06T20:56:08] Gabe Enzo: Drink there drink here
[2024-01-06T20:56:10] Gabe Enzo: So on
[2024-01-06T21:03:06] Gabe Enzo: Basically no sleep these past 48h LOL
[2024-01-06T21:15:59] haku: https://youtu.be/nLNOHgNOBO8?si=0rub5v50-vAghSUe
[2024-01-06T21:16:21] haku: what do you guys think of this. i might go to CES and check it out
[2024-01-06T21:19:54] haku: in my opinion its another rich kids toy. 10k dollar scooter 😭
[2024-01-06T21:24:40] Tommy ª: guys any ideas for the poles count? i have 30 magnets but 27 coils 27 poles give me wrong speed 30 is close to real speed but still wrong
[2024-01-06T21:35:45] Yamal: https://youtu.be/Wr1_g-IQzTU?si=rINWKK1-dcRRarbY
[2024-01-06T21:36:03] Yamal: This is your work group ! 😁
[2024-01-06T21:39:10] Gabe Enzo: Has anyone ever fit 80 cells in a 3L? I think it's possible with honeycomb haha
[2024-01-06T21:39:43] Gabe Enzo: 4.41cm² per cell. The 2.5L can hold 55 cells without honeycomb. I don't know the formula for honeycomb
[2024-01-06T21:40:06] Yamal: The good thing about riding a g30, that no one is looking at you! You can live in peace with tranquility.
[2024-01-06T21:40:51] Gabe Enzo: What makes you think that?
[2024-01-06T21:43:39] Yamal: Xiaomi/G30 are like the smallest scooters out there, all cities have them and I think the state security forces won't give you any problems.😁
[2024-01-06T21:45:21] haku: they are commuter scooters. thats why they are the best candidate for sleepers
[2024-01-06T21:50:31] Gabe Enzo: I've signed out on sleeperism when I bought double suspension Lol
[2024-01-06T21:51:08] Gabe Enzo: my ride style is aggressive so I need it
[2024-01-06T21:52:07] Yamal: One motor or two motor ?
[2024-01-06T21:52:10] Gabe Enzo: But honestly it's so nimble the cops can't catch you.
[2024-01-06T21:52:16] Gabe Enzo: Single until march.
[2024-01-06T21:52:23] Gabe Enzo: Just waiting to put it all together
[2024-01-06T21:52:29] haku: that outlaw life.
[2024-01-06T21:52:57] Gabe Enzo: The opps got surrons and shit. I need something really quick.
[2024-01-06T21:53:11] Gabe Enzo: No playing around with 300w motor shit
[2024-01-06T21:53:48] Yamal: 65h motor look nice!
[2024-01-06T21:53:49] Mirono escooters: 30
[2024-01-06T21:54:05] Mirono escooters: Then your tire size is slightly off Adjust until gps match
[2024-01-06T21:54:12] Gabe Enzo: I'm going with dual 22x3
[2024-01-06T21:54:16] Gabe Enzo: Idk what H that is, 60?
[2024-01-06T21:54:33] Gabe Enzo: I'll be using an 800w until I get my payment.
[2024-01-06T21:54:41] Gabe Enzo: Should be good for 5kw peaks, I'm pretty light. With temp sensor
[2024-01-06T21:55:01] Yamal: the length of magnet
[2024-01-06T21:56:59] Yamal: When you talk about a 60h motor, it means that the length of its magnet is 60mm
[2024-01-06T21:57:25] Gabe Enzo: I assumed it was 60 winding Arrangements.
[2024-01-06T21:57:35] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2024-01-06T21:58:35] Yamal: 22/3 winding is the one I use on the nami and it is right in the middle between 17/4 torque and 33/2 speed
[2024-01-06T22:02:17] Gabe Enzo: what does 22 and 3 mean
[2024-01-06T22:02:29] Yamal: I can help you in a little more, when you talk about parameters and concepts about the Vesc I am lost
[2024-01-06T22:02:33] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-01-06T22:02:58] Paolo ⁭: Now you're with 65h rear and 60 front?
[2024-01-06T22:03:30] Yamal: No, 60/60 front and rear
[2024-01-06T22:04:17] Yamal: tomorrow they start with the construction of my battery‼️
[2024-01-06T22:04:25] Paolo ⁭: Oh okay you got the another motor elsewhere
[2024-01-06T22:05:40] Yamal: Jesus help me with the engine infront, the problem is that I have broken halls and I go without a hall, in both engines, but I think it is not a problem for Vesc, right?
[2024-01-06T22:06:25] Paolo ⁭: You need halls for smooth start , especially with high current
[2024-01-06T22:07:25] haku: what happened to your halls. just replace it if broken
[2024-01-06T22:08:43] Yamal: Yeah ! In the near future I want to change the halls
[2024-01-06T22:13:36] Gabe Enzo: I'm looking at 1.5K € and I will have it in a couple weeks. Just looking at the battery situation ATM. Looking for a molicel sale.
[2024-01-06T22:13:53] Gabe Enzo: And that's without tyres and accessories even. just hardware
[2024-01-06T22:14:21] haku: just get 40ts if on sale my guy.
[2024-01-06T22:14:48] Gabe Enzo: I "need" 24kw.
[2024-01-06T22:14:53] haku: when the new molicels come out it will be discounted im sure.
[2024-01-06T22:15:16] Gabe Enzo: New molicels? P45C 👀
[2024-01-06T22:15:47] haku: p50s. @Mirono_escooters shared it
[2024-01-06T22:16:15] Gabe Enzo: they had every chance to call it P45C
[2024-01-06T22:17:03] Gabe Enzo: smh
[2024-01-06T22:17:18] Yamal: The good thing about high discharge batteries for Xiaomi or G30 are "cheap" do they not have too many cells?
[2024-01-06T22:17:23] haku: to stretch your dollar on scooter parts. buy parts discounted unless needed
[2024-01-06T22:18:40] haku: cheap is good 😂 thats what into. i hate overpaying for stuff i know has generic parts
[2024-01-06T22:19:59] Yamal: Your battery is going to be big, right? 22s how many P
[2024-01-06T22:20:53] haku: 10p atleast. i think ill go with 20s for regen.
[2024-01-06T22:21:05] haku: i really like that feature
[2024-01-06T22:21:50] haku: maybe in the future ill do 22s when theres bigger spintend controllers. im still deciding honestly.
[2024-01-06T22:23:40] Yamal: 20s 10 p is my battery 🙏👍
[2024-01-06T22:23:44] Gabe Enzo: Idk what to do, might try salvage my 20s 4p and see if I can make it into like a 20s3p lmfao
[2024-01-06T22:23:47] Yamal: Also 40t
[2024-01-06T22:23:56] haku: nice
[2024-01-06T22:25:24] haku: i dont really care how fast i can go. i just want unlimited burnouts without messing up the motors/esc/battery
[2024-01-06T22:26:49] Yamal: I can't wait to hit the gas with the new battery! The top speed is very good! but the torque is what really makes you fall in love
[2024-01-06T22:27:31] haku: good thing your halls not working. thats +torque
[2024-01-06T22:28:20] haku: what bms?
[2024-01-06T22:28:44] Yamal: The problem is that I need to have a minimum speed, that is, the scooter is running to press the accelerator fully.
[2024-01-06T22:29:10] Yamal: 40A charging bms, free discharge
[2024-01-06T22:34:19] haku: i really want to bypass bms too but im too scared 😂
[2024-01-06T22:34:48] haku: aslong as theres temp sensors im sure it will be ok
[2024-01-06T22:35:38] Yamal: They say that most of the problems are in loading, not in downloading, but increasing security is always good.
[2024-01-06T22:38:25] Mirono escooters: That's a car..
[2024-01-06T22:39:08] Gabe Enzo: I got a crazy idea. 16s4p and 4s6p with 2600mah ninebot cells. I'm thinking if it would be theoretically possible to have them as one 20s.
[2024-01-06T22:39:26] Gabe Enzo: Daring
[2024-01-06T22:40:35] Gabe Enzo: I can't go to school on this fiido any longer dude. It's so daunting.
[2024-01-06T22:40:47] Gabe Enzo: Half an hour in the cold twice a day
[2024-01-06T22:41:18] haku: dude id rock a fiido all day baby
[2024-01-06T22:41:21] Gabe Enzo: FUCK It ima do it.
[2024-01-06T22:41:27] Gabe Enzo: 33kmh bro
[2024-01-06T22:41:44] haku: you can mod those to the gills
[2024-01-06T22:42:15] Gabe Enzo: Possible to mod it. but it's mom's.
[2024-01-06T22:42:20] haku: they even have ly 70h motors for those
[2024-01-06T22:47:01] haku: rich kids will buy it knowing most parts are from ali. im hoping the frame is solid atleast
[2024-01-06T22:48:26] Mirono escooters: Hope so for the money
[2024-01-06T22:54:19] haku: i think they said that for legal reasons. hehe
[2024-01-06T22:55:55] Gabe Enzo: 2k is a car but here we are
[2024-01-06T22:56:07] Gabe Enzo: And still less performance than a maxed out g30
[2024-01-06T22:59:43] haku: no idea. makes me want to check it out on CES. i want to go there juat for that
[2024-01-06T23:00:11] haku: they are advertising it racing against a sportscar
[2024-01-06T23:01:27] haku: anyways todays workout boys. barefoot back squats
[2024-01-06T23:14:40] Paolo ⁭: Come on bench it
[2024-01-06T23:19:49] haku: thats my weakest lift unfortunately😭
[2024-01-06T23:21:04] haku: im trying to do all barefoot from now on. im canceling lifters
[2024-01-06T23:38:46] Gabe Enzo: I do this when doing squats.
[2024-01-06T23:39:04] Gabe Enzo: 2x 10kg bells to failure squatting
[2024-01-06T23:39:59] haku: awsome. i dont want to rely on lifters. working on ankle mobility is good. it helps with my scooter stance 😂
[2024-01-06T23:40:25] haku: practicing for the french championship
[2024-01-06T23:41:41] haku: i will hand carry my scooter in the plane. need to be strong like bull
[2024-01-06T23:41:47] Gabe Enzo: I got a new idea for my temporary cell.
[2024-01-06T23:42:08] Gabe Enzo: dual 10s and 3s6p
[2024-01-06T23:42:14] Gabe Enzo: 10s+3s
[2024-01-06T23:42:17] Gabe Enzo: But high amps.
[2024-01-06T23:42:57] haku: aslong as it can do burnouts on demand. thats the most important
[2024-01-06T23:43:09] Gabe Enzo: Gets the girls watching.
[2024-01-06T23:43:46] Gabe Enzo: So do the muscles
[2024-01-06T23:43:48] Gabe Enzo: Heh
[2024-01-06T23:43:53] haku: 😭
[2024-01-06T23:46:23] Gabe Enzo: 800w at 2.4kw constant should do the trick heheheeh
[2024-01-06T23:46:30] Gabe Enzo: And thats constant
[2024-01-07T00:00:18] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2024-01-07T00:00:28] Mirono escooters: Here's a boring timelapse of me designing a simple Snsc stem
[2024-01-07T00:01:01] haku: what software is this?
[2024-01-07T00:01:56] haku: this is the stuff i want to learn. dam so good
[2024-01-07T00:03:54] Mirono escooters: SolidWorks
[2024-01-07T00:04:06] Mirono escooters: You can see where I paused I checked photos and drawings xD
[2024-01-07T00:04:32] haku: thats the $$$ software yea?
[2024-01-07T00:04:53] haku: can normal folks use it free?
[2024-01-07T00:08:30] Tommy ª: wait, 3d printer software needs money?
[2024-01-07T00:08:31] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-07T00:08:57] haku: im a noob. i have no idea 😂
[2024-01-07T00:14:37] Tommy ª: remember, the only printer i used is my stupid hp who fails a lot
[2024-01-07T00:18:18] haku: cannon printers. no way to manualy refill ink
[2024-01-07T00:21:29] haku: i need a printer that can print money 😁
[2024-01-07T00:21:54] haku: im in the fbi watchlist now
[2024-01-07T00:34:48] haku: dam my city doesnt have specialty bolt shop. im just gonna have to guess in aliexpress
[2024-01-07T00:37:57] Mirono escooters: Designing, yes.
[2024-01-07T00:38:06] Mirono escooters: Tis one of the spensive and complex
[2024-01-07T00:38:40] Tommy ª: casually i used my old used head gasket bolts from my car as axle, works nice
[2024-01-07T00:40:16] haku: nice lol. these are m12 bolts i believe. having a shop custom make one for me will cost $$. i want to be as thrifty as possible
[2024-01-07T00:41:35] haku: i also want to upgrade to hardened steel
[2024-01-07T00:43:29] haku: this one i need a custom longer one. can jcpcb do it?
[2024-01-07T00:44:18] Mirono escooters: Sure, but any shop can lathe that
[2024-01-07T00:44:31] Mirono escooters: And they only do alu xd
[2024-01-07T00:44:54] haku: i havent tried it yet. my bad. the scooter is taking most my time 😭
[2024-01-07T00:47:41] Gabe Enzo: Big day tmrw me thinks. Snapped the front extender also. One piece shouldn't take too long to print.
[2024-01-07T01:16:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't know if I can put this question here if can't please remove it
[2024-01-07T01:16:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: Anyone tried the proprietary flipky firmware escs?
[2024-01-07T01:17:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mKvA9lm
[2024-01-07T01:17:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: Like this one
[2024-01-07T01:19:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: Another question (this one is vesc related) anyone knows if is possible to use new key flipky 75100 ( https://a.aliexpress.com/_mqwvLIg) in dual motor and the slave esc be a normal one? If I turn the key does it cut the power of both? Or do I need both escs with key to archive that?
[2024-01-07T01:19:58] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Rogerio has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-07T01:20:36] Mirono escooters: Won't cut both
[2024-01-07T01:20:41] Mirono escooters: Both need key
[2024-01-07T01:41:03] Tommy ª: pov: you want temp sensor in your motor but you are poor as f***
[2024-01-07T01:41:13] Tommy ª: at least it works
[2024-01-07T03:16:59] sombre_enfant: Will cut through can
[2024-01-07T03:17:32] Tommy ª: i feel scammed
[2024-01-07T04:19:41] haku: checking out the makita shelf @jamessoderstrom
[2024-01-07T04:20:10] haku: looking for a grinder
[2024-01-07T04:21:30] haku: milwaukee has a bigger isle
[2024-01-07T04:21:31] haku: <photos/photo_12006@07-01-2024_04-21-31.jpg>
[2024-01-07T04:23:00] haku: <photos/photo_12007@07-01-2024_04-23-00.jpg>
[2024-01-07T04:48:12] haku: lame no metric tape measure.
[2024-01-07T04:48:13] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-07T12:39:35] Gabe Enzo: OK guys I took apart the pack and all the cells are equal..Pretty wierd. I assumed a pack would be dead but nope
[2024-01-07T12:40:04] Mirono escooters: From wich scoot or
[2024-01-07T12:40:09] Gabe Enzo: I used solder to wire up every series connection.
[2024-01-07T12:40:12] Gabe Enzo: back then
[2024-01-07T12:40:16] Gabe Enzo: Pro 2 dual 10s 20s
[2024-01-07T12:41:11] Mirono escooters: The merikan freedom is strong
[2024-01-07T12:41:30] Gabe Enzo: maybe resistance is the issue of the voltage drop. But it's weird cause when I fully charge it it drops to 81.8v.
[2024-01-07T12:41:53] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2024-01-07T12:42:05] Gabe Enzo: Could it be the cause?
[2024-01-07T12:42:45] Gabe Enzo: I'll use copper Strands on the series connections, solder them all up and see if it helps.
[2024-01-07T12:42:51] Mirono escooters: Problably not
[2024-01-07T12:43:46] Gabe Enzo: I'll test each 4p pack for a voltage drop
[2024-01-07T12:44:49] Gabe Enzo: if that's inconclusive I'll test every single cell individually. But first. Gotta do physics study for the exam in 3 days! The scooter project will be an evening reward.
[2024-01-07T12:45:07] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12008@07-01-2024_12-45-07.jpg>
[2024-01-07T12:46:23] Mirono escooters: XD have fun
[2024-01-07T14:15:25] Happy Giraffe: 4P at weaker 18650 cells not a lot if its a pro battery. Good for maybe 30A😅
[2024-01-07T14:16:13] Happy Giraffe: The filament alone costs arm and leg for those
[2024-01-07T14:17:21] Happy Giraffe: Get a corded grinder for 55$
[2024-01-07T14:18:04] Happy Giraffe: Tools business is extremely shady and they will scam your money. Look Project Farm and Torque Test Channel on youtube to avoid being scammed
[2024-01-07T14:22:57] Gabe Enzo: 30a is fine, can also drain 40a over cell specs.
[2024-01-07T15:04:15] Izuna 生活: I use 2k atm
[2024-01-07T15:16:02] Tommy ª: bruh im getting bored of the usb stops working randomly
[2024-01-07T15:16:15] Tommy ª: now i need to open the entire scooter for unplug the battery
[2024-01-07T15:17:15] Happy Giraffe: Then you just get lot of drop
[2024-01-07T15:17:39] Happy Giraffe: LG cells tend to drop lot usually
[2024-01-07T15:18:42] Tommy ª: i remember my lg g3 dropping from 4.0 to 3.5, lg is lg
[2024-01-07T15:27:25] Gabe Enzo: They drop at 10a.
[2024-01-07T15:27:36] Gabe Enzo: 2.5a each
[2024-01-07T15:28:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: U said that cote and @jamessoderstrom and @Mirono_escooters say that don't cut
[2024-01-07T15:29:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: That sucks
[2024-01-07T15:29:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: I wanted to have one with key and other normal
[2024-01-07T15:31:24] Gabe Enzo: Does the monorim brakę adapter work with the monorim 500w motor?
[2024-01-07T15:33:17] Mirono escooters: 2k???
[2024-01-07T15:33:37] Mirono escooters: And Tommy said above 470ohm, fuctup I used 1kohm and sometimes fucktup, with ebrake And you use 2?
[2024-01-07T15:33:53] Mirono escooters: Smart bms
[2024-01-07T16:13:02] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: or Y-cable and short it 😂
[2024-01-07T16:41:56] Izuna 生活: No, only when charging with 20A, but besides this no absolutely no issues.
[2024-01-07T16:42:43] haku: @Happy_Giraffe i found the correct pitch for my m12 bolt. aparently there are 2 pitches. 1.25 and 1.75 mine was 1.75.
[2024-01-07T16:44:03] haku: im kinda learning this metric madness now. pretty straight forward
[2024-01-07T16:48:43] Unknown: Is there alternative to the zero10x stem ? I heard the dt thunder 1 stem fits also
[2024-01-07T16:49:09] Mirono escooters: I have 470 ohm now. I report back later
[2024-01-07T16:49:16] Mirono escooters: If it's worse I need to open this whole scooter..😢
[2024-01-07T16:49:23] Mirono escooters: Rip silicon. It better work
[2024-01-07T17:23:27] Tommy ª: i use a m365, 1zuna uses a g30 also the og m365 has more impedance in the dash cable
[2024-01-07T17:52:15] Happy Giraffe: As expected
[2024-01-07T17:52:57] Face de Pin Sucé: My last little Foccer randomly died
[2024-01-07T17:53:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Worked well yesterday
[2024-01-07T17:53:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Now doesn't want to turn on
[2024-01-07T17:53:10] Face de Pin Sucé: <sticker>
[2024-01-07T17:53:30] Happy Giraffe: To be exact theres atleast 6 metric pitches for M12😂 but 1.75 and 1.25 most common ones
[2024-01-07T17:54:40] Face de Pin Sucé: What a shame, was very useful to run some tests on air
[2024-01-07T17:55:56] Tommy ª: how you kill that? 😭
[2024-01-07T18:01:01] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2024-01-07T18:01:11] Mirono escooters: Not the most reliable vescs
[2024-01-07T18:01:20] Tommy ª: what model?
[2024-01-07T18:01:35] Face de Pin Sucé: I didn't
[2024-01-07T18:01:45] Face de Pin Sucé: it stayed at the same place in same configuration
[2024-01-07T18:01:51] Face de Pin Sucé: turned it off yesterday
[2024-01-07T18:01:57] Face de Pin Sucé: doesn't want to turn on
[2024-01-07T18:02:57] Mirono escooters: I take donations for recycling

[2024-01-07T18:11:24] Unknown: So what do you suggest?
[2024-01-07T18:12:29] Mirono escooters: Not much left now, since I got a powerwall
[2024-01-07T18:14:03] Gabe Enzo: Kek i was about to say I wanted to buy them off you to make a power wall.
[2024-01-07T18:19:21] Mirono escooters: Go visit local bike shops and such. They have heaps of batts
[2024-01-07T18:19:23] Mirono escooters: That's what I do
[2024-01-07T18:21:47] Gabe Enzo: Really? where tf do they get them from
[2024-01-07T18:21:59] Gabe Enzo: Bike shops as in cycling bikes?
[2024-01-07T18:22:37] Mirono escooters: Ebike shops, with dead ebike battz
[2024-01-07T18:22:42] Mirono escooters: Ususally salvageable
[2024-01-07T18:47:51] Unknown: I thought It was short thank you for confirming it's just I need a new one cuze this is the state of the old one

[2024-01-07T19:04:03] Happy Giraffe: 150kg Mama sits on it to make it straight
[2024-01-07T19:06:31] Unknown: No I just need to smash it back on the car in 50kmh cuze that how it bent
[2024-01-07T19:06:55] Gabe Enzo: Use a stone

[2024-01-07T19:35:42] puneDir: Camera angle ruined the vid
[2024-01-07T19:38:53] haku: dont try this at home kids
[2024-01-07T19:39:04] puneDir: yeah
[2024-01-07T19:39:16] puneDir: btw i didnt hit anybody in this vid so nobody is harmed
[2024-01-07T19:39:38] puneDir: but 1.12 was close call

[2024-01-07T19:39:46] haku: but off camera yea? 😜
[2024-01-07T19:40:16] puneDir: Still no lol
[2024-01-07T19:40:36] haku: this is why scooter regulations coming boys.
[2024-01-07T19:40:51] puneDir: I was expecting it to snap to half in 0.6
[2024-01-07T19:40:56] puneDir: but even no cracks lol
[2024-01-07T19:41:00] puneDir: That was a nice jump
[2024-01-07T19:41:20] haku: just wear a helmet bro
[2024-01-07T19:41:40] puneDir: I do have Gloves + motorcycle helmet + some other gear
[2024-01-07T19:45:43] puneDir: Wish there was some good suspension like on the zero for g30
[2024-01-07T19:46:18] puneDir: This kind of jumping is impossible with g30
[2024-01-07T19:46:38] puneDir: G30 is like built for making 100+ on perfect road
[2024-01-07T19:48:18] Yamal: Does anyone know what type of electronics weped mounts now?
[2024-01-07T19:52:12] haku: ly motors or qs motor i think
[2024-01-07T19:52:35] haku: maybe fardriver or kellys
[2024-01-07T19:55:42] haku: sad sabvoton controllers died in 2023. no one want them anymore
[2024-01-07T19:57:51] Gabe Enzo: Powerwall on wheels.
[2024-01-07T20:04:05] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_12012@07-01-2024_20-04-05.jpg>
[2024-01-07T20:07:22] haku: btw i tried it @jamessoderstrom on stock petg settings turned out like crap.
[2024-01-07T20:07:47] haku: i have to do the settings that was said there
[2024-01-07T20:08:11] haku: not at all. its a good light difuser though
[2024-01-07T20:09:00] haku: whut. how?
[2024-01-07T20:12:02] Yamal: The new models I think they change..
[2024-01-07T20:13:12] Oreo huzky: What app?
[2024-01-07T20:17:04] Gabe Enzo: Todo baterias
[2024-01-07T20:22:15] Happy Giraffe: Bambu stock petg settings suck, you just cant print it at those speeds
[2024-01-07T20:23:05] haku: yea. from what i read go super slow for these transparent stuff.
[2024-01-07T20:23:17] haku: <photos/photo_11989@06-01-2024_01-28-38.jpg>
[2024-01-07T20:24:04] haku: i just dont know how to make a custom preset and dial in my settings
[2024-01-07T20:24:26] puneDir: I Want this so badly
[2024-01-07T20:26:46] Happy Giraffe: Speeds down to 1/3 of this and try again😂
[2024-01-07T20:27:11] Happy Giraffe: Also would not use that much fan
[2024-01-07T20:27:54] Happy Giraffe: Maybe 50% to try first. You must remember tho that small parts and bigger parts print differently due to less time spent by making each layer
[2024-01-07T20:28:14] haku: gotcha
[2024-01-07T20:29:10] haku: ill try both. this was a test print on stock petg preset. very disapointed with the results 😭
[2024-01-07T20:29:14] Happy Giraffe: Small parts with overhangs need more cooling than large ones. Big flat parts wont need any cooling at all
[2024-01-07T20:29:26] haku: i see.
[2024-01-07T22:05:24] Gabe Enzo: New Xbox having overheating issues.
[2024-01-07T22:10:36] NetworkDir: PS5 have a same problem
[2024-01-07T22:10:36] NetworkDir: lol
[2024-01-07T22:10:43] NetworkDir: Console bullshit
[2024-01-07T22:10:45] Happy Giraffe: Oof
[2024-01-07T22:10:51] NetworkDir: PC for ever
[2024-01-07T22:11:07] Happy Giraffe: My 8 years old GTX1070 slapping dat ass still with old thermal paste😂
[2024-01-07T22:29:19] Rose: Hey there Marcel, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-07T22:32:56] haku: too bad gta6 is console only. but i dont really play much games anymore.
[2024-01-07T22:33:13] haku: looks like @mrstealyogirI is preping for it
[2024-01-07T23:07:09] Mirono escooters: Anyone got experience with jlcpcb modelling, kinda hard stuff?
[2024-01-07T23:07:22] Mirono escooters: Since the things you can choose between are super simple "Coupling shaft" and such
[2024-01-07T23:07:28] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_12016@07-01-2024_23-07-28.jpg>

[2024-01-07T23:07:38] Mirono escooters: This is far from that So I wonder, if they even make that?
[2024-01-07T23:38:39] Mirono escooters: Or some other site who makes it? I think there was one. Forgot tho
[2024-01-07T23:39:32] Mirono escooters: YES PCBWAY
[2024-01-07T23:39:37] Mirono escooters: I should also upload it there
[2024-01-08T00:18:54] Unknown: For now console only probably be late by 2 years to PC
[2024-01-08T00:19:48] Gabe Enzo: This Xbox has lag issues but it isn't my internet. I believe it's a hardware problem
[2024-01-08T00:20:13] Gabe Enzo: My PS4 has no issues with internet lag. Every game on Xbox has internet lag. Totally unplayable. Lots of people say the same on Reddit.
[2024-01-08T00:21:04] Gabe Enzo: I'm unsure if the heat is making it do this.. Need more testing.
[2024-01-08T00:21:26] Unknown: Brother has PS5
[2024-01-08T00:21:36] Gabe Enzo: what about it
[2024-01-08T00:21:41] Unknown: I play vr sometimes
[2024-01-08T00:21:57] Unknown: Just shearing bro
[2024-01-08T00:22:02] Gabe Enzo: I hate vr
[2024-01-08T00:22:18] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2024-01-08T00:22:37] Unknown: I'm stuck with PS4 with no screen to play on hhh
[2024-01-08T00:23:01] Unknown: You didn't try or didn't try enough
[2024-01-08T00:35:36] Gabe Enzo: I tried
[2024-01-08T00:44:42] Happy Giraffe: Its about your screen latency and the refresh rate being lower
[2024-01-08T00:45:38] Gabe Enzo: Nah it's internet lag it's like an absolute lag spike
[2024-01-08T00:45:51] Gabe Enzo: Like I'm suddenly dead cause someone shoots me
[2024-01-08T00:45:56] Happy Giraffe: Non-OLED TV might have a response time of 20-30ms making it quite hard to play while monitor for pc easily does 3-5ms if its a good one
[2024-01-08T00:46:20] Gabe Enzo: I played with NAT settings I'll see if it works better now.
[2024-01-08T00:48:05] Gabe Enzo: it's 2000ms
[2024-01-08T00:48:07] Gabe Enzo: or more.
[2024-01-08T00:48:22] Gabe Enzo: I have 300mbps and 28 ping
[2024-01-08T00:57:18] Happy Giraffe: Thats 2 seconds if you do the math😂
[2024-01-08T00:57:58] Happy Giraffe: But anyway gamin monitor a must on new consoles when playing 144hz/fps
[2024-01-08T00:58:56] Gabe Enzo: It's longer.
[2024-01-08T00:59:08] Gabe Enzo: Yeah I'm getting a 144fps TV soon
[2024-01-08T00:59:14] Gabe Enzo: 4k
[2024-01-08T01:02:47] Happy Giraffe: If for gaming best to see that its proper one
[2024-01-08T01:21:24] haku: yes. same thing happened to red dead redemtion 2. but when it came on pc it had the best graphics
[2024-01-08T01:25:57] haku: but i played it on both xbox 1x and pc. one of the best games imo. story of murikan wild west
[2024-01-08T02:00:10] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/FWM7yGZDvbk?si=QVc6cGPMMh_GFedN
[2024-01-08T02:00:35] haku: are all italian girls like this? can you confirm @PaoloWu
[2024-01-08T03:24:54] Santiago: Nope
[2024-01-08T03:25:02] Santiago: Not only them
[2024-01-08T03:26:49] haku: these italian weightlifters are the best.
[2024-01-08T03:27:29] Santiago: Many other more not only Italians but yeah
[2024-01-08T03:27:38] Santiago: I like these too xD
[2024-01-08T03:27:53] Santiago: Only gym goers understand hahah
[2024-01-08T06:29:54] haku: im trying the transparent bambu settings from reddit. dam slow. a 15min print is 2hr long
[2024-01-08T06:30:08] haku: <video_file>
[2024-01-08T07:14:21] haku: imagine printing battery holders on this speed. it will take a day to make a 20s.
[2024-01-08T07:15:19] haku: its looking okay so far.
[2024-01-08T08:19:56] haku: dam printing this metric bolt measurer will take a day. 15 infill
[2024-01-08T09:09:49] haku: bro this is pretty clear.

[2024-01-08T09:10:24] haku: some plastic polish and this will look like glass
[2024-01-08T09:22:58] haku: left is generic petg right is custom
[2024-01-08T09:31:53] haku: now i need stl for 20s10p 21700 holders
[2024-01-08T09:32:35] haku: it will take a few days to print but worth it imo
[2024-01-08T10:00:06] Unknown: We are not friends anymore because you are an Xbox fan hahah
[2024-01-08T10:13:57] Mirono escooters: Waa das pretty cool
[2024-01-08T10:14:11] Mirono escooters: Wich filament is that
[2024-01-08T10:14:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why guess?
[2024-01-08T10:20:05] Happy Giraffe: What settings?
[2024-01-08T10:59:13] Face de Pin Sucé: QS for big Sonic Weped Fardriver for all controllers since mid 2023 around
[2024-01-08T11:00:28] Yamal: What is QS?
[2024-01-08T11:10:17] Mirono escooters: Motor brand
[2024-01-08T11:11:45] Yamal: Ah ok and far driver
[2024-01-08T11:11:59] Yamal: Is one type controller?
[2024-01-08T11:17:43] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-01-08T11:17:57] Yamal: BLDC?
[2024-01-08T11:18:05] Mirono escooters: 🤷 shitty one
[2024-01-08T11:25:19] Yamal: I really don't know what the scooter companies are waiting for to mount Vesc electronics on their electric scooters, they would gain smoothness in their vehicles, energy efficiency and of course more discharge power with less space, they would just have to take the temperature issue with "tweezers" I think..., but at the same time with an unlimited range of programming
[2024-01-08T11:30:16] haku: overture petg
[2024-01-08T11:32:05] haku: super slow settings like you said 13mms
[2024-01-08T11:32:21] Mirono escooters: €€€ is the answer.
[2024-01-08T11:32:35] Mirono escooters: Bldc controllers cost a fraction of vesc And way easier, no config issue, plug play
[2024-01-08T11:32:53] Face de Pin Sucé: exactly
[2024-01-08T11:36:33] haku: and they charge an arm and a leg for thier scooters knowing it generic parts for china. i can do that to my laotie too haha
[2024-01-08T11:52:57] Gabe Enzo: I'm trying to change that in the future.
[2024-01-08T11:53:22] Gabe Enzo: they charge an arm a leg for which they could easily install vesc with.
[2024-01-08T11:53:35] Gabe Enzo: Profit and greed too much.
[2024-01-08T11:57:12] haku: this is exactly what i mean by expensive scooter brands. all the same crap components from china. i rather build my own with that money and hand pick the parts.
[2024-01-08T11:57:39] haku: you really are just paying for the frame
[2024-01-08T11:58:11] Gabe Enzo: The frames are so bad dude
[2024-01-08T11:58:15] Gabe Enzo: The motor is the only thing
[2024-01-08T11:59:18] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12025@08-01-2024_11-59-18.jpg>
[2024-01-08T12:01:39] Gabe Enzo: Getting the day started
[2024-01-08T12:01:45] haku: milk and tea or bailys?
[2024-01-08T12:01:55] Gabe Enzo: Espresso shot with a tad bit milk.
[2024-01-08T12:03:20] haku: in the uk you drink milk and tea right? odd combination 😂
[2024-01-08T12:04:06] Gabe Enzo: In Ireland we do that too. Yes it's an odd combo but black tea, milk and alot of sugar tastes like liquid caramel. Something to die for.
[2024-01-08T12:04:35] Gabe Enzo: Try it, 3 teaspoons or more.
[2024-01-08T12:04:43] haku: ill try that sounds good. kinda like thai tea
[2024-01-08T12:07:25] Happy Giraffe: 13?😂😅
[2024-01-08T12:07:41] haku: yes lol
[2024-01-08T12:07:44] Happy Giraffe: Damn, glad it worked lmao
[2024-01-08T12:07:50] Happy Giraffe: I told 1/3😂
[2024-01-08T12:09:11] Happy Giraffe: Next time I say one third of an inch😂
[2024-01-08T12:11:50] haku: im printing test holders right now 2s6p and its 9hrs long 😭
[2024-01-08T12:12:49] haku: buy a fast printer and use the slowest speed haha
[2024-01-08T12:19:22] Gabe Enzo: Not my business but why not just hot glue them all together and forget holders?
[2024-01-08T12:24:39] Gabe Enzo: think I asked you this before
[2024-01-08T12:30:01] Mirono escooters: It's 12💀
[2024-01-08T12:30:24] Mirono escooters: Got time
[2024-01-08T12:30:46] Mirono escooters: Holders preferred
[2024-01-08T12:34:11] Gabe Enzo: Got an electrical exam tomorrow at 9am 💀😘
[2024-01-08T13:17:27] Face de Pin Sucé: but why do you need it to be transparent ? x)
[2024-01-08T13:25:40] haku: i like it 😂.
[2024-01-08T14:49:49] haku: i will if i have to but not use hot glue. if really limited on space.
[2024-01-08T14:58:37] Rose: Hey there Nandinho, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-08T15:20:07] Rose: Hey there Ninebotextreme, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-08T15:20:49] Happy Giraffe: Should use QS90 belt drive haha😂
[2024-01-08T15:21:17] Happy Giraffe: Actually wouldnt overheat and weigh way less
[2024-01-08T15:51:08] Gabe Enzo: Guys if 4 Cells are in parallel then what happens to the internal Resistance? I have 4x LG cells and my device shows 10 m Ohm resistance.
[2024-01-08T15:51:55] Gabe Enzo: second batch shows 74mohms
[2024-01-08T15:52:00] Gabe Enzo: Hmmm
[2024-01-08T15:54:42] Gabe Enzo: The resistance should be 2.5milliohms if 4x 10mohm cells are in parallel according to my calculator
[2024-01-08T15:54:43] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-08T16:00:13] Izuna 生活: Escooter knowledge comes in handy for school too, listed can-bus and was the only one who knew one. Too bad I didn't remember RS4??
[2024-01-08T16:00:33] Izuna 生活: my first thought was UART, but that counts as protocol
[2024-01-08T16:12:55] NetworkDir: Display time :)
[2024-01-08T16:13:07] NetworkDir: Looks simple and modern
[2024-01-08T16:13:09] NetworkDir: i like it
[2024-01-08T16:17:47] Gabe Enzo: I took all of them apart.
[2024-01-08T16:17:55] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12028@08-01-2024_16-17-55.jpg>
[2024-01-08T16:19:17] NetworkDir: the github version works with esp32 + ili9341 https://github.com/Gh0513d/SVD but i modify tft-espi library now works with esp32-2432S028 (bigger display and esp32 built-in)
[2024-01-08T16:19:18] Mirono escooters: Having fun
[2024-01-08T16:19:49] NetworkDir: <files/TFT_eSPI.zip>
[2024-01-08T16:20:04] Gabe Enzo: Oddly satisfying.
[2024-01-08T16:56:02] Gabe Enzo: So hot.
[2024-01-08T16:56:22] Gabe Enzo: think I have a cell fetish
[2024-01-08T16:58:26] Mirono escooters: Does look good
[2024-01-08T17:01:06] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_12030@08-01-2024_17-01-06.jpg>
[2024-01-08T17:01:19] Mirono escooters: I like
[2024-01-08T17:01:46] Gabe Enzo: Oh god
[2024-01-08T17:02:32] Gabe Enzo: I know it's not accurate but most show as 30mohm and some shows 100 so I "know" those are dead dead
[2024-01-08T17:02:55] Gabe Enzo: I can weed out the worst ones even tho this machine isn't too good
[2024-01-08T17:03:52] Gabe Enzo: All of the good ones show 30-35ohm on the dot. they seemed to have aged identically
[2024-01-08T18:31:09] Mirono escooters: Don't even bother with testing IR like that
[2024-01-08T18:31:14] Mirono escooters: 20€ meter, tsjop tsjop
[2024-01-08T18:44:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Never saw audi version irl ,what you bought?
[2024-01-08T18:46:10] Mirono escooters: Audi version And I transport fuel for fire in workroom
[2024-01-08T18:47:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fuel? Like what oil?
[2024-01-08T18:48:00] Yamal: Is like palm oil..
[2024-01-08T18:48:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Explain what heater is that
[2024-01-08T18:48:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This drop tech ?
[2024-01-08T18:49:38] Gabe Enzo: I think every single cell is good....
[2024-01-08T18:49:55] Gabe Enzo: The issue was the solder
[2024-01-08T18:52:04] Yamal: It could also be gazpacho..
[2024-01-08T18:55:06] Gabe Enzo: I'm gonna get a car battery and weld them all up.
[2024-01-08T19:19:41] Gabe Enzo: 20s4p no extender pro 2 👀👀
[2024-01-08T19:20:30] Mirono escooters: You do know the slot to slide it in is thinner then the space below
[2024-01-08T19:20:50] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_12033@08-01-2024_19-20-50.jpg>
[2024-01-08T19:20:55] Mirono escooters: Or you can't lift it out or in
[2024-01-08T19:23:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True true ,also no bms for now and that also eats some area
[2024-01-08T19:24:00] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2024-01-08T19:29:57] Gabe Enzo: OOPS
[2024-01-08T19:29:59] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2024-01-08T19:55:20] haku: cell fetish you say? i have a hoarding problem
[2024-01-08T19:56:08] Gabe Enzo: Cell whore
[2024-01-08T19:56:22] Mirono escooters: : D
[2024-01-08T19:56:35] haku: what is that sir?
[2024-01-08T19:57:07] NetworkDir: Simple vesc display with esp32
[2024-01-08T19:57:19] NetworkDir: You can find with seraching "esp32-2432S028" name in google.com
[2024-01-08T19:57:29] NetworkDir: https://www.google.com/search?q=esp32-2432S028
[2024-01-08T19:58:08] Mirono escooters: I found 0.2€ per cell locally, I'm gonna get some But let's go offtopic
[2024-01-08T20:00:06] haku: is it plug and play or do you need wizarding coding skills?
[2024-01-08T20:00:29] haku: thanks for the link.
[2024-01-08T20:01:15] NetworkDir: the code avaliable you should flash just. but now i just test display in coming week i test with real vesc
[2024-01-08T20:06:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is what i was going to ask ,how good is that Before some goes after you, also do you or does it have some sort of housing?
[2024-01-08T20:08:55] NetworkDir: What
[2024-01-08T20:10:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How good is that? Does it work? Does it have housing? or it will be floating in the air in wires as wind blows by the speed
[2024-01-08T20:11:54] NetworkDir: The design looks good and simple modern it's work but for sure i test and say results in group for wires and .. in thingiverse 3d moderns avaliable for esp32-2432S028
[2024-01-08T20:12:30] NetworkDir: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5680106 https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5905855 https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6308391
[2024-01-08T20:14:27] haku: please keep updating us on this. very cool
[2024-01-08T20:14:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice
[2024-01-08T20:14:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Agreed
[2024-01-08T20:18:33] haku: wow its still printing
[2024-01-08T20:33:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way its normal ,does it give you predicted print time before print? Coz that layer % doesnt tell you all
[2024-01-08T20:34:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like not all layers take same due printers movement ,so some takes a sec ,some minutes,so cant rely on that
[2024-01-08T20:34:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But also predicted times are usually less than reality
[2024-01-08T20:41:23] haku: yes. im testing these new filament preset and see how it looks like 😂
[2024-01-08T21:14:54] sombre_enfant: Anybody know wich hydro hose crimp is needed ? The bh59 or bh90 for zoom nutt and shimano ?
[2024-01-08T22:15:44] haku: 11hrs and these look like ass
[2024-01-08T22:15:45] haku: <photos/photo_12038@08-01-2024_22-15-45.jpg>
[2024-01-08T22:23:32] Mirono escooters: No
[2024-01-08T22:23:45] Mirono escooters: Samsung 26fm Have to remove from pack, but ez
[2024-01-08T22:24:21] NetworkDir: poor cells but 0.2 eur nice
[2024-01-08T22:31:21] Mirono escooters: Their only purpose, yep
[2024-01-08T22:31:29] Mirono escooters: And I have time to dissasemble
[2024-01-08T22:32:09] Mirono escooters: I prefer same cells for 1 whole powerwall pack, instead of mix and match xD
[2024-01-08T22:32:35] Mirono escooters: So I just make a lot of smaller same cell packs Fail? Remove and continue Vs 80p dissasemble 😂
[2024-01-08T23:51:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe you need more retraction with this material
[2024-01-08T23:53:17] Happy Giraffe: petg prints good 60-120 mm/s
[2024-01-08T23:53:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pla was smooth for me but petg needed lot adjusting,but really up to machine,so same as mine probably wont work
[2024-01-08T23:53:27] Happy Giraffe: you dont have to go granny speed
[2024-01-08T23:53:48] Mirono escooters: And dry
[2024-01-08T23:54:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also ,but you guys have more experience
[2024-01-08T23:54:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont 😁 just saw some before and learnt
[2024-01-08T23:54:51] Happy Giraffe: @Bradhaku Making it more complicated than it needs to xd
[2024-01-08T23:55:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Will take a look on this too
[2024-01-08T23:55:41] haku: yes the settings are all messed up. have to figure this out. this is my custom preset 😂
[2024-01-08T23:58:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also not all slicers define all speeds Just like default printing speed is x than you give % for Outline underspeed Solid infill underspeed Support underspeed
[2024-01-08T23:59:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What slicer u use?
[2024-01-08T23:59:31] Happy Giraffe: Cura, basic but works
[2024-01-08T23:59:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont use that
[2024-01-09T00:00:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But will try just have to make new win coz this old and cura works from win10
[2024-01-09T00:00:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: While payed ones work on any
[2024-01-09T00:01:14] Happy Giraffe: just get windows 10 ISO on a USB stick and use that
[2024-01-09T00:01:21] Happy Giraffe: dont even need to activate it
[2024-01-09T00:01:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am just renewing my pc partly
[2024-01-09T00:01:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So till than i dont use it
[2024-01-09T00:02:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Simplify3d knows a lot But needs more knowledge
[2024-01-09T00:03:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And i dont have newest , thats Pretty good also
[2024-01-09T00:03:02] Happy Giraffe: What slicer you use?
[2024-01-09T00:03:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just said it🙈🙈🙈
[2024-01-09T00:03:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Biggest payed slicer is simplify 3d bro
[2024-01-09T00:03:33] Happy Giraffe: havent heard of it being even a slicer 😆
[2024-01-09T00:03:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz you new school
[2024-01-09T00:04:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also this is not free
[2024-01-09T00:05:02] Happy Giraffe: Simplify seems not to be used by community, has slow and out-of date updates idk if even has plugins😅 Just use Cura, better
[2024-01-09T00:05:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ppl and money spending on programs not too easy
[2024-01-09T00:05:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: New version just came out bro
[2024-01-09T00:05:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cura is nice
[2024-01-09T00:06:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ans also something what is free is better for a newbie , simplify needs knowledge
[2024-01-09T00:06:43] Happy Giraffe: yeah next comes out 2028 in this fashion xd
[2024-01-09T00:07:40] Happy Giraffe: Prusa, Cura, Bambu etc is pro stuff if used in that manner😅 Plugins etc you could do anything you want with it
[2024-01-09T00:09:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Non of them knows all what new simplify does however you want to tell me
[2024-01-09T00:10:11] Happy Giraffe: ok😁
[2024-01-09T00:10:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bro
[2024-01-09T00:10:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cura is free shit
[2024-01-09T00:11:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is reason why simplify new starts at 210€
[2024-01-09T00:12:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Older also knows a lot but that you can crack if you have brain for it
[2024-01-09T00:31:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Check video on YT from new and news knowledge and why and the how But imagine Can they sell something for that price while 4 others does that for free ,i dont thinks so and this was always payed 🤷‍♂
[2024-01-09T00:52:18] haku: @Happy_Giraffe what the difference between .3mf, .stl and .RAR files. and are these safe to DL
[2024-01-09T00:54:47] haku: gotcha thanks. im kinda paranoid DL these sometimes
[2024-01-09T00:55:29] haku: a big black cock might pop out of my screen and say got you nigga!
[2024-01-09T00:56:04] haku: i see. no malicious stuff?
[2024-01-09T00:57:02] haku: thanks bud
[2024-01-09T00:57:26] haku: its mostly from thingiverse and the bambu app
[2024-01-09T03:18:33] Happy Giraffe: Yeah popular stuff usually safe but you never know from sure. Usually viruses etc spread by other ways
[2024-01-09T04:18:19] haku: there is a difference in print quality with custom trans petg and generic petg. fun experimenting with these filaments 😂
[2024-01-09T04:18:20] haku: <photos/photo_12040@09-01-2024_04-18-20.jpg>
[2024-01-09T04:18:49] haku: not fully transparent though. i want glass like if thats even possible
[2024-01-09T04:33:19] haku: too brittle or not enough material.
[2024-01-09T05:04:13] haku: america a throw away and not fix it society. if i only had skills i will take this home
[2024-01-09T06:03:07] Happy Giraffe: Too cold and too fast also possibility
[2024-01-09T06:03:39] Happy Giraffe: Sometimes they tell you an error code, google and swap new part😂
[2024-01-09T06:05:01] haku: yea right. its just unfortunate that this is going to the landfill and not fixed. also lots of parts on ali
[2024-01-09T06:06:52] haku: ive seen really neat stuff just thrown out from the neighborhood. if i had the space i take them all 😂
[2024-01-09T06:08:28] haku: if i also have knowledge to fix things
[2024-01-09T07:05:06] Happy Giraffe: If error code then easy
[2024-01-09T07:07:06] haku: i have this ali infared thermometer. does anyone know how to calibrate it? i threw away the imstructions 😂
[2024-01-09T07:07:56] haku: it kinda sucks at measuring temp. its off by -7
[2024-01-09T07:14:34] haku: also @Happy_Giraffe this is how you measure bolt width right? just bellow the head?
[2024-01-09T07:39:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Go back to link where you bought it scroll till you dont see description in top menü or sometimes its directly under ,or write the shop and they send you digitaly
[2024-01-09T07:39:57] haku: i forgot where i got this. either bangood or ali. maybe amazon 😂
[2024-01-09T07:40:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's seconds to search
[2024-01-09T07:44:32] Happy Giraffe: M12 thread means 12mm thread diameter. The smooth part size could vary tiny bit but should be around 11.9-11.95mm
[2024-01-09T07:45:10] Happy Giraffe: Dont get confused if its 0.1mm off as they need tolerances in order to fit
[2024-01-09T08:00:55] Happy Giraffe: Tutustu tähän: Camcut https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.camcut.app
[2024-01-09T08:01:29] Happy Giraffe: This is a nice app where you find everything
[2024-01-09T08:03:53] haku: is 304 ss steel stronger than 303?
[2024-01-09T08:05:17] haku: i need someone to lathe this into this

[2024-01-09T13:18:32] Gabe Enzo: me making a Powerwall over the summer.
[2024-01-09T13:18:43] Gabe Enzo: But with new cells.
[2024-01-09T13:19:33] Gabe Enzo: No money for heating the house. So I'm only gonna wire it up to my room. Cause I'm always in there. 3-7kwh would be nice Two 400w turbines to take advantage of the Irish wind.
[2024-01-09T13:36:09] Gabe Enzo: Good candidate. 4.5kwh for only 700€. Would buy rn if I wasn't in another project
[2024-01-09T13:39:35] Mirono escooters: Prod date old, check IR
[2024-01-09T13:59:26] haku: im obsessed with this tramsparent filament. now i have a metric ruler 😂
[2024-01-09T14:08:42] Gabe Enzo: Buying this tomorrow.
[2024-01-09T14:08:59] Gabe Enzo: There's no such thing as a fake welder no? Imagine..
[2024-01-09T14:31:15] Gabe Enzo: 0.3mm pure nickel welding seems sus. if logically copper takes 4x more energy then this can only weld 25% of 0.3mm in copper form aka 0.075mm?
[2024-01-09T14:31:15] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-09T14:31:44] Finn: Why no lipo arduino spotwelder
[2024-01-09T14:32:24] Mirono escooters: This apperantly super stronk capacitor
[2024-01-09T14:32:49] Mirono escooters: I stay with kweld
[2024-01-09T14:33:54] Gabe Enzo: Because it's in one piece and for the same price around.
[2024-01-09T14:34:24] Gabe Enzo: @lBabacar thoughts? you used this welder for 0.1mm or 0.15mm copper? I'm gonna be using the entire 26kw of the molicel so I can't have room for error Idk if 0.1mm is even enough for so many amps
[2024-01-09T14:35:15] Mirono escooters: It's time for copper sandwich, the good ol reliable method
[2024-01-09T14:35:39] Gabe Enzo: @kawaiinekololis did you use 0.15mm?
[2024-01-09T14:35:51] Gabe Enzo: Sounds tasty
[2024-01-09T14:55:39] Mirono escooters: defenitely

[2024-01-09T16:41:15] sombre_enfant: Didnt bought yet
[2024-01-09T16:42:36] Mirono escooters: Are you accoustic
[2024-01-09T16:42:48] Mario: I have a 71500 VESC, instead of a linear throttle, I want off being 0 and on being 100% as in a button (it's to turn on and off a fan blade. I'm not sure how to wire this. Anyone have any insight?
[2024-01-09T16:43:19] Finn: <photos/photo_12055@09-01-2024_16-43-19.jpg>
[2024-01-09T16:43:20] Finn: Done
[2024-01-09T16:43:33] Mirono escooters: Lovely
[2024-01-09T16:43:43] Mirono escooters: Holes still allign?
[2024-01-09T16:43:46] sombre_enfant: Wow nice
[2024-01-09T16:44:34] sombre_enfant: Omg fan is prohibed
[2024-01-09T16:44:57] Mario: I'm not sure what you mean?
[2024-01-09T16:45:13] Mario: It's for a lawn mower blade.
[2024-01-09T16:46:12] Mario: I'm replacing the broken ESC that is on my electric mower with a 75100 VESC
[2024-01-09T16:47:07] Mario: I've had countless people confirm this is the correct approach, I'm just trying to figure out how to wire in the throttle for it.
[2024-01-09T16:48:37] sombre_enfant: Shunt red to white with a resistor
[2024-01-09T16:49:51] Finn: Yes
[2024-01-09T16:50:09] Finn: Had the motor in for welding the outside fork
[2024-01-09T16:52:02] Finn: Dual wll be fun
[2024-01-09T16:58:31] Oreo huzky: Autistic i would say
[2024-01-09T16:59:11] Mario: I'm assuming a 10k? Thank you.
[2024-01-09T17:02:21] Gabe Enzo: VESC MOWER LOL
[2024-01-09T17:02:35] Gabe Enzo: that's awesome
[2024-01-09T17:03:19] Mirono escooters: It's a meme
[2024-01-09T17:03:26] Mirono escooters: Instant ban
[2024-01-09T17:04:23] Gabe Enzo: Then maybe I don't know if it's good.
[2024-01-09T17:04:54] Gabe Enzo: What's going on here wtf???
[2024-01-09T17:06:54] Finn: Soo
[2024-01-09T17:07:10] Finn: On the xiaomi 1s the rear motor doesnt fit with the break cover
[2024-01-09T17:07:22] Finn: So i need to extend the arm to make it fit
[2024-01-09T17:07:29] Finn: Its getting dual motor😂
[2024-01-09T17:08:38] Gabe Enzo: You won't have front brakes either.
[2024-01-09T17:08:46] Gabe Enzo: U high?
[2024-01-09T17:08:58] Mirono escooters: High im miro
[2024-01-09T17:09:16] Finn: What?
[2024-01-09T17:09:16] Finn: I will only have rear breaks and e brake
[2024-01-09T17:09:45] Mario: Functionally, it's basically the same principle right? It's an electric motor that needs to be controlled, I just want mine to run at a specific speed when running.
[2024-01-09T17:09:45] Gabe Enzo: What are you planning with this dual thing. This used to be my first idea before I got into big stuff.
[2024-01-09T17:10:05] Gabe Enzo: You need 2x 300w to break 70 with low heat, and even then it'll blow.
[2024-01-09T17:10:12] Gabe Enzo: @KenLawrence done it.
[2024-01-09T17:10:39] Gabe Enzo: He's why I got into scooters
[2024-01-09T17:10:53] Finn: Yes okay
[2024-01-09T17:10:58] Finn: <photos/photo_12056@09-01-2024_17-10-58.jpg>
[2024-01-09T17:11:03] Gabe Enzo: What voltage are you gonna be using?
[2024-01-09T17:11:07] Finn: 20s
[2024-01-09T17:11:14] Finn: It will be fun
[2024-01-09T17:11:23] Unknown: Put a thumb throttle on it. Then you can run cruise control 🔥❤️
[2024-01-09T17:11:42] Gabe Enzo: Yeah it is even with a single 300w at dual cell pro 2 20s
[2024-01-09T17:11:50] Gabe Enzo: I broke 70 kmh and I'm 67kg
[2024-01-09T17:12:07] Gabe Enzo: I had the sannio setup
[2024-01-09T17:12:10] Finn: What are you trying to tell me
[2024-01-09T17:12:21] Gabe Enzo: Hmm? just making conversation.
[2024-01-09T17:12:24] Finn: No physical breaks are better then only electric break
[2024-01-09T17:12:27] Finn: Ah okay
[2024-01-09T17:13:17] Finn: <photos/photo_12057@09-01-2024_17-13-17.jpg>

[2024-01-09T17:13:59] puneDir: How strong is it
[2024-01-09T17:14:05] Finn: Idk
[2024-01-09T17:14:17] Mario: lol, there must be an easy way, someone else also told me to "the best approach will be to use the ADC App, put a pulldown resistor to ground on the ADC input, and then connect the switch (assuming normally open) to the ADC pin and 3.3V."
[2024-01-09T17:14:18] Finn: <video_file>
[2024-01-09T17:14:33] Mario: I just wasn't sure exactly how to wire that in, but I'm getting there.
[2024-01-09T17:15:30] puneDir: Nice job
[2024-01-09T17:17:03] Gabe Enzo: How did u get it

[2024-01-09T17:20:12] Finn: <video_file>
[2024-01-09T17:38:23] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom I need your opinion on the welder
[2024-01-09T17:39:23] sombre_enfant: Its alright for 0.1 copper + 0.15 nickel tab
[2024-01-09T17:39:57] haku: guys glitter 811 is the welder that can do copper 801 im not sure. just get a kweld if you are not getting 811
[2024-01-09T17:40:00] Finn: You think it doesnt hold?
[2024-01-09T17:40:08] Mirono escooters: No, I didn't say that
[2024-01-09T17:40:12] Mirono escooters: It was joke
[2024-01-09T17:40:16] Gabe Enzo: It's 12kW. @LizardDoggo

[2024-01-09T17:40:39] Finn: 400A aluminium welder
[2024-01-09T17:41:02] sombre_enfant: Way too powerfull for li ion battery
[2024-01-09T17:41:04] haku: my son is one and he loves legos
[2024-01-09T17:41:22] Paolo ⁭: No
[2024-01-09T17:41:33] Mirono escooters: Can it be too powerful: D
[2024-01-09T17:41:48] Paolo ⁭: Current is adjustable
[2024-01-09T17:42:27] sombre_enfant: Bro what kind of kush u was on for building the battery i buy i need the same

[2024-01-09T17:44:24] Gabe Enzo: I'll check the price of the K weld
[2024-01-09T17:44:34] Gabe Enzo: didn't know choosing a spot welder is so confusing.
[2024-01-09T17:44:55] Gabe Enzo: Imagine I buy one and it doesn't work with copper. I'd rope myself with an AC power cord.
[2024-01-09T17:45:49] Oreo huzky: Same
[2024-01-09T17:46:14] haku: thats exaxtly what i want to do but extend the forks to 160mm
[2024-01-09T17:46:53] Finn: The scooter doesnt have a serialnumber etc
[2024-01-09T17:47:06] Finn: Its just a fun scooter to trash if something fails
[2024-01-09T17:47:19] Finn: If the fork breaks etc i dont really care
[2024-01-09T17:47:49] Gabe Enzo: Give me
[2024-01-09T17:47:57] Finn: Nah

[2024-01-09T18:12:06] Gabe Enzo: Just finding out now that the lipos I impaled for fun in August could've been used to weld. Off to buy more lipos I guess
[2024-01-09T18:12:16] Gabe Enzo: Thought I'd never have a use for them. Here we are
[2024-01-09T20:00:01] sombre_enfant: @mrstealyogirI ima buy it tomorow, i got the breed from my old company i quit

[2024-01-09T23:34:43] haku: dam thats crazy. this is why sometimes im scared to f around with batteries. i have to make sure and ask permission from vesclords if what im doimg is okay
[2024-01-09T23:34:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Car paints dry on 50-70 c
[2024-01-09T23:36:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well keep them safe , all in boxes so non can be touched by some who just plays with also you cant step on it if its not on the ground But there are lot of facts🤷‍♂

[2024-01-09T23:37:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅 i mean we shooted in then with air rifle ,they even opened up no fire nothing 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
[2024-01-09T23:37:47] haku: depends on the build though. there is a youtuber drama right now because his molicels caught on fire
[2024-01-09T23:38:06] haku: in the US.
[2024-01-09T23:38:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lot ppl make fire and such coz they dont know what they play with ,how to handle etc

[2024-01-09T23:40:22] haku: and it was his customers battery
[2024-01-09T23:40:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a tiny way this story reminds of the guy who sued tesla coz he made an accident and he said he felt a sleep coz new car smell😏

[2024-01-09T23:41:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wonder why he ended up like that
[2024-01-09T23:41:22] haku: i think he also built it in a snaking pattern
[2024-01-09T23:42:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe in archive we have how to diy battery book
[2024-01-09T23:42:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Really

[2024-01-09T23:43:40] haku: i saw the burned battery but it was taken down
[2024-01-09T23:43:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i liked the fella tbh
[2024-01-09T23:44:43] haku: yea i like him too. very family guy but selling dangerous stuff is a different story even if his trying to make ends meet
[2024-01-09T23:45:22] haku: he built a jank 100mph mtb. thats a record mtb in the us.
[2024-01-09T23:46:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well now i know and so some of his "work" i think non of us would even try to do such
[2024-01-09T23:46:37] haku: ive been following him even before that. i really like his determination. but knowledge is not there
[2024-01-09T23:46:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fuck i dont find the book where i saw that 🤔🤔🤔 should send to him
[2024-01-09T23:47:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I can agree
[2024-01-09T23:47:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not just for trolling
[2024-01-09T23:47:44] haku: i was almost close to building a battery like his. no bms and all his methods. phew
[2024-01-09T23:47:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But some % is that from 100%
[2024-01-09T23:48:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But also moli or any see soldering like that and closes the door

[2024-01-09T23:50:39] Rogerio Figueiredo: With vesc?
[2024-01-09T23:50:39] haku: battery building really is all knowledge and some $$ involved
[2024-01-09T23:50:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: How you make the brakes work?
[2024-01-09T23:50:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never done such ,i would say ok on it if 1-2 cell for some outside lights
[2024-01-09T23:52:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i have some of the tools to make batts ,but i have great builder who does decent job and saves time for me
[2024-01-09T23:53:10] haku: very lucky. good builders here cost $$. and they dont even use copper sometimes
[2024-01-09T23:53:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I could probably learn ,but dang another shit to bug with ,get tools etc Kinda have enough shit what i do
[2024-01-09T23:53:46] haku: very few private builders use copper. but big vendors still use nickel on high powered packs
[2024-01-09T23:53:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Copper is needed for high end stuff
[2024-01-09T23:54:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They will never use copper in does , also some i would say does a shit job
[2024-01-09T23:55:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like old mantis battery inside is a mess for me, half cells turned and not really fixed
[2024-01-09T23:57:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In my point view fixing thing to be stabil is a must, i was jumping so much with one of my ex scooters when took it to parts after 1,5 year all was like when installed it ,the Outside and the inside
[2024-01-09T23:57:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also pack used out 1/3 of batts knowledge
[2024-01-09T23:58:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In audio world i did Always similar , big power amp with lower knowledge sub ,so if shit happens sub dies not the amp
[2024-01-09T23:59:15] haku: i also want to learn cnc and welding someday. make things from scratch
[2024-01-09T23:59:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In the other way around all shit is in struggle all time ,this what i mean
[2024-01-10T00:02:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,i may said this already,but i respect Happy for doing that ,we are friends like for years now And he totally comes from different area in life But now i really enjoy seeing what he learns and does

[2024-01-10T00:30:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This sometimes happens with James also ,i think i run into it once🤷‍♂
[2024-01-10T00:31:09] haku: today it keeps happening
[2024-01-10T00:31:36] haku: ill try to uninstall and install

[2024-01-10T00:36:45] haku: ill try that if this still bad
[2024-01-10T00:37:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Matrix always does glitch
[2024-01-10T00:41:11] Tommy ª: actually a friend helped me with that, also i recommend to wait to get the 6.05 stable bc there is some glitches
[2024-01-10T00:41:37] Tommy ª: casually im going to make another mod for front light and rear light + brake light (individually)
[2024-01-10T01:43:22] Mario: Yes, I did post it on Facebook. I finally got the VESC and I'm starting to get to the point of install. I just wanted to collect as much info before I start.
[2024-01-10T01:56:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: I can't have the beta because there is no beta version for Mac
[2024-01-10T01:58:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nop blade gt has 1500w tires with 6.5 rim
[2024-01-10T02:33:09] Tommy ª: so.. time to wait my bro
[2024-01-10T02:33:11] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-10T02:40:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: I wanted the break light
[2024-01-10T02:53:22] Tommy ª: you need 6.05
[2024-01-10T02:59:29] haku: seems like a good deal yea? how much do these cost? 13" 16 speed drill press
[2024-01-10T03:03:48] Tommy ª: i already explained how also idk if is legal to edit a script or even better, i can ask to @kawaiinekololis to add the lines to the script and make it more plug and play but idk, even because a friend modded it, i need to ask to him
[2024-01-10T03:03:49] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-10T03:05:05] Tommy ª: actually i dont know how to use github and same thing, i need to ask to my friend if he allows that
[2024-01-10T03:08:11] Tommy ª: actually is private only for me for now, and im gonna to edit a lot of more things for make it more flexible also i need to figure why the usb server crahses, i hate to dissamble the entire scooter for disconect the battery every time when i want to plug it
[2024-01-10T03:09:22] Tommy ª: what that means?
[2024-01-10T03:11:22] Tommy ª: i just dont want to broke someone setup, im just testing for now basically, nothing serious, and the most weird things is these glitches
[2024-01-10T03:11:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: U need hemp testing I'm a developer to so
[2024-01-10T03:15:19] Tommy ª: thats it, and my friend literally every day is "hey, i modified this, test it" casually and honestly i just want to wait to 6.05 stable also respect at the rear light, the brake light cant work with lights on bc lack of pwm commands (bruh they dont exist on lisp) im thinking on made various scripts because vesc actually dont support lights control, my another scooter and some friends needs individually rear light (light+brake light) so probalby im going to make various scripts for light oriented, now im just starting with the xiaomi because i use it to go at work
[2024-01-10T03:16:29] Tommy ª: that can be good just wait a bit and problably im going to talk with you when i need some help
[2024-01-10T03:23:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_12064@10-01-2024_03-23-27.jpg>
[2024-01-10T03:23:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: Here is my scooter
[2024-01-10T03:24:51] Tommy ª: pro2?
[2024-01-10T03:25:58] Tommy ª: no related you know some linux that works on old nvidia hardware? i just rebuilded my pc but i want to get on linux but they cant handle the cards (750ti and gt520), even in failsafe
[2024-01-10T03:29:12] Tommy ª: i want to boot something, im trying about 6 distros i liked fedora, also this one actually it booted only in the 520 and the desktop dont work and the 750ti just make random lines on win7 works normal and the "nvidia" boot in some distros looks like works only in newer cards, in the mine i just get a black screen in 2 cards
[2024-01-10T03:29:13] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-10T03:37:10] Tommy ª: hmm first i think i need to install fedora in some way literally im running windows on a 128gb usb, i can do the same on linux (?)
[2024-01-10T03:38:05] Tommy ª: wrong chat buddy 😭
[2024-01-10T03:38:44] Tommy ª: aismdov ok, im going to burn a fedora dvd again
[2024-01-10T03:39:40] Tommy ª: yea, thanks c:
[2024-01-10T03:43:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2024-01-10T03:43:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: For the drivers of nvidia I would advise you system 76 OS
[2024-01-10T03:44:03] Tommy ª: mine is a essential
[2024-01-10T03:44:09] Tommy ª: that is not popos?
[2024-01-10T03:44:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2024-01-10T03:44:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is you setup
[2024-01-10T03:44:35] Tommy ª: that one just wont boot
[2024-01-10T03:44:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: Witch version?
[2024-01-10T03:44:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: And what is the error?
[2024-01-10T03:45:09] Tommy ª: stock bat + 75100 + pro2 motor
[2024-01-10T03:45:46] Tommy ª: just the normal "lts" i dont get error, just all 2 screen glitches very bad and the console is in 320x240 bruh
[2024-01-10T03:46:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nice
[2024-01-10T03:46:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: How cs you fit pro 2 battery is essential?
[2024-01-10T03:46:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: Something is not right
[2024-01-10T03:47:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is your setup?
[2024-01-10T03:47:08] Tommy ª: i need to fit the money of one 😭
[2024-01-10T03:47:36] Tommy ª: fx8350 + 24gig + 750ti + 520 2gb
[2024-01-10T03:47:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: I think fedora has spins with nvidia drivers
[2024-01-10T03:48:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: Lolll
[2024-01-10T03:48:39] Rogerio Figueiredo: Sorry I reed bad
[2024-01-10T03:48:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: You use pro 2 motor not battery
[2024-01-10T03:49:57] Tommy ª: yup
[2024-01-10T03:50:30] Tommy ª: yep i got that motor 4 free bc the mine got cracked bruh
[2024-01-10T03:50:43] Tommy ª: im going to try, ty
[2024-01-10T03:53:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: Stock should work
[2024-01-10T03:55:43] Tommy ª: even on windows, the 520 stops working on 2015 drivers
[2024-01-10T03:58:49] haku: i dont know if i need it but i do want to learn this stuff. to remove rails from g30 and new holes for my bigger deck if i wanna use it.
[2024-01-10T04:03:06] haku: machine shop will charge me this much anyways
[2024-01-10T06:46:42] Happy Giraffe: If you want to remove rails then a tiny 1/2" wide belt sander is better. Angle grinder bit hard to get on tight spaces
[2024-01-10T06:47:31] haku: but is this drill press a pretty decent price?
[2024-01-10T06:48:18] Happy Giraffe: Yeah I guess, depends if its shit and how large the chuck is
[2024-01-10T06:49:38] Happy Giraffe: You would want one that accepts also bigger drillbits so you dont have to buy a second one lol
[2024-01-10T06:50:50] haku: i see. i dont know anything about this i only have a cordless drill. i want straight holes
[2024-01-10T06:51:17] Happy Giraffe: Very doable on that
[2024-01-10T06:51:17] haku: machine shop will charge me as much as this tool lol
[2024-01-10T06:52:21] Happy Giraffe: Even to thick steel, spring centerpunch, then heavy duty centerpunch and hammer, first small hole, then second bigger hole etc😁
[2024-01-10T06:53:15] Happy Giraffe: Cutting fluid kinda necessary also there and a sharp drillbit
[2024-01-10T06:53:57] haku: i cant even find metric bits in harbor freight. sad i have to get it online
[2024-01-10T06:54:35] haku: also do you know if thisnis m4 or m5?
[2024-01-10T06:55:45] haku: its the threaded part
[2024-01-10T06:56:22] haku: different tools for metric and sae 😂
[2024-01-10T07:03:26] Happy Giraffe: Lol, atleast same caliper
[2024-01-10T07:04:02] Happy Giraffe: Seems to be m6. Use wide part of caliper jaws so it wont go inside thread for accurate measurement
[2024-01-10T07:04:25] haku: i got this big boy actually 😂
[2024-01-10T07:04:49] haku: i just use the old one if under 50mm
[2024-01-10T07:04:53] Happy Giraffe: Haha, works. I also need one tbh but so expensive
[2024-01-10T07:05:26] haku: harbor freight not bad if you have a similar shop there
[2024-01-10T07:05:42] haku: all rebranded ali stuff 😂
[2024-01-10T07:06:53] Happy Giraffe: Kinda yes but even Lidl Parkside stuff seems crappy but nowadays those calipers quite ok. Not everyone need a Mitutoyo😁
[2024-01-10T07:07:27] Happy Giraffe: You have a workbench of some sort?
[2024-01-10T07:08:03] haku: if you have a fulltime shop its good. no workbench im just using flimsy stuff. i want to build one with 2x4s
[2024-01-10T07:09:59] Happy Giraffe: Yeah doesnt need to be big, just a surface that stays still and lets you use clamps etc to hold scooter. I would buy/build a small workbench rather than a drillpress. Proper bench + hand drill always beats press + small ikea table😂
[2024-01-10T07:11:13] Happy Giraffe: Tutustu tähän: Plus Messenger https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.plus
[2024-01-10T07:11:16] Happy Giraffe: Damn, telegram messing with you all today. Download "Plus" app
[2024-01-10T07:13:37] haku: wtf. how did i end up here. i was in offtopic
[2024-01-10T07:23:42] haku: okay. i dl that app you recomend thanks
[2024-01-10T07:49:32] Happy Giraffe: That lock will be cut in 1 sec with pocketable pliers😅
[2024-01-10T07:54:05] Finn: Only for insurrance reasons😁
[2024-01-10T08:55:13] Happy Giraffe: I doubt any company accepts that kind of a "lock". But yeah, 8mm hardened steel chain minimum if you want to leave bit longer time unattended😅

[2024-01-10T09:06:08] puneDir: Cengiz battery and ninebot 🔛🔝
[2024-01-10T09:17:11] Finn: @Mirono_escooters I want to get into fpv drones. I had a beta drone before but didnt like the camera angle..
[2024-01-10T09:20:54] Mirono escooters: Can adjust, no?
[2024-01-10T09:21:22] Mirono escooters: Some race drones have 30-45* angle Stupid for beginner/not racer My advise, get a cinewhoop Save u money when crash, very fun, very good to learn basics and safe
[2024-01-10T09:40:32] Finn: Yeah i had very bad experience with the beta fpv drone
[2024-01-10T09:40:59] Finn: But custom fpv is better
[2024-01-10T09:41:08] Finn: https://www.racedayquads.com/collections/6s-batteries/products/rdq-series-22-2v-6s-1300mah-100c-lipo-battery-3-pack-xt60?aff=58
[2024-01-10T09:41:25] Finn: Also getting these batteries. Charger i already have for my lipo spotwelder
[2024-01-10T09:46:53] Mirono escooters: Build a cinewhoop, it's not a brand.. :)
[2024-01-10T09:47:05] Mirono escooters: I'm cnhl gang
[2024-01-10T09:50:58] Finn: Oh you mean because of crash resistant?
[2024-01-10T09:51:49] Finn: Im just gonna order mote props
[2024-01-10T09:52:25] Mirono escooters: Uhu, money saved xD
[2024-01-10T09:52:43] Finn: Hm okay i will think about it
[2024-01-10T09:52:46] Mirono escooters: What? Props don't cost money Your frame snapping in half does, while killing all motors and esc
[2024-01-10T09:53:19] Mirono escooters: CInewhoops are great Only thing I really fly with. I got 4", 1", even a longrange. Just never use it. Cinewhoop is way more fun and safer xd
[2024-01-10T09:54:13] Mirono escooters: A lil "underpowered " but still much punch. Bit heavy that is But pays off Also because I only fly cinematic.. Problably the reason I like them 🤷 But for starters.. yes. I started with fragile high power too, ruined hundreds of euro in weeks CInewhoops can't destroy, money held me back from flying xD
[2024-01-10T09:56:51] Mirono escooters: Or a mobula8, tiny drone also fun For garden and indoor, cheap and relatively safe. Good to train And a computer sim is hours of fun btw, and pretty accurate
[2024-01-10T10:15:38] Chris Culver: What do y'all think of this:
[2024-01-10T10:15:53] Chris Culver: Makerbase VESC 75200 V2 84V 200A High Current With Alu PCB Based on VESC For E-Foil Fight Robot Surfboard AGV Robot https://a.aliexpress.com/_mPafShw
[2024-01-10T10:21:28] Chris Culver: Can you elaborate on what those are?
[2024-01-10T10:23:25] Mirono escooters: Good cheap high power
[2024-01-10T10:23:48] Mirono escooters: 105€, das nothing. Impressive

[2024-01-10T10:29:13] Oreo huzky: Could be cool to make quick release for easy vesc replacement
[2024-01-10T10:55:05] Chris Culver: Not being able to turn it off? Wtf is that shit
[2024-01-10T10:56:40] Chris Culver: Also, another question? What are the connectors on the Spintend Ubox v2?
[2024-01-10T11:36:17] puneDir: Vibration?
[2024-01-10T11:50:42] Oreo huzky: If magnets strong enough?
[2024-01-10T11:52:36] puneDir: Idk
[2024-01-10T11:53:05] Mirono escooters: How many times do you replace your VEsc?
[2024-01-10T11:53:22] Mirono escooters: That even connectors are too much 😱
[2024-01-10T11:54:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: It look nice and expensive
[2024-01-10T11:54:59] Mirono escooters: Ahn, the new version of davega
[2024-01-10T11:55:04] Oreo huzky: Flipsky
[2024-01-10T11:55:07] Mirono escooters: Aimed for eskateboards mostly
[2024-01-10T11:55:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: But he has the 750 right?
[2024-01-10T12:06:27] Oreo huzky: Or if there is one with big enough contacts it could be possible to make a charger that can contact with magnets to make it easier to charge but I don’t know if that’s safe enough
[2024-01-10T12:13:59] Mirono escooters: Until reversed
[2024-01-10T12:14:19] Mirono escooters: Microsoft surface and MacBook got
[2024-01-10T12:14:32] Mirono escooters: Need 4 pin unreversible
[2024-01-10T12:17:16] Oreo huzky: The plug can’t be reversed
[2024-01-10T12:17:39] Mirono escooters: Ionno
[2024-01-10T12:17:50] Oreo huzky: Look at its shape
[2024-01-10T12:18:05] Mirono escooters: Always fun when 200w of charging power pins touch metal radiator or so nearby
[2024-01-10T12:18:13] Oreo huzky: Ye
[2024-01-10T12:18:20] Mirono escooters: I like concept, but safety gotta be thought out

[2024-01-10T12:23:55] Chris Culver: The main connectors you plug into the thing. They are JST of some kind, trying to figure out what kind it is
[2024-01-10T12:39:23] Давно пора: Lol
[2024-01-10T13:21:01] Gabe Enzo: I sincerely doubt that Americans get paid so low when I see shit like this.
[2024-01-10T13:28:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So later on you willing to share wiring diagram for that mosfet? And maybe if you guys would ask @kawaiinekololis he would solve glitches
[2024-01-10T13:37:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Directly from batt with a swich?
[2024-01-10T13:38:04] puneDir: I would taket
[2024-01-10T13:38:42] Gabe Enzo: Lovely 1kw AC motor in there
[2024-01-10T13:38:51] Gabe Enzo: Not Hub obviously
[2024-01-10T13:39:07] puneDir: I wondered if theres any battery power on stem
[2024-01-10T13:39:19] puneDir: Yeah Make a electric car
[2024-01-10T13:39:22] Gabe Enzo: VESC washing machine when
[2024-01-10T13:39:40] Gabe Enzo: too low power, maybe gokart but that's even a stretch. Maybe with dual
[2024-01-10T13:40:51] puneDir: I can make a bus with that motor
[2024-01-10T13:41:19] Gabe Enzo: How.
[2024-01-10T13:41:38] puneDir: Idk

[2024-01-10T13:48:34] NetworkDir: Zero 10x supra coming soon😁
[2024-01-10T13:51:10] Gabe Enzo: Amazing 😂😂
[2024-01-10T14:36:31] haku: there are some that would benifit from selling instead of throwing. these guys just dont have the time to do all that
[2024-01-10T14:36:52] haku: that is so creative
[2024-01-10T14:44:59] haku: why are zeros sometimes called supras. i heard this before from somewhere
[2024-01-10T15:06:48] Tommy ª: yea sure, actually the mosfet is just a logic one in the - rail of the rear led bc of mods and multiple lights, im thinking on use one of these relay modules that works at 3.3v logic and 5v now im rebuilding my old scooter so now i really want to use the 2 light outputs
[2024-01-10T15:07:36] Tommy ª: you can find these for very cheap
[2024-01-10T15:22:06] Tommy ª: some engineer are going to try to kill me now, but i dont have money for more things at least with this i have a fairly functional rear light, just for the brake and light (you cant have blinky led when the light is on) it fitted perfect inside of one of these shrink tubes but thats it also there is another things, like poeple using the adc ports actually with a full configuration (motor + halls) you can use adc1 and adc2 and ppm for output, if you use adc you only have the ppm but if you dont use halls you can use the connector as output in every hall pin

[2024-01-10T16:59:06] Gabe Enzo: Hello Guys If anyone wants to make a quick buck, I'll pay you 20€ if one of you modifies the pro 2 STL file to fit M4 screws. I'm not tech savvy enough and not gonna learn how because I got many exams left and right and am heavily busy. Only thing is that all 4 pieces must be edited separately as separate STL files because I find it easier to print that way.
[2024-01-10T16:59:28] Gabe Enzo: If anyone wants to HMU then LMK
[2024-01-10T17:07:15] Gabe Enzo: I can provide the 4 seperate STL files
[2024-01-10T17:11:13] Paolo ⁭: 18s7p
[2024-01-10T17:25:17] haku: what is that sir? welder?

[2024-01-10T17:33:53] haku: not alot of modded scooter youtubers. i think you have the best one!
[2024-01-10T17:35:48] haku: that burnout is what i want to achieve. good job bro
[2024-01-10T17:37:21] haku: vesc website i think
[2024-01-10T17:41:19] Jan: Modify an STL needs wizardry
[2024-01-10T17:44:08] Albert Rembisz: On Vesc website is only newest 6.02 or beta
[2024-01-10T17:47:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its not in the hidden where it basically even puts stupid csv?
[2024-01-10T17:51:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Step 1 think over what you want to weld than you know what you need. Multi machines know more for beginers but if you want to weld steel and than alu You change half stuff on the machine So better define what you really want
[2024-01-10T17:52:59] haku: i kinda want to learn both. but but aluminum is alot harder from what i hear.
[2024-01-10T17:53:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like mig steel with co2 or argon corgon protective gas is easy
[2024-01-10T17:53:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes it is harder
[2024-01-10T17:53:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also you need to know what you want to do with that
[2024-01-10T17:54:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz mig can do alu just pistol wire and gas differs
[2024-01-10T17:55:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But avi aka tig does better job but even harder and to weld small pieces is hard coz it makes lot heat in seconds and whole shit melts off
[2024-01-10T17:55:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also hate to say but you lucky
[2024-01-10T17:55:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Best avi machines made in the USA
[2024-01-10T17:56:39] haku: i see. maybe there are weld classes i can attend here. im sure there are.
[2024-01-10T17:56:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I was at my mates company and wacthing boss welding titanium
[2024-01-10T17:57:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's super rare and the machines he has each cost a car , different classes😅
[2024-01-10T17:58:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah gather info
[2024-01-10T17:58:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe even something near batteries
[2024-01-10T17:59:26] haku: i think welding needs a hands on experience these things you cant learn thru youtube and video tutorials
[2024-01-10T18:00:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sure ,you can learn some ways and tricks but experience is needed to be able to do so
[2024-01-10T18:01:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also near what you say ,in school like that you could avoid probs and not understanding stuff home alone and gather knowledge what you like and than buys machine ,so it wont be a dust holder in the corner
[2024-01-10T18:02:47] haku: agreed
[2024-01-10T18:04:13] Rose: Hey there Matus, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-10T18:04:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In my mates school here ,they learnt cnc milling and lathe and prgramming for them and before any of does happen they 3 d printed is to see is all fine before you start milling
[2024-01-10T18:05:32] haku: yea prototyping.
[2024-01-10T19:09:41] Marco Agazzi: We were interested to know what the max amperage the battery can output
[2024-01-10T19:10:08] Marco Agazzi: Benjo says 210
[2024-01-10T19:23:08] Happy Giraffe: Chill with your hurry to buy so much stuff😂

[2024-01-10T20:58:53] haku: mr @PaoloWu why add flux. you told me it can be done without
[2024-01-10T20:59:08] haku: we have the same welder sir
[2024-01-10T21:00:17] haku: maybe practice cells. but you ballin on murata practice cells
[2024-01-10T21:03:11] Paolo ⁭: Sandwich method is no good if you don't seal the pack very well, since I never seal them then I add flux

[2024-01-10T21:06:28] Gabe Enzo: Maybe
[2024-01-10T21:06:57] sombre_enfant: Take a loan 30 year 10% 200k down payement and 200 credit score

[2024-01-10T21:09:29] Gabe Enzo: Seems I got an opportunity already
[2024-01-10T21:09:35] sombre_enfant: Free return hit diff
[2024-01-10T21:10:46] Gabe Enzo: Lmao, what happened
[2024-01-10T21:23:47] Ion: Hi, did you also ask this in the scooter subreddit? I remember answering with some info some time ago. Tho sadly I still don't know what the best approach is. resistor with switch sounds reasonable , and you can "train" min/max values in vesctool so its actually "full throttle" when on.
[2024-01-10T22:15:39] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2024-01-10T22:17:18] haku: resin more defined prints right? no layer lines?
[2024-01-10T22:17:32] Unknown: I need this part but for the zero10x suspension (the swing arms holes)
[2024-01-10T22:17:35] Unknown: <photos/photo_12096@10-01-2024_22-17-35.jpg>
[2024-01-10T22:19:20] Mirono escooters: Yes, super accurate shit Slow and tiny surface tho Ususally also stronger
[2024-01-10T22:19:29] Mirono escooters: Machine
[2024-01-10T22:20:01] Gabe Enzo: Guys do 11x3 tyres fit on monorim suspension front and back yeah?
[2024-01-10T22:20:52] Unknown: <animation>
[2024-01-10T22:20:54] Unknown: Ah
[2024-01-10T22:20:58] Unknown: ?
[2024-01-10T22:23:26] sombre_enfant: U can fit 11" on 6" rim, rear it might dont never seen it
[2024-01-10T22:24:23] haku: isnt that part available in ali?
[2024-01-10T22:24:40] Unknown: 1How do I machine that part ? (I don't have cnc or any sort of mill) 2 how do I measure it
[2024-01-10T22:24:46] Mirono escooters: A lathe
[2024-01-10T22:25:09] Unknown: Of course it does but I don't know how to call it or the diameter
[2024-01-10T22:25:23] Unknown: I wish I had one of those
[2024-01-10T22:26:00] Mirono escooters: No local makerspaces?
[2024-01-10T22:26:08] Unknown: And I did lost my digital caliper (if that's what you call it )
[2024-01-10T22:26:48] Unknown: Scot can't drive to local technician and they're pretty basic here
[2024-01-10T22:27:22] Mirono escooters: A simple lathe makes that
[2024-01-10T22:28:32] Unknown: Again can't get one without knowing the diameter
[2024-01-10T22:28:35] sombre_enfant: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EvQU7hF
[2024-01-10T22:28:50] sombre_enfant: Its 8mm most of time
[2024-01-10T22:30:16] sombre_enfant: If for shocks shaft
[2024-01-10T22:32:29] Paolo ⁭: If someone need for spot welder battery message me please
[2024-01-10T22:34:47] haku: can you check resistance on lipo batteries just like how you can with liion?
[2024-01-10T22:37:20] Gabe Enzo: No Im talking about the actual suspension Like the front fork and the rear dampener
[2024-01-10T22:37:25] Gabe Enzo: Not rim size here
[2024-01-10T22:37:36] Gabe Enzo: I'm going with CST
[2024-01-10T22:41:34] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12098@10-01-2024_22-41-34.jpg>
[2024-01-10T22:43:05] Mirono escooters: I love those 9500
[2024-01-10T22:43:08] Mirono escooters: Price? Xd
[2024-01-10T22:44:00] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2024-01-10T22:44:02] Gabe Enzo: Of course!
[2024-01-10T22:44:17] Gabe Enzo: Loved running these with brushless back in the day dude
[2024-01-10T22:44:30] Gabe Enzo: I'll never forget it. So sad the RC hobby is dead
[2024-01-10T22:44:54] Tommy ª: it died when it went a very expensive hobby
[2024-01-10T22:44:55] Paolo ⁭: I did very much battery, I killed more than 12 lipos
[2024-01-10T22:45:08] Paolo ⁭: These are new, but I got Tig now hahah
[2024-01-10T22:50:36] sombre_enfant: Maybe with axle extender, but if motor has 125mm axle u must need lots of washer on motor axle so atp get 142mm 11" motor like a 70h
[2024-01-10T22:51:17] sombre_enfant: Show us tig method and setup
[2024-01-10T22:51:36] Paolo ⁭: Get any Tig that works
[2024-01-10T22:51:42] Paolo ⁭: Mod it with a timer
[2024-01-10T22:51:52] Paolo ⁭: Then u can weld
[2024-01-10T22:52:51] haku: why no more glitter? i trusted you with my life savings bro
[2024-01-10T22:54:39] Mirono escooters: Some annoying one
[2024-01-10T22:54:42] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2024-01-10T22:58:59] Gabe Enzo: Pro 2 issues for days.
[2024-01-10T23:00:46] Gabe Enzo: the entire thing requires serious modification either way.
[2024-01-10T23:01:17] Gabe Enzo: Idc what y'all say I'm not getting a G30 XD I love my Pro 2 I'll marry her
[2024-01-10T23:02:05] Paolo ⁭: Just don't use any
[2024-01-10T23:02:10] Paolo ⁭: I unsolder all pins
[2024-01-10T23:07:40] Mirono escooters: Same
[2024-01-10T23:11:12] haku: looking at all these modded g30s makes me want to put all my parts for my main build there.
[2024-01-10T23:11:54] haku: its just the battery space thats making me reconsider
[2024-01-10T23:13:11] Mario: Too funny the crossover here, the facebook group, and the reddit group. Yes, I did post on both Facebook and Reddit just hoping to collect enough info to make it all make sense. It believe it'll all work, if I get the correct voltage on the switch when pressed, as you said it should represent as full throttle and no throttle when the button is not pressed. I believe your info is what I've used for most of my researching and hopeful implementation.
[2024-01-10T23:13:17] haku: do you still use your glitter or did it explode? 😅
[2024-01-10T23:13:27] haku: asking for a friend
[2024-01-10T23:13:44] Gabe Enzo: 20s6p inner and 60 cells outer. that's 20s9p
[2024-01-10T23:13:47] Gabe Enzo: Plenty.
[2024-01-10T23:14:35] haku: external batteries though. o dont mind esc outside but batteries put alot of weight in stem
[2024-01-10T23:14:38] Paolo ⁭: Glitter QC is very bad
[2024-01-10T23:14:46] Paolo ⁭: Now is sold
[2024-01-10T23:14:55] haku: oh dam 😭
[2024-01-10T23:15:18] Paolo ⁭: If works then it work well, but if don't works, I repaired from my self
[2024-01-10T23:15:32] haku: capacitor problems?
[2024-01-10T23:15:49] Paolo ⁭: The machine was shorted, mos was active even you don't press pedal , and even machine was off
[2024-01-10T23:15:58] Paolo ⁭: Very very dangerous
[2024-01-10T23:16:05] Paolo ⁭: Board
[2024-01-10T23:16:21] haku: i see. do i have to unplug it every time im not using?
[2024-01-10T23:16:34] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_12099@10-01-2024_23-16-34.jpg>
[2024-01-10T23:16:54] Paolo ⁭: If I didn't tested it on died cell, now my house would catch fire probably xd
[2024-01-10T23:17:12] haku: oh hell no 😭
[2024-01-10T23:17:27] Paolo ⁭: It's useless , that was only a bad batch
[2024-01-10T23:17:51] Paolo ⁭: I was one of the first received this machine in eu
[2024-01-10T23:18:06] haku: i have glitter 811h 😭 top specs. im kinda nervous now
[2024-01-10T23:18:07] sombre_enfant: Can u get shock from welder ?
[2024-01-10T23:18:32] Paolo ⁭: Not shock problem
[2024-01-10T23:18:43] Paolo ⁭: If mo's is always on is like you welding with arc
[2024-01-10T23:18:59] Paolo ⁭: Do u can made hole on the battery
[2024-01-10T23:19:04] haku: did you touch both leads and press pedal?
[2024-01-10T23:19:26] haku: electrodes i mean
[2024-01-10T23:19:28] sombre_enfant: Aint no way u fit 20s6p in pro even g30 its a tight tight fit
[2024-01-10T23:20:15] haku: dam i have to reconsider my life choices
[2024-01-10T23:21:58] Mirono escooters: Mucho extender
[2024-01-10T23:22:04] Paolo ⁭: No bro
[2024-01-10T23:22:10] Paolo ⁭: Only first batch was that
[2024-01-10T23:22:24] Paolo ⁭: If it is bad, it is bad from first day
[2024-01-10T23:22:26] haku: ok thats reasuring. thanks my guy
[2024-01-10T23:22:56] Paolo ⁭: Because was available only for china people when I got it, and they was still testing it
[2024-01-10T23:23:03] haku: i already blew a hole on one of my test batteries. it just fizzled no fire thank God.
[2024-01-10T23:23:17] Paolo ⁭: Don't use nickel on copper
[2024-01-10T23:23:22] Paolo ⁭: Use copper directly

[2024-01-11T15:37:19] puneDir: Ahhh
[2024-01-11T15:37:22] puneDir: That sucks
[2024-01-11T15:37:23] Izuna 生活: its a nightmare
[2024-01-11T15:37:26] Izuna 生活: A FUCKING NIGHTMARE
[2024-01-11T15:37:35] Izuna 生活: you are chilling, you think your finally done for the day
[2024-01-11T15:37:36] Izuna 生活: NAH MAN

[2024-01-11T15:37:48] Izuna 生活: and be like:
[2024-01-11T15:37:56] puneDir: I generally dont like the persons in my city + school (cuz my City is shit small place)
[2024-01-11T15:37:59] Izuna 生活: well here you go some tasks
[2024-01-11T15:38:00] Izuna 生活: tomorrow
[2024-01-11T15:38:01] Izuna 生活: get it done
[2024-01-11T15:38:04] puneDir: I hate to talk with them after school
[2024-01-11T15:38:22] puneDir: That sucks
[2024-01-11T15:38:26] puneDir: 💀
[2024-01-11T15:38:30] Izuna 生活: and my motivation is at the bottom
[2024-01-11T15:38:53] puneDir: What if you dont make the tasks
[2024-01-11T15:38:58] Izuna 生活: i fail
[2024-01-11T15:39:02] Izuna 生活: and have to redo everything?
[2024-01-11T15:39:07] Izuna 生活: another year
[2024-01-11T15:39:08] Izuna 生活: wasting my life
[2024-01-11T15:39:09] Izuna 生活: for SHIT
[2024-01-11T15:39:19] puneDir: Ah man thats so shit
[2024-01-11T15:39:26] puneDir: How many years left to get out of that
[2024-01-11T15:39:40] Izuna 生活: and they are so unrealistic, they have no idea how life actually works. They really think school is the MOST important thing in the whole life.
[2024-01-11T15:39:45] Izuna 生活: half year now
[2024-01-11T15:39:48] Izuna 生活: if I fail this
[2024-01-11T15:39:53] Izuna 生活: im gonna jump in front of the train
[2024-01-11T15:40:06] Izuna 生活: also no plans atm for the future
[2024-01-11T15:40:23] Izuna 生活: i am self-employed at the same time, which makes it worse
[2024-01-11T15:40:49] puneDir: Look on the bright side nothing much left
[2024-01-11T15:40:55] puneDir: You wont
[2024-01-11T15:40:59] puneDir: Just 6 months
[2024-01-11T15:41:14] Izuna 生活: if I fail only one class, its fucked
[2024-01-11T15:41:32] Izuna 生活: i cant speak fucking spanish
[2024-01-11T15:41:33] Izuna 生活: I CANT
[2024-01-11T15:42:18] Izuna 生活: and then I have to keep the updates coming, the progress, work on new projects to keep myself relevant and so on.
[2024-01-11T15:42:36] puneDir: Spanish wtf
[2024-01-11T15:42:45] puneDir: Why you guys have that 💀
[2024-01-11T15:43:04] puneDir: German English and youre enough to speak with the whole world
[2024-01-11T15:44:06] Izuna 生活: i disappeared over 2-3 years and people thought I am in jail or smth, that ruined a lot of my reputation + less people downloading but I still earned like mini-job level money and now I am back, posting youtube videos actively, making software updates etc but that causes a load of "customer" support on telegram, youtube, guilded, discord, twitter EVERYWHERE.
[2024-01-11T15:44:20] Izuna 生活: but during the 2-3 years i disappeared I got into the escooter hobby, so thats nice
[2024-01-11T15:44:29] Izuna 生活: but that also brought the fact that now people message me every day
[2024-01-11T15:44:35] Izuna 生活: asking for help with EVERYTHING
[2024-01-11T15:44:44] Izuna 生活: and im not someone who just does not respond, i try to always answear
[2024-01-11T15:45:26] Izuna 生活: so im basically complaining about having social contact or smth, idk its just i cant even watch a youtube video without a single message appearing on my phone
[2024-01-11T15:45:37] Izuna 生活: or go to bed and i see my phone display go off
[2024-01-11T15:46:00] Izuna 生活: no we have to speak german, english and spanish (or france, or another language)
[2024-01-11T15:46:13] puneDir: Your mind is so full
[2024-01-11T15:46:29] puneDir: You should go to a vacation or something
[2024-01-11T15:46:45] Izuna 生活: and now I have to make a video game for school, IT class which is another off school-time job.
[2024-01-11T15:46:52] Izuna 生活: and another programming project
[2024-01-11T15:47:20] puneDir: Yes youre a good person but questions are sometimes annoying
[2024-01-11T15:47:29] puneDir: I would ignore them
[2024-01-11T15:47:38] Izuna 生活: well i went to france, that was a really good time, but still responded to every message i got
[2024-01-11T15:47:50] Izuna 生活: and now I see analytics dropping, just because I was gone for a week
[2024-01-11T15:48:05] Izuna 生活: thats the worst part of being self-employed
[2024-01-11T15:48:37] puneDir: :/
[2024-01-11T15:48:47] puneDir: Your mind is really so full
[2024-01-11T15:48:55] puneDir: You need to clear your mind somehow
[2024-01-11T15:49:15] Izuna 生活: well, first step is getting out of school, but that will take some time
[2024-01-11T15:49:31] puneDir: Just 6 months
[2024-01-11T15:49:39] Izuna 生活: true...
[2024-01-11T15:49:42] puneDir: Wait 6 months and life would be good
[2024-01-11T15:49:50] puneDir: Most of the load will be gone
[2024-01-11T15:49:52] Izuna 生活: but after 6 months, what?...
[2024-01-11T15:49:56] Izuna 生活: need to continue
[2024-01-11T15:50:02] Izuna 生活: find university or something
[2024-01-11T15:52:32] puneDir: Isnt university better?
[2024-01-11T15:52:36] puneDir: You do what do you love
[2024-01-11T15:52:58] Gabe Enzo: You're gonna love college buddy
[2024-01-11T15:54:08] Gabe Enzo: Don't fail then. I was in your spot, failing my winter exams, but I got myself together and had good marks on the summer exams, now here I am studying electrical engineering
[2024-01-11T15:55:08] Izuna 生活: hopefully
[2024-01-11T15:55:11] Izuna 生活: but I am at the cliff
[2024-01-11T15:55:50] Marco Agazzi: I agree
[2024-01-11T15:55:53] Gabe Enzo: Digga i had a physics exam today I got zero hours of sleep. And another exam tomorrow and I gotta wake up at 6am and ebike through the cold for an hour
[2024-01-11T15:56:04] Gabe Enzo: Understandable, been there
[2024-01-11T15:56:53] Gabe Enzo: Just get on with it, or you'll be assraping your future self
[2024-01-11T15:57:35] Jan: Europe is unfortunately all about the degree
[2024-01-11T15:57:53] Gabe Enzo: the assignments won't go away if you bury your head in the sand
[2024-01-11T15:58:04] Gabe Enzo: wipe the sand ouut of ur eyes for a minute
[2024-01-11T15:58:06] Jan: In Europe rather be a useless fuck with PhD degree than being a god without any degree
[2024-01-11T15:58:43] Jan: We had so many useless people with PhD its unbelieveable. They were completely incapable of doing any meaningful work but got paid the most
[2024-01-11T16:01:16] Jan: When i wanted a raise they denied for not having a higher degree despite being the inventor of 4 fucking patents for that company (One that Airbus wants to steal now) while the PhD guy havent done a single useful thing so far
[2024-01-11T16:01:26] Jan: Thats when i decided to quit
[2024-01-11T16:02:28] Jan: I feel like after a point in university, you are not providing any meaningful work anymore and just work to get the degree
[2024-01-11T16:02:29] Izuna 生活: I knew a guy that did not even have a school graduation, most smartest person I ever met, however he absolutely had no future because of the missing graduation. He was so fucking talented. I would have employed him if I would have been able to, but now its too late. Because of no chances in the future drug abuse follows and then death.
[2024-01-11T16:03:16] Jan: If you are smart but no degree you must go your own way outside of normal society and build your own company
[2024-01-11T16:05:35] Jan: Yes it was
[2024-01-11T16:05:54] Jan: Glad im done with it
[2024-01-11T16:06:01] Jan: Now work is torture ^^
[2024-01-11T16:06:43] Marco Agazzi: Worker + Informatic School Is Torture
[2024-01-11T16:07:23] Jan: Its basically the same: Every day, 5 days a week Grades => Certificate of Employment + Linkedin profile Lots of shitty stuff to do
[2024-01-11T16:08:02] Marco Agazzi: Am I the only one still in high school?
[2024-01-11T16:08:05] Marco Agazzi: 😂😂
[2024-01-11T16:08:28] Izuna 生活: Yes, but when you are this position its really hard to stay motivated. Kicking in motivation and then bam everything suddenly goes down hill again. (which you can see at the graphs). He always found a way to make money, even if it was not so legal, but finding something that will make a steady income is so difficult.
[2024-01-11T16:08:36] Izuna 生活: For me recently for example, Google fucked up and banned me from their ad program and also YouTube and I had to wait until they unbanned me. Multiple days of income, just vanished.
[2024-01-11T16:11:07] Izuna 生活: and for the social part, he came out of his shell and it was going uphill, however then the unexpected happend and he died because of a overdose of sodium nitrite, which we still think was a accident... Oh and boi that hit me so hard, had a really hard time with this and then the fucking teacher was annoying me because "i am missing so much", just because I ran out of class at that day and went home during her class.
[2024-01-11T16:11:59] Izuna 生活: was not even able to go to the funereal because of an important exam... still bothers me
[2024-01-11T16:12:10] Izuna 生活: and that exam was a fucking 0 points
[2024-01-11T16:12:19] Izuna 生活: so fucked up
[2024-01-11T16:12:45] Gabe Enzo: Did you ask for them to move your date? my college would do that. Under exceptional circumstances.
[2024-01-11T16:13:11] Izuna 生活: no, does not work. it was a really important one
[2024-01-11T16:13:31] Izuna 生活: and the teachers would have killed you for not attending
[2024-01-11T16:13:42] Izuna 生活: the first thing my math teacher said was: "oh great, you are here, did not expect you"
[2024-01-11T16:13:45] Gabe Enzo: I headlocked teachers back in HS.
[2024-01-11T16:13:48] Gabe Enzo: Kek
[2024-01-11T16:13:51] Gabe Enzo: fuck em
[2024-01-11T16:14:08] Gabe Enzo: my friend WWE slammed the principal onto a desk
[2024-01-11T16:14:33] Izuna 生活: its true I am not at school a lot, its just too much for me, but the fact they keep annoying me so much and the comments
[2024-01-11T16:14:53] Izuna 生活: xd
[2024-01-11T16:15:08] Gabe Enzo: If I had your scooter id be in every day. That's why im building a build like yours. College is 14km away.
[2024-01-11T16:15:14] Gabe Enzo: Being in is key to success
[2024-01-11T16:15:16] Gabe Enzo: Always
[2024-01-11T16:15:25] Gabe Enzo: I get you tho it can be too much
[2024-01-11T16:15:51] Izuna 生活: thats the only thing that makes me happy once in the day.
[2024-01-11T16:15:59] Izuna 生活: full throlling the parking lot
[2024-01-11T16:16:01] Gabe Enzo: I skip classes that aren't important, save energy for importsnt subjects. I was only in 2 hours out of 6 for my entire school career.
[2024-01-11T16:16:01] Izuna 生活: thats it
[2024-01-11T16:16:03] Happy Giraffe: Mini cross bikes, here they go 300$ even. Only issue with them is legality not being possible
[2024-01-11T16:16:14] Izuna 生活: yes I do the same
[2024-01-11T16:16:18] Gabe Enzo: come in at small break and leave at big break

[2024-01-11T16:17:06] Izuna 生活: for winter
[2024-01-11T16:17:09] Izuna 生活: that makes me mad too
[2024-01-11T16:17:32] Gabe Enzo: Really? battery sag or something?
[2024-01-11T16:17:36] Izuna 生活: no
[2024-01-11T16:17:37] Izuna 生活: water

[2024-01-11T16:17:45] Mirono escooters: :(
[2024-01-11T16:17:52] Gabe Enzo: Wtf I go through floods on my pro 2 and never got water inside.
[2024-01-11T16:17:59] Gabe Enzo: can't you seal well with silicone
[2024-01-11T16:18:19] Happy Giraffe: My next build gonna kick ass even at less than 5kw...wheelies everywhere and burnout

[2024-01-11T16:18:48] puneDir: Wonder how mines doesnt get water in

[2024-01-11T16:19:38] Gabe Enzo: sounds like you need a joint
[2024-01-11T16:19:39] Gabe Enzo: no joke
[2024-01-11T16:19:41] Gabe Enzo: LoOL
[2024-01-11T16:19:46] Izuna 生活: the fucking sound of teams
[2024-01-11T16:19:48] Izuna 生活: popping up
[2024-01-11T16:20:02] puneDir: teacher : wanna smash
[2024-01-11T16:20:14] Finn: Fr
[2024-01-11T16:20:54] Izuna 生活: not going to take any drug, not even a joint. I had one once, but it was bad shit and I did not feel shit from it besides the mixed in nicotine
[2024-01-11T16:21:01] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Linuxoid detected
[2024-01-11T16:21:03] Izuna 生活: since then never touched again
[2024-01-11T16:21:41] Izuna 生活: i dont know what was wrong with that weed, i inhaled multiple grams pure with a bong and boi shit never hit
[2024-01-11T16:21:46] Izuna 生活: but well in the end, i think it was a good thing
[2024-01-11T16:22:09] Izuna 生活: i dont need drugs, all i need is sleep for weeks
[2024-01-11T16:24:06] Marco Agazzi: And are you so experienced? wow
[2024-01-11T16:24:15] puneDir: Im not actually
[2024-01-11T16:24:23] Marco Agazzi: This is a serious group
[2024-01-11T16:24:48] Marco Agazzi: Definitely more than me 😂❤️
[2024-01-11T16:25:04] Marco Agazzi: I'm good at computer science but not with the vesc
[2024-01-11T16:25:45] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I want to do same but our post-ussr school program SUCKS. only what I can do is sleep at this lessons if it possible. many teachers makes vision of caring about all people when you just don't want to teach this useless in whole life lesson
[2024-01-11T16:26:32] Marco Agazzi: If want I'll give a hand with C++ or Python
[2024-01-11T16:26:36] Marco Agazzi: 😂😂
[2024-01-11T16:27:13] Paolo ⁭: Vesc is basically In c
[2024-01-11T16:27:26] Izuna 生活: It takes about 2-3 days of sleep to get me back motivated when I am sick or on holiday, then i suddenly become the most productive person ever. Work day n' night on my projects (which is of course exhausting too, but not in the way that makes me burned out). I only remember that when I was 12-13 years old and doing school and projects every day into the night like a workaholic I suddenly felt really shit, well since then i was never that motivated and life went downhill. So eh, don't overdo it even if you want your projects to become a success. At least that money that I made in this time is now able to buy me scooter parts. 😬
[2024-01-11T16:29:51] Izuna 生活: post-ussr?
[2024-01-11T16:30:05] Marco Agazzi: Electrical engineering is also required for vesc
[2024-01-11T16:30:13] Marco Agazzi: elettrotecnica in ita
[2024-01-11T16:30:19] Marco Agazzi: e li faccio pena
[2024-01-11T16:30:27] Gabe Enzo: sleep is the most important thing.
[2024-01-11T16:30:40] Rose: Hey there Guillermo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-11T16:30:48] Izuna 生活: So far I was not doomed to certify being sick (as long I am not away for more than 3 days). But I am cloooose to be. However my doctor is a nice guy, so even if, I am fine.
[2024-01-11T16:31:44] sombre_enfant: Yeah sleep is really important i had a aunty who stayed at home for 3 month i could slept she was snoring and shi all night it took me to hospital
[2024-01-11T16:32:01] Izuna 生活: damn thats crazy
[2024-01-11T16:32:13] Izuna 生活: she slept in same room or another room?

[2024-01-11T16:33:23] sombre_enfant: The sound was crazy job + school i started to trip out
[2024-01-11T16:33:39] Guillermo Fuenzalida: hello! regards freom Chile
[2024-01-11T16:33:43] Guillermo Fuenzalida: can anyone read me?
[2024-01-11T16:34:14] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: xD
[2024-01-11T16:34:19] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I have some picture
[2024-01-11T16:34:29] sombre_enfant: What do you need brother ?
[2024-01-11T16:34:51] Guillermo Fuenzalida: just joined
[2024-01-11T16:35:01] francois schempers: welcome 😁
[2024-01-11T16:35:02] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I can buy that 😂
[2024-01-11T16:35:07] Guillermo Fuenzalida: and trying to learn, how to setup a pair of vesc 75200 controllers, into my nami
[2024-01-11T16:35:23] Guillermo Fuenzalida: using a pair of custom motors
[2024-01-11T16:35:33] Guillermo Fuenzalida: configuring them dual, adding throttle, etc etc
[2024-01-11T16:35:34] Guillermo Fuenzalida: xD
[2024-01-11T16:35:42] Guillermo Fuenzalida: and dont burn it while trying
[2024-01-11T16:35:42] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Guillermo has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-11T16:36:14] sombre_enfant: Well turn off phase filter and do your adc wiring properly
[2024-01-11T16:36:19] Mirono escooters: You met the bot quite early
[2024-01-11T16:36:36] sombre_enfant: Whats these ?
[2024-01-11T16:36:58] Mirono escooters: Grandpa drugs
[2024-01-11T16:37:34] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: A fucking pills for sleep called "sleep retard" 😂
[2024-01-11T16:38:07] sombre_enfant: Hospital meds was crazy ngl
[2024-01-11T16:38:48] francois schempers: try to make one big msg instead of several small one, easier to read and the chat is cleaner ;) as for your problem, you're in the right place for that 👌
[2024-01-11T16:40:57] Guillermo Fuenzalida: adc? auto detection?
[2024-01-11T16:42:11] sombre_enfant: The Throttle....
[2024-01-11T16:44:46] Guillermo Fuenzalida: sorry, im not an expert, first time and experience with vesc tool, so terminology begginer. im using a nami burne as a whole, and replacing the original controllers with makerbase 75200, and pretending to use everything else from scooter, except the lcd screen, so i asume, ill use same throttle and cable ¿?
[2024-01-11T16:59:27] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2024-01-11T17:19:29] Rose: Hey there Hemi, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-11T17:28:05] Rose: Hey there Hemi, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-11T17:28:59] Hemi Murin: Hi, can you advise please now I have a 33a flashlight 21700x98, g30d controller, bms 80A, mantis 1000w. I want to connect a 500w front and a flipsky 7100 controller to the back. will I need 2x dashboards? upload new software to flipsky 7100? rework the color wiring from the original g30? Thank you
[2024-01-11T17:50:23] francois schempers: you should be able to use everything that comes with the scooter, Vesc measure and adapte to most throttle and brake, and if you're in the few case it can't, you have adaptor board for it, like this one https://spintend.com/products/ewheel-adc-adapter-v2-for-diy-ebike-escooter
[2024-01-11T17:52:57] francois schempers: if both controller are Vesc you should be able to setup main controller where everything goes (throttle, brakes, etc) and a slave one that just follows what the mains one is doing, you have to connect them via the can bus
[2024-01-11T17:54:37] francois schempers: if you have g30 controller in front and Vesc in the back its the jankiest setup I've seen x) better off selling your g30 controller and do dual Vesc, much less of a hassle
[2024-01-11T18:28:19] Mirono escooters: Especially for price of VEsc nowadays
[2024-01-11T18:54:27] francois schempers: better off going dual g30, that's a solution too
[2024-01-11T18:55:22] haku: you guys are lucky the teachers are very involved with students there. here they dont give AF
[2024-01-11T18:57:40] francois schempers: Hemi

[2024-01-11T18:57:55] haku: are you that coding guy in youtube?
[2024-01-11T19:00:36] Simone: approximately 35A per parallel. but it's a 7p not 6p as I remembered...so 245A
[2024-01-11T19:02:12] NetworkDir: https://github.com/aka13-404/VSETT-LISP
[2024-01-11T19:04:07] Mirono escooters: So much work tho, and Problably more euro then 2 vescs xD
[2024-01-11T19:04:22] Mirono escooters: Since lisp script, I don't see the point anymore
[2024-01-11T19:06:59] haku: @PaoloWu did you just leave the mesh on you glitter welder or yours came with real silicone cables? mine is sketchy with just a mesh
[2024-01-11T19:08:53] Paolo ⁭: I use the stock
[2024-01-11T19:11:24] haku: this is what it came with. its a mesh
[2024-01-11T19:12:37] haku: im thinking of changing it to a more protected one. i got the wrong size sleeves for my ly motor so ill just use it here
[2024-01-11T19:13:08] haku: also removing the stupid spring inside the pens
[2024-01-11T19:20:02] Hemi Murin: thanks for the advice. I ordered another 75100
[2024-01-11T19:28:56] Hemi Murin: When connecting the dual vesc, proceed in the same way as for the g30
[2024-01-11T19:42:14] Finn: I have the same idea
[2024-01-11T19:42:26] Finn: Only with 20s
[2024-01-11T19:42:32] Finn: And rear disk brake
[2024-01-11T19:43:05] Hemi Murin: Canbus connect?
[2024-01-11T19:44:33] francois schempers: dedicated port on Vesc
[2024-01-11T19:44:34] Finn: Canbus connect
[2024-01-11T19:54:27] Hemi Murin: I see now. thank you ❤️
[2024-01-11T20:00:58] Hemi Murin: This need for dual motor and 2x 75100 and 2x dashboard?
[2024-01-11T20:30:50] sombre_enfant: No only a Dashboard and two vesc
[2024-01-11T20:32:24] Hemi Murin: One dashboard?
[2024-01-11T20:39:34] Guillermo Fuenzalida: anyone knows, what this means, over my 75200 controller?
[2024-01-11T20:39:37] Guillermo Fuenzalida: <photos/photo_12126@11-01-2024_20-39-37.jpg>
[2024-01-11T20:40:08] Guillermo Fuenzalida: <photos/photo_12127@11-01-2024_20-40-08.jpg>
[2024-01-11T20:41:49] Guillermo Fuenzalida: VCC, i asume, should be 5v?
[2024-01-11T20:52:29] Mirono escooters: Depends wich voltage you want
[2024-01-11T20:52:46] Mirono escooters: Its cool makerbase has a switch like that, great idea
[2024-01-11T20:55:32] Guillermo Fuenzalida: i want? that i dont get, i thought 5v was the standard?
[2024-01-11T20:57:39] Mirono escooters: Really? Finally. Makerbase caught a good engineer..
[2024-01-11T20:57:44] haku: dam thats on a scooter? or ebike?
[2024-01-11T20:59:41] Mirono escooters: That's sketch
[2024-01-11T20:59:48] haku: those are pretty new model cells? i cant find a US vendor for it?
[2024-01-11T21:00:15] Mirono escooters: Pretty new, high capacity low discharge
[2024-01-11T21:00:38] haku: thats range for days wow
[2024-01-11T21:01:20] Guillermo Fuenzalida: thanks, 3.3v it is. My questions aim to NOT BURN on my first try
[2024-01-11T21:02:28] Mirono escooters: Yeah, got it in my g30, can cruise for ages
[2024-01-11T21:02:31] Mirono escooters: I'm tired before battery is
[2024-01-11T21:09:42] haku: its 20a discharge isnt it? thats pretty good with that capacity
[2024-01-11T21:09:47] Guillermo Fuenzalida: and the DC-DC switch, means, to enable or disable the power on of the controller, using the on/off switch from the scooter?
[2024-01-11T21:11:39] haku: its really good actually perfect for pevs
[2024-01-11T21:12:09] sombre_enfant: Do llt bms can safely turn it off and on ?
[2024-01-11T21:13:58] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-01-11T21:14:03] Mirono escooters: I do that daily
[2024-01-11T21:14:19] sombre_enfant: Cool
[2024-01-11T21:14:50] Mirono escooters: Ant is better with precharge But unless huge load with caps, no worries
[2024-01-11T21:16:58] Guillermo Fuenzalida: thx!
[2024-01-11T21:24:28] Gabe Enzo: 20a discharge is beast as is
[2024-01-11T21:24:44] Mirono escooters: Welp, mine been going for months :p
[2024-01-11T21:24:46] Gabe Enzo: but this cell is best of both worlds very interesting
[2024-01-11T21:24:57] Mirono escooters: Asi and fardriver quality is very debatable
[2024-01-11T21:24:58] Gabe Enzo: Where you gonna put that?
[2024-01-11T21:29:53] sombre_enfant: Mks75100 ?
[2024-01-11T21:30:23] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-01-11T21:30:39] Mirono escooters: Just wired key to the SW pins, everyday turn on off
[2024-01-11T21:52:47] Mirono escooters: Ive got 0 idea why that happened But this is just normal turn off, if this kills can, I kill VEsc : D
[2024-01-11T21:53:25] Mirono escooters: I didn't mod ignition, so should be ok 👍 Turns off whole power from BMS
[2024-01-11T21:58:31] Izuna 生活: damn
[2024-01-11T22:05:58] Mirono escooters: No, no
[2024-01-11T22:06:10] Mirono escooters: I wired switch (key) to SW pin Then enable key mode in LLT And boom
[2024-01-11T22:07:49] haku: the battery lords. is that for a scooter too?
[2024-01-11T22:10:16] Happy Giraffe: Finalized design?
[2024-01-11T22:10:54] Happy Giraffe: He has stock surron esc and motor?
[2024-01-11T22:24:21] sombre_enfant: He needed tc1000
[2024-01-11T22:26:01] Happy Giraffe: Would be shame for his 20s13p surron to get smoked by my 1000w bike😂
[2024-01-11T22:26:56] haku: why is torpe a good choice for these surron boys?
[2024-01-11T22:27:18] haku: i thought they are bad.
[2024-01-11T22:28:50] Happy Giraffe: And this was against "12kw" surron😂 Idk how much they use at stock. The BBSHD was pulling 4kw and had same performance +-5%
[2024-01-11T22:29:55] haku: ok. gotcha
[2024-01-11T22:31:09] Happy Giraffe: Haha, so surron had 3x the power of stock I see😂
[2024-01-11T22:32:02] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/ttVPZBSEW3o?si=uhRcODUP8an6nuyn
[2024-01-11T22:32:36] Happy Giraffe: Insanity for these kind of power levels pulled. If temp is not a problem I should be able to push it even more with a good motor tune
[2024-01-11T22:33:10] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/VOZwbD05p-w?si=pXpkpai0htVesLgL
[2024-01-11T22:33:14] Happy Giraffe: It had😁 after 60kmh tho the surron pulls more because of the battery amps. I wonder if BBSHD kept the 100A current all the way through what would have happened instead of dropping it to 50A
[2024-01-11T22:35:23] NetworkDir: Magura package ? :D
[2024-01-11T22:35:50] Happy Giraffe: He got it on the motor body haha, useless but yeah. I would definitely have it on stator where it should
[2024-01-11T22:36:32] Gabe Enzo: Lmfao
[2024-01-11T22:36:43] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_12128@11-01-2024_22-36-43.jpg>
[2024-01-11T22:36:54] Happy Giraffe: But having 2000€ motor, battery and drivetrain + bicycle frame pulling same as 10,000€ surron its a laughing stock of a moped
[2024-01-11T22:36:55] Gabe Enzo: piece of honey?
[2024-01-11T22:38:40] haku: are torpe motors good too?
[2024-01-11T22:39:37] Happy Giraffe: I dont think so if the bbshd is on even lighter frame😅 On proper setup they can have 250Nm+ wheel torque and still reach 80kmh+ topspeed at 72v😳 Thats the spot Im aiming for
[2024-01-11T22:40:35] Happy Giraffe: This is already with 40% field weakeninf
[2024-01-11T22:41:18] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I guess the BAC guys calculate if from normal batt amps
[2024-01-11T22:41:42] Happy Giraffe: Having all of this on a sub 40kg bike will be insanity🌚
[2024-01-11T22:41:55] Mirono escooters: Rlly can recommend
[2024-01-11T22:42:25] Happy Giraffe: And being 100% legal when limited to 25kmh as its 1000w in marketing and known motor for that
[2024-01-11T22:42:48] Happy Giraffe: It does depending on fw levels
[2024-01-11T22:43:51] Happy Giraffe: Stock is quite bad, depends on gearing etc. 72V with FW gets so high rpm that it benefits greatly from the chain reduction or rather a 42T-38T ish sprockets
[2024-01-11T22:45:13] Happy Giraffe: BBSHD has a bad chainline on most of the bikes sadly. That's why people rip their chains, got a friend to guide me on building a proper drivetrain so I can swap 20€ chains once a year😅 very cost effective if done right
[2024-01-11T22:56:38] Gabe Enzo: advertised as 70 I believe (meaning it can barely push 60'
[2024-01-11T22:56:51] Gabe Enzo: for 20s
[2024-01-11T22:57:15] Happy Giraffe: Actually no need, if chain is straight and has a higher speed it stresses it less. Yeah can put a beefier chain but really not needed😁
[2024-01-12T00:05:34] haku: how you like my copper chain dawg?
[2024-01-12T00:06:06] Gabe Enzo: Highly conductive.
[2024-01-12T00:43:08] haku: ooh i got a product from sweden. i dont know why i have this 😂 i dont smoke
[2024-01-12T00:58:22] Ion: I'm curious if there are good FANLESS charger options for 13s or 16s and 5+ A
[2024-01-12T00:58:40] Ion: shit's so annoying lol, especially at night
[2024-01-12T05:31:58] haku: @Happy_Giraffe @Her0DasH have you heard of this brand before. paid youtube reviews look pretty good
[2024-01-12T10:51:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No idea of the brand Looks has lot knowledge, no idea how good Mig mag avi and plasmacutter, you need even more if you buy it Like most uses gases also Welding wires Gear to not get burnt Avi helmet and one for the rest Probably no need for the airfilter helmet , that can make probs Than they save
[2024-01-12T10:52:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also check what power it needs
[2024-01-12T10:52:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Standard outlet maybe low for max knowledge of the avi part
[2024-01-12T10:53:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than you probably swich fuses off😁
[2024-01-12T10:55:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Once with 3 mag welders Welding each around 150 A-200A we made whole electric clock melt completely 🤣 Whole was on fire , so yeah fuses didn't saved that But was an old type
[2024-01-12T10:57:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: my workshop area has 400 v also and wiring to poweroutlets are 2,5mm thickness each
[2024-01-12T12:17:09] Nirel: Hi friends I need help 🙏 Now I finished to connect the flipsky 75200 pro The problem is the hardware that doesn't recognize him properly. What should be done?
[2024-01-12T12:30:38] Mirono escooters: Flash it correctly with the community firmware on esk8
[2024-01-12T12:37:02] Nirel: How I do it?
[2024-01-12T12:37:45] Mirono escooters: By flashing it
[2024-01-12T12:38:15] puneDir: this time zeros front tire is flat
[2024-01-12T12:38:21] puneDir: wtf is wrong with this tires
[2024-01-12T12:38:29] Mirono escooters: Anyone in Europa need a zero 10x frame? Controllers rust but Problably work. Dash too, battery is gone. Front brake leaks, rear ok Motors ok Frame pretty ok, little stem wobble Light control board gone
[2024-01-12T12:38:46] puneDir: Where
[2024-01-12T12:38:49] puneDir: How much
[2024-01-12T12:38:49] Nirel: I need to press on upload button?
[2024-01-12T12:38:51] Mirono escooters: Belgium, lol
[2024-01-12T12:38:55] Mirono escooters: Doubt I get it in turkey
[2024-01-12T12:39:12] puneDir: 😖
[2024-01-12T12:39:24] puneDir: Btw how much is it Just wondered
[2024-01-12T12:39:52] Mirono escooters: Like a hundred bucks 😂
[2024-01-12T12:40:00] NetworkDir: <animation>
[2024-01-12T12:40:01] Mirono escooters: Want it gone, in my way, I can't use the motors
[2024-01-12T12:40:13] Mirono escooters: And am not putting it on g30
[2024-01-12T12:40:37] puneDir: wish turkey had better custom shit
[2024-01-12T12:40:39] Mirono escooters: Non
[2024-01-12T12:40:51] NetworkDir: i think you can import
[2024-01-12T12:40:57] Mirono escooters: You can normal scrol down and flash a .bin Download. Bin from esk8 site
[2024-01-12T12:41:07] puneDir: Another 100 to import
[2024-01-12T12:41:10] NetworkDir: for 100$ you purchase + 200$ for shipping + 200$ for import
[2024-01-12T12:41:14] puneDir: Another 100 to shipping
[2024-01-12T12:41:19] Mirono escooters: Well anyway I want it gone, pm me if interested
[2024-01-12T12:41:27] puneDir: 500 for frame Not a good idea
[2024-01-12T12:41:34] NetworkDir: frame + motors?
[2024-01-12T12:41:41] Nirel: Now I get it, thanks
[2024-01-12T12:41:42] puneDir: Only Frame
[2024-01-12T12:41:50] NetworkDir: hmm
[2024-01-12T12:42:01] Mirono escooters: Guy wants to sell it for me, but I don't want a Zero 10x, I don't like them Stupid big useless scooter 😂
[2024-01-12T12:42:28] NetworkDir: Do not insult zero 10x😂
[2024-01-12T12:42:38] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2024-01-12T12:43:23] Mirono escooters: Is there a zero telegram group?
[2024-01-12T12:43:25] Mirono escooters: Maybe Facebook
[2024-01-12T12:43:30] puneDir: Why you dont like it?
[2024-01-12T12:43:38] puneDir: Cuz water shit?
[2024-01-12T12:43:52] NetworkDir: He likes small and delicate scooters
[2024-01-12T12:43:55] Mirono escooters: Tiny ah battery frame, useless, water shit, ...
[2024-01-12T12:44:11] Mirono escooters: And this. But that doesn't matter Compared to vsett 10+, man, this sucks 😂
[2024-01-12T12:44:32] Mirono escooters: women scoots ✅
[2024-01-12T12:44:56] NetworkDir: In general, the battery and the quality of vsett parts are not much higher than zero It is only in stem design and looks better
[2024-01-12T12:44:59] Mirono escooters: And I myself don't need a big scoot in city, I live wrong If I lived in country id buy it
[2024-01-12T12:45:05] puneDir: Batt sucks Frame good actually just print a extender Excellent suspension Good motors Good brakes Nice looking
[2024-01-12T12:45:10] Mirono escooters: Bwuh, sure
[2024-01-12T12:45:34] puneDir: How much is vsett 10+ currently
[2024-01-12T12:45:38] Mirono escooters: Too much
[2024-01-12T12:45:41] puneDir: @NetworkDir
[2024-01-12T12:45:57] Mirono escooters: And btw, extender isn't helping with water heh And still, tiny space
[2024-01-12T12:46:00] puneDir: But for speeding i think g30 is better than zero and vsett
[2024-01-12T12:46:05] Mirono escooters: And brakes suck, lol
[2024-01-12T12:46:10] puneDir: Noooo brakes nice
[2024-01-12T12:46:12] Mirono escooters: Anyway overall ok scoot
[2024-01-12T12:46:19] Mirono escooters: They leaking 🤡
[2024-01-12T12:46:21] puneDir: G30 feels more trusty
[2024-01-12T12:46:29] Mirono escooters: But not for me So sell time. Dad angry I take all space
[2024-01-12T12:46:35] puneDir: Its like an arrow So stiff
[2024-01-12T12:46:54] puneDir: Zero doesnt feels that much trusty
[2024-01-12T12:47:00] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-01-12T12:47:06] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_12133@12-01-2024_12-47-06.jpg>
[2024-01-12T12:47:09] NetworkDir: poor weld
[2024-01-12T12:48:05] Nirel: I don’t found bin that fits this controller, could you direct me where it is on the website?
[2024-01-12T12:48:14] puneDir: @NetworkDir how much is vsett10+ currently
[2024-01-12T12:49:08] NetworkDir: in general : Bigger frame = more space for battery. vsett motors are suitable for speed (higher kv than zero) The frame design is more beautiful than Zero controller = trash Battery (CN version) = trash
[2024-01-12T12:49:30] NetworkDir: In turkiye vsett = 85.000 lira and zero = 55.000 lira
[2024-01-12T12:49:47] NetworkDir: It is not worth 85,000 lira at all
[2024-01-12T12:50:32] puneDir: Building g30 is cheaper
[2024-01-12T12:50:55] NetworkDir: But it requires a lot of effort
[2024-01-12T12:51:48] NetworkDir: wtf in eu vsett 10+ cheaper than zero
[2024-01-12T12:51:49] NetworkDir: :/
[2024-01-12T12:52:18] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha, yes
[2024-01-12T12:52:25] Mirono escooters: That's why
[2024-01-12T12:53:11] NetworkDir: Well, I would definitely buy vsett if I was in Europe. Unfortunately, at the moment, I am doing a completely custom zero project, of course, except for the frame (even the stem). The stock thing is left from zero😂
[2024-01-12T12:53:26] NetworkDir: Custom stem Custom batt pack + smart bms Ubox
[2024-01-12T12:53:31] NetworkDir: just motor and frame stock lol
[2024-01-12T12:53:32] Mirono escooters: Keep us updated
[2024-01-12T12:53:47] Mirono escooters: I like the zero motors, but I'm not putting em on g30 And I have no other scoot
[2024-01-12T12:54:23] NetworkDir: They are good motors
[2024-01-12T12:54:40] Mirono escooters: But not for me
[2024-01-12T12:54:49] Mirono escooters: Time to fb marketplace 50€ it
[2024-01-12T12:55:12] NetworkDir: https://t.me/g30mod/54326 he put 100A b - 210A phase to single drive ☠️

[2024-01-12T20:32:15] Rose: Hey there Franchesco, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-12T20:40:36] Guillermo Fuenzalida: Please? 🙏
[2024-01-12T20:40:39] Mirono escooters: Must be crazy short peak and fet legs .1mm long xD
[2024-01-12T20:40:45] Mirono escooters: Adc1/2
[2024-01-12T20:40:54] Mirono escooters: 1 throttle 2 brake
[2024-01-12T20:41:15] Mirono escooters: Remember to use or a voltage divider or a 3.3v throttle (Or do these have divider build in?) I forgor
[2024-01-12T20:49:30] Guillermo Fuenzalida: So 3.3v is shared within throttle and brake sensor?
[2024-01-12T20:49:32] Guillermo Fuenzalida: ????
[2024-01-12T20:50:58] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2024-01-12T20:51:12] Mirono escooters: I think you need more "???"
[2024-01-12T20:51:59] puneDir: I wonder something but pls dont bully We need so thick wires to move power But things like mosfet legs are thin and small How do they dont act like a fuse?
[2024-01-12T20:57:22] Mirono escooters: Good question MOSFETs legs are suuper duper short, to220 on flipsky for example right on pcb And the toll pins are even closer, right on pcb. Length matters (sus) And the power is half through MOSFET, 6 fets for 3 phases
[2024-01-12T20:57:44] Guillermo Fuenzalida: My brake sensor has only 2 cables. How does it goes?
[2024-01-12T20:57:57] Guillermo Fuenzalida: <photos/photo_12153@12-01-2024_20-57-57.jpg>
[2024-01-12T20:58:13] Mirono escooters: Oh, between 3.3v and Adc2
[2024-01-12T20:58:36] Mirono escooters: It will be "on/off" don't use too high ebrake and be prepared xD Use slow ramp up Or use a hall sensor brake
[2024-01-12T21:01:57] Yamal: Sensor brake ? Please
[2024-01-12T21:02:58] Mirono escooters: Adc2
[2024-01-12T21:03:58] Yamal: Thanks

[2024-01-12T21:08:50] Hemi Murin: Hello guys, just want to ask, i'm thinking about upgrading my G30d controller to get higher top speed and maybe also higher power (ampere output).. Is there some way to replace just condensators or mossfets. Thanks for advice!
[2024-01-12T21:09:03] Mirono escooters: Not VEsc
[2024-01-12T21:09:08] Mirono escooters: And you talk English
[2024-01-12T21:10:03] sombre_enfant: I speak le franjavava its a language from Lyon u can ask sibclimb
[2024-01-12T21:10:32] Mirono escooters: I don't care, English group, first and last warning Always you french guys doing it
[2024-01-12T21:16:34] Paolo ⁭: Estop not ， mt5 normal and mt5e yes
[2024-01-12T21:17:03] haku: what is the difference?
[2024-01-12T21:17:34] Paolo ⁭: Mt5estop better for more intensive use
[2024-01-12T21:17:45] Paolo ⁭: Mt5e is mt5 with brake sensor
[2024-01-12T21:17:58] haku: gotcha thanks

[2024-01-12T21:18:26] puneDir: When you got a flat but lazy to patch or replace the tube
[2024-01-12T21:18:32] haku: im shopping for brakes that are right side brakes. stuff on sale
[2024-01-12T21:18:50] puneDir: Btw for some reason zero's tires always explode
[2024-01-12T21:19:08] haku: get tubeless rims
[2024-01-12T21:19:16] puneDir: motor is split rim
[2024-01-12T21:19:32] puneDir: Its impossible to get motors in turkey
[2024-01-12T21:19:55] haku: mr. wu can probably smuggle them in
[2024-01-12T21:20:33] puneDir: We tried but
[2024-01-12T21:20:38] puneDir: Custom guy said impossible

[2024-01-12T21:23:50] haku: what happened to then 11" motor you were planning on doing?
[2024-01-12T21:24:05] haku: kaabo motors
[2024-01-12T21:24:08] puneDir: I have 50h's now but i need fronk fork
[2024-01-12T21:24:24] puneDir: Cengiz making one but some part is missing and were still waiting for it
[2024-01-12T21:24:52] haku: i was hoping you do it because ill be doing something similar but jank
[2024-01-12T21:25:23] haku: like extending dropouts to 152mm
[2024-01-12T21:25:38] haku: no suspension
[2024-01-12T21:26:43] puneDir: No suspension is impossible for my city
[2024-01-12T21:26:53] puneDir: In here even zero suspension is not enough sometimes
[2024-01-12T21:27:09] puneDir: I will make custom suspension to nini sometime
[2024-01-12T21:29:41] haku: do you know how to weld aluminum?
[2024-01-12T21:30:01] Guillermo Fuenzalida: Ok then, lets go
[2024-01-12T21:30:17] puneDir: No
[2024-01-12T21:30:19] Guillermo Fuenzalida: <photos/photo_12155@12-01-2024_21-30-19.jpg>
[2024-01-12T21:30:24] puneDir: But cengizs welder can lol
[2024-01-12T21:31:11] Gabe Enzo: Yes, I put that into consideration.
[2024-01-12T21:31:27] sombre_enfant: Battery ? Motor ? Space left to fit inside the vesc ?
[2024-01-12T21:31:38] puneDir: @mrstealyogirI dont try to do wheelies
[2024-01-12T21:31:56] Gabe Enzo: Wasn't planning to, I'm not a surronfag
[2024-01-12T21:32:07] Gabe Enzo: Plus, I value my head.
[2024-01-12T21:32:22] Gabe Enzo: had enough head injuries as is

[2024-01-12T21:34:25] haku: nice photo!
[2024-01-12T21:35:16] haku: did you take that photo on your nikon? or phone?

[2024-01-12T21:47:38] Gabe Enzo: Now that's what I call a bag
[2024-01-12T21:47:42] Gabe Enzo: what's in there?
[2024-01-12T21:47:55] Gabe Enzo: also what scooter is that???
[2024-01-12T21:48:07] sombre_enfant: Nami burn e2
[2024-01-12T21:48:16] Gabe Enzo: What motors, they look nicee
[2024-01-12T21:48:31] Happy Giraffe: For Magura brakes get the metal lever version or make shigura. The plastic levers should be banned by EU/US officials for being insanely stupid and dangerous
[2024-01-12T21:48:54] puneDir: Whats the max safe field weakening for 75200?
[2024-01-12T21:49:08] Happy Giraffe: Heard too many stories of snapped levers and people without brakes its insanity
[2024-01-12T21:49:23] haku: is there a version that doesnt have so many decals and branding?
[2024-01-12T21:50:53] Happy Giraffe: You could also search for the Bosch ABS version without the ABS unit itself. All metal brake set, even master cylinder
[2024-01-12T21:51:33] haku: ill see if bosch is available here. im sure theres some
[2024-01-12T21:55:08] haku: @Happy_Giraffe what is a good small lathe machine for little things?
[2024-01-12T21:55:29] haku: like making screws boring small holes?
[2024-01-12T21:55:30] sombre_enfant: 60-70A
[2024-01-12T21:55:47] haku: something that can fit in desk
[2024-01-12T22:01:45] sombre_enfant: Tornos swiss nano
[2024-01-12T22:02:11] sombre_enfant: Or go 9 axis mill+ lathe
[2024-01-12T22:04:21] Mirono escooters: Wtf xd
[2024-01-12T22:04:28] Mirono escooters: Local makerspaces : D
[2024-01-12T22:04:53] Mirono escooters: Locally someone was selling one, looked cool but didn't need
[2024-01-12T22:06:44] sombre_enfant: Im doing 2500mm 300mm diameter screw now for plastic extrusion
[2024-01-12T22:10:25] haku: that looks huge. i need a little tiny one to make 10-20mm cylinders
[2024-01-12T22:10:59] haku: i check out offer up
[2024-01-12T22:11:35] Mirono escooters: Buy secondhand, not new
[2024-01-12T22:11:58] Mirono escooters: But local makershop (merika maybe less) here great
[2024-01-12T22:14:30] haku: aww man. these things arw pricey
[2024-01-12T22:14:50] haku: ill lowball for $500
[2024-01-12T22:16:40] haku: is it possible to make a jank lathe with a hand drill? making suff like this
[2024-01-12T22:18:37] NetworkDir: Windows moment☕️ (POV: your windows got a bluescreen at safemode and you try to backup desktop).
[2024-01-12T22:19:20] haku: thats the bbc virus im talking about
[2024-01-12T22:19:40] Tommy ª: that is why im still on win7
[2024-01-12T22:19:44] Tommy ª: just no bsod
[2024-01-12T22:20:01] NetworkDir: No i just disable valorant anti cheat service 😁
[2024-01-12T22:20:25] NetworkDir: Stupid game + AC
[2024-01-12T22:20:32] NetworkDir: Linux time
[2024-01-12T22:20:51] Tommy ª: i have nvidia 😭
[2024-01-12T22:20:57] NetworkDir: Lol
[2024-01-12T22:24:04] puneDir: How to disable brake handles from vesc completely
[2024-01-12T22:24:07] haku: i dont get it. whats wrong with nvidia?
[2024-01-12T22:24:32] Tommy ª: drivers issues
[2024-01-12T22:24:43] haku: i see. 😂
[2024-01-12T22:26:22] haku: bangood always have the answers to my dumb questions
[2024-01-12T22:30:07] Mirono escooters: Wood
[2024-01-12T22:30:54] haku: i see. would it be possible to convert a drill press or a hand drill into a lathe?
[2024-01-12T22:31:12] Hemi Murin: Help!! 😀😀😀
[2024-01-12T22:31:44] haku: i was checking this out a couple of days ago. might have to jank the setup abit
[2024-01-12T22:32:15] Hemi Murin: Hello guys, just want to ask, i'm thinking about upgrading my G30d controller to get higher top speed and maybe also higher power (ampere output).. Is there some way to replace just condensators or mossfets. Thanks for advice!
[2024-01-12T22:32:59] Gabe Enzo: You need to replace micro resistors, MOSFETs, capacitors and do much more things
[2024-01-12T22:33:02] Happy Giraffe: Screws holes?😅 What?😂😂😂
[2024-01-12T22:33:50] haku: lol. im trying to make mini sruff like this
[2024-01-12T22:34:36] Mirono escooters: Bweh
[2024-01-12T22:34:47] Mirono escooters: I'd really take evening cnc lessons
[2024-01-12T22:34:49] Happy Giraffe: Thats an axle bro😂 and to lathe harder materials it wont fit into desk as it weighs a lot, lets say 500kg / 1 ton lbs minimum
[2024-01-12T22:35:06] Mirono escooters: Yeah, hardened steel machine just destroys itself
[2024-01-12T22:35:10] Mirono escooters: Aluminium maybe with those tiny xD
[2024-01-12T22:36:41] haku: ok ill youtube more and learn about it 😂
[2024-01-12T22:36:43] Hemi Murin: What exactly mean the much more things? 😀
[2024-01-12T22:37:22] Mirono escooters: This is Vesc chat
[2024-01-12T22:37:33] Mirono escooters: I answered you in g30 chat already
[2024-01-12T22:40:02] Hemi Murin: But only to desolder components and do the staff with no real advice 😁😁
[2024-01-12T22:50:09] Happy Giraffe: "VESC" chat no other stuff here than VESC controllers
[2024-01-12T22:52:27] haku: just replace the whole comtroller if you want more power
[2024-01-12T22:53:24] Marco Agazzi: <video_file>
[2024-01-12T22:53:28] puneDir: Finally
[2024-01-12T22:53:46] Marco Agazzi: With the great help of @punedir everything is finally perfect
[2024-01-12T22:54:01] Marco Agazzi: I wish you all the best
[2024-01-12T22:54:08] puneDir: Me too bro have fun :D
[2024-01-12T22:54:20] puneDir: Drive safe
[2024-01-12T22:54:27] Marco Agazzi: thx bro
[2024-01-12T23:03:02] haku: not an axle its this part. kinda like a spacer.
[2024-01-12T23:08:36] Guillermo Fuenzalida: Why when accelerate, as soon as i release throttle, motors brake themselves?
[2024-01-12T23:08:39] Happy Giraffe: Very cheap to give a guy with manual lathe a starting material with same diameter or bit more from your preferred material choice
[2024-01-12T23:08:58] Happy Giraffe: Its like 5-10 minutes of work
[2024-01-12T23:09:05] Guillermo Fuenzalida: <video_file>
[2024-01-12T23:09:34] Guillermo Fuenzalida: Is there a specific setting, to. Make motors loose, when i release the throttle?
[2024-01-12T23:09:41] Happy Giraffe: You have chosen some weird throttle type in ADC settings
[2024-01-12T23:10:27] Happy Giraffe: Usual setting for throttle and regen brake option is "ADC 1 current ADC2 brake no reverse"
[2024-01-12T23:11:03] haku: good idea. but i also want to learn the basics of how a lathe works. experience it i mean
[2024-01-12T23:11:17] Happy Giraffe: If you have two throttles to accelerate and brake
[2024-01-12T23:11:33] haku: make small spacers and stuff
[2024-01-12T23:11:59] Happy Giraffe: Not worth it Imo, need a big garage to do any useful stuff
[2024-01-12T23:12:37] Guillermo Fuenzalida: I dont want regen, just free throttle
[2024-01-12T23:12:55] Guillermo Fuenzalida: <photos/photo_12165@12-01-2024_23-12-55.jpg>
[2024-01-12T23:13:16] Happy Giraffe: Lathes make a lot of mess and noise, if you buy crappy one without a digital display then its not enjoyable to use
[2024-01-12T23:13:18] haku: gotcha. i already have the materialJust found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $0.58 67%OFF | 303 Stainless Steel Rod Diameter 1mm-10mm Shaft 8mm 4mm 5mm 6mm 8mm 10mm Linear Shaft 3d Printer Parts 8mm 100-500mm Long 400mm https://a.aliexpress.com/_msM5mxS
[2024-01-12T23:13:50] Happy Giraffe: If its standard size, I would guess most machine shops have those in shelf
[2024-01-12T23:14:17] Paolo ⁭: Do again input wizard
[2024-01-12T23:14:47] haku: its metric bro. im asuming this will be special order and murikan labor is expensive
[2024-01-12T23:15:10] Happy Giraffe: Then just select "current"
[2024-01-12T23:15:59] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt matter, lathe guy can make 10mm rod from 1/2" rod ezpz Would be a less than 10min job for me and wouldnt ask more than 10$ + material lol
[2024-01-12T23:16:30] Marco Agazzi: thanks also to @PaoloWu for recommending this group
[2024-01-12T23:16:31] haku: i see. ill look up local shops.
[2024-01-12T23:16:47] Guillermo Fuenzalida: Excelent!
[2024-01-12T23:18:29] Guillermo Fuenzalida: One last question, is it possible to add and configure an On/OFF button, to turn on and OFF both controllers?
[2024-01-12T23:19:42] Guillermo Fuenzalida: <video_file>
[2024-01-12T23:19:54] Happy Giraffe: Not sure about that vesc but it should have port for power button if yes
[2024-01-12T23:20:47] Happy Giraffe: Then just use a latching on/off button on it depending on connection schematics
[2024-01-12T23:22:13] Rose: Hey there Franchesco, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-12T23:22:49] Franchesco Carofano: Eh
[2024-01-12T23:37:26] haku: @jamessoderstrom heres a torpe surron. is this pretty good performance in EU standards? https://youtu.be/1culBfsLh8E?si=ypW2sGF9zfd5xfPd
[2024-01-12T23:40:23] Happy Giraffe: 24hp, bahh let me laugh worlds fastest on dyno😂🙈 I can also do 200kmh in air with my old xiaomi🌚
[2024-01-12T23:41:15] haku: he actually did it in street. with 2 gps verifications
[2024-01-12T23:41:46] haku: draggy and garmin gps
[2024-01-12T23:42:39] Happy Giraffe: Gotta respect him for that tho, usually they just dyno or in air bs
[2024-01-12T23:43:29] haku: agreed. i thoughtbit was dyno too. is this pretty good standards for e-moto?
[2024-01-12T23:44:16] haku: for me burnouts are the priority if im getting a surron.
[2024-01-12T23:45:59] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, it's good result but I'm thinking the frame can't handle that power for long. We have Ninebot G30 here that come close to this 5.5sec 0-100kmh. @AJAJ1992 How fast is the fastest accurately measured 0-100kmh on G30?
[2024-01-12T23:49:14] haku: im sure changing the gear ratio on the surron can make do those numbers. but it will be difficult the keep the front wheel down😂
[2024-01-12T23:50:20] Happy Giraffe: 4000w Mid drive on my next bike will give atleast 5 sec 0-70kmh😁 Even better with vesc MTPA and more batt amps I hope
[2024-01-12T23:51:44] haku: someday when used surron prices go down i secretly kimda want one 😂
[2024-01-12T23:52:36] haku: kids in the park destroying the trails give it a bad look. though
[2024-01-12T23:52:53] Happy Giraffe: Stock surrons goofy af
[2024-01-12T23:52:56] Yamal: Welcome , finally !
[2024-01-12T23:53:25] Happy Giraffe: Get a beefy ass steel frame DH bike with a Lightning rods motor and make it go vroom
[2024-01-12T23:53:31] Yamal: I want to see this nami ! 125/130kmh !
[2024-01-12T23:54:11] haku: if i was into fabricating like you i would. but surrons have bolt on parts available
[2024-01-12T23:54:14] Jan: We need to test again when its summer, we had about 7seconds
[2024-01-12T23:54:27] Jan: But with traction control off
[2024-01-12T23:54:27] Happy Giraffe: Will outperform all Surrons, perhaps come even the one on the video for much more maneuverable and nimble/bicycle look
[2024-01-12T23:54:46] haku: agreed
[2024-01-12T23:54:49] Happy Giraffe: And the traction on those smaller wheels is😅
[2024-01-12T23:56:22] Gabe Enzo: Look funny when people try flex them
[2024-01-12T23:56:46] Gabe Enzo: it's so cheap on Ali I think

[2024-01-13T04:24:10] Andrew Edwards: I have silicone as well this time to make sure it is sealed properly
[2024-01-13T05:04:35] Andrew Edwards: But the biggest question is whether it is going to work or be a waste of time
[2024-01-13T05:05:33] haku: it will aslongas your hall sensors are good and you did not scratch the copper enamel on the windings
[2024-01-13T06:09:00] haku: my humble begginings battery workspace is coming together nicely!
[2024-01-13T06:10:04] haku: i think i need to print more shelves
[2024-01-13T06:41:37] haku: thanks to aliexpress. if i did not find out about them last year this wouldnt be possible😢
[2024-01-13T11:22:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh wait, that is dual controller, not single, if so, yes can maybe believe
[2024-01-13T12:23:59] Happy Giraffe: Hub drive🙈 propably slow as fucks aswell due to it being Segway
[2024-01-13T12:46:35] Mirono escooters: It looks ok, brakes good, and Segway is quality
[2024-01-13T12:46:51] Mirono escooters: Guess Surron wasn't happy about rebrand
[2024-01-13T12:47:49] Happy Giraffe: Talaria etc also exists
[2024-01-13T12:48:07] Happy Giraffe: How do you plan to mount the 20s13p to surron😂
[2024-01-13T12:48:59] Happy Giraffe: No wonder it sucks lol
[2024-01-13T12:49:09] Mirono escooters: Oh tf

[2024-01-13T12:49:19] Happy Giraffe: Stark Varg🔛🔝
[2024-01-13T12:49:23] Mirono escooters: Sigh
[2024-01-13T12:49:39] Mirono escooters: Surron is pretty ok Segway is a good company, especially vs many scooter brands
[2024-01-13T12:50:44] Happy Giraffe: Im waiting in coma until someone else than Varg releases a good dirt bike or scooter that doesnt suck
[2024-01-13T12:50:53] Mirono escooters: Big brands namnamnam small
[2024-01-13T12:51:03] Mirono escooters: I'll have to do it
[2024-01-13T12:51:38] Happy Giraffe: Only if my frame building skills were better and had 10,000€ to spend...😂🙈
[2024-01-13T12:51:56] Mirono escooters: Money always limits And legalisation 🤢
[2024-01-13T12:52:17] Happy Giraffe: QS90 so cheap tho. Good for nimble bikes
[2024-01-13T13:03:21] Mirono escooters: How long ago was that?
[2024-01-13T13:06:39] Mirono escooters: I don't mind Xiaomi having Segway, it's a good combo
[2024-01-13T13:23:33] haku: that will make used surron prices way higher if they discontinue the surron brand 😭
[2024-01-13T13:32:49] Mirono escooters: No no, the Surron clone Not Surron brand
[2024-01-13T13:33:13] Mirono escooters: And real engineers 😎
[2024-01-13T13:44:33] Happy Giraffe: Stark Varg only proper electric vehicle I've seen yet. #changemymind
[2024-01-13T13:49:20] Happy Giraffe: Somehow people excuse them being electric to be a reason for bad engineering
[2024-01-13T13:50:10] haku: it does look like a gas moto too. ive never seen one
[2024-01-13T13:51:59] Konstantin: Boogiiiiie spot welder xDDD

[2024-01-13T15:24:16] puneDir: I havent tested the one i cleaned but it turns freely
[2024-01-13T15:24:28] puneDir: Maybe dead halls but sensorless is better
[2024-01-13T15:24:41] puneDir: We killed 2 vescs cuz bad halls
[2024-01-13T15:38:46] Happy Giraffe: I can propably make proper custom washers bit later. Planning to do them for the usual motor sizes so people would only need to drill one 6mm hole in scooter fork to get something that will never break loose or loosen the motor axle and spin
[2024-01-13T15:42:03] Happy Giraffe: If someone is interested🤔

[2024-01-13T21:23:51] Finn: @kawaiinekololis
[2024-01-13T21:42:08] sombre_enfant: Anybody know what increase cross section on a motor mean ?
[2024-01-13T22:05:16] Happy Giraffe: Thicker winding or phase?🤔

[2024-01-13T22:44:58] Gabe Enzo: As if that gas engine can move that at all
[2024-01-13T22:45:40] Gabe Enzo: probably 60 sec 0-50
[2024-01-13T22:46:23] haku: these guys build crazy stuff like crazy e gocarts and honda cbr powered honda ruckus.
[2024-01-13T22:49:05] haku: the cnc and welding they do is so cool to see too.
[2024-01-13T22:55:41] Happy Giraffe: Just pls dont tell you want cn mill/lathe combo at home to work hardened steel with😂
[2024-01-13T22:56:01] Mirono escooters: Every machines nightmare
[2024-01-13T22:56:53] haku: i dont even know these machines they use. but kinda want to get some if i had space and $$. i need a warehouse
[2024-01-13T22:57:05] Happy Giraffe: Typo, needed to say "at home" instead
[2024-01-13T22:57:19] Happy Giraffe: Best start from soldering😂
[2024-01-13T22:58:03] haku: but i was gonna start with metal work whats the most basic tool you need? welder and cutter yea?
[2024-01-13T22:59:36] haku: thats next years goals. i have to master spot welding first 😂
[2024-01-13T23:00:08] haku: and printing
[2024-01-13T23:00:27] haku: and speaking german
[2024-01-13T23:05:59] Gabe Enzo: Start now, each year it gets progressively harder, not easier.
[2024-01-13T23:06:04] Gabe Enzo: Especially as our brains age.
[2024-01-13T23:06:59] Happy Giraffe: Buy BMW, Mercedes or Audi and then learn the car user manual👍
[2024-01-13T23:07:57] haku: i have a old mercedes c300. manual in english. i hate that car. stupid enginuity

[2024-01-13T23:39:55] haku: i kinda learn bit by bit watching ww2 documentaries. and german pov ww2 movies. 😭
[2024-01-13T23:41:33] haku: i have to admit. 1940s germany was pretty innovative.❤️
[2024-01-13T23:43:34] haku: unpopular opinion though
[2024-01-13T23:53:20] Konstantin: 1 recommendation, add tvs diode. 20v ( mb can more, don't know which types of fets they used)
[2024-01-13T23:55:12] Mirono escooters: You mod everything 😲😜
[2024-01-13T23:55:35] Gabe Enzo: also where's the rest of it
[2024-01-13T23:55:39] Gabe Enzo: it better not come like that
[2024-01-13T23:55:44] Gabe Enzo: Or imma tear my head out
[2024-01-13T23:58:26] Konstantin: <photos/photo_12202@13-01-2024_23-58-26.jpg>
[2024-01-13T23:58:58] Konstantin: 801a 801d 801h
[2024-01-13T23:59:07] Gabe Enzo: Why do that mod tho
[2024-01-13T23:59:08] Gabe Enzo: ?
[2024-01-13T23:59:20] Konstantin: Power board + difference on capacitor resistance
[2024-01-14T00:00:00] Konstantin: Tvs diode must be in all version, it's protect MOSFET from bemf
[2024-01-14T00:00:01] haku: can the glitter 801 spot copper out of the box?
[2024-01-14T00:00:26] Gabe Enzo: 801D for sure, james said so, that's why I bought it.
[2024-01-14T00:00:52] haku: i shouldve went with this.
[2024-01-14T00:00:58] Gabe Enzo: What one did you get?
[2024-01-14T00:01:09] haku: glitter 811h
[2024-01-14T00:01:11] Konstantin: My mod from battery do this jobs fine.
[2024-01-14T00:01:17] Gabe Enzo: Just lower the kW.
[2024-01-14T00:01:20] Gabe Enzo: what's the issue
[2024-01-14T00:01:25] haku: blows holes thru copper. very unpredictable
[2024-01-14T00:01:37] Gabe Enzo: Then use thicker sheets maybe?
[2024-01-14T00:02:02] Konstantin: Not me shooting video, but device made by me.
[2024-01-14T00:02:09] haku: ive been experimenting. seems like .2copper and .2nickel is the best combo
[2024-01-14T00:02:30] haku: ill try .3 nickle or .3 copper
[2024-01-14T00:02:39] Gabe Enzo: Yeah I'm doing 0.1 copper and 0.15 nickel sandwich
[2024-01-14T00:02:44] Gabe Enzo: for my 8p moli cell.
[2024-01-14T00:02:57] Gabe Enzo: Should be enough for my 24-26kw peaks
[2024-01-14T00:03:09] Gabe Enzo: James said so so I trust him with my life here
[2024-01-14T00:03:40] Andrew Edwards: <video_file>
[2024-01-14T00:03:42] Gabe Enzo: 0.3 nickel will blow the cell. That's like 0.75 copper
[2024-01-14T00:03:58] Gabe Enzo: Is there any way to lower the power?
[2024-01-14T00:04:32] Gabe Enzo: or just 2x copper lmfao.
[2024-01-14T00:04:39] haku: with .2 copper it melts the copper and just fuses with the battery. resulting on copper splatters and weak weld
[2024-01-14T00:04:57] haku: <video_file>
[2024-01-14T00:05:14] Gabe Enzo: Try 0.2x2 and nickel, should dissipate the power enough.
[2024-01-14T00:05:25] Gabe Enzo: weld the copper first
[2024-01-14T00:05:27] Gabe Enzo: together.
[2024-01-14T00:05:28] haku: i cant replicate how i got it to weld last time for some reason
[2024-01-14T00:06:18] haku: yes copper and nickel is has a good hold. very strong it deforms the cell when peeling
[2024-01-14T00:06:44] Konstantin: Can you speen motor by hands?
[2024-01-14T00:07:10] Andrew Edwards: Yep
[2024-01-14T00:07:53] Andrew Edwards: <video_file>
[2024-01-14T00:08:16] Gabe Enzo: why wouldn't he be able to haha
[2024-01-14T00:08:45] Konstantin: + nickel add flexibility, and for durable. Pure cooper really easy to tear
[2024-01-14T00:08:45] Gabe Enzo: wanna switch welders XD
[2024-01-14T00:08:48] Gabe Enzo: I'll pay for postage
[2024-01-14T00:08:59] haku: agreed
[2024-01-14T00:09:23] Konstantin: Can run foc detection not from wizard?
[2024-01-14T00:09:30] haku: so irish of you 😂
[2024-01-14T00:09:53] Konstantin: <photos/photo_12204@14-01-2024_00-09-53.jpg>
[2024-01-14T00:10:18] haku: i just need more practice with this copper stuff. i already wasted 30x cells playing with it
[2024-01-14T00:10:47] Konstantin: It's ok... exp xD
[2024-01-14T00:11:10] Andrew Edwards: It’s a standard kaabo wwkgt
[2024-01-14T00:11:26] Andrew Edwards: No vesc controller
[2024-01-14T00:11:36] Konstantin: Just try it and report results
[2024-01-14T00:11:48] Konstantin: On video I can hear resistance meansure
[2024-01-14T00:12:40] Konstantin: And now, if you use stable firmware, they has issues, when you from vizard started 2 motors
[2024-01-14T00:13:40] Konstantin: Dual motor flux linkage measurement current spike bug fix.
[2024-01-14T00:14:08] Gabe Enzo: LOL this guy again, fastest ninebot my ass. My 300w Xiaomi went 6kmh faster.
[2024-01-14T00:14:11] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12205@14-01-2024_00-14-11.jpg>
[2024-01-14T00:14:43] haku: he fixed it atleast. saying g2.
[2024-01-14T00:14:51] Konstantin: They can run motor w/o halls?
[2024-01-14T00:15:01] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: When I’m going to lose some weight, or when there will be a Vesc model that will not overheat with me on it 😅😅😅 and Thank you! 🙏🏻
[2024-01-14T00:15:32] Gabe Enzo: Dual must solve that issue??
[2024-01-14T00:15:39] Fresh: Hey there can anyone tell me what this abs count ?
[2024-01-14T00:15:56] Gabe Enzo: Have you looked at the 18fet models?
[2024-01-14T00:16:13] haku: maybe you gonna get more views with vesc. milk the cow baby
[2024-01-14T00:16:21] Mirono escooters: That's a weird excuse
[2024-01-14T00:16:40] Mirono escooters: We got so powerful vescs now, that you can cool perfectly
[2024-01-14T00:16:41] Konstantin: Hall signal, or something like this, they have 2 abs data
[2024-01-14T00:16:51] Mirono escooters: Kelly makes much more heat, and is so big, ofcourse it overheat slower 😜
[2024-01-14T00:16:58] haku: do this in general chat. this place is for the trolls
[2024-01-14T00:17:00] Konstantin: Or erpm, didn't remember correctly
[2024-01-14T00:17:14] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Honestly I only tried Spintend 250A dual… but will try something else at one point for sure! I had the tronic controllers but I was afraid they will burn and they are not cheap so I sold them… quite poor soldering job on them… 250R versions😅
[2024-01-14T00:17:22] Fresh: Tanks
[2024-01-14T00:17:31] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Which one?
[2024-01-14T00:17:42] Fresh: Hey there can anyone tell me what this abs count ?
[2024-01-14T00:17:43] Mirono escooters: Spintend 250a sucks yes And tronic is very QC problem
[2024-01-14T00:17:49] Mirono escooters: 3shul seems for you
[2024-01-14T00:17:59] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: They are not big in size?
[2024-01-14T00:18:09] Gabe Enzo: Not as big as kelly
[2024-01-14T00:18:11] Gabe Enzo: Kek
[2024-01-14T00:18:11] Mirono escooters: You want cool or you want small? Hahaha
[2024-01-14T00:18:18] haku: it looks like a sabvoton 72100
[2024-01-14T00:18:22] Mirono escooters: Yep, dinosaur technology
[2024-01-14T00:18:26] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: I’ve seen them at Rage Mechanics in France …OMG what temperatures …
[2024-01-14T00:18:49] Gabe Enzo: Going 150 on a racetrack is different
[2024-01-14T00:18:57] puneDir: kelly is overrated
[2024-01-14T00:18:57] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-01-14T00:19:03] Mirono escooters: I doubt you'll find Kelly supporters here
[2024-01-14T00:19:16] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Dinosaurs but they handled me very well, and I even had to limit them by a lot so I don’t burn anything else 😅
[2024-01-14T00:19:20] haku: im a noob but isnt there more vesc options. g300 and 3shul come to mind for high voltage
[2024-01-14T00:19:31] puneDir: kelly has no settings 😖
[2024-01-14T00:19:50] Mirono escooters: G300 isn't for him, will overheat 3shul sure Trampa, UK company, also NEW Tronic is ok, very good
[2024-01-14T00:20:04] puneDir: bro needs 75100
[2024-01-14T00:20:15] puneDir: <animation>
[2024-01-14T00:20:55] Mirono escooters: Defenitily
[2024-01-14T00:21:31] Konstantin: Funny things, if I remember correctly, g300 use 18 toll8 fets, cl350 12 toll8 fets.
[2024-01-14T00:21:47] Andrew Edwards: No they only work when halls are attached tryed it with front motor so I’m thinking that it is the halls
[2024-01-14T00:22:02] Konstantin: <photos/photo_12208@14-01-2024_00-22-02.jpg>
[2024-01-14T00:22:02] Konstantin: <photos/photo_12209@14-01-2024_00-22-02.jpg>
[2024-01-14T00:22:17] Konstantin: 95% y
[2024-01-14T00:22:26] Кирилл: Different voltage range. Compare C350, not CL
[2024-01-14T00:22:44] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Yeah …Guess what!?! The buyer of my Zero11X scooter started to mess with the settings, he said I want more power, he didn’t even tried it outside, made the front motor go only when he was pressing the brake…I helped him to sort that out, then he took it out he loved it…but still did not listen and put the wrong parameters…he tried to do a 100m burnout and he blown the bullet plugs on the back motor…the ones from the motor not the ones from the controller … some people just don’t have any idea what they are doing really… sad to see this but lucky him he has someone that does repairs near and that he knows what he is doing…
[2024-01-14T00:22:50] Konstantin: Y, but both if them 12fets design
[2024-01-14T00:23:16] Кирилл: Yes, but g300 will burn at those power c350 can deliver
[2024-01-14T00:23:28] Konstantin: Funny things xD
[2024-01-14T00:23:48] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: How about these? https://youtu.be/dg6pq-FNdLM?si=7Wo6M9ggi-HOfrrN

[2024-01-14T00:24:51] Кирилл: @PaoloWu he does
[2024-01-14T00:25:12] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: I think he blocked me…as I sent him a message but no reply and I don’t see any videos online still
[2024-01-14T00:25:16] Mirono escooters: Well, that's why we lock settings down 🙈😅 I hate those kinds of people, ignorant, think there is no limit
[2024-01-14T00:25:23] NetworkDir: Phase Current + Battery Current ?
[2024-01-14T00:25:57] Mirono escooters: I've seen 1 screenshot xd
[2024-01-14T00:26:07] Konstantin: So... 12fets... 18 fets... 18 use classic pcb... 12 use alu pcm... Alu - magic xD

[2024-01-14T00:29:00] Paolo ⁭: Just nobody cares, because it's no easy for mass production
[2024-01-14T00:29:07] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: I miss it honestly …but what can I do…did not used it and times are hard …My Zero11X Supra is now a memory 😅

[2024-01-14T00:30:01] Mirono escooters: Lovely
[2024-01-14T00:30:04] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Bro, you are still in the business? What do you have now?
[2024-01-14T00:30:06] haku: mr. @XgunaX has a 11x and doing mad burnouts with a vesc
[2024-01-14T00:30:27] Paolo ⁭: Time, engineering, reliability, quality components and tests, nobody can compete with chinese
[2024-01-14T00:30:35] Paolo ⁭: U can compete with similar, like 3shul
[2024-01-14T00:31:00] Mirono escooters: Obviously
[2024-01-14T00:31:02] Paolo ⁭: Flipsky made 12 fet Alu at 100€, I want see who can make a cheaper vesc hahaha
[2024-01-14T00:31:33] Mirono escooters: Same with trampa I don't mean expensive= bad I just mean most care about money and buy other china Esc🤷 So that's why we don't see much being used
[2024-01-14T00:31:36] Paolo ⁭: I have remain some motors , and some scooter
[2024-01-14T00:31:47] Paolo ⁭: Nothing else, I'm lefting everything
[2024-01-14T00:31:49] Mirono escooters: Wich is incredible MP2 can't even beat (and that's basically a kit with many hours of work) while 75200 is plug play
[2024-01-14T00:31:50] haku: there is a market for western products though. some folks prefer them
[2024-01-14T00:32:19] Mirono escooters: I love 75200 If I ever need a 12fet, it's that one 🤷 Just don't have crazy enough projects
[2024-01-14T00:33:00] Paolo ⁭: The shit is shit, but if you want only feel the adrenaline it is enough😁
[2024-01-14T00:33:30] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: I do apologise… I have wanted to pay you for those motors…(just the inside part) but it seems that for now I just can’t afford them and never enough money…I do hope you still have them and when times are better, I’ll contact you if still available 🙏🏻
[2024-01-14T00:33:36] Mirono escooters: Are we really gonna bitch about 100€ 12 fet Esc xD
[2024-01-14T00:33:40] Mirono escooters: That it works is a wonder
[2024-01-14T00:34:05] Paolo ⁭: Yes, I buy and when broken buy again , that's what I do
[2024-01-14T00:34:11] Paolo ⁭: Because I don't ride everyday
[2024-01-14T00:34:20] sombre_enfant: Do 2x33x2 65inch 10" motor with 75200 and 20s5p is ok for race ?
[2024-01-14T00:34:22] Paolo ⁭: Only 1 time per month just for drag test xd

[2024-01-14T00:38:04] Gabe Enzo: What power system is that beast running?
[2024-01-14T00:39:01] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: I feel you… always something that needs to be done and require a lot of work and time…I stopped doing custom scooters for customers, when I want I build one for me …then if all good I sell it …but only if I have time and most parts Second Hand …
[2024-01-14T00:39:22] haku: dam living n the edge
[2024-01-14T00:39:27] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: You don’t get your money back on new builds…I sold the Zero11X Supra with £4500 😥😥😥

[2024-01-14T00:40:08] sombre_enfant: To print me honeycomb
[2024-01-14T00:40:14] Gabe Enzo: It's not gonna fit
[2024-01-14T00:40:17] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: What setup? 😅 the other guy is insane…
[2024-01-14T00:40:18] haku: cant you just build batteries? good $$
[2024-01-14T00:40:51] Mirono escooters: Ionno, plastic price
[2024-01-14T00:41:01] Gabe Enzo: it just barely fits without Honeycomb and the g30 frame is exactly 33% wider than the pro 2 and it can hold 4p with no plastic
[2024-01-14T00:41:06] Mirono escooters: Its in 2 parts like for 1zuna tho, belt is busy
[2024-01-14T00:41:13] Paolo ⁭: Maybe new lishen enough
[2024-01-14T00:41:20] Mirono escooters: It fits with honeycomb rofl
[2024-01-14T00:41:23] Mirono escooters: Just very thin holder
[2024-01-14T00:41:24] Gabe Enzo: no way
[2024-01-14T00:41:26] Gabe Enzo: ah
[2024-01-14T00:41:27] sombre_enfant: Cant get them
[2024-01-14T00:41:44] Mirono escooters: Hope they respect 21mm Lishen always bigger
[2024-01-14T00:41:48] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Not really … you spend so much time to build a battery…I don’t know others but I take long…I start by designing the battery frame, then welds etc … don’t like it that much
[2024-01-14T00:42:07] Gabe Enzo: not really 21700 then, 22700 🤣
[2024-01-14T00:42:23] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: I will finish everything I have now and then I’ll focus only on repairs

[2024-01-14T00:44:03] Gabe Enzo: Bad news for me. Gonna have to grind the frame sigh

[2024-01-14T00:48:54] Gabe Enzo: I'll be able to fit the rest of the cells also, with my math I should be able to put in even 12s8p into the frame hahahaha. Totally unheard of, I'll be the very first. other 8s8p in 3L ez fit.
[2024-01-14T00:49:02] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: I barely fit on it bro 😂😂😂 is a joke of a minibike… but I plan to do some crazy build
[2024-01-14T01:09:08] Finn: Hey can you not post it in every channel?
[2024-01-14T01:11:20] haku: sorry bro i told him to come here because he will just gets spammed on offtopic
[2024-01-14T01:11:44] Fresh: So you don’t know what it means?
[2024-01-14T01:12:12] Finn: I know that one message is enough
[2024-01-14T01:12:24] Fresh: Seems not
[2024-01-14T01:12:41] haku: i have a extra psu from the great 2020 psu shortage. i want to convert it to dcpower supply anyone done that? its a cheapy newegg one
[2024-01-14T01:12:45] Finn: Youre a smart guy
[2024-01-14T01:13:03] haku: its just collecting dust.
[2024-01-14T01:13:05] Fresh: No just searching information
[2024-01-14T01:14:10] haku: i want a higher amperage dc powersupply
[2024-01-14T01:14:51] Finn: Also the VESC Help channel is for this kind of questions
[2024-01-14T01:21:36] Mirono escooters: Yes, no respamming in every topic
[2024-01-14T01:24:27] haku: what filament brand?
[2024-01-14T01:24:31] haku: so clean
[2024-01-14T01:25:52] haku: yes it does. but ive seen folks put dials and display for adjusting.
[2024-01-14T01:27:54] haku: my bad bro. i reccomemded him here. vesc lords know the answer to this. offtopic he will get spammed by me
[2024-01-14T01:31:15] Konstantin: Sell them, and bought which u need. Coz u need new shotkie, logic, capacitor, and some etc staff. Sell/bought - smart decision
[2024-01-14T01:31:59] Konstantin: 750w it's 3.3 rail + 5.0 rail + 12v rail.
[2024-01-14T01:32:56] haku: i got this as a spare incase my psu gives out. you are right it will be complicated for me to turn this to dc supply. high amp dc supply is just super expensive thats why i thought of this
[2024-01-14T01:34:42] haku: the 12v rail is 62a wich is crazy
[2024-01-14T01:36:14] Konstantin: Смотри, что есть на AliExpress! Регулируемое зарядное устройство 0 - 120 в 0-25 А за US $230 - уже со скидкой -8% https://sl.aliexpress.ru/p?key=WOb3OiA
[2024-01-14T01:47:33] Konstantin: (90$+85$ ) +20% taxes, for my region
[2024-01-14T01:47:33] Konstantin: <photos/photo_12214@14-01-2024_01-47-33.jpg>
[2024-01-14T01:47:38] Konstantin: https://liguima.com/zxd2400/4/3to4/
[2024-01-14T01:48:15] haku: nice! ty ill check it out
[2024-01-14T02:03:19] haku: this was shared somewhere qs motor with 2 stators
[2024-01-14T02:03:33] haku: two sets of magnets. crazy
[2024-01-14T02:04:57] haku: some dude in NYC running this with 26s prismatic cells 😱
[2024-01-14T06:19:52] Happy Giraffe: Ofc hes a ginger
[2024-01-14T06:20:29] Happy Giraffe: Dad made a wrong move with his body when child was in the making
[2024-01-14T07:06:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Motors were hot, not controllers, watch video again 😁
[2024-01-14T07:07:42] Happy Giraffe: Spintend 12 fet no good? Or you mean dual vesc?
[2024-01-14T08:36:59] Jan: ???
[2024-01-14T10:48:41] Happy Giraffe: Propably some amount of rotation done by motor calculated from pole magnets I would guess
[2024-01-14T11:14:38] Mirono escooters: Dual
[2024-01-14T11:15:32] Mirono escooters: Ofc, but only 3.3v 5 and 12
[2024-01-14T11:59:58] Fresh: Thank you 🙏
[2024-01-14T12:46:40] haku: the 12v rail can power kcaps if i decide to get one someday 😂
[2024-01-14T12:47:25] haku: 12v at 62a can charge capacitors fast
[2024-01-14T13:05:27] Jan: Yes 200A dual apparently sucks
[2024-01-14T13:05:35] Jan: But single 250A is magic af
[2024-01-14T13:07:06] haku: theres a dual 12 fet? or you saying 6 fet per side x2
[2024-01-14T13:07:17] Gabe Enzo: Dual box
[2024-01-14T13:10:46] Mirono escooters: Miscommunication then
[2024-01-14T13:29:03] @Súperpatin: One question ❔ when can the maximum voltage be ⚡ that a Flisky 75100 can withstand, I put a 19S battery in it, and the manufacturer says it is up to 84 V but it's a lie, it gives me this error
[2024-01-14T13:37:13] Кирилл: Motor cfg > general > advanced. Here is maximum voltage parameter.
[2024-01-14T13:39:33] @Súperpatin: Could you send me an image if you have it on hand where this parameter is located?
[2024-01-14T13:39:48] @Súperpatin: Could you send me an image if you have it on hand where this parameter is located?
[2024-01-14T13:42:02] Mirono escooters: Just find it 😂 he gave you a step by step manual
[2024-01-14T14:23:37] Franchesco Carofano: Who can help me with the wiring of the vest 75200 200ah controller, please tell me what is the cable that cuts off their current to put the on and off button?
[2024-01-14T14:24:43] Mirono escooters: 75200 doesn't have off on, it's always on
[2024-01-14T14:26:02] Franchesco Carofano: I mean I have to put a suiw directly to the battery
[2024-01-14T14:26:43] Franchesco Carofano: They should have a shutdown suiw
[2024-01-14T14:29:13] Mirono escooters: No, not directly to battery
[2024-01-14T14:29:17] Mirono escooters: Antispark or smart bms
[2024-01-14T14:30:28] Happy Giraffe: Baby got a new home
[2024-01-14T14:30:52] Happy Giraffe: Bike tanky af, will be good times
[2024-01-14T14:34:31] Franchesco Carofano: I have a dali on the main battery
[2024-01-14T14:35:52] Mirono escooters: Then you can turn Daly off
[2024-01-14T14:35:58] Mirono escooters: Jaj
[2024-01-14T14:36:37] Franchesco Carofano: They are the makerbase supposedly they are the good version friend
[2024-01-14T14:37:14] Mirono escooters: No, still not Makerbase is flipsky , its 1:1 copy
[2024-01-14T14:37:23] Mirono escooters: Except if you got the 75100 PRO Then you have on off
[2024-01-14T14:38:05] Franchesco Carofano: Paolo recommends them to me as the best in their category
[2024-01-14T14:40:03] Franchesco Carofano: Correct, I understand that these do not have on and off, so there is no other option than to cut the power directly to the battery. From what I see, they are going well with the tests we did there. I will be telling you how it goes and thank you very much for your attention. They are very kind.
[2024-01-14T14:42:02] Mirono escooters: Yes they are good, but just not on off Price quality very ok
[2024-01-14T14:45:52] Franchesco Carofano: I am a friend, a colleague helped me with the configuration @guillermo fuenzalida, the first one to be programmed and installed in Chile, no one here has many scooters, but almost all of them come from the factory in my workshop, I plug them in a little, but they start well, we just did a test, now it's time fix them and arrange the cables so that everything looks good
[2024-01-14T14:47:24] Paolo ⁭: But when turn on you probably fuck BMS
[2024-01-14T14:47:31] Mirono escooters: Really?
[2024-01-14T14:47:40] Mirono escooters: 75100 got super tiny caps 😂😂
[2024-01-14T14:47:41] Paolo ⁭: Yes, the spark is no good for mosfet
[2024-01-14T14:48:00] Paolo ⁭: One time two time no problem, but if you do it everyday it's a problem
[2024-01-14T14:48:10] Mirono escooters: Yes, precharge is cool
[2024-01-14T14:48:13] Mirono escooters: Saved my MP2 too
[2024-01-14T14:48:34] Paolo ⁭: Yes but he has 2 x 75200 , 5,700uf
[2024-01-14T14:48:36] Mirono escooters: My LLT 100a is fine everyday, ofcourse a tiny 75100, but it works fine
[2024-01-14T14:48:43] Mirono escooters: Ah, woops
[2024-01-14T14:49:07] Paolo ⁭: Daly worse BMS ever made 😂
[2024-01-14T14:49:12] Mirono escooters: I've never ever seen LLT blow up BCS of it Ant got precharge Daly can kiss my Belgian *** And JK is expensive for me
[2024-01-14T14:49:37] Paolo ⁭: It fuck controller first , because yes also controller goes the shock
[2024-01-14T14:50:58] Franchesco Carofano: Then you recommend me to always keep them on
[2024-01-14T14:51:08] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2024-01-14T14:51:43] Franchesco Carofano: ready when making the connection I always keep them on
[2024-01-14T14:52:31] Franchesco Carofano: Anything new you know about them, please tell me, I'm very new to this clothing thing.
[2024-01-14T14:54:49] Franchesco Carofano: The suiw that Dualtron has under the deck will serve to cut the current with the negative even if it is
[2024-01-14T15:01:23] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_12218@14-01-2024_15-01-23.jpg>
[2024-01-14T15:01:56] Franchesco Carofano: I say that
[2024-01-14T15:02:34] Mirono escooters: No, stupid idea
[2024-01-14T15:02:44] Mirono escooters: That'll just burn, check the rating on those switches xD
[2024-01-14T15:02:58] Happy Giraffe: Mosfet switch...
[2024-01-14T15:03:21] Happy Giraffe: Maybe into a key but need a proper circuit design and many mosfets in parallel
[2024-01-14T15:04:09] Mirono escooters: Obviously
[2024-01-14T15:06:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha collateral damage
[2024-01-14T15:14:09] Franchesco Carofano: yes correct correct I understand now I'll tell you there now if I say goodbye thank you very much friend
[2024-01-14T15:15:24] Paolo ⁭: I proposed a pair with on/off mod already done but he bought them from AliExpress 🤷‍♂️
[2024-01-14T15:17:45] Franchesco Carofano: Your point is understood, friend, but the engine took a while to arrive and we still didn't have much money left and that's why we tried the ones you recommended on Ali Express, they were half the price with free shipping, brother, but we did want to make your purchase.
[2024-01-14T15:19:16] Franchesco Carofano: but if you can dedicate a little of your time with what we have and it has a cost, no problem brother, we could coordinate it
[2024-01-14T15:20:08] Paolo ⁭: It was for you, I don't need sell them😅 I already predicted these problems and mine was just a help
[2024-01-14T15:21:57] Franchesco Carofano: sì, amico
[2024-01-14T15:32:59] sombre_enfant: Do you have pictures of mod on real pcb
[2024-01-14T15:33:55] Paolo ⁭: @fungus93 or @punedir take picture, I didn't
[2024-01-14T15:34:04] Paolo ⁭: Because the concept is very basic
[2024-01-14T15:37:39] sombre_enfant: The 27mm height of 75200 is mesured on top of the caps ?
[2024-01-14T15:38:10] Mirono escooters: Hopefully
[2024-01-14T15:38:23] Mirono escooters: Without need for capacitors, imagine the tiny Esc we can have 75100 alupcb is 1/3 cap xD
[2024-01-14T15:39:51] puneDir: There is
[2024-01-14T15:40:07] puneDir: In usefull archive xhannel
[2024-01-14T15:41:36] Happy Giraffe: These old school Hope brakes are nice af. Full metal, no plastic blabla
[2024-01-14T15:45:44] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_12219@14-01-2024_15-45-44.jpg>
[2024-01-14T15:46:03] Mirono escooters: Still don't understand why they at least don't put this on the pcbs Inexpensive, removable and very waterproof
[2024-01-14T15:46:15] Mirono escooters: @kawaiinekololis for your Esc 😚
[2024-01-14T16:11:29] Franchesco Carofano: It would be good to put an electric fan on the controllers in the bami burn-e, go outside or make air intakes.
[2024-01-14T16:14:48] Mirono escooters: No, fans suck. stupid idea Air intakes same, + water (even stupider)
[2024-01-14T16:15:06] Mirono escooters: Man, the amount of times fan come into this chat, I can't count on both hands anymore
[2024-01-14T16:23:24] Franchesco Carofano: These are just questions my friend
[2024-01-14T16:23:41] Franchesco Carofano: thank you
[2024-01-14T16:53:19] Mirono escooters: Sry, wasn't personal 😗
[2024-01-14T17:21:59] Franchesco Carofano: No problem brother, I'm asking so I don't make a mistake just brother, I've done several socoter but. I never messed with configurations or anything
[2024-01-14T17:22:57] Franchesco Carofano: correct I understand I will see where to find them

[2024-01-14T17:47:58] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12221@14-01-2024_17-47-58.jpg>
[2024-01-14T17:47:59] Gabe Enzo: He made that up.
[2024-01-14T17:48:17] Gabe Enzo: there was no mention of it at all. "fastest stock controller ninebot"
[2024-01-14T17:48:26] Gabe Enzo: The title of the video was fastest ninebot
[2024-01-14T17:48:37] Mirono escooters: 🤷 if you are admin, you make rules
[2024-01-14T17:48:43] Finn: Yeah they didnt do that themself
[2024-01-14T17:48:54] Finn: Just a kid who paid soneone and flexing now
[2024-01-14T17:49:41] Finn: I got so many comments under my pro2 video so many kids who say fake or slow
[2024-01-14T17:49:49] Finn: Thats why i deleted tiktok😁
[2024-01-14T17:50:15] Gabe Enzo: I'm a menace.
[2024-01-14T17:50:35] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12222@14-01-2024_17-50-35.jpg>
[2024-01-14T17:51:19] Mirono escooters: I stopped putting time in those people
[2024-01-14T17:51:23] Mirono escooters: Can't fix Ignorant
[2024-01-14T17:51:35] Mirono escooters: Jealous
[2024-01-14T17:51:47] Gabe Enzo: Gastards.
[2024-01-14T17:51:56] Mirono escooters: It's why I don't post on fb for example Half of them in the groups go and bitch on you, "just buy a kaboo" xD
[2024-01-14T19:08:22] Happy Giraffe: Then see if gps is close to vesc speed with a tad smaller tire size being put there iex 9.85" instead of 10"
[2024-01-14T20:27:56] haku: dam neighbor stuntin on me. wait till i finish my scooter fool
[2024-01-14T20:29:18] haku: ill be doing burnouts in front of his house

[2024-01-14T20:34:38] haku: 11am my bad
[2024-01-14T20:45:10] Happy Giraffe: Real men ride bikes🌚😘
[2024-01-14T21:17:42] haku: these onewheel skateboards popular in the EU?
[2024-01-14T21:20:38] Mirono escooters: Not really
[2024-01-14T21:20:43] Mirono escooters: Good thing anyway
[2024-01-14T21:21:08] haku: yes i hate these things. alot here where im from
[2024-01-14T21:21:45] haku: some have vescs. i think the kids that hacked my settings had one
[2024-01-14T21:49:06] Gabe Enzo: always stay connected to your vesc when out and about.
[2024-01-14T21:58:45] puneDir: Anybody has good presets for ly70 and ly65
[2024-01-14T22:11:05] Face de Pin Sucé: nope
[2024-01-14T22:15:01] haku: boooo. share the knowledge 😝
[2024-01-14T22:39:03] Happy Giraffe: Buy his motor first🦅
[2024-01-14T22:40:00] Happy Giraffe: Or do the pairing thing but it must be done properly with pc or you are locked out lmao
[2024-01-14T22:41:07] haku: i might do that once i set up the spintend.
[2024-01-14T22:43:21] Mirono escooters: Vedder should just integrate a simple Bluetooth password. Can't be that hard
[2024-01-14T22:43:26] Mirono escooters: Not even over usb, just Bluetooth
[2024-01-14T22:43:31] haku: agreed
[2024-01-14T23:00:27] Gabe Enzo: Need to nag him a bit
[2024-01-14T23:12:57] haku: vesclord gatekeepers of the realm, I beg you! i am your humble servant
[2024-01-14T23:43:17] haku: is there a scooter brand that the deck is milled and not welded?
[2024-01-14T23:43:38] haku: like from a solid piece of alloy
[2024-01-14T23:49:04] haku: to the racers out there check this out. instant booty pants https://youtube.com/shorts/IXxpgAkC-2A?si=1wxi4xR1_2DiWgZp
[2024-01-15T00:17:21] Mirono escooters: That would be crazy expensive and useless
[2024-01-15T00:17:26] Mirono escooters: Just a cool gimmick
[2024-01-15T00:19:27] haku: i had a crash back then in august. i might need to get padded jeans
[2024-01-15T00:19:48] Gabe Enzo: But so trucking solid
[2024-01-15T00:19:57] Mirono escooters: Welding is fine if done properly
[2024-01-15T01:38:58] haku: we ridin a mans ride today boys. need to diacharge the battery 😂
[2024-01-15T01:40:18] haku: i really want to vesc this bike. someday when i have spare $$
[2024-01-15T01:41:00] haku: i dont think it deserves it though
[2024-01-15T02:22:18] R3VOLT: hi , vsett 10 noob here bought a vesc dual motor in purple , i'm still looking for a plug n play display if possible and 2 motor temp sensors if it's doable ,ty
[2024-01-15T02:31:09] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: You weight 70kg bro! Controllers reached 50* and motors 150* …imagine with me 120kg … I’m not judging your build or anything I’m just saying that from my personal experience the more weight you put on that scooter the higher temperatures you will have … I speak out of my personal experience… keep up with the good work, I personally support you everywhere on social media because I like what I see ! ✌️
[2024-01-15T02:47:22] haku: there are limited displays for vesc right now. but you can use the stock vsett display with some wizardry coding
[2024-01-15T03:52:20] Ion: You can use stock Vsett display (with a Vesc script) or Ninebot G30/Xiaomi display (also with script), or your phone and the app. Yes, temp sensor is doable. For example NTC 10k, but you need to pull through 1 extra wire. Soldering one side of sensor to hall sensor GND, and the other one to the new wire
[2024-01-15T06:45:59] Happy Giraffe: Milling metal is actually weaker than 3D printing metal. Idk if properly done weld is same, should test tho
[2024-01-15T06:47:39] haku: whut! thats nuts. no way printed metal is stronger. ive never seen one though i can only imagine
[2024-01-15T06:48:44] haku: dont you have to bake or whatever thats called to strengthen prints?
[2024-01-15T06:51:04] haku: im thinking the holy grail.of scooter design will be milled titanium. someone make that happen
[2024-01-15T07:25:11] Happy Giraffe: Depends on the machines but usually yes if not built in
[2024-01-15T07:26:07] Happy Giraffe: Havent researched that much, you can actually 3D print metal also at home but required special oven to heat up after and part shrinks 50%😂
[2024-01-15T07:26:27] Happy Giraffe: Alu perfectly fine when done properly

[2024-01-15T08:06:30] NetworkDir: My setup components
[2024-01-15T08:07:31] puneDir: You have more cells lol
[2024-01-15T08:08:33] NetworkDir: Yes 98x FEB zero stock cells + 14sp dmegc cells
[2024-01-15T08:08:48] puneDir: also lg
[2024-01-15T08:08:53] NetworkDir: No
[2024-01-15T08:09:17] puneDir: Ah
[2024-01-15T08:59:58] haku: what cells are those?
[2024-01-15T09:00:29] puneDir: Aspilsan
[2024-01-15T09:00:33] puneDir: Turkish brand cells
[2024-01-15T09:00:43] puneDir: But good
[2024-01-15T09:00:57] puneDir: According to datasheet really good
[2024-01-15T09:01:11] puneDir: 2900 mah 25a discharge
[2024-01-15T09:01:11] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-15T09:05:17] haku: nice! 21700 cells yea? im curious how this cell perform and i want to see IR meter readings
[2024-01-15T09:05:25] NetworkDir: 18650
[2024-01-15T09:05:26] puneDir: No 18650 xd
[2024-01-15T09:05:51] puneDir: its maded by turkish military brand aselsan Never used it but should be good
[2024-01-15T09:06:20] haku: dam 25a 2900mah is very good for 18650
[2024-01-15T09:11:04] haku: also what scooter is this going to
[2024-01-15T09:12:12] puneDir: Zero 10x
[2024-01-15T09:13:56] NetworkDir: yes but it's maximum pulse
[2024-01-15T09:14:04] NetworkDir: in normally you can't push 25A
[2024-01-15T09:14:20] NetworkDir: but 15-20A is safe
[2024-01-15T09:14:30] NetworkDir: 5C cell
[2024-01-15T11:59:29] Face de Pin Sucé: This is a racing scooter, not meant to be used by 120Kg rider. Cooling would be much different for a 120Kg. 50°C is very much okay for that type of performance. Weight isn't a thing, it's only a matter of power, if you would see the average power used on this build, I'm not sure there are many builds that reach this average. Thank you for the support :)
[2024-01-15T12:04:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the ble password is already integrated in the vescexpress (which will replace the old nrf module)
[2024-01-15T12:06:47] haku: vesc expess only available for the latest vescs right?
[2024-01-15T12:07:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think it works for all vesc
[2024-01-15T12:07:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: at least for all 6.xx
[2024-01-15T12:07:40] haku: good to know
[2024-01-15T12:08:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it does wifi gateway 😁
[2024-01-15T12:39:40] Mirono escooters: And price My Bluetooth Is 3€ Its just simple software integration :)
[2024-01-15T12:43:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, doc is poor 🫤
[2024-01-15T12:44:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: esp32-c3 + can transceiver doesn't cost really more
[2024-01-15T12:50:36] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2024-01-15T12:50:47] Mirono escooters: I'd write a manual but I got no knowledge either
[2024-01-15T15:14:11] Martin Kaktits: In their website this thing was updated to 20s spec (even tho components the same). What do you guys think about 21s tho? 😅🙈 with regen? who has experience?
[2024-01-15T15:20:35] Happy Giraffe: 21s a weird ass setup😂
[2024-01-15T15:22:49] Martin Kaktits: Whats wrong 21s 🥲
[2024-01-15T15:23:13] puneDir: Why not 20s Easy to find charger
[2024-01-15T15:23:37] Martin Kaktits: Because 21>20
[2024-01-15T15:28:57] Mirono escooters: You match s with setup There is no weird setup You fill with what you can
[2024-01-15T15:37:12] Jan: The troubles you get
[2024-01-15T15:37:39] Jan: Its like that phd guy in my office who wanted a M9 bolt for his project
[2024-01-15T15:37:51] puneDir: also 21s charger
[2024-01-15T15:38:16] Mirono escooters: That is nothing...
[2024-01-15T15:39:00] Mirono escooters: Funny but if it's the ideal 🤷🤷
[2024-01-15T15:39:16] Mirono escooters: But except Nasa reasons or F1...
[2024-01-15T15:39:20] Jan: The design is stupid if it requires an ultra special bolt
[2024-01-15T15:39:37] Jan: It was like bolting to plates together
[2024-01-15T15:39:47] Mirono escooters: 🤷
[2024-01-15T15:39:58] Jan: It was at ESA ^^
[2024-01-15T15:40:11] Mirono escooters: Then I don't mind
[2024-01-15T15:40:19] Mirono escooters: He sure has his reasons
[2024-01-15T15:40:21] Jan: That guy was a moron
[2024-01-15T15:40:28] Mirono escooters: Has a phd
[2024-01-15T15:40:36] Jan: He thought it was a standard bolt
[2024-01-15T15:40:48] Mirono escooters: Lack of practical knowledge
[2024-01-15T15:40:53] Jan: Every moron can do a phd
[2024-01-15T15:40:53] Mirono escooters: Cant blame him
[2024-01-15T15:40:57] Mirono escooters: No
[2024-01-15T15:40:59] Mirono escooters: I cant
[2024-01-15T15:41:05] Jan: Sure you can
[2024-01-15T15:41:09] Jan: Its not hard, its long
[2024-01-15T15:41:19] Mirono escooters: I can't do basic Mechanics lol
[2024-01-15T15:41:32] Jan: How old are you now?
[2024-01-15T15:41:38] Mirono escooters: Anyway round off subject, going way off

[2024-01-15T15:41:57] Mirono escooters: Tldr 21s is fine if sure all handle it And stupid S doesn't exist
[2024-01-15T15:42:08] Jan: Well you will learn it, most people dont start with phd before 26-28

[2024-01-15T17:03:12] Mirono escooters: A little
[2024-01-15T17:04:05] haku: cant you open it and there is a knob you can dial or something?
[2024-01-15T17:04:23] Mirono escooters: Sometimes
[2024-01-15T17:10:14] Mirono escooters: I swear I try
[2024-01-15T17:10:18] haku: all you need is a determaimation and anything is possible. -mlk
[2024-01-15T17:10:19] Mirono escooters: You can have your own view on it

[2024-01-15T17:48:17] Jan: Better just do 20s, not worth the extra effort here
[2024-01-15T17:48:52] Martin Kaktits: this is vesc group. Why are people so safe? Where is: "fuck it, vesc go brrrrt"
[2024-01-15T17:48:59] haku: 21s is it still risky for 85200 and 80100?
[2024-01-15T17:49:20] Mirono escooters: Nun want responsibility for boom

[2024-01-15T19:01:33] Mirono escooters: I don't mind selling own made stuff expensive But come on
[2024-01-15T19:01:57] Mirono escooters: Losers. But their fan group is a cult. I tried discussing, didn't work Even evidence they say it's fake, ppl believe
[2024-01-15T19:02:03] haku: people in the US are clueless to these mods. or maybe its just me
[2024-01-15T19:02:10] Mirono escooters: Many retards exist
[2024-01-15T19:02:15] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2024-01-15T19:02:19] Mirono escooters: That's why a site with a simple buy button and great manual sells good
[2024-01-15T19:02:34] Mirono escooters: And that's why I don't I don't attract dumb ppl Ususally only with (limited) knowledge find me
[2024-01-15T19:02:36] Mirono escooters: Less headache
[2024-01-15T19:02:55] Gabe Enzo: Love it how that guy is just pure lying too
[2024-01-15T19:03:04] haku: thanks. thats a compliment to me
[2024-01-15T19:03:05] Gabe Enzo: Like he's not even stupid, he's just an asshole
[2024-01-15T19:03:15] Gabe Enzo: Stupid would be him realising he's wrong
[2024-01-15T19:03:18] Mirono escooters: You found vesc group, you are one up
[2024-01-15T19:03:47] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2024-01-15T19:05:16] haku: scooter modding here is very rare. the ones that do follow these groups
[2024-01-15T19:06:19] Mirono escooters: The makerbase uses a quad op (SGM8584) amp instead of 3 current sense amps (SGM8634) that flipsky uses. Also the latest makerbase version you can toggle VCC between 3.3v and 5v, as well as enable it to shut down via a switch through adc15 (see pic)
[2024-01-15T19:06:28] Mirono escooters: Seems like makerbase is getting ahead of flipsky 👍👍
[2024-01-15T19:06:59] haku: i got lucky and found the light. or i would have a fardriver and soldered cells right now
[2024-01-15T19:14:26] Happy Giraffe: This is a phenomenon of modern world. If you present something nicely people think its true. So a blonde with big boobs or a cute less-masculine funny man will make everything seem not concerning
[2024-01-15T19:14:41] Happy Giraffe: Influencer crap
[2024-01-15T19:15:00] Mirono escooters: Yes, I hate it
[2024-01-15T19:15:01] Mirono escooters: People don't want to think Want pre chewed knowledge
[2024-01-15T19:16:23] Happy Giraffe: If it only was knowledge instead of some half assed effort. You don't have to be a pro to say something but cmon atleast add some value to it
[2024-01-15T19:16:47] haku: today i am considered a toxic masculinity man. i got cancelled at work a few times already.
[2024-01-15T19:17:59] haku: this is why i dont mess with social media

[2024-01-15T19:22:52] Happy Giraffe: Nowadays you say "I eat meat and I'm straight" - Instant woman hater/misogynistic and planet destroyer

[2024-01-15T21:56:53] Unknown: Believe your talking about Adam. Dual Nucular 12f's think he maxed at 14kw
[2024-01-15T21:59:15] haku: USA sales only. my own brand
[2024-01-15T21:59:22] Konstantin: Rip nuclear controller... 60w per light it's to much... On 1 build , which I was moding, previous builder use only controller power to drive light... 2*12fet + ulight module etc stuff. Controller after time start lags...can from 1 ESC random loosing... system can turn off... Send to Kazakhstan 1 ESC, they fix ix. After I was modify ulight...and my small logic board + add external isolated power for light, all works perfect, no problem all season... And it's religion...12fets nuc...how to order and bought them, for me, just use vesc .. and nuclear it's like Kelly... Only 20s (warranty), power max 100v (fets, capacity, etc). And even 24fets, 500amp... So weak for 2023/2024... Ppl want more power...
[2024-01-15T22:01:59] haku: how is nucular software. i never hear much about them
[2024-01-15T22:02:02] Konstantin: And I'm lought , most like feature, what it's has a lot of protection, and u can wrong wire port, but any way, if tvs gone, u send it for fix...if don't want loose warranty xD
[2024-01-15T22:03:27] Konstantin: On display only. But now, they make esp32 module, for setting this sht;).
[2024-01-15T22:04:04] haku: i see
[2024-01-15T22:05:58] Konstantin: Nuclear was very cool few y ago (5+). Small size + power, + charge through ESC... Like battery 20s, charger 15s, it's ok, you can fully charge u bag. For me that all benefit
[2024-01-15T22:09:09] Happy Giraffe: Charge feature is cool, is there any documentation or explanation how they do it? At the moment I have charger mounted on bike separately lol
[2024-01-15T22:09:44] Konstantin: U can use on vesc to, but it's treaky
[2024-01-15T22:10:02] Happy Giraffe: I rather not put ac to my vesc😂
[2024-01-15T22:18:03] Unknown: Idk he fell of the edge of the world again.
[2024-01-15T22:20:50] Unknown: You charge through the hub motor with a lower voltage than battery. Uses it as a transformer
[2024-01-15T22:36:45] Konstantin: What interesting, it's only Russian make this... Nuclear, adapto.. so, it's was very cool 7+ y ago, coz 20s+ charger was very expensive. On present day...so-so...
[2024-01-15T22:38:03] Konstantin: Y, was repair 1 in summer, it's fkng pain...
[2024-01-15T22:38:38] Oreo huzky: Make them write 100% pure chinesium

[2024-01-15T23:25:54] Oreo huzky: I found 801 d it says it can do 12kw
[2024-01-15T23:26:03] Gabe Enzo: James said it can weld 0.1 copper and nickel sandwich.
[2024-01-15T23:26:19] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_12234@15-01-2024_23-26-19.jpg>
[2024-01-15T23:26:25] Gabe Enzo: that's the one you just linked
[2024-01-15T23:26:34] Oreo huzky: What
[2024-01-15T23:26:42] Oreo huzky: Bruh
[2024-01-15T23:27:06] Gabe Enzo: .
[2024-01-15T23:27:17] Oreo huzky: Yes
[2024-01-15T23:27:27] Gabe Enzo: Yeah, I bought that one.
[2024-01-15T23:27:38] Oreo huzky: But isn’t 12kw enough for 0.15 copper?
[2024-01-15T23:27:41] Gabe Enzo: which one.
[2024-01-15T23:27:56] Gabe Enzo: Ya should be.. ill be the one to test I suppose.
[2024-01-15T23:28:18] Oreo huzky: But if not It can do copper nickel sandwich correct?
[2024-01-15T23:28:33] Gabe Enzo: According to James, yes.
[2024-01-15T23:28:39] Gabe Enzo: and @Lbabacar
[2024-01-15T23:30:01] Oreo huzky: I will test 0.15 copper
[2024-01-15T23:30:24] Oreo huzky: If not I use nickel copper sandwich it will just look bad
[2024-01-15T23:35:05] haku: 811 is cool but have to be careful. ive blown so many holes already.
[2024-01-15T23:35:40] haku: its good for .2 copper .2 nickle.
[2024-01-15T23:39:14] haku: you get a tougher weld with .2 plated steel ontop
[2024-01-15T23:40:18] Oreo huzky: Okay
[2024-01-15T23:40:24] Gabe Enzo: You can't make a cell with just copper anyway, copper is tensile weak
[2024-01-15T23:40:27] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2024-01-15T23:41:13] Oreo huzky: Ah didn’t know that
[2024-01-15T23:41:42] haku: you can but have to have the right pressure and power. its hard for me
[2024-01-15T23:43:47] haku: but putting nickel or played steel ontop makes it crazy strong
[2024-01-15T23:45:44] Happy Giraffe: Surron dead lmao, oh my world I drink a red wine bottle when theres one proper bike made
[2024-01-15T23:48:36] haku: surron has a midrive fanbase. super73 will get killed
[2024-01-15T23:49:12] Happy Giraffe: Call me a hater but small hub motor and battery is a granny bike for sunday ride. Hub kinda meh on other than cruising bikes, suffers too much load on acceleration with big wheels
[2024-01-15T23:49:42] Happy Giraffe: Cant wait to experience some mid drive madness later
[2024-01-15T23:49:52] haku: never owned a mid drive. im curious what it feels
[2024-01-15T23:50:31] puneDir: Why theres no dual motor surron
[2024-01-15T23:50:32] Happy Giraffe: Heavy and I would say a 20kw mid drive would perform the same tbh
[2024-01-15T23:50:38] puneDir: Mid drive for rear and hub for front
[2024-01-15T23:50:47] haku: i think hub for speed and midrive for offroad
[2024-01-15T23:50:48] Happy Giraffe: Oh god pls no
[2024-01-15T23:50:55] puneDir: Why no
[2024-01-15T23:51:00] puneDir: Any reason
[2024-01-15T23:51:12] Happy Giraffe: Weight, handling, stupidity
[2024-01-15T23:51:28] puneDir: More speed
[2024-01-15T23:51:33] puneDir: More power
[2024-01-15T23:51:37] Happy Giraffe: Nope
[2024-01-15T23:52:03] haku: its been done and its dumb. lectric bikes with midrive. and front and back hubs.
[2024-01-15T23:52:07] Happy Giraffe: If you do a proper bike build you will do a wheelie from throttle at 80-100kmh anyway
[2024-01-15T23:52:14] puneDir: i want a bike
[2024-01-15T23:52:51] Happy Giraffe: Will see about the 72v bbshd, should be a monster that comes on par with 12kw tuned surrons lol
[2024-01-15T23:53:34] haku: surron all bolt ons too
[2024-01-15T23:53:45] puneDir: When i go to univerrsity
[2024-01-15T23:53:52] Happy Giraffe: Not legal here so hardly exist here
[2024-01-15T23:54:22] Gabe Enzo: nothing is legal anywhere
[2024-01-15T23:54:25] Happy Giraffe: Need legal moped registered version, rather buy moped at that point
[2024-01-15T23:55:13] Happy Giraffe: My bike will be legal when limited to 25kmh😅 after that I do throttle wheelie from 50kmh when police looks away
[2024-01-15T23:56:04] Happy Giraffe: Nah, cost too much for very little offering. I will put down all the costs of the bike build to have something on the paper. Will be best value so far
[2024-01-15T23:56:39] Happy Giraffe: Surron too big for a bike and too toy for moped
[2024-01-15T23:56:44] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-01-15T23:56:48] haku: make your own frame. you have the skillset
[2024-01-15T23:57:10] puneDir: Also e scooters with seat
[2024-01-15T23:57:13] Happy Giraffe: No I dont lol, frame is really damn hard to make. Thats why I bought the DH bike😅

[2024-01-15T23:58:13] haku: isnt that dangerous. sitting on a standing scooter
[2024-01-15T23:59:01] Happy Giraffe: Wont be a comfy ride even with a seat, bollocks scream purple when you arrive home to check the damage
[2024-01-16T00:00:13] Happy Giraffe: Tried seat on xiaomi pro once but it was some shity wrong sized one even when I ordered for Pro model. Tho I sat on a microwave box, that was fun.
[2024-01-16T00:00:39] puneDir: Never tried it but must be unstable
[2024-01-16T00:00:39] haku: also you wont be able to fully control without your legs
[2024-01-16T00:01:15] Happy Giraffe: Was catching some looks from car riders but it was ok if you sit low. However handlebar bit too high then🤔
[2024-01-16T00:01:15] puneDir: But i think it might be easier to wheelie if you have seat lol
[2024-01-16T00:01:33] haku: what ive never done is kneeling stance when doing speed runs. thats scary af
[2024-01-16T00:01:45] puneDir: Like a motorcycle
[2024-01-16T00:02:40] sombre_enfant: Yes put 0.15 nickel steel belt on top
[2024-01-16T00:03:40] Happy Giraffe: Im waiting stark varg for a lite model with 72v 20kw sub-70kg enduro ebike🌚 Would end the life of those surron crap thats out there. Hope they would do smaller stuff too
[2024-01-16T00:04:02] haku: thats a real emoto
[2024-01-16T00:04:28] Happy Giraffe: Their current bike nice but sold out and never legal😁
[2024-01-16T00:04:34] Oreo huzky: Will do
[2024-01-16T00:05:10] sombre_enfant: But 0.15 copper is overkill nobody use that
[2024-01-16T00:05:21] haku: do they classify it as a real motorcycle and need registration. or completely illegal?
[2024-01-16T00:06:06] haku: if i had welding skills i would do a bmx midrive
[2024-01-16T00:06:22] Gabe Enzo: Here they class it as a real motorcycle and needing registration, But don't let insurance companies register them
[2024-01-16T00:06:36] Gabe Enzo: No joke, this is real.
[2024-01-16T00:06:41] haku: dam
[2024-01-16T00:07:00] haku: you need freedom baby
[2024-01-16T00:07:12] haku: 🦅
[2024-01-16T00:07:15] Gabe Enzo: freedom is being nimble enough to get away from cops.
[2024-01-16T00:07:53] sombre_enfant: France over the top
[2024-01-16T00:08:20] sombre_enfant: <animation>
[2024-01-16T00:08:33] haku: im sure there will be regulations here too. folks abusing it riding on highways and wheelies
[2024-01-16T00:11:35] haku: is it? 350a you need that much
[2024-01-16T00:11:57] haku: i think @Oreohuzky building a big battery
[2024-01-16T00:12:58] Gabe Enzo: I'll be pulling 320a and I'm using like 0 .1 + 0.15mm
[2024-01-16T00:19:08] haku: according to my calculations .1cu=3nickle+.15=4.5
[2024-01-16T00:19:22] haku: hows my math?
[2024-01-16T00:22:28] Oreo huzky: 800A
[2024-01-16T00:22:47] haku: yep you need big boy bussbars
[2024-01-16T00:22:56] Oreo huzky: I just guessed with 0.15
[2024-01-16T00:23:31] haku: if your pulling 800a thats alot bro.
[2024-01-16T00:23:43] haku: thats emoto teritory
[2024-01-16T00:23:47] Oreo huzky: Ye
[2024-01-16T00:24:19] haku: idk im a noob. the vesclords will know
[2024-01-16T00:24:54] haku: i like to over do things
[2024-01-16T00:25:03] sombre_enfant: Its peak for a second...
[2024-01-16T00:26:09] haku: according to my research resistance = heat. heat= boom
[2024-01-16T00:26:44] haku: boom=goodbye scooter.
[2024-01-16T00:31:12] Oreo huzky: Battery can do constant 900A
[2024-01-16T00:31:21] Oreo huzky: BMS can’t I would guess 😂
[2024-01-16T00:31:51] Oreo huzky: BMS can do 800A for 30 sec or 1 min I think max is 950A
[2024-01-16T00:46:00] haku: 800a peak for 30 sec is alot isnt it?
[2024-01-16T00:49:56] Oreo huzky: It’s a bit yes
[2024-01-16T02:05:29] Rose: Hey there Freddy Leonardo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-16T02:06:24] Rose: Hey there Freddy Leonardo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-16T03:50:01] R3VOLT: on Nucular u can't regulate stuff ?
[2024-01-16T03:50:22] R3VOLT: like 30% light when not braking and 100% when u do
[2024-01-16T03:55:43] Tommy ª: casually you can get a dual output with vesc, im using a 2 relay module, one for the light and another for the brake just a resistor, and the other relay goes directly at rear light, you get the "hi/low" light
[2024-01-16T03:55:44] Tommy ª: <sticker>
[2024-01-16T06:26:54] R3VOLT: <animation>
[2024-01-16T06:29:02] R3VOLT: they managed to ship it
[2024-01-16T06:29:25] R3VOLT: got my tracking just before midnight their time , how tf they work so late
[2024-01-16T07:37:35] Happy Giraffe: China👍
[2024-01-16T09:24:39] sombre_enfant: Shouldve ordered from james or jrev imo
[2024-01-16T09:27:14] Mirono escooters: whats the problem with ordering directly from manufacturer😂😂
[2024-01-16T10:16:39] Face de Pin Sucé: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2IYpnkMzg0/?igsh=dHBvbXIzdmtobmI1
[2024-01-16T10:22:36] Yamal: Have Kelly in her scooter..?
[2024-01-16T10:28:29] Happy Giraffe: James cheaper and better. Also supports our our buddy
[2024-01-16T10:29:16] Mirono escooters: Cheaper? Incredible
[2024-01-16T10:43:27] Happy Giraffe: How many times do I have to tell people to order from James to skip the Spintend blabla until you believe me lmao
[2024-01-16T10:43:45] Mirono escooters: Sowwy papa 😗
[2024-01-16T11:34:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes for now she using Kellys
[2024-01-16T11:37:16] Yamal: <photos/photo_12238@16-01-2024_11-37-16.jpg>
[2024-01-16T11:38:52] Oreo huzky: Why ?
[2024-01-16T11:43:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Because she didn't need more back in the time
[2024-01-16T11:48:06] Gabe Enzo: Female driver no way
[2024-01-16T11:48:43] haku: 16yrs old female driver would be great. sub 50kg
[2024-01-16T11:49:43] sombre_enfant: Soon there will be RFperformance who will sell them also
[2024-01-16T11:49:50] Yamal: Soon you can Winn Erik Wilson with his Nami 😂
[2024-01-16T11:52:01] haku: whos that. merikan driver? finally
[2024-01-16T11:52:17] Gabe Enzo: 3 weeks waiting time.
[2024-01-16T11:52:30] Face de Pin Sucé: why ?
[2024-01-16T11:53:06] Gabe Enzo: what cell can do that constant now?
[2024-01-16T11:53:08] Gabe Enzo: Lmfao
[2024-01-16T11:53:35] Yamal: Yes
[2024-01-16T11:54:04] haku: oh snap. he will race in france?
[2024-01-16T11:54:06] Yamal: Another red Nami , but Nami stock
[2024-01-16T11:54:06] Gabe Enzo: simply just is unheard of.
[2024-01-16T11:54:10] Yamal: No
[2024-01-16T11:54:19] haku: oh
[2024-01-16T11:54:20] Gabe Enzo: I'm intrigued
[2024-01-16T11:54:29] Gabe Enzo: that's all
[2024-01-16T11:54:56] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't understand your answer
[2024-01-16T11:55:15] sombre_enfant: He trippin again like his cl350 he break every week
[2024-01-16T11:55:41] haku: i think hes in US.
[2024-01-16T11:55:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Who ?
[2024-01-16T11:55:59] Oreo huzky: P42a 45A constant 50Amax
[2024-01-16T11:56:24] sombre_enfant: Oreo guy
[2024-01-16T11:56:35] Oreo huzky: Haha
[2024-01-16T11:57:20] Oreo huzky: Ye idk what I did I just drove and suddenly dead but now I will take really good care of my cl350 and try not to break them
[2024-01-16T11:57:33] Happy Giraffe: Hell no
[2024-01-16T11:57:57] Oreo huzky: It’s rated at 45A?
[2024-01-16T11:58:00] Happy Giraffe: 45A way too much constant for that cell. P45B also starts to struggle there
[2024-01-16T11:58:13] Oreo huzky: Is that only burst?
[2024-01-16T11:58:57] haku: you from US yea?
[2024-01-16T11:59:06] Oreo huzky: Oof but I will only use the 45 A at burst so should be fine
[2024-01-16T11:59:07] Mirono escooters: Coming from..
[2024-01-16T11:59:45] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_12239@16-01-2024_11-59-45.jpg>
[2024-01-16T12:00:17] Gabe Enzo: You don't have 16P tho
[2024-01-16T12:00:18] Gabe Enzo: hahaha
[2024-01-16T12:00:19] Happy Giraffe: Scooters wont see more than 10sec continuous max currents typically unless you ride 100-120kmh at a highway anyway
[2024-01-16T12:00:35] Oreo huzky: I will build 16p for my next scoot
[2024-01-16T12:00:43] Oreo huzky: 16p 28s
[2024-01-16T12:01:09] Oreo huzky: Se so should be fine for the cells
[2024-01-16T12:01:24] Happy Giraffe: Never trust manufacturer claims ever. On batteries especially.
[2024-01-16T12:01:34] Oreo huzky: Okay
[2024-01-16T12:01:38] Gabe Enzo: P45 only good for 30a right?
[2024-01-16T12:01:44] Gabe Enzo: just overheats after that.
[2024-01-16T12:01:49] Gabe Enzo: 😂
[2024-01-16T12:01:57] Oreo huzky: But will be fine
[2024-01-16T12:02:14] Happy Giraffe: Depends on the duration of load again
[2024-01-16T12:02:30] Mirono escooters: That it's rare
[2024-01-16T12:02:41] Mirono escooters: My gf scoots, but don't go over 25 or curve more then 3 degrees :)
[2024-01-16T12:02:53] Oreo huzky: I use 38A out of my current pack with p45a and it’s fine after long ride the get a bit warm like room temp
[2024-01-16T12:03:03] Mirono escooters: And outside temps And potting (seriously, pot your batts for high power)
[2024-01-16T12:03:18] Happy Giraffe: Temp sensors💸👍
[2024-01-16T12:03:36] Happy Giraffe: Sad that vesc bms never made it through. Could have been nice
[2024-01-16T12:03:38] haku: what about 40t 25a cell?
[2024-01-16T12:03:53] Mirono escooters: 40t? 25a?
[2024-01-16T12:03:59] Happy Giraffe: P42A better if you can get that
[2024-01-16T12:04:04] Mirono escooters: Smart BMS ofcourse
[2024-01-16T12:04:08] Mirono escooters: But if you want best performance Pot it
[2024-01-16T12:04:25] haku: rated. peak its 35a
[2024-01-16T12:04:35] Gabe Enzo: maintenance would be hell tho
[2024-01-16T12:04:50] Gabe Enzo: no?
[2024-01-16T12:04:59] Happy Giraffe: Samsung 40T3 here
[2024-01-16T12:05:32] Mirono escooters: Who tf needs maintenance on a well build pack?
[2024-01-16T12:05:41] Mirono escooters: Always same argument, I never understand Esc ok Batt? Come on
[2024-01-16T12:05:43] Mirono escooters: And its peelable with enough time
[2024-01-16T12:05:56] Gabe Enzo: oh I thought it was epoxy
[2024-01-16T12:06:02] Gabe Enzo: lol
[2024-01-16T12:06:15] Mirono escooters: I've made the deal with myself if my g30 batt dies, I'm not repairing it
[2024-01-16T12:06:16] Mirono escooters: Impossible
[2024-01-16T12:06:23] Mirono escooters: Sombre can have it
[2024-01-16T12:07:04] haku: similar performance to p42
[2024-01-16T12:07:22] Happy Giraffe: P42A noticeably better
[2024-01-16T12:08:54] Happy Giraffe: Aroud 0.2Ah better at 30A but again on burst it doesnt matter that much. But still more capacity and less resistance is always better
[2024-01-16T12:09:43] Happy Giraffe: Less vdrop😁
[2024-01-16T12:12:21] haku: will you even notice the difference when riding?
[2024-01-16T12:13:33] Happy Giraffe: Interesting, this is the old 40T tho?
[2024-01-16T12:14:15] Mirono escooters: Especially with price diff Gimme my 40T
[2024-01-16T12:14:50] Happy Giraffe: on mooch graph it looked like 40T bit behind and with higher IR would make sense xd
[2024-01-16T12:16:04] Happy Giraffe: nkon 40T more expensive, clear wrap cheaper tho but sold out
[2024-01-16T12:16:46] Mirono escooters: I got my own sources 🌚
[2024-01-16T12:16:59] Mirono escooters: Nkon sometimes good prices Ususally scam
[2024-01-16T12:17:13] Mirono escooters: Got Francois a really nice deal on new 40t
[2024-01-16T12:17:21] haku: i got mine $3.85 cell but ive seen it. $2.99
[2024-01-16T12:17:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh okay
[2024-01-16T12:18:15] Happy Giraffe: Lets wait and see. Battery configuration propably will be 20s5p so need best cells if using batt for Lightning Rods motor in future
[2024-01-16T12:18:43] Mirono escooters: Yep, hitting that mark too
[2024-01-16T12:18:45] haku: 5p on a bike no. need more bud
[2024-01-16T12:18:54] Mirono escooters: Idk how dollar vs euro is now Quite bad
[2024-01-16T12:19:07] Mirono escooters: We support it
[2024-01-16T12:19:13] Mirono escooters: It wasn't meant bad : D
[2024-01-16T12:19:36] Happy Giraffe: not really, its currently 13s6p 18650 35E cells so the new batt 60% bigger already
[2024-01-16T12:19:46] Mirono escooters: I don't like talking in p Because I got 52ah cells here 😂 Then i tell ppl 24s1p And they go bla only 1p Sigh
[2024-01-16T12:20:04] Happy Giraffe: will be for agile riding and if needed, then buy a second battery
[2024-01-16T12:20:07] haku: true
[2024-01-16T12:20:22] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_12241@16-01-2024_12-20-22.jpg>
[2024-01-16T12:20:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Always get the best 😁😁
[2024-01-16T12:21:19] haku: the best is arm and leg. next gen cells around the corner
[2024-01-16T12:21:47] Mirono escooters: They'll be around the corner for a long time
[2024-01-16T12:21:55] Face de Pin Sucé: https://www.instagram.com/p/C0pP93csgF7/?igsh=MXE3N20yNTFyNTYwaw==
[2024-01-16T12:22:01] Face de Pin Sucé: We do support female racing too
[2024-01-16T12:22:10] Happy Giraffe: sadly its 95% of just scamming investors with these flashy news
[2024-01-16T12:22:15] haku: itll come daddy
[2024-01-16T12:22:26] Mirono escooters: Welp, good for them
[2024-01-16T12:22:41] Mirono escooters: Yeah like "solid state batts" been promised 3y ago
[2024-01-16T12:23:03] Mirono escooters: And still people talk to me like "Ah man, you don't know shit, solid state is best, just wait for it, why you still buy normal cells"
[2024-01-16T12:23:04] Face de Pin Sucé: What do you use to measure ?
[2024-01-16T12:23:12] Mirono escooters: I love ignorant people🌚
[2024-01-16T12:23:13] Happy Giraffe: I suck EVE CEO cock if 100A continuous happens without 80+celsius
[2024-01-16T12:23:15] Mirono escooters: Oh we in wrong chat
[2024-01-16T12:23:35] Mirono escooters: Bet
[2024-01-16T12:23:58] haku: just believe baby. i can feel it
[2024-01-16T12:24:45] Happy Giraffe: Then I dont have to kneel as I thought, nice. But even 40-50A continuous without 80c would be great
[2024-01-16T12:24:59] Mirono escooters: Even potting cant do that I stink
[2024-01-16T12:25:10] Mirono escooters: Incredible for such a tiny cell
[2024-01-16T12:25:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2024-01-16T12:25:22] Mirono escooters: Time for water-cooled
[2024-01-16T12:25:48] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-01-16T12:25:52] Happy Giraffe: But then need to say with cooling 100A, ofcourse if you have automated LN2 pot keeping it 30c its possible
[2024-01-16T12:25:53] Mirono escooters: Do not awaken the beast
[2024-01-16T12:29:55] Happy Giraffe: Guy I know so far pulled 12kw on that. Controller limits prevent further testing but motor stays very cool and performance is insanity. Best motors that can still be installed on a bicycle like frame. QS90 etc will be too wide to fit and have chainline issues etc
[2024-01-16T12:31:16] haku: real question is. would 350 a be enough to do burnouts on a 33x2 70h?
[2024-01-16T12:31:54] haku: or there will be no torque?
[2024-01-16T12:32:49] Happy Giraffe: You pushing 350A batt and asking if there will be no torque? xd
[2024-01-16T12:33:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Front wheel will always have burnouts
[2024-01-16T12:33:25] haku: its a high speed motor not high toque
[2024-01-16T12:33:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Rear wheel, never happens
[2024-01-16T12:33:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Even high torque never happens
[2024-01-16T12:34:05] haku: dam.
[2024-01-16T12:35:44] Yamal: Real wheel happens 😁‼️
[2024-01-16T12:36:37] Happy Giraffe: Thats just a good thing tho, steering would become shity
[2024-01-16T12:42:50] haku: females has less bone mass then men. means less weight. means more agile
[2024-01-16T12:43:23] haku: agile=fast.
[2024-01-16T12:45:08] haku: thats my scientific take on that
[2024-01-16T12:47:58] Happy Giraffe: Anyone tested 58T capacity at certain amps? 10A-15A?
[2024-01-16T12:48:09] haku: back to sleep for me. carry on gents
[2024-01-16T13:25:56] Happy Giraffe: Racing with females is the only race where Sib doesnt want to be 1st 😆
[2024-01-16T13:38:10] Mirono escooters: So much resistance deviation between new??
[2024-01-16T13:39:33] Mirono escooters: Also that's little more resistanve after so much cycles
[2024-01-16T13:45:38] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12242@16-01-2024_13-45-38.jpg>

[2024-01-16T14:28:02] Mirono escooters: They pretty ok
[2024-01-16T15:02:58] Gabe Enzo: Pro 2 can fit 12s8p or 96 cells up to this point, if that interests anyone XD
[2024-01-16T15:05:07] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12245@16-01-2024_15-05-07.jpg>
[2024-01-16T15:05:08] Gabe Enzo: It can fit an extra 13.265 cells without honeycomb and without the shaded spaces.
[2024-01-16T15:15:09] Gabe Enzo: Yes!!!
[2024-01-16T15:15:10] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣 🔌 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-16T15:36:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahahaha
[2024-01-16T15:45:58] Gabe Enzo: bought 6awg on accident. Guess I'll find a way to do double 6awg on one QS8
[2024-01-16T15:49:27] Gabe Enzo: forgot I'm doing double qs8 anyways haha.
[2024-01-16T15:49:47] Gabe Enzo: 2 QS8 On battery and Two QS8 female on each controller.
[2024-01-16T15:50:17] Gabe Enzo: Yes that's the plan. Just out of curiosity does 4awg fit it?
[2024-01-16T16:00:06] Mirono escooters: Brb I'll saw that .265 cell
[2024-01-16T16:14:36] sombre_enfant: Yeah like the indian i repair everything
[2024-01-16T16:15:41] Gabe Enzo: Without shaded area.
[2024-01-16T16:16:04] Gabe Enzo: and without honeycomb
[2024-01-16T17:46:24] haku: keep that as a spare. might want to use it in the front
[2024-01-16T17:55:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's true but some " has" fat mass on the ass and slows by weight and tbh doesnt help on aerodinamics also 🙈😅
[2024-01-16T17:56:05] Gabe Enzo: It's burned
[2024-01-16T17:56:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Is it the same girl who is in the interview? Dont think so
[2024-01-16T17:57:12] Gabe Enzo: I took off the tyres
[2024-01-16T17:57:17] Gabe Enzo: might be giving them to a customer.
[2024-01-16T17:57:31] Gabe Enzo: I did a few burnouts so I said I'll replace them for free if they blow
[2024-01-16T17:57:41] haku: oh. ok.
[2024-01-16T17:58:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice Also i would not category woman riders female racing 🤔 not sure how to say ,if they good they can beat anybody
[2024-01-16T17:59:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Woman category feels in some things like wnba
[2024-01-16T18:00:04] Gabe Enzo: Scooting isn't physical so both genders should race against eachother
[2024-01-16T18:00:13] Gabe Enzo: one of the advantages of non physical sports.
[2024-01-16T18:00:41] haku: if i managed a scooter race team it will be all women 😭
[2024-01-16T18:00:45] Gabe Enzo: Men usually stronger and this isn't fair, but eSports has no such limiter.
[2024-01-16T18:00:47] Gabe Enzo: Hahaha
[2024-01-16T18:01:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And what about you?
[2024-01-16T18:01:09] Gabe Enzo: Real eSports is electric, not gaming shit. Who even came up with that ridiculous term?
[2024-01-16T18:01:34] haku: i will be the coach.
[2024-01-16T18:01:59] Gabe Enzo: Racing behind a female on a hot day would be.... Uhhh
[2024-01-16T18:02:01] Gabe Enzo: haha
[2024-01-16T18:02:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some nice some pointless

[2024-01-16T18:03:46] Face de Pin Sucé: nope
[2024-01-16T18:04:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say that's cheating
[2024-01-16T18:04:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In both ways it works,if its nice you want to get closer,if not you want distance
[2024-01-16T18:05:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Didn't had time to watch tbh ,but will

[2024-01-16T18:09:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔 we all saw that film😁
[2024-01-16T18:10:55] haku: women does have some fat but muscle weighs more than fat. males have the tendency to have more muscle due to the testostorone.
[2024-01-16T18:11:24] haku: unless females on steroids
[2024-01-16T18:12:24] haku: another scientific take from me 😂
[2024-01-16T18:12:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say some woman is like you say
[2024-01-16T18:13:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also ppl are different

[2024-01-16T20:28:29] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters i did it looks so clean no any cables flying over somewhere and its reliable
[2024-01-16T20:28:47] Mirono escooters: Just use hub motor or large outrunner Dont mess with the settings Configure later in motor config tab
[2024-01-16T20:28:53] Mirono escooters: Good
[2024-01-16T20:29:03] Mirono escooters: Looks safe Don't blind cars
[2024-01-16T20:31:28] puneDir: I tested it and it doesnt blind
[2024-01-16T20:31:36] puneDir: Focuses on somewhere
[2024-01-16T20:34:40] Mirono escooters: Be careful with that thinking
[2024-01-16T20:34:56] Mirono escooters: They are high and powerful A low sitting car is dangerous
[2024-01-16T20:35:11] Mirono escooters: High beams illegal for a reason in most situations
[2024-01-16T20:45:07] haku: how bad is it to ride a scooter 80kph with no suspension?
[2024-01-16T20:45:58] haku: what would that feel like in a track scenario? smooth roads
[2024-01-16T20:47:00] Konstantin: If smooth road, it fine;)
[2024-01-16T20:47:19] Gabe Enzo: Totally fine at 70 with 8.5
[2024-01-16T20:47:22] Gabe Enzo: as long as no bumps
[2024-01-16T20:47:24] haku: wouldnt it be more stable?
[2024-01-16T20:48:51] Mirono escooters: Debatable But ppl have suspension that can lock at higher speeds
[2024-01-16T20:49:44] haku: this question is for my future g30. i will not put any kind of suspension
[2024-01-16T20:51:02] haku: also for track cars usually harden dampening and suspension. i think it would be the same for scooters
[2024-01-16T21:03:49] Gabe Enzo: Im loaded
[2024-01-16T21:04:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice , one day i make you even speak it😄
[2024-01-16T21:05:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on road and road knowledge and skill
[2024-01-16T21:07:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Above 60 road flattens in a way ,coz you fly over shit, however if you hit something bigger You go Superman 😁
[2024-01-16T21:08:24] haku: true. it will be smooth roads.
[2024-01-16T21:08:37] haku: mostly straight
[2024-01-16T21:09:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I do lot similar rides but i usually say skill amd road knowledge needed
[2024-01-16T21:09:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you can do bit more scary slower
[2024-01-16T21:10:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Go dirt road or path in the Forest around september, when you have 20cm leafes and unsure even where the road is
[2024-01-16T21:10:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not to mention condition
[2024-01-16T21:10:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Around 40-50 this is pure adrenalin
[2024-01-16T21:11:03] haku: i will not be racing just doing burnouts and maybe ride it fast on smooth roads
[2024-01-16T21:11:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's how it starts
[2024-01-16T21:11:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Gear also nice to have

[2024-01-16T21:23:07] Gabe Enzo: I've only gotten wrecked while loaded
[2024-01-16T21:25:51] haku: that means the magnets on the hub is 60mm yea? thats how you measure?
[2024-01-16T21:26:43] haku: and the vsett 10 what is magnet size on those. the 10"
[2024-01-16T21:26:51] sombre_enfant: 50mm
[2024-01-16T21:27:19] haku: those bolt on directly to g30 or need mods?
[2024-01-16T21:28:56] sombre_enfant: Yes it does
[2024-01-16T21:29:12] haku: so this laotie motor is pretty much the same as vsett 10 but alot heavier cause 11"
[2024-01-16T21:29:50] haku: is there a tubeless 10" vsett motor?
[2024-01-16T21:30:15] sombre_enfant: No

[2024-01-16T22:49:37] Mirono escooters: Don't want water-cooling, dont buy 75350 Simple
[2024-01-16T22:49:42] haku: i see.
[2024-01-16T22:49:45] Mirono escooters: I understand flipsky hate, but this ain't it.
[2024-01-16T22:49:58] Mirono escooters: Buy another then
[2024-01-16T22:50:02] Mirono escooters: Inefficiënt
[2024-01-16T22:50:09] Happy Giraffe: Or heatspreader for frame🌚 with big contact area
[2024-01-16T22:50:14] Mirono escooters: 1 solid piece of aluminum > 2 bolted ones
[2024-01-16T22:50:28] Mirono escooters: Just ruins the water-cooling high heat transfer concept
[2024-01-16T22:51:14] Mirono escooters: Those efoils are terribly inefficient, pull crazy powers
[2024-01-16T22:51:40] Happy Giraffe: If frame alu then bottom is a surface getting 20°c water already...
[2024-01-16T22:52:01] Mirono escooters: Don't buy it then??
[2024-01-16T22:52:04] haku: thats what im thinking too
[2024-01-16T22:52:07] sombre_enfant: Who in spain i need help
[2024-01-16T22:52:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I ment like that☺️

[2024-01-16T22:52:59] Happy Giraffe: LUL
[2024-01-16T22:53:24] Mirono escooters: Wich makes sense
[2024-01-16T22:53:42] Happy Giraffe: Then I guess heatsource-heatspreader/heatsink-flowing water. Adding pump when you already have speed on water is waste
[2024-01-16T22:53:42] Mirono escooters: That's a wonderful deal
[2024-01-16T22:54:15] Mirono escooters: Just a inlet and outlet and 75350 , simple
[2024-01-16T22:54:23] Mirono escooters: Add pump if ya need more
[2024-01-16T22:54:44] Happy Giraffe: Yeah and stopping using shit fets

[2024-01-16T22:55:21] Mirono escooters: Isn't it Spintend using no datasheet bs?
[2024-01-16T22:55:42] Happy Giraffe: Spintend aint for extreme sports or a surfboard that costs 10,000€😂
[2024-01-16T22:55:43] Mirono escooters: Or I am on drugs, or you all are Odds aren't in my favor
[2024-01-16T22:55:51] haku: calm down bros. all vesc are equal in gods eyes
[2024-01-16T22:55:55] Mirono escooters: The fets are perfectly fine

[2024-01-16T22:56:54] Mirono escooters: I need to figure out water-cooling for my boat in spring Or diy, or 75350 See, it's useful.😊
[2024-01-16T22:58:04] Mirono escooters: Thought SPintend has a phase where they did that too..
[2024-01-16T23:00:36] Happy Giraffe: If Amy is hot they should put her with bikini to marketing team and hire a co-engineer who also helps with issues and gives datasheets etc
[2024-01-16T23:00:44] Mirono escooters: I'd love to see that

[2024-01-17T09:03:35] Yamal: I am very curious about what are installed, inside the scooter, how they work with the temperature issue", if they could only go with heatsinks or would they need a fan system, etc., because there are a lot of scooters on the market that are They could remove the controllers at source and put 2x1 spinteed or whatever...

[2024-01-17T09:32:15] Mirono escooters: It's pretty ok
[2024-01-17T09:32:24] Mirono escooters: The light angle is very good, the form
[2024-01-17T10:20:05] Happy Giraffe: Magishine etc proper light. Pls dont use ali for serious riding. Tho the 18w one is ok-ish as it concentrates all output into road. Lumen not important, Lux is as its the amount of light being thrown to road😁
[2024-01-17T10:23:53] Mirono escooters: If they even say lux
[2024-01-17T10:26:01] Happy Giraffe: They won't😁 my light also should be 25w but pulls 18w at 12v lmao. Also did that with 48v🌚
[2024-01-17T10:26:24] Mirono escooters: Heh, w ratings

[2024-01-17T11:52:01] Mirono escooters: It looks tiny
[2024-01-17T11:52:07] Mirono escooters: But I bet 8awg
[2024-01-17T11:57:28] Finn: 8awg?
[2024-01-17T11:57:50] Finn: Isnt that a xt90?
[2024-01-17T11:58:18] Gabe Enzo: that's 10awg
[2024-01-17T11:58:28] Finn: Double 10awg in one xt90?
[2024-01-17T11:58:30] Finn: Oh god
[2024-01-17T11:59:03] Gabe Enzo: I put 6awg on xt60
[2024-01-17T11:59:09] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12242@16-01-2024_13-45-38.jpg>
[2024-01-17T11:59:11] Gabe Enzo: Magic
[2024-01-17T11:59:37] Finn: Why that haha
[2024-01-17T11:59:48] Gabe Enzo: used xt90 to make motor plugs
[2024-01-17T12:00:09] Finn: Lmao
[2024-01-17T12:00:56] puneDir: <photos/photo_12270@17-01-2024_12-00-56.jpg>

[2024-01-17T12:02:02] Finn: Its 10awg on the ubox
[2024-01-17T12:02:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think i did searching where ,but maybe it was modded . Also water cooling in a water vehicle is best , near any else its similar to an oil shock So if you have tiny oil shock what has no extra oil near in a tank, it's good for nothing. Also i had an idea to try , actually two but second is more fun than reality My own plan is oil based not even water. Other fun is about a bike icecream stand 😁 But near all if we would the space and "money" even my battery would be liquid cooled and warned like in better e cars, if you are familiar with that
[2024-01-17T12:03:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure that's a good idea
[2024-01-17T12:03:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: These not ment for that
[2024-01-17T12:04:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Make a rubber ring sealing from one piece
[2024-01-17T12:12:12] Mirono escooters: That's a qs8
[2024-01-17T12:12:49] Mirono escooters: Ohh it's double wire going in Welp, 12awg×2 ig
[2024-01-17T12:13:50] Finn: Yep same
[2024-01-17T12:16:00] Finn: I see qs8 will be the next upgrade. Better specs than xt90 45A vs 110A continious
[2024-01-17T12:18:21] puneDir: It worked
[2024-01-17T12:18:29] puneDir: <photos/photo_12272@17-01-2024_12-18-29.jpg>
[2024-01-17T12:20:28] Gabe Enzo: me doing double qs8

[2024-01-17T12:22:48] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-01-17T12:43:53] Gabe Enzo: if you trim the outer hairs it's possible to fit any wire to any plug tbh
[2024-01-17T13:41:55] Happy Giraffe: XT30? Lmao not even 60. I guess they like to heat up connectors
[2024-01-17T13:43:04] Finn: The 3shul C350 comes with double xt30??😂😂
[2024-01-17T13:44:32] Happy Giraffe: Segway😁
[2024-01-17T13:47:28] francois schempers: it's a QS8-S connector, much more current 👌
[2024-01-17T13:47:51] francois schempers: it's QS8-S not XT90
[2024-01-17T13:48:53] Happy Giraffe: Mine will have QS10- Happy 1- T-800 (0)
[2024-01-17T13:48:53] Paolo ⁭: G30 2

[2024-01-17T13:53:02] Happy Giraffe: It was xt30 from old xiaomi s
[2024-01-17T14:09:30] Finn: Ah yeah
[2024-01-17T14:10:25] Paolo ⁭: Normally they don't use connector for big power

[2024-01-17T15:25:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But what he said is true
[2024-01-17T15:31:41] Paolo ⁭: Fuck parrot
[2024-01-17T15:31:54] Paolo ⁭: Eat my light wire
[2024-01-17T15:39:39] Yamal: Don't leave it near the engines.
[2024-01-17T15:43:41] Gabe Enzo: "how dare you take a pic of me'

[2024-01-17T16:42:09] Paolo ⁭: I don't know but for big currents and voltage , terminal are the best
[2024-01-17T16:44:13] Happy Giraffe: Big and bad connector will be fine😁XT90 is far from big and bad😁

[2024-01-17T19:38:34] haku: part 2 of the brembo ebike. https://youtu.be/2IUj8w1Esfw?si=keOK0TAC5VzIY0M8
[2024-01-17T19:41:29] haku: these guys turning ebikes into full e motos. 😂
[2024-01-17T19:41:50] haku: murika baby
[2024-01-17T19:41:53] Paolo ⁭: Connectors arrived
[2024-01-17T19:46:41] Happy Giraffe: Yeah with unlimited budget and own company it becomes a bit boring. True warriors build from budget parts in their 1-room flat bedroom😂
[2024-01-17T19:46:59] Happy Giraffe: That bag is 70€😂
[2024-01-17T19:48:44] haku: thats true! but im sure these guys started that way too. or maybe not maybe trustfund kids
[2024-01-17T19:53:01] haku: this is also why i think regulations are coming here. because if it has pedals and electric its street legal without any paperwork.
[2024-01-17T19:55:45] Yamal: Well, you are wasting your time, prepare your scooter soon, and accelerate it as if the day wasn't going to come out tomorrow. sun
[2024-01-17T19:57:54] Yamal: We have a date of 2027, you don't, but in any case it doesn't worry me
[2024-01-17T19:58:02] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-01-17T19:59:07] Paolo ⁭: Cheap compared to these machines hahaha
[2024-01-17T19:59:56] Yamal: Paolo, are you preparing a scooter for the races?
[2024-01-17T20:00:39] haku: whats that white one in the middle?
[2024-01-17T20:01:02] haku: the one with the handles
[2024-01-17T20:03:35] Yamal: Only need arrive home..
[2024-01-17T20:15:31] Paolo ⁭: 120a 30a charger
[2024-01-17T20:28:23] haku: qs12 is pretty new yea? havent been tested enough?
[2024-01-17T20:28:36] haku: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $22.93 20%OFF | QS12S QS12 Anti-sparking Male Female Lipo Battery Plugs Connector High-Current Weldable for E-bike Electric Scooter Balance Car https://a.aliexpress.com/_mN4Bira
[2024-01-17T20:42:46] Happy Giraffe: Idk exactly, being that massive contact area it should perform remarkably well
[2024-01-17T22:32:40] Mike: Go half of the observer gain.Try it

[2024-01-17T22:38:59] Happy Giraffe: Gotta setup the rest, iex sensorless erpm when vesc changes from halls to sensorless tracking
[2024-01-17T22:57:33] haku: but for most scooter builds would qs8 be enough? this seems overkill. made for emotos
[2024-01-17T23:00:24] Happy Giraffe: You can check QS8 ratings. For most people its enough but when going extreme better use 2
[2024-01-17T23:01:50] haku: i hope for a spintend 85/200 qs8 should be enough.
[2024-01-17T23:02:14] Yamal: How is your scooter ,,?
[2024-01-17T23:02:24] haku: waiting on bolts
[2024-01-17T23:02:45] haku: the timeline will be delayed.

[2024-01-17T23:03:23] Happy Giraffe: Theres even QS9 lmao
[2024-01-17T23:03:26] haku: the french will have to wait.
[2024-01-17T23:03:39] Happy Giraffe: Yes, perfectly fine (you wont be running 200A battery currents anyway)
[2024-01-17T23:04:08] Yamal: Are you going to do everything alone?
[2024-01-17T23:04:23] haku: mostly yes.
[2024-01-17T23:04:46] haku: might need some welding we will see
[2024-01-17T23:06:02] Yamal: Well, nothing! good luck with that, waiting to see how that scooter is assembled
[2024-01-17T23:06:35] haku: its gonna be jank. so do not expect much from my engineering skills 😂
[2024-01-17T23:07:14] haku: burnouts #1 priority looks #2 and safety #3
[2024-01-17T23:08:32] Mirono escooters: Stock should be fine
[2024-01-17T23:08:35] Happy Giraffe: If you plan to go crazy then QS10 wont hurt, atleast peace in mind that it wont ever heat or introduce losses Im still searching for a good mountable connector
[2024-01-17T23:08:53] Mirono escooters: Lovely charger
[2024-01-17T23:09:38] Happy Giraffe: Yes, should atleast work
[2024-01-17T23:09:52] haku: my father passed away in 2014. he talked to me in a dream last night saying i need more amps and add more parralel. i told him we will see dad.
[2024-01-17T23:10:37] Yamal: apparently everything good,: -good batteries -good controllers - good engines
[2024-01-17T23:10:57] Mirono escooters: Lets not confuse him even more down the rabbit hole
[2024-01-17T23:15:02] Happy Giraffe: Eventually but better see him after a long lived life instead of a scooter crash. Im also taking it very easy later with the bike as I havent had anything near that power before😅

[2024-01-17T23:28:15] Yamal: I told you the other day, 40A Ant bms for charging, the download is free
[2024-01-17T23:28:45] haku: thats right. i forgot sorry!
[2024-01-17T23:28:57] Yamal: Is okay😂👍🔥
[2024-01-17T23:30:09] haku: with no discharge limit you can prolly peak each cell at 40a. just need a temp sensor
[2024-01-17T23:30:29] haku: very ballsey! let me know how it goes
[2024-01-17T23:31:53] Yamal: If it just arrives and I install it, I want to do acceleration and top speed tests.
[2024-01-17T23:32:37] Yamal: I'm basically doing everything like Rion
[2024-01-17T23:32:51] haku: keep us updated. very interesting how it does.

[2024-01-17T23:40:51] haku: is zero10x and vsett10+ motor the same?
[2024-01-17T23:52:08] NetworkDir: no
[2024-01-17T23:52:56] NetworkDir: zero is low kV (torque based) and 1000W on 52V 1200W on 60V but vsett 10+ is high kV (speed based) 1400W on 60V
[2024-01-17T23:53:56] haku: gotcha. thanks. but does it have the same axle width and rim size?
[2024-01-17T23:59:00] Gabe Enzo: should I use a thermal pad for my escs on a metal plate?
[2024-01-17T23:59:09] Gabe Enzo: Or just thermal paste.
[2024-01-17T23:59:25] haku: my vote is paste

[2024-01-18T17:59:25] puneDir: Motors dont give a fuck to water maybe halls but motors not Even if they do theyre cleanable and totally fixable Also zero motors are mostly sealed well
[2024-01-18T18:00:35] puneDir: Theyre fine if you dont drive in swimming pool
[2024-01-18T18:00:39] Gabe Enzo: motors are waterproof always have been
[2024-01-18T18:00:51] Gabe Enzo: just not halls and bearings

[2024-01-18T18:01:04] puneDir: also this scooter has warranity xd 😳
[2024-01-18T18:01:23] puneDir: if i split it in half they have to replace it xD
[2024-01-18T18:08:51] Happy Giraffe: You gotta seal them yourself😅

[2024-01-18T22:42:01] haku: wtf these are plastic washers. i wanted hardened steel
[2024-01-18T22:42:18] Mirono escooters: Hardened steel washers? Why?
[2024-01-18T22:42:21] Mirono escooters: Hardened doesn't equal better
[2024-01-18T22:42:31] Mirono escooters: Stainless beats it in like, every aspect
[2024-01-18T22:42:46] haku: oh. i thought black is always better
[2024-01-18T22:43:15] haku: i am getting all hardened steel bolts and nuts.
[2024-01-18T22:45:30] haku: changing suspension bolts to hardened steel. would that even matter?
[2024-01-18T22:49:34] Happy Giraffe: Hardened steel not black if you dont make it black😁
[2024-01-18T22:50:08] Happy Giraffe: No need for real, regular stainless more than hard enough
[2024-01-18T22:50:17] haku: hardened steel is always black color yea?
[2024-01-18T22:50:51] haku: too late now. i already ordered weeks ago just waiting for it
[2024-01-18T22:51:02] Happy Giraffe: You mean high tensile bolts?
[2024-01-18T22:51:34] haku: idk. the black stuff. it says 10.9 hardness on it
[2024-01-18T22:51:56] Happy Giraffe: If you have a long axle then special material suited best for that application is best
[2024-01-18T22:52:40] haku: like what material? it will be atleast 160mm bolt.
[2024-01-18T22:52:54] Happy Giraffe: Yeah those come even at 12.9 but they loose elasticity. Its like you have hard material that can crack or soft that bends a bit but comes back😁
[2024-01-18T22:53:47] haku: but it takes alot of force to crack these steel bolts yea?
[2024-01-18T22:54:51] Happy Giraffe: I havent studied them enough, maybe @Her0DasH can tell about tensility number grading system iex. 12.9
[2024-01-18T22:54:59] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2024-01-18T22:55:52] haku: im having a hard time finding long metric bolts here.
[2024-01-18T22:57:08] Happy Giraffe: Grade 8.8 bolts: Also known as structural grade bolts, they are typically made of steel and plated with several coatings. Grade 10.9 bolts: As these bolts are most often used in the automotive industry, they are also referred to as ‘car bolts’. They are made of boron or carbon steel and have high tensile strength (1040 MPa). Grade 12.9 bolts: Known for their strength, these bolts are most often used in the manufacturing and construction industries to join medium or heavy industrial parts such as an automotive engine. Grade 14.9 bolts: It's simple: these are the most durable bolts you can use in your application. Perfect to join large structural elements to each other, the grade 14.9 bolt has a whopping maximum tensile strength of 1400 MPa.
[2024-01-18T22:58:06] Happy Giraffe: I might have been mistaken on the harder = brittle part but yeah. Also matters in which way you measure it. In fastening direction or in scooter axle direction when riding on bumpy road
[2024-01-18T22:58:21] haku: if 10.9 is enough for automotive. it should be enough for scooter use
[2024-01-18T23:00:32] Happy Giraffe: Yes if thick enough. But then again depends on design and application😁 Should be fine 99% of the time
[2024-01-18T23:00:37] haku: hardened steel still prone to rust yea?
[2024-01-18T23:04:43] haku: also @Happy_Giraffe what is better bed for printing? smooth pei or textured?
[2024-01-18T23:05:37] haku: ive noticed some of my pla and petg sticks hard on my textured pei
[2024-01-18T23:09:16] Happy Giraffe: Every kind of steel is prone to rust, some less some more haha. If stainless gets a scratch it slowly starts to rust on that spot
[2024-01-18T23:10:04] Happy Giraffe: I like textured, if bed is leveled and doesnt warp during print it has never failed me😁
[2024-01-18T23:11:02] haku: gotcha. is it true you can put print bed in the dishwasher or wash it with dish soap?
[2024-01-18T23:11:32] haku: i wipe it with alcohol but theres still some foggy marks
[2024-01-18T23:11:57] haku: yes. i have this problem too haha
[2024-01-18T23:14:13] haku: lol sometimes i have to use metal spatula to remove it. ive scratched it a few times already
[2024-01-18T23:14:32] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow I ask my teachers the differences on these tensile table bolts if 12.9 is always stronger than lets say 8.8
[2024-01-18T23:16:12] Happy Giraffe: Petg CF 95° printbed makes part warped but its like welded on it😂
[2024-01-18T23:18:15] Happy Giraffe: Gotta check if I could privately maybe make spare axles for my bike🤔 Would be fun to lathe some grade 5 titanium😅
[2024-01-18T23:19:03] haku: titanium is just lighter yea? not stronger
[2024-01-18T23:21:58] Happy Giraffe: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! €0.20 30%OFF | Titanium Rod Grade 5 Bar GR5 Welding Wire Shaft Rods 2mm To 35mm https://a.aliexpress.com/_EGjScD3

[2024-01-18T23:23:09] Happy Giraffe: Less dense but almost as strong. So it can outperform weight:performance ratio Pure titanium soft and weak tho. Needs to be a higher number grade that has aluminium etc other metals added to it
[2024-01-18T23:23:19] Happy Giraffe: Take a magnet and check
[2024-01-18T23:25:09] haku: no wonder its made in eu.

[2024-01-18T23:35:07] haku: i need to go to ikea actually. need more skadis for my ali tool collection
[2024-01-18T23:53:26] haku: dam $2k for this. ill wait for the discount sale 😂 https://youtu.be/CS5hU-pX208?si=2ZHgHb_F5x-vr0wX
[2024-01-18T23:53:58] haku: alot of emotos coming this year.
[2024-01-18T23:58:42] Happy Giraffe: So basically weighs 50% more than my current ebike and 50% of the power😂
[2024-01-18T23:59:20] haku: he said there will be a midrive version
[2024-01-18T23:59:55] Happy Giraffe: I have no hope for them, just copied super73 with a new 2$ rear light design😂
[2024-01-19T00:00:03] haku: i like the look. i wonder where they cut corners
[2024-01-19T00:00:10] Happy Giraffe: Everywhere
[2024-01-19T00:00:13] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-01-19T00:01:01] Happy Giraffe: Fork = shit, frame = shit, brakes = maybe ok, shocks = shit, battery = shit, esc = shit, motor = maybe ok
[2024-01-19T00:01:36] haku: hopefully they even come out to western market so we see real world reviews
[2024-01-19T00:01:49] Happy Giraffe: Lights = "look at all deeez INSANE Lightss"😂
[2024-01-19T00:02:46] haku: ill keep my $700 engwe 😂
[2024-01-19T00:04:04] Happy Giraffe: Its usually just a tierlist of Normal Hardtail MTB -> Ebike Steel frame MTB/Fullsus ebike DH bike into Ebike Minicross/Razors 50/125/250cc dirtbikes into ebikes
[2024-01-19T00:04:42] Happy Giraffe: Wouldnt really do anything else than these, tho I would skip the normal mtb builds and go straight to DH bike and above
[2024-01-19T00:05:19] Happy Giraffe: Chinabike with some nasty engineering that can end your life aint hot
[2024-01-19T00:12:43] haku: i have a folding one thats really sketch
[2024-01-19T00:13:25] francois schempers: here
[2024-01-19T00:13:42] francois schempers: ESC V1.4/2.1/3.0 mod and tutorial this file includes a tutorial to modd all esc versions and also has some pretty usefull info about precharge cables, 3d prints, ecc. Sorry for the typing errors, i will correct them when i will have some time. Here a link to a video tutorial (in spanish) by @CamiAlfa https://youtu.be/Qym06yv4vD8
[2024-01-19T00:14:07] haku: if i want to mess with ebikes in the future it will be the surron platform or something similar
[2024-01-19T00:14:11] francois schempers: use a m365 controller, they are dirt cheap, and compatible with your g30 stuff
[2024-01-19T00:14:20] francois schempers: you can easily mod them
[2024-01-19T00:17:11] haku: or something small like a minibike
[2024-01-19T00:20:07] francois schempers: I'm not sure, it may be the number of time hall sensor "saw" a magnet
[2024-01-19T00:21:38] francois schempers: max g2 now, better than g30 in everyway 👌
[2024-01-19T00:22:18] francois schempers: plus I'm currently exploring swing arm mod to easily fit bigger motor 👌
[2024-01-19T00:22:51] francois schempers: <photos/photo_12287@19-01-2024_00-22-51.jpg>
[2024-01-19T00:23:59] francois schempers: Well, once the rabbit hole is open x) with happy's machined pieces, I can make the fork as wide as I want 👌
[2024-01-19T00:24:29] francois schempers: <photos/photo_12288@19-01-2024_00-24-29.jpg>
[2024-01-19T00:24:39] francois schempers: <photos/photo_12289@19-01-2024_00-24-39.jpg>
[2024-01-19T00:27:05] francois schempers: I had 2wd before, and rear was always hotter, it works a lot more especially when your heavy, I feel like it's better for me to put 2x the budget in one Vesc and one motor and use that at 100% on the rear, instead of splitting my budget into lower tier one and have the front one do 30% of the job
[2024-01-19T00:28:54] francois schempers: for the same budget, you get nothing to use those phase amps
[2024-01-19T00:29:14] francois schempers: sure if you double the budget too, but that's not the point
[2024-01-19T00:32:16] francois schempers: for around 600€ I get a 3500w motor that I will run at 10kw peak and a controller that can easily output that, I don't see how you can get the same for 2 motors and 2 controller for 600
[2024-01-19T00:34:53] francois schempers: that's why I ferrofluided it heavily, even if I get some drag, it will handle some heat, and the 10kw power are for short burst, not at all sustained, I should be good tempwise
[2024-01-19T00:36:24] francois schempers: yeah, plus easier to do burn out if I just have rear motor and front brake😂 👌
[2024-01-19T00:37:11] francois schempers: Hum Hum @Happy_Giraffe @Mirono_escooters you guys heard the man 😂
[2024-01-19T00:38:16] francois schempers: and 2wd I loose the stock look, plus that takes too much internal space, here I have 20s5p inside with like 2mm spacer
[2024-01-19T00:39:18] francois schempers: when police see my front tire see through like the stock rim, they won't even bother ^^
[2024-01-19T00:41:05] francois schempers: plus I have a high visibility vest, and a bike helmet,I look like a old pops discovering technology,little do they know that that stockish looking scooter can do 100km/h 😂😂
[2024-01-19T00:41:46] francois schempers: never ! 🤣

[2024-01-19T01:20:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-19T01:22:15] francois schempers: last one
[2024-01-19T01:24:36] Tommy ª: first
[2024-01-19T01:42:38] haku: 2nd. less is more
[2024-01-19T01:56:56] haku: is there a stronger hole punch than these ali ones?
[2024-01-19T02:00:10] haku: it barely dents steel
[2024-01-19T02:21:26] Unknown: @Bradhaku use never-sieze on stainless bolt and Nuts they gall and lock togeather or use plain steel nuts. Or just quality bolts the Chinesium holds so it's an upgrade anyway.
[2024-01-19T02:44:51] haku: also another question to the gamers. is there a way to get nintendo switch games to PC/windows? my son seems to like the nintendo switch but i sold mine on 2020 when it was worth triple. also we are less fortunate folks
[2024-01-19T03:05:30] haku: <photos/photo_12295@19-01-2024_03-05-30.jpg>
[2024-01-19T03:06:12] haku: kids messing up the trails again. i hate em but i secretly want one
[2024-01-19T03:19:06] Franchesco Carofano: first test of the 75200 controllers and 3000watt 22x3 70h motors🔥
[2024-01-19T03:22:16] haku: does the back wheel slip or it sticks to the road?
[2024-01-19T03:22:55] Franchesco Carofano: sticks to the road
[2024-01-19T03:23:42] Franchesco Carofano: How do I look for the Vest Toll application on my device, I have an iPhone.
[2024-01-19T08:02:44] Happy Giraffe: "Puner0n SeXXmonstah"
[2024-01-19T08:02:59] Happy Giraffe: Zero boring
[2024-01-19T08:03:30] Happy Giraffe: Surron doesnt have the power to mess up anything😁
[2024-01-19T08:04:55] haku: it actually does. this one a 72v talaria x. they make holes on offroad trails.
[2024-01-19T08:05:20] Yamal: what scooter do you ride?
[2024-01-19T08:05:25] haku: and holes on grass parts
[2024-01-19T08:07:37] haku: they do offroad burnouts. so annoying. they effed up my park
[2024-01-19T08:11:58] puneDir: Good idea
[2024-01-19T08:33:56] Mirono escooters: Tldr?
[2024-01-19T08:34:19] Mirono escooters: Ah, finishing da stuff 😂
[2024-01-19T09:25:08] Yamal: Arrive!!!!😎🤣
[2024-01-19T09:43:23] Gabe Enzo: It can mess up grass, that's about it.
[2024-01-19T09:59:43] Mirono escooters: And your wallet
[2024-01-19T10:24:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is several, these type for marking, like you need to grow them of needed
[2024-01-19T10:24:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But usually you drill in steps not size max you need
[2024-01-19T10:25:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i would try searching local metal company or such
[2024-01-19T10:28:08] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, better models catching up slowly😁
[2024-01-19T10:31:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So about the bolts
[2024-01-19T10:38:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: the first number indicates the tensile strength, which shows how much mechanical load the screw can withstand per square millimeter, the second number, which is the product of the tensile strength, indicates the yield strength. This value refers to the ability of the screw material to maintain its original shape under load. So this kinda means it goes back to shape after no load even if load bends it in a way. There is much more behind this, basically i would say ppl not always search for max ,coz some builds need to move and bolts have to stand that also , super big numbers are pretty rigid like that ,so Need to know how to choose your destiny
[2024-01-19T10:40:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 10,9 and such can be find in industrial machines
[2024-01-19T10:41:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 12,9 is holding lot type of car suspension parts,even truck rims
[2024-01-19T10:44:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So basically question leads to more questions
[2024-01-19T10:44:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And what a morning wall of text
[2024-01-19T10:45:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also stupid things happen here Yesterday we had +13c Now i look out and its snowing 🙈
[2024-01-19T10:59:29] haku: he said he runs 72v on a stock esc and motor. talaria x is 60v stock
[2024-01-19T11:01:26] haku: thanks for this.
[2024-01-19T11:03:41] haku: fire it up bud! congrats
[2024-01-19T11:06:15] Yamal: thank you ! I'm looking forward to trying it!
[2024-01-19T12:51:04] Rose: Hey there wdyrmdn, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-19T13:13:59] Happy Giraffe: Teacher said same, 12.9 typically always stronger bolt in both direction. Tho for axles one might use softer material that has ability for slight bend
[2024-01-19T13:59:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: first test of the 75200 controllers and 3000watt 22x3 70h motors🔥

[2024-01-19T15:13:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you adjust it well and make a fast pull on the belt where extra comes it tightens up and should stay like it
[2024-01-19T15:17:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also screen can die while key still works and shows bullshit, but lot times dies fully
[2024-01-19T15:18:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I Would surly say to secure who knows what happens with esc if it shorts with keymod, since it works like "xiaomi" this way

[2024-01-19T18:11:11] Finn: @Her0DasH heres the interesting part
[2024-01-19T18:11:30] Gabe Enzo: should you not be able to fit the entire 20s3p inside vertically, and still have space for the original esc lmfao
[2024-01-19T18:12:35] Finn: Thats a 1s😂
[2024-01-19T18:12:45] Gabe Enzo: 1s is m365 shape no
[2024-01-19T18:12:46] Finn: Also this will be dual so no space
[2024-01-19T18:12:51] Finn: Yes
[2024-01-19T18:13:02] Gabe Enzo: Dual 300w works very very well so I've heard
[2024-01-19T18:13:03] Finn: 10s3p fits perfect in with 21700
[2024-01-19T18:13:14] Finn: And with 20s and fieldweaking even better haha
[2024-01-19T18:13:29] Finn: Faster acceleration than a tesla

[2024-01-19T18:14:38] Gabe Enzo: Only 3? I've killed 10. Also, this is me saying this: Skill issue
[2024-01-19T18:14:44] Finn: Lmao

[2024-01-19T18:15:04] Gabe Enzo: OK, true. but it's true.
[2024-01-19T18:15:09] Gabe Enzo: I have skill issue
[2024-01-19T18:15:21] Gabe Enzo: that's why I moved away from xesc
[2024-01-19T18:15:26] Finn: It can be a skill issue or a part failing which was already dead
[2024-01-19T18:15:30] Konstantin: Ok, if ESC give somebody for free , if pay... Go AliExpress and bought chip vesc ;)
[2024-01-19T18:15:41] Tommy ª: nah i just slapped a vesc on it and 0 problems looks like og controller dont like +70kmh braking with 10s

[2024-01-19T18:15:58] Finn: What you wanna say?
[2024-01-19T18:16:15] Gabe Enzo: Perhaps I'll have a chance because I don't use stimulants anymore. So I'll give it a shot LOL
[2024-01-19T18:16:31] Gabe Enzo: ADHD meds before soldering = 💩
[2024-01-19T18:17:03] Finn: Got the fastest single motor scooter here with vesc😁
[2024-01-19T18:17:06] Jan: Adhd meds = tunnel vision
[2024-01-19T18:17:21] Konstantin: Tunning m365 ESC to vesc... Ok if you have them free. If need to buy, just order box cheap vesc version

[2024-01-19T18:18:42] Finn: Yes i guess the blade was already at its thermal limit. Sad this thing doesnt have a temp sensor. Pushing 9kw in it💀😁
[2024-01-19T18:18:59] Paolo ⁭: solid tire, no brake, is crazy

[2024-01-19T18:35:46] Tommy ª: the rev1 of my board has only 4 pin connector (and 125w cpu dont like that 😭 ) i just soldered the wires on it and now fine
[2024-01-19T18:36:43] Finn: Custom made connector for my handlebar. Quick charge for phone is very important😂
[2024-01-19T18:51:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cant say , I didn't said so🤣

[2024-01-19T18:58:23] haku: here adderall still prescribed.
[2024-01-19T19:01:59] Gabe Enzo: As it should be. it's the only thing that actually works
[2024-01-19T19:02:14] Gabe Enzo: Ritalin is shit, and non stimulant adhd meds simply don't work.
[2024-01-19T19:02:32] Gabe Enzo: they're amphetamines and always have been and always will be . I'm getting amphetamine prescribed next week, switching from ritalin
[2024-01-19T19:05:43] Mirono escooters: None worked fine for me, bad effects overall, fuck up personality
[2024-01-19T19:05:47] Oreo huzky: Survival masters sticker 🫣
[2024-01-19T19:06:23] haku: never tried any of those prescription stuff

[2024-01-19T19:07:34] haku: i only use when needed.
[2024-01-19T19:08:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Would need to search for pics,but basically what was in them was interesting,kinda like pure speed

[2024-01-19T19:10:06] Gabe Enzo: Caffeine works well, but it's effects on sleep are awful. I'm quitting myself.
[2024-01-19T19:10:24] Mirono escooters: Doesn't do shit to me
[2024-01-19T19:10:33] Mirono escooters: I could take cafeïne pill, nothing
[2024-01-19T19:10:52] Gabe Enzo: it makes me psychotic and trigger panic attacks yet I still use it. and hallucinations
[2024-01-19T19:11:03] Gabe Enzo: Addiction since childhood, I'm going cold turkey tomorrow
[2024-01-19T19:11:22] Gabe Enzo: Cutting down doesn't work, I tried today and had like 10 coffees after a few days off.
[2024-01-19T19:12:14] Gabe Enzo: I use SSRIs for anxiety disorder Good you only use it when needed, responsibility Terrible thing to get used to.
[2024-01-19T19:14:02] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2024-01-19T19:14:26] Mirono escooters: Yk what triggers that for me? School
[2024-01-19T19:14:52] Gabe Enzo: I got bullied and have ptsd from school. entire school hated me
[2024-01-19T19:15:24] Gabe Enzo: would've probably killed myself if I didnt have weed during HS.
[2024-01-19T19:16:15] Gabe Enzo: They tried stealing my Pro 2 multiple times but I never let them, it's my baby. That's why I'm not getting a G30.

[2024-01-19T19:17:06] Finn: I tried coffee once and i dont like it till this day. Also i can stand up very good in the morning without the need of a coffee
[2024-01-19T19:17:14] Mirono escooters: This got into trauma posting real quick
[2024-01-19T19:17:20] Gabe Enzo: Once you get dependent it's over.
[2024-01-19T19:17:31] Gabe Enzo: Don't start
[2024-01-19T19:17:33] Finn: Yes i know
[2024-01-19T19:17:34] Mirono escooters: I'm a zombie for half a hour, not because of no coffee, just morning
[2024-01-19T19:17:39] Mirono escooters: A lil bit of coffee is fine
[2024-01-19T19:18:00] Finn: I have a friend who stands up at 5am and goes to bed at 11pm
[2024-01-19T19:18:09] Mirono escooters: Why did we let morning people make our time schedule
[2024-01-19T19:18:10] Finn: He drinks arround 5 coffee a day
[2024-01-19T19:18:12] Gabe Enzo: Alzheimer's by 45.
[2024-01-19T19:18:14] Mirono escooters: We were probably sleeping while they did it
[2024-01-19T19:18:40] Mirono escooters: Atleast we won't know xd
[2024-01-19T19:18:50] puneDir: They
[2024-01-19T19:18:56] puneDir: They dont do much difference
[2024-01-19T19:19:05] Gabe Enzo: Depends on the person!!
[2024-01-19T19:19:28] Gabe Enzo: incredible benefits for me.
[2024-01-19T19:23:32] Mirono escooters: Yep very dependant Also different products can help
[2024-01-19T19:26:44] haku: yes be carefull with adderall but good stuff from coming from folks that are prescribed
[2024-01-19T19:27:04] Gabe Enzo: It's assholes who abuse meds illegally that make it hard for us people who actually need them to get them.
[2024-01-19T19:27:11] Gabe Enzo: This is why doctors don't trust most people anymore.
[2024-01-19T19:27:37] haku: good for workouts and gaming i hear.
[2024-01-19T19:27:54] Gabe Enzo: Be careful when working out after taking it even when prescribed.
[2024-01-19T19:27:59] Gabe Enzo: And never mix with caffeine.
[2024-01-19T19:28:23] haku: nah im cool witg over the counter pre workout.

[2024-01-19T20:43:08] Gabe Enzo: One by one
[2024-01-19T20:44:19] Happy Giraffe: Coffee nap is a real thing, chug a cup of coffee fast when ready to take a nap. Set timer for 20minutes and wake up b00sted😂
[2024-01-19T21:33:24] haku: this brings me memories. i played this at launch and was hooked. i never played the heroes though. just the shooter part
[2024-01-19T21:52:07] Happy Giraffe: Now theres the new one haha. I also played the OG one as a kid but as I didnt know english I didnt understand the game at all😂
[2024-01-19T21:53:43] haku: yes. i played bf2 too and the OG one as a kid.

[2024-01-19T21:59:19] Happy Giraffe: Same..
[2024-01-19T22:04:10] Rose: Hey there ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-01-19T22:05:23] Mirono escooters: Welcome back
[2024-01-19T22:05:55] Happy Giraffe: Theres custom brake discs that have been done with our CN machines. Maybe I could get a hold on those and try to make some 2.3mm or 2.5mm ones😁
[2024-01-19T22:06:30] Tommy ª: You can make me a small gearbox?
[2024-01-19T22:06:32] Happy Giraffe: Teachers all 4 sons used to ride Downhill racing😅 they did like 300mm rotors roflmao
[2024-01-19T22:07:25] Happy Giraffe: Gearbox making not easy, I don't have access to the machines yet and don't know if they have all the tooling🤔
[2024-01-19T22:07:32] francois schempers: no for long, I'm comming for your place 😂😂
[2024-01-19T22:08:04] Happy Giraffe: Maybe you could get it 3D printed from PEEK?
[2024-01-19T22:08:39] Happy Giraffe: I put a self destruct module in your adapters
[2024-01-19T22:08:53] Mirono escooters: @VioletViolencee coming close too
[2024-01-19T22:08:59] Tommy ª: Bruh 130kg driver + plastic + 150amp + 10krpm sounds rough 😭 Ah wait, today exists metal 3d printing or something like that
[2024-01-19T22:09:02] Mirono escooters: And uh, isn't @jamessoderstrom fastest on single motor? Cant remember
[2024-01-19T22:09:07] Mirono escooters: You all madlads
[2024-01-19T22:09:47] Mirono escooters: Oh mb
[2024-01-19T22:13:43] Happy Giraffe: Where are you putting a gearbox, why not get a QS90 motor and use chain + cogs to do reduction?🤔
[2024-01-19T22:14:13] Tommy ª: bc is a 15yr old scooter 😭
[2024-01-19T22:14:31] Happy Giraffe: PEEK gear used in Bafang BBSHD etc motors but not sure if fits yours
[2024-01-19T22:15:25] Tommy ª: i have very limited space, now im running with a very compact 40v 1800w inrunner hydraulic pump motor
[2024-01-19T22:15:49] sombre_enfant: Wich battery ?
[2024-01-19T22:17:50] francois schempers: 20s with 100A discharge c350 controller, 3500w rage motor
[2024-01-19T22:23:34] sombre_enfant: The cells ?
[2024-01-19T22:24:13] francois schempers: 40T
[2024-01-19T22:24:22] sombre_enfant: Good
[2024-01-19T22:24:27] francois schempers: I know x)
[2024-01-19T22:24:47] sombre_enfant: Dual next ? Fork mods
[2024-01-19T22:24:59] haku: is that cell the gold eu standard
[2024-01-19T22:25:08] francois schempers: nah, I wanna keep the stock look
[2024-01-19T22:25:15] francois schempers: oh yeah 👌
[2024-01-19T22:26:47] haku: for high discharge cells
[2024-01-19T22:27:17] sombre_enfant: 120 amps battery 270A phase and 70A field weakening should be ok
[2024-01-19T22:28:19] Mirono escooters: 70a fw??
[2024-01-19T22:28:31] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-01-19T22:28:50] Mirono escooters: On a single motor?
[2024-01-19T22:28:55] Mirono escooters: Idk wich drugs you are on but hit me up
[2024-01-19T22:28:59] sombre_enfant: For sure
[2024-01-19T22:29:20] sombre_enfant: Snus only sometime hash
[2024-01-19T22:33:15] Mirono escooters: Must be the lead solder then
[2024-01-19T22:34:09] haku: rosin is the best
[2024-01-19T22:34:33] haku: i get a headache the next day
[2024-01-19T22:34:33] Mirono escooters: I've learned today that you can sniff lighter gas Edit: I DIDN'T LEARN BY TRYING
[2024-01-19T22:34:52] Mirono escooters: Lead makes dumb, why do all great metals have shit properties
[2024-01-19T22:35:37] haku: the best scent is when you pucture a battery. makes your eyes teary
[2024-01-19T22:36:04] Mirono escooters: Steel, easily weldable, workable, great strength, cheap, castable Rusts.. Aluminium: most common metal in Earth's crust. Super light, great thermal properties and pretty strong to weight ratio Cons: shit to work with 😢😢😢
[2024-01-19T22:36:15] Mirono escooters: God just had to nerf some stuff to balance it out
[2024-01-19T22:36:50] Mirono escooters: I must have nothing left
[2024-01-19T22:36:55] Mirono escooters: I sniff fumes daily
[2024-01-19T22:37:07] Mirono escooters: ^^
[2024-01-19T22:37:38] Mirono escooters: Oh and ofcourse asbest, super promising material Causes cancer tho. :(
[2024-01-19T22:37:42] haku: i want to make one
[2024-01-19T22:37:42] Mirono escooters: Got printer
[2024-01-19T22:38:29] Mirono escooters: Well then ^^
[2024-01-19T22:39:19] Mirono escooters: Nah ofc 21700 it
[2024-01-19T22:39:27] haku: i have useless fans that amy sold me. i need to turn it to this
[2024-01-19T22:39:27] Mirono escooters: Preferably on a arm that you can adjust
[2024-01-19T22:40:26] Mirono escooters: Akf should be enough
[2024-01-19T22:40:49] Mirono escooters: Point is mostly to get it away from your face, so you don't breathe in the concentrated fumes That's what I've been told
[2024-01-19T22:40:57] Mirono escooters: Don't forget akf needs a lot more power to push through
[2024-01-19T22:41:36] Gabe Enzo: Flux is cancerous
[2024-01-19T22:41:47] Gabe Enzo: Always solder with a fan and windows up
[2024-01-19T22:41:56] Mirono escooters: What isn't at this point
[2024-01-19T22:42:10] Paolo ⁭: Lead even more
[2024-01-19T22:42:19] Gabe Enzo: More cancerous than drinking from a plastic bottle.
[2024-01-19T22:42:21] Mirono escooters: And makes dumb
[2024-01-19T22:42:36] Gabe Enzo: Highly cancerous**
[2024-01-19T22:42:47] Gabe Enzo: My granny died from cancer a week ago
[2024-01-19T22:42:48] Mirono escooters: Fak that
[2024-01-19T22:42:53] Mirono escooters: I'm not planning to live till 80 anyway
[2024-01-19T22:42:59] Mirono escooters: Oh I'm sorry to hear
[2024-01-19T22:43:02] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_12313@19-01-2024_22-43-02.jpg>
[2024-01-19T22:43:12] Gabe Enzo: She died at 80 kek
[2024-01-19T22:43:19] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2024-01-19T22:43:30] haku: i hear drinking mercury is healthy
[2024-01-19T22:44:38] Mirono escooters: Funny we got iron in blood
[2024-01-19T22:46:46] Finn: hehe
[2024-01-19T22:46:52] Mirono escooters: Still don't understand Hy
[2024-01-19T22:47:17] haku: no wonder steel welders here pays good and have good insurance.
[2024-01-19T22:47:28] Mirono escooters: Oh welders body suffers
[2024-01-19T22:47:29] Jan: The ones i tried made quite the difference
[2024-01-19T22:47:45] Mirono escooters: I'm seeing a link between scoots and adhd at this point
[2024-01-19T22:48:52] Happy Giraffe: Alu is shit to work with cmon🌚
[2024-01-19T22:49:02] Mirono escooters: Steel is better. Admit it
[2024-01-19T22:49:13] Mirono escooters: There's a reason car manufacturers prefer it over alu by a lot
[2024-01-19T22:49:13] Happy Giraffe: Its nice to TIG and machine alu...
[2024-01-19T22:49:28] Mirono escooters: Tig alu is not as nice as just bagette steel and call it a day
[2024-01-19T22:49:39] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-01-19T22:50:26] Happy Giraffe: You should try TIG alu, feels the best😁
[2024-01-19T22:50:34] Paolo ⁭: Why shit go work with?
[2024-01-19T22:50:53] Happy Giraffe: Stainless steel/Titanium much worse haha
[2024-01-19T22:50:54] Paolo ⁭: Super easy to drill, cut , flex
[2024-01-19T22:50:57] Mirono escooters: Way more work compared to steel to make strong assembly
[2024-01-19T22:51:13] Mirono escooters: I didn't say that they weren't..
[2024-01-19T22:51:19] Mirono escooters: I'm talking pure materials
[2024-01-19T22:51:26] Mirono escooters: (ok titanium is but whatev)
[2024-01-19T22:51:32] Mirono escooters: Easily accessible to us
[2024-01-19T22:52:15] Happy Giraffe: Not really, gotta clean both alu and steel before welding etc. Alu heat harder to control tho but easier to cut etc if you use some solvent to prevent it sticking to blades
[2024-01-19T22:52:36] Mirono escooters: Eh, opinions differ I see I follow what my experiences car maker teacher says..
[2024-01-19T22:53:11] Happy Giraffe: For car use its thin sheets but again very use case specific thing🌚
[2024-01-19T22:53:24] haku: alu welding is more expensive and laborsome yea?
[2024-01-19T22:53:56] Mirono escooters: You can bagette weld with a car battery if you need a fix to go home let's say 😂
[2024-01-19T22:53:59] haku: i need to widen my g30 forks and weld my laotie battery box
[2024-01-19T22:54:12] haku: alu alloy 😭
[2024-01-19T22:54:14] Happy Giraffe: If you weld it yourself not really. Just need argon and thats about it
[2024-01-19T22:54:56] haku: i will not trust my own welds. maybe someday
[2024-01-19T22:56:03] Mirono escooters: I let someone from school weld my scooter pole aswell, I am not trusting it
[2024-01-19T22:56:14] Happy Giraffe: Kinda easy to see if weld succesfull or not😁 It surely needs a lot of practice. Sadly I take machining courses so I might have the time to take welding class tests
[2024-01-19T22:56:16] Mirono escooters: Without a proper degree, I stick to welding stupid not going 60kmh stuff
[2024-01-19T22:56:42] haku: oh noes.
[2024-01-19T22:57:02] Happy Giraffe: Yeah if its a guy you trust, Ive seen so many bad welds on internet by "Pros"😂
[2024-01-19T22:57:05] haku: i will be bolting and welding it
[2024-01-19T22:58:02] haku: ill just jb weld it 😂
[2024-01-19T22:58:22] Happy Giraffe: Maybe best to just bend the forks if you can and just reinforce them a bit
[2024-01-19T22:59:26] Happy Giraffe: Rear is easier depending on size you need could just weld 2 plates there and add some external support on outside
[2024-01-19T22:59:57] Happy Giraffe: But if the fork arms are not square type then its a headache😂
[2024-01-19T23:00:43] haku: i was looking at welders the other week. about time i learn this manly skill
[2024-01-19T23:02:40] haku: look how clean these old cannondale bikes welds
[2024-01-19T23:03:19] haku: i wonder how they did that
[2024-01-19T23:03:55] haku: <photos/photo_12315@19-01-2024_23-03-55.jpg>
[2024-01-19T23:04:20] haku: maybe.
[2024-01-19T23:06:35] haku: theres no bead lines
[2024-01-19T23:20:52] Mirono escooters: Well I trust him and I can visually check/lathe a bit off
[2024-01-19T23:25:43] haku: @Mirono_escooters
[2024-01-19T23:26:01] haku: what should i coat first
[2024-01-19T23:26:24] Mirono escooters: Just 2 soldered wires is great
[2024-01-19T23:26:34] Mirono escooters: Or a little pcb u got somewhere , idk
[2024-01-19T23:26:53] haku: this stuff reeks omg.
[2024-01-19T23:27:15] Mirono escooters: XD smell is yeah
[2024-01-19T23:27:56] haku: i will test it on a pcb. see how easy it comes off
[2024-01-19T23:29:08] haku: can you put this over the nickel plated steel to weather proof it?
[2024-01-19T23:30:33] haku: i will try it anyways
[2024-01-19T23:32:05] Mirono escooters: Yeah sure, it's expensive to use it for that purpose but eh
[2024-01-19T23:32:52] haku: just the top welds for copper nickel sandwich
[2024-01-19T23:32:55] Mirono escooters: Conformal coating for steel/nickel batteries Liquid Silicon for pcb, fragile wires , securing connectors, ... Regular Silicon to waterproof stuff/seal batt ends Epoxy for thermal and sturdyness
[2024-01-19T23:32:58] Mirono escooters: That's my basic list
[2024-01-19T23:34:55] haku: how long does this dry?
[2024-01-19T23:35:57] Mirono escooters: A hour till touchable A day till fully cured
[2024-01-19T23:36:10] Mirono escooters: It's like, touchable, but underneath it'll still be soft and stuff
[2024-01-19T23:36:25] Mirono escooters: After a day it really takes its rubbery properties and sticks better
[2024-01-19T23:36:58] haku: its like easy to remove potting then
[2024-01-19T23:47:54] Mirono escooters: Yes, except it doesn't conduct heat well
[2024-01-19T23:48:09] Mirono escooters: And its pretty expensive considering weight per euro, wouldn't pot stuff with it xd
[2024-01-20T00:02:35] @Súperpatin: Hello, who can help me solve this noise when starting the engine?
[2024-01-20T00:03:50] haku: maybe hall sensors
[2024-01-20T00:07:06] @Súperpatin: The hallway sensors are fine, I thought the same too, I checked them many times and they are fine!
[2024-01-20T00:09:51] @Súperpatin: It only makes noise when current begins to enter, and it begins to make the first turns, after more current begins to enter the noise goes away.
[2024-01-20T00:11:39] haku: did you open it? might be a lose magnet or something. idk im just guessing
[2024-01-20T00:12:02] @Súperpatin: I'm new to this, is there any parameter that can supply more current when starting the first acceleration?
[2024-01-20T00:13:08] haku: yes there is in vesctool i believe. wait for someone more knowledgable to answer.
[2024-01-20T00:13:54] @Súperpatin: not king!!! I already put another J&P driver in it and the motor sounds excellent.
[2024-01-20T00:14:57] haku: do you have a vesc?
[2024-01-20T00:20:22] Mirono escooters: Phase amps?
[2024-01-20T00:20:31] @Súperpatin: Look
[2024-01-20T00:20:37] @Súperpatin: si Flisky 75100
[2024-01-20T00:20:55] Mirono escooters: Some setup is wrong. Tell more details and settings
[2024-01-20T00:21:09] Mirono escooters: Possible your motor values are off
[2024-01-20T00:21:12] Mirono escooters: Did you update firmware
[2024-01-20T00:21:20] Mirono escooters: Stock fw is shit
[2024-01-20T00:26:41] @Súperpatin: Where can I see if the engine values ​​are off?
[2024-01-20T00:46:55] haku: i need to stretch my forks by about 20mm. do you guys remove the inner supports?
[2024-01-20T00:48:25] haku: this project might be to ambitious for me
[2024-01-20T00:56:42] Happy Giraffe: Check realtime data screen as the result suggested, more info could be there
[2024-01-20T01:00:21] Happy Giraffe: Spacers welded to it might work. Might need to remove some material first. If the tire even fits😂
[2024-01-20T01:10:48] haku: tire will fit if i remove the inner supports. 😂
[2024-01-20T01:12:03] haku: g30 is solid frame. im gonna have to engineer something.
[2024-01-20T01:15:13] haku: how wide are the forks on the snsc frame?
[2024-01-20T01:25:48] Happy Giraffe: Well then frame becomes weaker again
[2024-01-20T01:26:22] Happy Giraffe: Square is weakest form, need to have a triangle atleast somewhere
[2024-01-20T01:30:42] haku: i might have to buy some sort of suspension upgrade and put longer bolts. but i want it as simple as possible. stock looking still
[2024-01-20T01:31:36] Happy Giraffe: Maybe @AJAJ1992 and others G30 tuners know better what's the best solution to this
[2024-01-20T02:17:50] haku: i barely drive my car anymore unless im taking my dog and kid. scooter life is just better imo. ill sell the tesla and get sidecars for my scooters. no more paying for premium insurance 😂
[2024-01-20T02:18:01] haku: <photos/photo_12319@20-01-2024_02-18-01.jpg>
[2024-01-20T03:46:50] haku: yep this has to be welded or ill only have 5 bolts in. intsead of 6
[2024-01-20T03:59:50] Oreo huzky: Anyone know if maker x G300 is any good ?
[2024-01-20T04:01:21] Unknown: Drill a new hole lower
[2024-01-20T04:01:42] Unknown: Or egg it out and use washer
[2024-01-20T04:02:01] Unknown: Suspension pushes at top pulls at bottom
[2024-01-20T04:03:50] haku: you are right but will be 14mm lower
[2024-01-20T04:04:59] haku: front will only have 5 screws. i will still get it bolted and welded
[2024-01-20T04:05:26] haku: its too sketch just to be bolted on.
[2024-01-20T04:06:53] haku: need to find a chinesium welder guy
[2024-01-20T04:06:54] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 84248 has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-20T09:47:44] Paolo ⁭: Chinese rion copy

[2024-01-20T10:06:51] haku: i gave up on hating on china copying everything. at this point i expect them to make a 1:1 clones.
[2024-01-20T10:08:43] Unknown: 😭
[2024-01-20T10:08:52] haku: this killed the handcrafted vape mod industry too. 😭 china copied the best ones and sold it at half the price
[2024-01-20T10:13:58] haku: even china rolex counterfeits are getting so good its hard to tell the difference. so sad
[2024-01-20T11:27:03] Mirono escooters: Good but cooling eh But very small
[2024-01-20T12:07:56] puneDir: <photos/photo_12326@20-01-2024_12-07-56.jpg>

[2024-01-20T12:08:17] puneDir: I couldnt managed the ppf film thingy lol Also size was bit off
[2024-01-20T12:08:38] puneDir: Now im printing one in exact same size and this time some professionel will stick it
[2024-01-20T12:10:22] puneDir: <photos/photo_12328@20-01-2024_12-10-22.jpg>

[2024-01-20T12:15:51] Yamal: Nice
[2024-01-20T12:39:52] Gabe Enzo: Both made in the same sweatshops.
[2024-01-20T12:41:11] Oreo huzky: If I mount backside to frame will be cooling better?
[2024-01-20T12:53:13] Mirono escooters: Should be fine
[2024-01-20T13:06:56] Happy Giraffe: People rub their cars 10min out of snow, I take my bike out and press throttle😂 Its ridable in deepish snow so never had a day I couldnt go from point A to B
[2024-01-20T14:03:27] sombre_enfant: Trippin, its swiss made
[2024-01-20T14:42:57] haku: yes. rolex is swiss. china almost close to counterfeitinng it. the difference is when you open it. some markings are different. also different materials you can see it in the ss steel they use.
[2024-01-20T14:43:59] haku: my nephew is a rolex connoisseur and collector. told me about this
[2024-01-20T14:44:38] Jan: There is this one issue where prices are so way beyond reason that it feels not justified to buy the original product. The rolex design is 70years old and the technology to create these is piss easy. A perfect rolex replica can be made for 500-800$ of a watch that costs 30'000-50'000$
[2024-01-20T14:47:39] haku: agreed. thats why i like the older rolex models like the explorer 2 that has patina in the dials. the new ones with bigger bezels are easily counterfeited
[2024-01-20T14:49:10] Jan: Im not judging anyone copying a product that is beyond any reasonable price for what it is that was designed more than half a century ago
[2024-01-20T14:57:00] haku: ive been wondering about this too. i think its a good product. you should try it. not alot of g300 users so not alot if data
[2024-01-20T14:59:07] Paolo ⁭: Is everything about the hype that the brand creates, nobody is really interested at the clock mechanism
[2024-01-20T14:59:57] haku: exept these watch collector folks
[2024-01-20T15:00:14] Paolo ⁭: Like sneakers too, a 99,9% same one china can make at maybe 40$, US market pay 10k or even 100k for sneakers , and they kill people for them😢
[2024-01-20T15:02:19] haku: that sneaker thing i can never understand😂
[2024-01-20T15:02:33] Happy Giraffe: That's the only reason I use 60€ Xiaomi watch instead of Rolex Daytona
[2024-01-20T15:03:32] haku: how about use your phone to check time guy
[2024-01-20T15:04:23] Happy Giraffe: Is someone interested to try custom brake rotors in high speed scooter?🤔
[2024-01-20T15:06:49] Happy Giraffe: I will try some 203mm 2.3-2.5mm whatever magura can take if teacher still has the cn program and model for a disc ready😁 Material would be acid proof steel. One grade higher from stainless
[2024-01-20T15:06:56] Jan: Its more convenient to have something on the wrist
[2024-01-20T15:15:00] Happy Giraffe: I talk with the guys on monday
[2024-01-20T15:43:08] puneDir: <photos/photo_12329@20-01-2024_15-43-08.jpg>
[2024-01-20T15:43:34] puneDir: Just to make 25 to 35-40 i opened up whole scoot removed esc did some soldering Just for the amps
[2024-01-20T15:43:47] puneDir: I love vesc so much Soon its gonna have vesc thanks to god
[2024-01-20T15:45:27] Happy Giraffe: @AJAJ1992 how thick discs can magura take? 2.3mm?
[2024-01-20T15:57:50] Jan: 2.1
[2024-01-20T16:07:00] Albert Rembisz: How can I enable real-time data reading in VESC app to map throttle?
[2024-01-20T16:12:59] Jan: No i would not
[2024-01-20T16:13:44] Jan: You have certain tolerances on the assembly, a disc can easily move 0.05-0.1mm in a revolution
[2024-01-20T16:15:48] Happy Giraffe: Measure?😂
[2024-01-20T16:15:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-01-20T16:16:33] Mirono escooters: On pc? At the right side "Rt data"
[2024-01-20T16:16:34] Happy Giraffe: On phone app here:
[2024-01-20T16:17:03] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_12330@20-01-2024_16-17-03.jpg>
[2024-01-20T16:17:13] Happy Giraffe: For real get a caliper😂
[2024-01-20T16:18:25] Happy Giraffe: Ive seen everything from halogens to wrapping and making knots for phase cables
[2024-01-20T16:18:49] Happy Giraffe: That might be good to go with then. Fits new pads without a ton of rub
[2024-01-20T16:36:42] puneDir: <photos/photo_12331@20-01-2024_16-36-42.jpg>
[2024-01-20T16:50:47] Mirono escooters: Ok that's cool
[2024-01-20T22:39:15] haku: looks like i will have to put this bigger box
[2024-01-20T22:40:04] haku: can fit 2x 85/200 and a big battery if i want
[2024-01-20T22:41:23] Mirono escooters: Lol, wich box is that?
[2024-01-20T22:46:44] haku: my laotie project will be delayed due to some unfortunate circumstances. my apologies to the french. i will not be able to compete and take first place this season. carry on with the race without me gentlemen
[2024-01-20T23:47:36] Albert Rembisz: Yes I know, but I can't find this on mobile app
[2024-01-20T23:50:13] Albert Rembisz: I know where is mapping, but I have to turn on RT data to see throttle and brake voltage to calibrate like in PC app and I don't know how to do it. Can you record phone screed to show how to map it?
[2024-01-20T23:50:55] Mirono escooters: Just link phone to PC, ezpz
[2024-01-20T23:53:12] Happy Giraffe: You literally just press adc mapping and then it begins😅
[2024-01-20T23:53:53] Happy Giraffe: This applies to standard adc based throttles
[2024-01-21T00:25:32] haku: today we drowning our sorrows with some squats.
[2024-01-21T00:29:12] Happy Giraffe: Was also squatting today, practicing form first with less weight tho...
[2024-01-21T00:29:52] haku: im going till i fail. i need to release this anger inside me 😭
[2024-01-21T00:30:13] Happy Giraffe: Anger from spotwelder?😂
[2024-01-21T00:30:28] Happy Giraffe: Bro wait till you get married and you next Ronnie Coleman then
[2024-01-21T00:30:43] haku: bro i just got recently divorced
[2024-01-21T00:30:56] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2024-01-21T00:30:56] Gabe Enzo: You good
[2024-01-21T00:31:18] Happy Giraffe: So you will be Ronnie soon?🤔😂
[2024-01-21T00:31:34] haku: with the right dose maybe haha
[2024-01-21T07:40:29] haku: @Happy_Giraffe i got this cheap tap and die set. for an m6 tap i need a 6mm drill bit?
[2024-01-21T07:40:41] haku: <photos/photo_12333@21-01-2024_07-40-41.jpg>
[2024-01-21T07:57:29] haku: i also have this drill auto tap. but i dont trust it
[2024-01-21T10:10:09] Albert Rembisz: How can I do this?
[2024-01-21T10:17:38] Finn: For a m6 hole you need an 6mm*0,8=4,8mm drill bit
[2024-01-21T10:21:43] Mirono escooters: With something I forgot the name off
[2024-01-21T10:22:39] Mirono escooters: When you are on same wifi network Just connect to scoot Scroll down And dont use the server thingy but the other thing And then on pc you can connect
[2024-01-21T10:22:42] Mirono escooters: TCP or something
[2024-01-21T11:05:17] Ion: "wireless bridge to computer"
[2024-01-21T11:12:56] haku: 4.8mm where do i find that? special order set?
[2024-01-21T11:13:21] haku: would 5mm be ok?
[2024-01-21T11:13:28] Finn: Sometimes it comes to the set
[2024-01-21T11:13:43] Happy Giraffe: That's perfectly fine. Most used 5,->6
[2024-01-21T11:13:44] Finn: Go for 4,5 and then just turn the drill little bit to widen the hole
[2024-01-21T11:14:44] haku: let me check my set. i have to buy it in amazon due to metric 😭
[2024-01-21T11:15:03] Happy Giraffe: Just need a hole thats straight and then to start threads straight. You need some cutting fluid/grease too

[2024-01-21T11:19:37] Gabe Enzo: what about for M4?
[2024-01-21T11:20:09] Finn: M4 4*0.8=3,2 drill bit
[2024-01-21T11:20:34] Gabe Enzo: Ah, I got that one, I'm lucky
[2024-01-21T11:20:53] Gabe Enzo: seems I didn't kill my brand-new frame after all
[2024-01-21T11:20:56] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: It's for thin metal and i think it's for impact drill
[2024-01-21T11:20:59] Finn: Haha
[2024-01-21T11:21:10] Finn: I also did M4 screws on my pro2
[2024-01-21T11:21:15] Finn: Perfect
[2024-01-21T11:21:15] haku: do you guys have a chart for these tap and die holes?
[2024-01-21T11:21:24] Finn: Chart?
[2024-01-21T11:21:27] Gabe Enzo: m3 just dies so fast.
[2024-01-21T11:21:31] Finn: Yes

[2024-01-21T11:22:15] haku: like a guide for hole sizes for metric taps
[2024-01-21T11:22:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically Non 5 size drill is 5 Mostly 4,8 ish But measure always
[2024-01-21T11:23:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Even these can do jobs but gotta know what you are doing
[2024-01-21T11:23:34] haku: ive used this before for m4 screws on chinesium. not to satisfied with the result
[2024-01-21T11:24:08] Finn: Just use normal drill bit and thread cut bit
[2024-01-21T11:24:56] Finn: <photos/photo_12335@21-01-2024_11-24-56.jpg>
[2024-01-21T11:25:07] haku: yes i like the manual tap. you can control it better
[2024-01-21T11:25:28] Finn: Also got one here from my dad. Very good
[2024-01-21T11:25:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably not made in China version
[2024-01-21T11:26:11] Finn: Nope
[2024-01-21T11:26:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say buy these bits locally, you can get the better ones
[2024-01-21T11:26:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: More sturdy for like 4* price each
[2024-01-21T11:27:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah that was mindblowing
[2024-01-21T11:29:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is up to what do you need , probably find all kind of sets ,just find the one what contains your needs
[2024-01-21T11:29:55] haku: metric bits is very rare to find in local stores.
[2024-01-21T11:30:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i can give you a link of a set of drill bits on ali what is pretty nice , bought for fun the first time than , bought another 5 sets coz damn good

[2024-01-21T11:41:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: His my childhood bro so he knows all metric and probably has ideas where to buy what you need
[2024-01-21T11:42:40] haku: metric tools can be bought online ali/amazon sometimes but very rare to find it in store
[2024-01-21T11:42:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh you dont need to be there every saturday ,but maybe he can machine you stuff for. Future products or something like that and ship it ,while once you may meet
[2024-01-21T11:43:07] haku: usually its sets that include both metric and sae
[2024-01-21T11:43:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,that can be good
[2024-01-21T11:44:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And fyi If i go down to lidl maybe and buy a set of drillbits You can find some imperial in it basically
[2024-01-21T11:44:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure of the name
[2024-01-21T11:44:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But
[2024-01-21T11:44:38] haku: its funny because mechanics need both sets for all import cars and sae for american cars 😭
[2024-01-21T11:44:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Same look as allen key just size differs
[2024-01-21T11:46:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way its a common thing with,lot tools made for specific reason in industrial life and you only have does if you use it
[2024-01-21T11:46:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also
[2024-01-21T11:46:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is pz head
[2024-01-21T11:46:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fucking common stuff made for philips head you say ,i believe

[2024-01-21T11:49:12] haku: yes we have torx head. like what mercedes use 😭
[2024-01-21T11:49:42] haku: very dumb choice for them to use that.
[2024-01-21T11:50:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Torx is one of the best heads you can have coz it rarely fails compared to any other heads
[2024-01-21T11:52:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I enjoy usage of the square head also for some stuff more like for outside, tells ppl nah you wont open this coz bit and screws even more rare like that here
[2024-01-21T11:52:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: New cars are. Mixture of companies
[2024-01-21T11:53:01] haku: i see. makes sense why they use it. i thought they just wanted to be special 😂
[2024-01-21T11:53:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: New benz and bmw contains too much plastic
[2024-01-21T11:53:37] haku: very squeeky plastics too
[2024-01-21T11:54:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Things not made to last nowdays
[2024-01-21T11:54:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I can tell you few shit near cars
[2024-01-21T11:55:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like components what comes joined like when they modify your car or it basically has a trailer hook
[2024-01-21T11:55:39] haku: i like vintage hondas and classic american muscle cars. those days were wild days
[2024-01-21T11:55:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Main part of hook is two sides
[2024-01-21T11:56:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you think in the middle there is any kind of paint or galvan or anything what keeps not rusting
[2024-01-21T11:56:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅 no there is nothing
[2024-01-21T11:57:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also cars like kia ,they give you a 8-10 years warranty Basically car falls to parts afterwards
[2024-01-21T11:58:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some of Ceed's doenst have Paint inside
[2024-01-21T11:59:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also computers They have a set to for x thousand km's to not show up minor desinged errors
[2024-01-21T11:59:45] haku: korean cars are pretty okay nowadays. very comparable to jap cars
[2024-01-21T12:00:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than suddenly you have plenty much problems and have to change half engine 😅
[2024-01-21T12:00:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like engine started to eat the oil and so own
[2024-01-21T12:01:07] haku: my sisters v8 truck has undergone 2 motor swaps since 2009 😂
[2024-01-21T12:01:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Jap cars nice Sad the reall quality what they let on there own Street differs what they sell abroad
[2024-01-21T12:01:48] Happy Giraffe: Tapping threads manually is fun, even more fun when doing it manually with a lathe while not spinning motor😅
[2024-01-21T12:02:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also we dont like cars from that area any part is for $$$$$
[2024-01-21T12:02:30] haku: someday i want a lathe and a drill press
[2024-01-21T12:03:01] haku: or a drill press that turns into a lathe
[2024-01-21T12:03:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Doing with lathe is another lvl tbh
[2024-01-21T12:04:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way i agree. ,but when you make 50 m3 holes what has a solid end and you should do by hand......🤔 Next time call you over to have fun 😁
[2024-01-21T12:05:47] Happy Giraffe: Manually, turning the chuck by hand and supporting the tap holder by the lathe tool holder😂
[2024-01-21T12:06:06] Happy Giraffe: Looks stupid but makes dead straight threads
[2024-01-21T12:06:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also one of crazy thread vids https://youtube.com/shorts/T5MjO6wEEmg?si=VYVlyl0RPGzmh0Mc
[2024-01-21T12:06:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know
[2024-01-21T12:06:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You didn't say any bad
[2024-01-21T12:07:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's total contoll under 1000 of milimeter
[2024-01-21T12:08:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you have super fancy newest 5 d cnc shit you do this by program
[2024-01-21T12:08:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On older this is skill
[2024-01-21T12:08:41] Happy Giraffe: Best diameters accuracy Ive hit on a axle was 0.01mm but thats also accuracy of micrometer so can be dead on or maybe .02mm off
[2024-01-21T12:08:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @Bradhaku my mate in Sf works like that
[2024-01-21T12:09:00] haku: thats some next level crafing skills
[2024-01-21T12:09:08] Happy Giraffe: Yeah cant wait to try own brake discs on those...
[2024-01-21T12:09:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably better than any you rolled on these years we know eachother
[2024-01-21T12:09:50] Happy Giraffe: Shimano 203mm disc already got a glass surface somehow...🙈 Was with resin pads
[2024-01-21T12:10:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say grow size bro
[2024-01-21T12:10:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 203 not big for a bike
[2024-01-21T12:10:41] Happy Giraffe: Yeah its a step up from using drill chuck as lathe and a file to make things fit😂😂😂😂
[2024-01-21T12:11:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I need to buy two new chucks 😢😢
[2024-01-21T12:11:24] Happy Giraffe: Yeah for the old bike 203 plenty. New DH bike I try 223 bit later
[2024-01-21T12:11:31] Happy Giraffe: Röhm👍
[2024-01-21T12:11:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean 3 jaw doesnt have all parts to be used reversed So buys new but only 100 size
[2024-01-21T12:12:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also would be so cool to have a 4 jaw Chuck to be able to hold square parts
[2024-01-21T12:12:48] Happy Giraffe: Aah you talking about lathe and not drill😂
[2024-01-21T12:13:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sure lathe Chucks
[2024-01-21T12:13:17] Happy Giraffe: 4 jaw would be bitch to get even?
[2024-01-21T12:14:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You cant really hold shapes like square or rectangle with 3 jaw chuck on lathe
[2024-01-21T12:15:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 4 jaw type made for that
[2024-01-21T12:18:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: in the press drill i have a chuck what is bigger than my fist ,love that machine It's an old industrial one , 400 V or 230v, works flawless Have to check when it was made
[2024-01-21T12:19:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i am unsure that your and my age together reach its made year 😂
[2024-01-21T12:21:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But this is why it still works probably coz it's made in the old days , Just main body without the stand more like 50 kg 😁
[2024-01-21T12:34:33] Happy Giraffe: Those are the best ones
[2024-01-21T12:37:03] haku: this isnan example of how tools measured here. seriously idk why we havent switched to metric yet. only tool manufacturers benefit from this
[2024-01-21T12:37:03] haku: <photos/photo_12337@21-01-2024_12-37-03.jpg>
[2024-01-21T12:38:26] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: wtf is that 😭
[2024-01-21T12:38:46] haku: stupidity 😂
[2024-01-21T12:43:56] haku: and this bit set is just ali express rebranded tools.
[2024-01-21T12:44:21] Happy Giraffe: Tutustu tähän: Camcut https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.camcut.app
[2024-01-21T12:44:45] Happy Giraffe: Download this, will have all info on drill sizes etc etc
[2024-01-21T12:45:09] Happy Giraffe: I check if language possible to set to english
[2024-01-21T12:45:51] Happy Giraffe: There's plenty👍
[2024-01-21T12:46:18] haku: thanks bud. i just dl it.
[2024-01-21T12:47:32] Happy Giraffe: Also good for machining
[2024-01-21T12:48:07] haku: someday illhave machining toys 😂
[2024-01-21T12:49:41] haku: very useful
[2024-01-21T12:57:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I always like to read this with p Than dont understand for sec the F you talking about, than realises😁
[2024-01-21T13:00:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh no, so sad 😭
[2024-01-21T13:10:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i am unsure if it app helps with does inch numbers,coz you cant give usually 7/64 in a counting app you need the decimal inch number 🤔 😅😅🙈 I getting a headache from these imperial numbers 🤣
[2024-01-21T13:11:38] Happy Giraffe: Metric masterrace👍
[2024-01-21T13:11:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Only imperial stuff i like is stormtroopers🤣
[2024-01-21T13:12:05] Happy Giraffe: Need to put all inch equations into mm and find the closest one hahhaa
[2024-01-21T13:12:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah
[2024-01-21T13:12:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But lot strange size they have like 3.1 mm
[2024-01-21T13:13:11] Happy Giraffe: Luckily threads allow bit deviation in drill bit size but I rather use 5mm hole so chances to snap the tap is lower as it only cuts the thread and doesnt have to fight its way in
[2024-01-21T13:13:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Funny biggest is 12,8 on pics what is damn close to our 13
[2024-01-21T13:13:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah
[2024-01-21T13:13:51] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I wouldnt use 3.1mm to 4mm thread. 3.3 much better and doesnt snap as easily😅
[2024-01-21T13:14:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically i would say hard topic coz real thread cutter is going in 3 steps
[2024-01-21T13:15:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But I didn't saw such just in car blocks back in the day
[2024-01-21T13:15:51] Happy Giraffe: Yeah those I have at home. Last being bottoming out tap. But "Flute" tap is bit nicer to use as it doesnt push the dust in. Rather pulling nice clean cut material out of thread so very nice for not through hole use😁
[2024-01-21T13:16:41] Happy Giraffe: Bought 10€ micrometer from aliexpress. Will test it against 200€ Mitutoyo at school😂
[2024-01-21T13:17:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah to other side of the story
[2024-01-21T13:18:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Every caliper makes a difference 🤣 Kinda same feeling like a multimeter till you dont have a fucking expensive one
[2024-01-21T13:27:33] Happy Giraffe: Found out even when I was using caliper a lot before school. Testing against micrometer showed that my measuring technique was off by 0.1mm😅 after that its been nice using just the caliper until the last runs
[2024-01-21T13:58:48] Gabe Enzo: Americans are a laughing stock.
[2024-01-21T14:14:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He can get stuff what he needs ,just needs right guy to guide where to search
[2024-01-21T14:15:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Already asked my mate to land us some info ,but he will call me ,too lazy to wright this much😅😅
[2024-01-21T15:07:29] haku: freedom baby!
[2024-01-21T16:49:21] Happy Giraffe: @Mirono_escooters Time to try solidworks...
[2024-01-21T16:49:56] Happy Giraffe: With student discount its only 50€/year and maybe I try to get those codes...
[2024-01-21T16:52:52] Mirono escooters: Finally
[2024-01-21T16:52:55] Mirono escooters: You'll enjoy it
[2024-01-21T16:53:05] Mirono escooters: We get almost all educational software for free through education
[2024-01-21T16:53:21] Mirono escooters: I can probably lent you one I think
[2024-01-21T16:54:03] Mirono escooters: A merikan admitting metric is better End of world is near ;)
[2024-01-21T16:58:35] sombre_enfant: https://youtu.be/QCjFEyLPZ9U?si=9-tGiNS4JnjKpqeR
[2024-01-21T17:03:56] Happy Giraffe: Fusion is way too unlogical sometimes like just wanting to bend a part of sketch 20° downwards from a side impossible🙈 And the lag is hell sometimes
[2024-01-21T17:18:30] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-01-21T17:18:33] Mirono escooters: SolidWorks king
[2024-01-21T17:36:46] Jan: Solidworks is one of the best Standard tools if you dont need professional surface design. If you dont want to afford this, try Onshape, its a specced down Solidworks that i made nearly all my CAD stuff you see. The best is still CATIA though its one of the hardest to learn properly
[2024-01-21T17:37:01] puneDir: <photos/photo_12340@21-01-2024_17-37-01.jpg>
[2024-01-21T17:37:43] puneDir: Didnt tried dot3 but shimano red shit didnt worked
[2024-01-21T17:37:44] sombre_enfant: Dot ??? Bro its mineral oil
[2024-01-21T17:37:56] puneDir: But diesel baby oil fixed my brakes xd
[2024-01-21T17:38:02] puneDir: Yeah ik i didnt used dot
[2024-01-21T17:38:19] puneDir: Baby oil is also mineral and it works lol :D
[2024-01-21T17:38:50] puneDir: Best decision of my life
[2024-01-21T17:38:53] sombre_enfant: Its only for trial bike, now u will loose pressure over heat
[2024-01-21T17:39:01] puneDir: 1.5 euro
[2024-01-21T17:39:18] puneDir: Hmm but it should work for some time right
[2024-01-21T17:39:36] sombre_enfant: Lhm+ is 7€ a litre and its for cars so its the best...
[2024-01-21T17:40:01] puneDir: Yes Cengiz said I visited total energies station today but all they had was dot3...
[2024-01-21T17:40:25] puneDir: The guy on the station said it will work but cengiz said never even think about it
[2024-01-21T17:41:09] Happy Giraffe: Thanks for the suggestion. Yeah I would benefit most from software with lots of tutorials and possibly an iPad version aswell as I like to draw a lot when travelling👍
[2024-01-21T17:42:47] Happy Giraffe: Onshape seems to have public storage😅
[2024-01-21T17:46:01] Mirono escooters: SolidWorks, standard? What?
[2024-01-21T17:47:04] Mirono escooters: Has if not the best, great physics simulations for any engineering fork, costs hundreds and thousands of dollars for the top tier stuff, and widely accepted files and features :P
[2024-01-21T17:47:42] Mirono escooters: Even got cnc cam integrated
[2024-01-21T17:47:56] Happy Giraffe: I just wanna draw a fkin rectangle at an angle. Ofc doable in Fusion but Im thinking of moving away from it
[2024-01-21T17:48:54] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-01-21T17:50:57] sombre_enfant: Use the vid its best way to get it
[2024-01-21T17:57:54] Happy Giraffe: Im considering all options. Funnily enough Shapr3D iPad app has been better for simple drawings and no lag at all
[2024-01-21T17:58:39] Happy Giraffe: Will see, I try the free version of SW to see if I like it or not
[2024-01-21T18:07:20] Jan: Its terrible in surface design
[2024-01-21T18:07:43] Jan: So as long as you are not designing aero stuff its fine
[2024-01-21T18:08:00] Mirono escooters: Out of my work, so I trust you
[2024-01-21T18:08:43] Jan: Solidworks probably the best package else
[2024-01-21T18:08:54] Jan: I mean catia and solidworks is the same company in the end
[2024-01-21T18:09:09] puneDir: I didnt
[2024-01-21T18:09:25] puneDir: 2.0 tdi baby oil 😏
[2024-01-21T18:16:56] Happy Giraffe: Yeah and seems to have best tutorials
[2024-01-21T18:25:56] Mirono escooters: Hahaha, yeah
[2024-01-21T18:32:52] cihan: Does anyone have an idea about this spot welder? Besides where can I get cheap and sufficient (maybe less than 3000F) super capacitors?

[2024-01-21T19:59:57] haku: im sure that will work fine.
[2024-01-21T20:05:59] Happy Giraffe: Heard about a frame like this, not really fan of the bolts😅
[2024-01-21T20:06:24] haku: agreed. but its fully modular
[2024-01-21T20:06:46] haku: can add on to your hearts desire
[2024-01-21T20:14:31] haku: very proffessional company with gmail address. im sure it will be fine 😁
[2024-01-21T20:15:48] Happy Giraffe: Might be great depending how good they make it
[2024-01-21T20:31:44] haku: you guys talking about cad earlier. what do you guys think of tinkercad?
[2024-01-21T20:43:42] Gabe Enzo: Used it in Masters engineering, back before I dropped down to bachelor's.
[2024-01-21T20:43:47] Gabe Enzo: Kek
[2024-01-21T20:44:13] Gabe Enzo: hated it
[2024-01-21T20:44:32] haku: i too am an engineer. what cad program is best?
[2024-01-21T20:44:53] haku: and affordable
[2024-01-21T20:44:55] Gabe Enzo: Wouldn't know, im in electrical now. We don't use any sort of CAD LOL
[2024-01-21T20:45:01] Gabe Enzo: we use uhhh
[2024-01-21T20:46:05] Gabe Enzo: Dialux. that's it
[2024-01-21T20:46:22] haku: ill check it out.
[2024-01-21T20:46:37] Gabe Enzo: Nono it's only for light systems
[2024-01-21T20:46:43] haku: i might try fusion with my .edu email
[2024-01-21T20:46:44] Gabe Enzo: I was just rambling
[2024-01-21T20:46:49] Gabe Enzo: good idea
[2024-01-21T20:52:15] haku: dam i ordered this a few hours ago on a sunday. it came fast. they prolly miss me because i order stuff from ali now
[2024-01-21T20:53:07] haku: fancy brand baby
[2024-01-21T20:53:41] haku: <photos/photo_12344@21-01-2024_20-53-41.jpg>
[2024-01-21T20:54:24] Happy Giraffe: It's ok to have a set like this but the most usual sizes I would take dewalt extreme 2 drillbits for 4-6mm. Those will be a lifesaver when these become dull😅
[2024-01-21T20:55:19] haku: i will not be drilling much. just for my bigger battery box. but its useful to have both metric and sae
[2024-01-21T20:56:11] haku: is this the bit your talking about
[2024-01-21T21:00:02] Happy Giraffe: No, the left ones are for wood and right ones for concrete
[2024-01-21T21:00:32] haku: the gold ones are for metal yea
[2024-01-21T21:00:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have a mate who draws on ipad Want me to ask him what he uses and such?
[2024-01-21T21:00:54] Happy Giraffe: Dewalt Extreme 2 possibly sold in amazon, a cobalt drill bit made to drill even stainless steels
[2024-01-21T21:01:12] Happy Giraffe: Shapr3D he uses I think
[2024-01-21T21:02:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Solid can do a lot for you than
[2024-01-21T21:02:12] Happy Giraffe: Im a slave of Fusion for now, will have to change but the GUI of others looks like a mom that you wouldn't wanna fuck even when drunk
[2024-01-21T21:04:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Try solid also
[2024-01-21T21:06:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hss🙈
[2024-01-21T21:06:48] Happy Giraffe: Remember to use cutting fluid/grease. Otherwise drillbit will overheat and lose its edge
[2024-01-21T21:07:22] Happy Giraffe: When tapping threads can never have too much sauce
[2024-01-21T21:07:59] haku: dumb question. can i use motor oil?
[2024-01-21T21:08:29] haku: im on a budget 😭
[2024-01-21T21:09:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically yes ,but sprays you can get are better
[2024-01-21T21:10:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also go slow and press it down Max speed just burns bit
[2024-01-21T21:10:22] haku: i will make pilot holes
[2024-01-21T21:10:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But this is up to drill type
[2024-01-21T21:12:18] Happy Giraffe: Cutting fluid cheap stuff
[2024-01-21T21:13:19] haku: thanks for the advice gents.
[2024-01-21T21:13:25] Happy Giraffe: maybe 2 cents per hole xd
[2024-01-21T21:17:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hss basically for Steel and some softer metals Hss e for inox Wooden drills mainly have sharp middle and two cutting edges what highly sticks out There is only one similar for metal but less pointy and its for industrial spot weld drilling Wall or concrete drills have an insert in them and makes the job Soft walls like bricks only needs spining mode, concrete needs hammering same time And this world there is another type called SDS head what is for dedicated drill type for bigger hits ,drill bit moves 3-6 cm depends on drill
[2024-01-21T21:18:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also there is fancy toppings like titanium what you hss has but cobalt even better cobalt type what's not just a layer is 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
[2024-01-21T21:19:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes and maked drill bit life much longer
[2024-01-21T21:19:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also they can be sharpened dont throw them away
[2024-01-21T21:20:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But that's another longer topic
[2024-01-21T21:20:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Finaly one more😁
[2024-01-21T21:20:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Anything what you would like to paint later
[2024-01-21T21:21:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont use oils or drill fluid
[2024-01-21T21:21:37] haku: is it hard to clean the oils off?
[2024-01-21T21:21:54] sombre_enfant: Acetone
[2024-01-21T21:21:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz all of them eats it self in , so cant really remove Than paintjob will be less long life
[2024-01-21T21:22:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or you go with all needed layers
[2024-01-21T21:22:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wash
[2024-01-21T21:22:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Primer paint
[2024-01-21T21:22:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's 2 component from mipa
[2024-01-21T21:23:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It eats it self in ,so not really a layer
[2024-01-21T21:23:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than epoxy 2 component paint
[2024-01-21T21:23:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than color
[2024-01-21T21:23:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than varnish
[2024-01-21T21:24:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And you spent a fucking lot while paint layer thickness grows a lot
[2024-01-21T21:24:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Better not mess with fluids if you want to paint ,use water
[2024-01-21T21:25:14] haku: nah i dont really care for paint. it will be welded after bolting anyway
[2024-01-21T21:25:48] haku: i hope chinesium is okay to weld with
[2024-01-21T21:26:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Show welding in the box inner corner
[2024-01-21T21:27:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also how thick it is?
[2024-01-21T21:27:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some welder will weld it?
[2024-01-21T21:28:56] haku: box will look like this. yes ill have a pro weld it
[2024-01-21T21:28:56] haku: <photos/photo_12347@21-01-2024_21-28-56.jpg>
[2024-01-21T21:29:13] haku: ill measure the thickness later
[2024-01-21T21:29:41] haku: i hope weld can penetrate
[2024-01-21T21:29:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: With i mean... If corner welds are shit whole fronto or rear part rips off
[2024-01-21T21:30:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Closer pics?
[2024-01-21T21:30:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They look shit from this distance
[2024-01-21T21:30:26] haku: yea ill show later. getting my swole on.
[2024-01-21T21:30:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12348@21-01-2024_21-30-28.jpg>
[2024-01-21T21:30:40] haku: thats beautiful actually
[2024-01-21T21:30:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ninebot g30 neck weld
[2024-01-21T21:30:53] haku: you did that?
[2024-01-21T21:31:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is something what you would like to see
[2024-01-21T21:31:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ninebot did
[2024-01-21T21:31:27] haku: yes. i want a pretty bead
[2024-01-21T21:31:32] haku: clean welds
[2024-01-21T21:31:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i could show you 2016 xiaomi welds and you would cry
[2024-01-21T21:32:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Same company made it
[2024-01-21T21:33:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: More like messing the corners and stuff looks like they didn't really contoll the melted metal, unsure how to explain better
[2024-01-21T21:33:22] haku: for now i will bolt it on just to get ot finished
[2024-01-21T21:33:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On kugoo we repaired similar but that case was different
[2024-01-21T21:34:04] haku: is chinesium pretty hard to weld?
[2024-01-21T21:34:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They didn't clean surface and machine what they tried to use was a toy compared to metal thickness
[2024-01-21T21:34:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's an imaginary name for unsure metals
[2024-01-21T21:34:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So same exists in steel also
[2024-01-21T21:35:23] haku: the welds on my battery box look pretty shitty. not the best looking welds
[2024-01-21T21:35:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like replacement xiaomi 1s Essential or pro2 fender protection is from that
[2024-01-21T21:35:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Magnet holds it ,but nothing welds it
[2024-01-21T21:36:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than show that to welding person to repair
[2024-01-21T21:36:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Shit part is have to clean all paint 🙈🙈🙈
[2024-01-21T21:37:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And in an inner corner weld that means sand blasting or co blasting
[2024-01-21T21:37:17] haku: i got this battery box from ali pretty affordable compared to what murikan welders will charge me to build me one
[2024-01-21T21:37:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But maybe he can do it from outside
[2024-01-21T21:37:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He will know , since he is there
[2024-01-21T21:38:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True Always
[2024-01-21T21:38:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would never go to metal company for such ,but i have lot shit and work with metal , anything bigger i ask my friend
[2024-01-21T21:39:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They make bridge parts and huge oil tanks
[2024-01-21T21:39:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So i just ask for a favor since his some boss there 🤣
[2024-01-21T21:40:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And there is different lvl tools and huge tools
[2024-01-21T21:40:29] Happy Giraffe: Old DH bike TIG welds😁
[2024-01-21T21:40:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: New cnc stuff ,up to huge lathe what could hold truck rim size stuff
[2024-01-21T21:40:36] haku: ofcourse. pro level contractors
[2024-01-21T21:41:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They are nice Always
[2024-01-21T21:41:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Quality was a thing back than
[2024-01-21T21:41:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Now means almost nothing
[2024-01-21T21:41:31] Happy Giraffe: The guy who did these deserves a blowjob from Stormy Daniels when he retires
[2024-01-21T21:41:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁😁
[2024-01-21T21:41:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably did already
[2024-01-21T21:42:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Retire
[2024-01-21T21:42:19] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, 2006 bike😅
[2024-01-21T21:43:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also welding bike frames in bulk is different,all is done inna cage so welds dont pull frame to any direction
[2024-01-21T21:43:57] Paolo ⁭: Where you see adc 15?
[2024-01-21T21:44:12] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, imagine welding frame thats pressed into a metal mold
[2024-01-21T21:44:40] Happy Giraffe: or done bolt sides simultaniously
[2024-01-21T21:47:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also just wacthed a pretty shitty video in this topic, In the disctrict next to me old lathe fella stopped working in the business he was almost 80 yo but have to care about his wife, Shit is I know only a hands not full ppl who can operate a manual lathe and knows all the tricks and you can go in and fella does you stuff with zero laptops and cad programs , when you just need a size Correction Manual machines win ,done in minutes with a nice price without programing price😒
[2024-01-21T21:48:07] Gabe Enzo: what are the risks of spot welding with no spacers, for a small amount of cells? around 16.
[2024-01-21T21:48:18] Gabe Enzo: If I use copper and thick nickel, there should be no issue?,
[2024-01-21T21:49:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well you should glue them together with isolation layers atleast
[2024-01-21T21:49:17] Gabe Enzo: what's an isolation lauer
[2024-01-21T21:49:24] Gabe Enzo: I'm going to glue them with hot glue obv
[2024-01-21T21:50:06] Gabe Enzo: I can fit 100 p42a's if I pull this off
[2024-01-21T21:50:08] Gabe Enzo: swear to god
[2024-01-21T21:50:18] sombre_enfant: Be ready for it to break apart
[2024-01-21T21:50:33] Gabe Enzo: Some people don't use spacers at all.
[2024-01-21T21:50:41] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, manual is nice. Tomorrow I will make custom fit handlebar extensions from alu. First will make test piece that barely fits in when pressed hard. Then will make it 0.1mm larger on the real part, put extension in -20°c freezer and heat up handlebar and smack them together with hammer😂
[2024-01-21T21:51:37] Gabe Enzo: if the subpack is only 8 cells or so then the structural integrity should be higher because there is less vibration intensity.
[2024-01-21T21:51:54] sombre_enfant: It does break over time in a scooter frame, all pack i did or seen that way
[2024-01-21T21:52:19] Happy Giraffe: Especially with no space for proper padding and anti vibration😅
[2024-01-21T21:52:52] Gabe Enzo: I'll be folding copper inside the 3L to fit 72 cells then
[2024-01-21T21:53:15] Gabe Enzo: Should just Barely fit with spacers, excited when I get the cells so I can find out.
[2024-01-21T21:53:38] Gabe Enzo: Worst case scenario I drop a P to 20s7p
[2024-01-21T21:53:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12350@21-01-2024_21-53-58.jpg>
[2024-01-21T21:54:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably talks about that
[2024-01-21T21:54:20] sombre_enfant: Do 20s4p properly and thats it
[2024-01-21T21:54:30] Gabe Enzo: Lol no I'm doubling that bro
[2024-01-21T21:54:35] Gabe Enzo: You'll see
[2024-01-21T21:54:55] Gabe Enzo: Not enough watts either way lmfao
[2024-01-21T21:55:40] Gabe Enzo: Making world's fastest pro 2 period
[2024-01-21T21:56:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never saw any fall apart what i know it was, but i am not building batts
[2024-01-21T21:56:15] Paolo ⁭: For some use u want
[2024-01-21T21:56:38] Gabe Enzo: I'll have full suspension so bonus points as well.
[2024-01-21T21:56:49] Gabe Enzo: We'll see what happens.
[2024-01-21T21:58:16] sombre_enfant: The glue need to be real hot
[2024-01-21T21:58:41] Gabe Enzo: Of course! it changes properties when superheated.
[2024-01-21T21:59:55] Konstantin: Y, I'm in few ESC use it for brake, if adc2 fail
[2024-01-21T22:01:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or try electronic silicone potting glue there is soft and hard, take a look in archive
[2024-01-21T22:01:34] sombre_enfant: Use epoxy
[2024-01-21T22:01:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ask Miro how Strong is that ,but probably does the job
[2024-01-21T22:02:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Epoxy rigid and that brake's Silicone stay flexible
[2024-01-21T22:02:41] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters
[2024-01-21T22:02:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Huge factory ebike trike and shit like that are potted
[2024-01-21T22:14:28] Gabe Enzo: What do you mean by insulate series properly? that seems like something normal to do anyways.
[2024-01-21T22:14:41] Gabe Enzo: Unless I'm mistaken, but I don't understand. and don't insulator rings come with cells anyways?
[2024-01-21T22:35:19] haku: what do you guys think of forstner bits? to use it to grind rails
[2024-01-21T22:36:49] Happy Giraffe: pls no, you could use a tiny belt sander for those if they arent thick. Or angle grinder :)
[2024-01-21T22:37:04] haku: ive been grinding my g30 rails and its labor intensive
[2024-01-21T22:37:48] haku: i experimented with drill bits, angle grinder and this circle bit
[2024-01-21T22:37:50] Happy Giraffe: its alu so I wonder if a chisel would do it lmao
[2024-01-21T22:38:10] haku: <photos/photo_12352@21-01-2024_22-38-10.jpg>
[2024-01-21T22:38:11] haku: <photos/photo_12353@21-01-2024_22-38-11.jpg>
[2024-01-21T22:38:39] Happy Giraffe: when grinding alu you must use some sort of alcohol on the disc so alu doesnt stick to it
[2024-01-21T22:38:44] haku: i dont care how it looks i just want it flat
[2024-01-21T22:38:57] haku: gotcha
[2024-01-21T22:38:59] Happy Giraffe: this not the type of disc you want to use tho
[2024-01-21T22:39:28] haku: i borrowed my buddys angle grinder to test. i need to buy my own
[2024-01-21T22:39:44] Happy Giraffe: too agressive, maybe 80 grit sanding disc better
[2024-01-21T22:40:07] haku: sanding disk with aluminum? wouldnt that gunk up?
[2024-01-21T22:40:16] Happy Giraffe: this
[2024-01-21T22:41:07] haku: ill try to chisel it of too haha
[2024-01-21T22:42:07] haku: i want to build the worlds jankiest g30
[2024-01-21T22:42:43] haku: but unexpectingly fast
[2024-01-21T22:43:23] haku: working on 2 scooters while waiting for china
[2024-01-21T22:45:45] Happy Giraffe: If you gotta mod the rear fork to fit a larger tire I would reinforce it to not lose much structural integrity
[2024-01-21T22:47:04] haku: i might just bolt custom forks to it. i need it to ba atleast 160mm wide
[2024-01-21T22:47:40] sombre_enfant: Rosheee had a disc with grain on it
[2024-01-21T22:47:59] haku: what is that?
[2024-01-21T22:49:29] haku: ill go with wooden forks if theres no other way
[2024-01-21T22:49:38] Mirono escooters: Yeah get grinding disks
[2024-01-21T22:50:14] Mirono escooters: That's actually cool
[2024-01-21T22:56:09] haku: i can bolt these to the sides. its only $60 in ali
[2024-01-21T22:56:30] haku: still keep the original forks
[2024-01-21T22:59:11] Happy Giraffe: Damn, it needs to be much stronger at those speeds...
[2024-01-21T23:00:27] Happy Giraffe: Need maximum contact area not to be able to twist or make any clearance to start death wobble or other nasty things
[2024-01-21T23:00:44] haku: ive seen folks bolt on custom suspension with g30s. im not a fan of the look and those look like its dangerous too
[2024-01-21T23:01:40] haku: best case is if i can stretch the fork
[2024-01-21T23:06:37] Happy Giraffe: Just measure how wide you need it to be and ask someone to weld adapter pieces to it. Not sure who has similar type of alloy material ready but it would be least stupid solution😂
[2024-01-21T23:07:31] haku: my future company will be called smooth brained mechanics
[2024-01-21T23:13:40] puneDir: I want makerbase do the same
[2024-01-21T23:16:42] haku: integrity will still be there it has 3 bolting holes and maybe get it welded too.
[2024-01-21T23:16:42] haku: <photos/photo_12356@21-01-2024_23-16-42.jpg>
[2024-01-21T23:17:16] haku: you can fit a 90h with how wide this thing will be haha
[2024-01-21T23:20:12] haku: 😂😂
[2024-01-21T23:21:09] Gabe Enzo: lmfao pro 2 doesn't have that
[2024-01-21T23:21:35] haku: lucky for you bud
[2024-01-21T23:22:37] Mirono escooters: Yeh
[2024-01-21T23:24:27] haku: yo "13 90h.
[2024-01-21T23:25:42] haku: just single motor and stock drums on the front 🤣
[2024-01-21T23:26:29] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Stock front tire on g30 is pain
[2024-01-21T23:27:12] haku: just a concept bud.
[2024-01-21T23:27:17] Happy Giraffe: If you ride with that I want to be included in your life insurance testament
[2024-01-21T23:30:15] haku: need ideas bros. jank is not a concern.
[2024-01-21T23:31:20] haku: waiting on china so i can stop thinking like this
[2024-01-21T23:33:00] Mirono escooters: They'll follow
[2024-01-21T23:34:01] haku: even bolted with hardened steel m12 bolts like this still no good?
[2024-01-21T23:34:05] Happy Giraffe: Fucking telegram😂
[2024-01-21T23:34:18] haku: with steel reinforcing in the inside too
[2024-01-21T23:34:22] Happy Giraffe: Now should work🌚
[2024-01-21T23:36:09] Happy Giraffe: Problem is the tiny profile of the red fork
[2024-01-21T23:36:53] haku: this has been my laotie fork and its been great. but i do have suspnsion on it though
[2024-01-21T23:36:57] Happy Giraffe: Is it much smaller tho?
[2024-01-21T23:38:02] Happy Giraffe: Here it seems like 10mm shorter from top and bottom
[2024-01-21T23:38:35] haku: <photos/photo_12360@21-01-2024_23-38-35.jpg>
[2024-01-21T23:38:36] haku: <photos/photo_12361@21-01-2024_23-38-36.jpg>
[2024-01-21T23:38:44] haku: even with torque plates
[2024-01-21T23:39:07] Happy Giraffe: With steel plats dividing twist load to larger area I dont really know. But its quite a diy solution
[2024-01-21T23:39:43] haku: we will see hopfully i just end up widening and welding it
[2024-01-21T23:40:48] haku: im really set on a wider wheel
[2024-01-21T23:43:16] haku: i want to be the scooter equivalent of ebike guy
[2024-01-21T23:43:58] haku: mad respect to that guy. but i dont like his batteries
[2024-01-21T23:46:52] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2024-01-21T23:48:14] haku: axles too small now haha
[2024-01-22T00:02:55] haku: @Happy_Giraffe even if i get cheap machined stainless steel. would it still be shady?
[2024-01-22T00:03:58] haku: stainless steel version of this but smaller width? like from jlpcb. these are serious questions bro
[2024-01-22T00:10:25] Happy Giraffe: Machining one part only would cost you maybe 3-400$
[2024-01-22T00:10:37] Happy Giraffe: Not sure if that's even enough
[2024-01-22T00:12:12] Happy Giraffe: Just use common sense to think how it will be strong enough. Already adding more stress on the original rear fork as the distance of force is like 20cm further away
[2024-01-22T00:16:13] haku: this one dude fit a 70h with a custom suspension setup. pretty similar concept
[2024-01-22T00:18:20] puneDir: Hes gonna make something Super fast
[2024-01-22T00:18:21] puneDir: Wtf
[2024-01-22T00:18:25] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, its challenging but needs to be done properly. Poor planning would be much bigger of a hazard as you don't weigh 50 kilos lol
[2024-01-22T00:19:01] puneDir: Make dual 90h
[2024-01-22T00:19:01] haku: agreed.
[2024-01-22T00:23:35] haku: im just recycling parts i dont even think battery space can power a single 90h
[2024-01-22T00:23:53] haku: or maybe😘
[2024-01-22T00:45:23] Gabe Enzo: 20s10p sure possible
[2024-01-22T00:47:43] haku: idk bro. maybe cant use it to its full potential
[2024-01-22T00:48:11] haku: im just talking out of my ass though
[2024-01-22T00:48:41] haku: @jamessoderstrom how many amps would it take to saturate 90h?
[2024-01-22T00:50:35] haku: for example high kv windings. and use the deck space for whatever batteries. lipo is all i can see that have the amps to fit
[2024-01-22T00:50:48] haku: deck space for g30
[2024-01-22T00:51:10] Gabe Enzo: What cell config tho?
[2024-01-22T00:51:15] Gabe Enzo: You thought of a bag?
[2024-01-22T00:52:12] haku: no bag. example you can fit a 20s4p molicels. thats not enough i believe
[2024-01-22T00:52:23] haku: single
[2024-01-22T00:52:45] haku: just theorizing here
[2024-01-22T00:53:09] Gabe Enzo: for the g30 you said you have you can fit 20s6p no?
[2024-01-22T00:53:11] puneDir: U can also 20s6p
[2024-01-22T00:53:31] haku: it wasnt me. someone else did.
[2024-01-22T00:53:31] Gabe Enzo: 120 cells inside 60 cells outside that's 20s9p
[2024-01-22T00:53:34] Gabe Enzo: Ah
[2024-01-22T00:54:41] Happy Giraffe: 400A phase🌚
[2024-01-22T00:54:44] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_12363@22-01-2024_00-54-44.jpg>
[2024-01-22T00:54:46] haku: need big boy esc to power that too if all internal
[2024-01-22T00:54:59] Gabe Enzo: What about the 22x3 60h? or whatever. 3kw equivalent
[2024-01-22T00:55:05] Gabe Enzo: or 65h I can't remember
[2024-01-22T00:55:11] Gabe Enzo: I don't know motor stuffs
[2024-01-22T00:56:25] haku: single high torque 90h on a g30 will win my imaginary burn out competition though
[2024-01-22T00:56:39] Gabe Enzo: 60h.
[2024-01-22T00:56:48] Gabe Enzo: think we talked about last month with Paolo
[2024-01-22T00:58:20] haku: there is hope for this madness
[2024-01-22T00:58:26] Gabe Enzo: Ah, so small numbers. Haha. Ez 8p moli.
[2024-01-22T00:59:00] Gabe Enzo: Should be fine for a 12km strip with my weight 100%%%
[2024-01-22T00:59:14] Gabe Enzo: Hahaha
[2024-01-22T01:02:52] Happy Giraffe: Hub motors heat ton at full power and low rpm😁 Almost cooked mine if it didn't have thermal sensor😅
[2024-01-22T01:12:29] haku: <photos/photo_12365@22-01-2024_01-12-29.jpg>
[2024-01-22T01:12:56] haku: this will take care of all the dropout issues. this on a g30 haha
[2024-01-22T01:13:34] haku: just dreaming of a g30 setup worthy of the vesclords
[2024-01-22T01:15:15] Happy Giraffe: Especially with bigger wheelsize more torque required to turn wheel😂 like my 29"🙈
[2024-01-22T01:15:36] Happy Giraffe: Would kick ass
[2024-01-22T01:16:48] haku: i can only dream. 😂
[2024-01-22T01:22:39] Happy Giraffe: Would be fun to build steel framed rollerskates that had this motor around your foot
[2024-01-22T01:22:49] Happy Giraffe: Instant darwin award
[2024-01-22T01:36:22] haku: how about a vesc rollerblades
[2024-01-22T01:37:44] haku: need to engineering first before i attempt this stuff
[2024-01-22T01:40:48] haku: i cant find this on the website anymore. hopefully they did not discontinue it @Happy_Giraffe
[2024-01-22T01:43:42] Happy Giraffe: http://www.qs-motor.com/product/qsmotor-1000w-bldc-mid-drive-motor-assembly-conversion-kits-for-electric-scooter/
[2024-01-22T01:44:46] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-01-22T01:46:51] haku: those human face cat memes crack me up everytime
[2024-01-22T01:48:01] Happy Giraffe: QS sadly only sells the kit with a crappy esc, maybe price goes way down without it
[2024-01-22T01:55:03] haku: proably comes with sabvoton too
[2024-01-22T03:43:22] Unknown: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $230.77 | QS 1000W 72V 55KPH Mid Drive Motor Assembly Kits with 10inch Rim for Electric Scooter https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNdLgDW
[2024-01-22T03:43:35] Unknown: Google lens
[2024-01-22T03:44:16] haku: looking for the right angle grinder disk. so many options geez
[2024-01-22T03:44:17] haku: <photos/photo_12368@22-01-2024_03-44-17.jpg>
[2024-01-22T03:59:09] haku: is this the drill/ tap lube you guys are talking about?
[2024-01-22T07:08:16] Happy Giraffe: No
[2024-01-22T07:08:57] haku: dam in already bought it. what is this drill lube named exactly?
[2024-01-22T07:09:04] Happy Giraffe: It likely has has a drill or tap picture
[2024-01-22T07:10:05] haku: gotcha
[2024-01-22T07:10:23] haku: i was at home depot and thought that was it
[2024-01-22T07:10:36] Happy Giraffe: https://ambro-solusa.com/products/cutting-oil/
[2024-01-22T07:11:28] haku: ty
[2024-01-22T07:11:31] Happy Giraffe: One can of spray and one grease will do nicely
[2024-01-22T07:12:10] Happy Giraffe: Grease nicer on threads as it stays for longer and spray nice for drilling
[2024-01-22T07:12:17] haku: i dont even have a drill press. this will be used on manual tap and hand drill
[2024-01-22T07:13:27] haku: also this is the grinding disk?
[2024-01-22T07:13:46] haku: for alu
[2024-01-22T07:13:54] Tommy ª: I want 8 of them
[2024-01-22T07:13:59] Happy Giraffe: I always use them on those, you use it on the spot where drill or tap contacts metal. Usually one tiny bit of spray here and there works. You will see the spray evaporating as a guide
[2024-01-22T07:14:41] Happy Giraffe: Need to see side profile of it, but you want grinding wheel not a cutting one
[2024-01-22T07:15:05] haku: yes its grinding
[2024-01-22T07:15:54] Happy Giraffe: It's 1.6mm thick so idk
[2024-01-22T07:17:08] haku: i also comsidering this set it has so good dollar to item ratio. and its brand tools too

[2024-01-22T07:17:24] Tommy ª: Poor vesc, it wants to die
[2024-01-22T07:18:54] haku: the batteries alone and the angle grider is worth that much if buying it seperately
[2024-01-22T07:20:00] haku: it comes with a pro looking contractor bag too
[2024-01-22T07:27:22] Basti: Hi from where you buy the swingarm or custom made
[2024-01-22T07:31:15] haku: from me. are you in the US?
[2024-01-22T07:32:28] haku: just kidding bud. this is just concept development
[2024-01-22T07:34:57] Basti: No
[2024-01-22T07:36:34] haku: im still trying to figure out how to widen swingarms.
[2024-01-22T09:18:50] puneDir: Guys im going to make puneron from leftover parts
[2024-01-22T09:18:55] puneDir: And bike frame
[2024-01-22T09:19:11] puneDir: What motor i can use? I want chain
[2024-01-22T09:19:55] puneDir: (turning g30 motor to mid drive)
[2024-01-22T09:19:58] puneDir: 😏

[2024-01-22T11:41:52] Finn: Via can bus and implimentation in lisp sure
[2024-01-22T11:41:55] NetworkDir: with lisp should yes
[2024-01-22T11:42:29] puneDir: Can we connect it to motor temp sensor port?
[2024-01-22T11:42:59] NetworkDir: if humudity sensor works with resistor yes
[2024-01-22T11:50:23] Gabe Enzo: The Lidl angle grinder I had worked amazingly. It was 30€ .
[2024-01-22T13:22:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not an easy task ,but guve you an idea what can help a bit
[2024-01-22T13:23:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Use metal cutter on the angle grinder
[2024-01-22T13:23:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12376@22-01-2024_13-23-40.jpg>
[2024-01-22T13:23:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cut slices in the rail like that

[2024-01-22T13:24:18] puneDir: With vesc i should reach 75+?
[2024-01-22T13:24:20] Mirono escooters: That's stupid big escs
[2024-01-22T13:24:38] Mirono escooters: Problably not
[2024-01-22T13:24:41] puneDir: Why
[2024-01-22T13:24:43] puneDir: Fwk
[2024-01-22T13:24:47] Mirono escooters: Batt sag+ bldc more speed
[2024-01-22T13:24:54] Mirono escooters: Fuck them cells am I right
[2024-01-22T13:24:58] puneDir: BLDC MORE SPEED WHAT DA HELL

[2024-01-22T15:05:50] Unknown: Thats Cutting not grinding not meant for side loads. Not for aluminum either. Try Amazon
[2024-01-22T15:08:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not bad but could be more thick 😁
[2024-01-22T15:08:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's what i ment
[2024-01-22T15:11:42] Gabe Enzo: How do I squeeze the copper wires onto the nail
[2024-01-22T15:11:46] Gabe Enzo: Do I just do it with tape
[2024-01-22T15:12:15] Gabe Enzo: Idk how else
[2024-01-22T15:13:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont remove plastic, than hammer it in ,cut end
[2024-01-22T15:13:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tie with a wire on the plastic than tape
[2024-01-22T15:14:35] Gabe Enzo: Huh? I don't understand.. Do you mean to not remove the silicone?
[2024-01-22T15:15:04] Gabe Enzo: I gotta also print cell holders now ugh.
[2024-01-22T15:15:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes
[2024-01-22T15:16:06] Gabe Enzo: Ah, so just fuse the wires by hammering.
[2024-01-22T15:16:13] Gabe Enzo: stone age shit
[2024-01-22T15:16:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda
[2024-01-22T15:16:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you are the one who has no holder 😁
[2024-01-22T15:17:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's like "If dont have hammer use a metal tube to hammer "
[2024-01-22T15:23:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also now i did check what i did and i made a second solution
[2024-01-22T15:24:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What was like I removed silicone like 10 cm on the wire ,than put a copper tube on it ,with longer end and lets say crimped nail in it Than shrink tube all
[2024-01-22T15:25:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think it made it self less hot like that
[2024-01-22T15:26:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure made it 1,5-2 years ago It was even luck that i found it

[2024-01-22T15:53:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also motor like to desolder stuff
[2024-01-22T15:53:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Anybody knows what is the size of g30 steering Bearings?
[2024-01-22T15:54:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: bought in eu locally
[2024-01-22T16:09:25] haku: are xiaomi phones in EU better than samsung phones? we dont get xiaomi here.
[2024-01-22T16:18:30] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2024-01-22T16:18:45] Gabe Enzo: used Xiaomi phones for years
[2024-01-22T16:21:35] haku: never seen one. here theres 2 choices. apple or samsung.
[2024-01-22T16:23:25] haku: i think you can use xiaomi but have to import one.
[2024-01-22T16:29:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on what you like ,i never had a Samsung phone and will probably never have 😁 Back in past Sony was my choice now xiaomi

[2024-01-22T16:30:28] puneDir: No
[2024-01-22T16:31:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Engine and rim i know the size but not the neck, i need the size than i can buy it
[2024-01-22T16:31:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i already find an option to buy original in eu
[2024-01-22T16:32:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You like word water dont you ? Coz there was more there Than that 😁
[2024-01-22T16:32:57] puneDir: I opened it up after washing No any water
[2024-01-22T16:33:00] puneDir: Even moisture
[2024-01-22T16:33:07] puneDir: Harsh driving i guess
[2024-01-22T16:33:28] puneDir: I might accidentally pressed throttle while braking
[2024-01-22T16:33:30] puneDir: :/
[2024-01-22T16:33:31] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-22T16:34:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We are talking about check inside the contoller , that's first Than inside you may find dead mosfet or and cap
[2024-01-22T16:35:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And that's a no go? Brake should cut throttle and nothing should happen 🤔 or maybe on max
[2024-01-22T16:39:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure, i dont really like that scooter mainly coz of the body let's say , geometry is an example of the worse🙈 not a dis Just honest But i dont like lot frames like i hate dualtron "frames" also Difference is more hyped ,more expensive But i see it crap 😅
[2024-01-22T16:41:12] sombre_enfant: What are the good frame beside ninebot ?
[2024-01-22T16:52:54] puneDir: I dont have brake sensor cable connected to esc
[2024-01-22T16:53:02] puneDir: For easier wheelies
[2024-01-22T16:55:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well probably non exist ,so this is the hardest question Whole thing is in childshoes still So far the naked gt2 body meet expectations in a way but still would say i could imagine its box bigger Also suspension makes whole thing a joke , I come from bike life Used forks for dh what costs more than pro2 ,some of my mates had even more fancy what's double price, 4 arm front fork , That takes insane jumps But back to the thing All sus what now exists is small route let's say ,till they dont grow that there will be a problem Funny thing that kaboo and laotie also had idea of double fork thingy just both used crap solutions Like they need to reinvent things but they dont Smallest stuff what would work could come from pocket and pit bikes You can buy different set of arms ,holders etc Also this means scooter sizes grow Coz if you have pocket bike size suspension,fuck will use toy tires Smallest pocket bike tires are 12" Radial , you can buy easy locally And 🖕pmt You can buy kinda 4 tires from pmt price 😅 But yeah this grows all motor esc battery all need to be up to size
[2024-01-22T16:56:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But let me say Power of a suspension like that with frame what is not made for it (force directions) Could fail fast
[2024-01-22T16:57:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like a g30 frame is nice But i am pretty sure that you could rip neck top weld or the bottom weld after a few greater jumps when you over do max a bottom the sus
[2024-01-22T16:58:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Now lot is just, ringing on a spring type of sus If you push it ,it reacts but thats all ,it doesnt correct a small holes coz there is no route
[2024-01-22T17:03:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a way building a bike is better coz you can have better stuff , but i also in love with scooters,so cant say didn't experiment near this Would love to do more but require lot of money time etc and in the of the day , near this we had to admit most of the frames not able to take this load , but never had a GT frame just to play with
[2024-01-22T17:04:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Shit is i know parts for GT,like i have brake disc here on the table, but cant get the frame 😅😅 and other stuff what would be needed
[2024-01-22T17:05:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But we can do a gofoundme if you guys want 😁
[2024-01-22T17:13:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also hope this answered your question ,this is what i think slighly about this , there is lot sides of the story
[2024-01-22T17:29:01] Happy Giraffe: Having a Marzocchi fork and fox rear shock is❤️🔥 Especially after those suntour shits on cheap market bikes
[2024-01-22T18:11:29] Gabe Enzo: How many cells can snsc fit?
[2024-01-22T18:11:40] Mirono escooters: 21s6p it seems
[2024-01-22T18:12:00] Gabe Enzo: Basically no upgrade from G30
[2024-01-22T18:12:15] Gabe Enzo: other than structural integrity
[2024-01-22T18:12:22] Mirono escooters: It's a better frame
[2024-01-22T18:23:33] puneDir: snsc's are mostly fucked up
[2024-01-22T18:29:08] Mirono escooters: No
[2024-01-22T18:47:08] Jan: G2 community bigger than snsc, so for me it makes no sense commercially to develop parts for snsc
[2024-01-22T18:47:22] Jan: G2 in the future seems legit
[2024-01-22T18:48:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Soon as a good front fork will exist 😁 now it's shame of ninebot

[2024-01-23T10:23:34] Finn: Ninebot F45 like frame
[2024-01-23T10:31:23] Oreo huzky: @SibClimb this also not allowed when racing on track?
[2024-01-23T10:44:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, unallowed
[2024-01-23T10:47:50] Gabe Enzo: Why?
[2024-01-23T10:51:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Because rules
[2024-01-23T10:52:02] Face de Pin Sucé: For safety reasons
[2024-01-23T10:52:14] Mirono escooters: Shame
[2024-01-23T10:52:56] Face de Pin Sucé: And also, this is a federal championship, so we need well made scooters, not something that seems to come from a cave 😁
[2024-01-23T10:53:20] Oreo huzky: Oof then I will stay in my cave
[2024-01-23T10:53:24] Face de Pin Sucé: You won't see any motorcycles on championships with dirty added extra batteries x)
[2024-01-23T10:54:38] Face de Pin Sucé: You need to understand that, a battery in a bag like this, in the case you crash at 100+Kmh, will be flying on the track and surely catch fire
[2024-01-23T10:55:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Btw, this is also forbidden in Spain, where they don't have any federation
[2024-01-23T10:56:09] Face de Pin Sucé: People just need to understand that track competitions aren't not made for street escooters, that's it
[2024-01-23T10:59:09] Oreo huzky: Nice fireworks
[2024-01-23T10:59:50] Oreo huzky: What’s size of battery bay from this frame
[2024-01-23T11:04:21] Oreo huzky: I know that it will but it’s not easy to fit big battery in battery bay
[2024-01-23T11:09:08] Gabe Enzo: HAHAH trueeeeee
[2024-01-23T11:09:32] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't understand
[2024-01-23T11:10:14] Jan: A nami had enough space to house all the power you need, no need for bag on track
[2024-01-23T11:10:32] Gabe Enzo: He's asking for the size of the battery compartment
[2024-01-23T11:10:38] Jan: Ninebot even enough space for track 😬😬
[2024-01-23T11:11:08] Gabe Enzo: pro 2 got enough for a few laps too. Maybe with 30a charger for ez reups

[2024-01-23T11:13:03] Oreo huzky: Yes but I want to know what is The maximum it can fit just to compare it
[2024-01-23T11:13:39] Jan: I only know for GT2 and Ninebot G30
[2024-01-23T11:13:49] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't remember
[2024-01-23T11:13:52] Jan: But 11inch scooters are quite big
[2024-01-23T11:13:55] Face de Pin Sucé: You can fit easily 20S10P
[2024-01-23T11:14:12] Jan: <photos/photo_12396@23-01-2024_11-14-12.jpg>
[2024-01-23T11:14:21] Jan: 11inch vs 10inch
[2024-01-23T11:14:26] Face de Pin Sucé: We did 22S10P but I don't recommend at all, and if we had to do it again, I wouldn't do again
[2024-01-23T11:15:31] Mirono escooters: So big, lol
[2024-01-23T11:15:41] Mirono escooters: Even dis is already out of my comfort range

[2024-01-23T11:20:06] Oreo huzky: Ah okay is 20s10p with c350 inside or outside?
[2024-01-23T11:20:13] Face de Pin Sucé: Inside
[2024-01-23T11:20:34] Oreo huzky: Very nice would 22s10p fit better with c350 outside?
[2024-01-23T11:21:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe, but shape will always be weird
[2024-01-23T11:21:10] Face de Pin Sucé: For those kind of power, it is not recommended
[2024-01-23T11:21:40] Oreo huzky: Okay

[2024-01-23T12:05:52] puneDir: Why
[2024-01-23T12:05:57] puneDir: Batteries die?
[2024-01-23T12:09:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's kinda to cold to store it like that , also near moisture There is a thing outside,so called dew point formation This effect all what is not in a 4 wall building with roof Moisture gets in even bearings this was if there is no simering on it dew point formation happens everywhere in the morning ours Than imagine when there is a fog
[2024-01-23T12:13:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Never had any issues with dumb daly. Bms Also old series was pure love coz There was no overcurrent protection 😁 Also they have shit balance, coz only on end but just by the lot diss it has ,i was wondering how balanced my batt will be when we bring it down ,after 1,5 usage all was balanced kinda perfect 🤷‍♂
[2024-01-23T12:13:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Read what temps they like
[2024-01-23T12:16:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also these not really ment to Store 0/24 outside Fuel bikes ,cars etc have more surface treatment and preparation for the weather But look at a common car what is out there for lot time
[2024-01-23T12:16:51] puneDir: Hmm
[2024-01-23T12:17:00] puneDir: I need a close space
[2024-01-23T12:17:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What is the reason to make it stay outside
[2024-01-23T12:17:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: To heavy to take up in your room?
[2024-01-23T12:17:39] puneDir: Mom says theyre dirty
[2024-01-23T12:17:55] puneDir: 💀 its impossible to say her something
[2024-01-23T12:18:14] puneDir: I store my 20s8p's on outside in some cabinet but still its cold
[2024-01-23T12:18:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Still better than full outside
[2024-01-23T12:19:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How about put scooter in there and store batt in your room

[2024-01-23T12:25:39] Oreo huzky: Why
[2024-01-23T12:25:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Imagine it double wide ,sotwo tables and double long So 4* 6m*12m sheet fits the tables, While one end plasma cutter up to 1" thickness Other end flame cutter up to 15 cm thickness Laser was in next building
[2024-01-23T12:25:53] Oreo huzky: Is there a better frame?
[2024-01-23T12:26:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Is this a school visit or such?

[2024-01-23T12:40:33] Oreo huzky: Why that?
[2024-01-23T12:40:56] Mirono escooters: XD, this is like 1 of 5 cranes
[2024-01-23T12:41:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And what about it's neck
[2024-01-23T12:41:18] Mirono escooters: They had a horizontal cnc machine the size of half my house😂
[2024-01-23T12:41:19] Face de Pin Sucé: rigidity, steering stability
[2024-01-23T12:41:28] Face de Pin Sucé: it's neck ?
[2024-01-23T12:41:28] Mirono escooters: Didn't take pic :(
[2024-01-23T12:41:36] Oreo huzky: And then tug them under a blanket and read them a good night story it will balance the cells really well
[2024-01-23T12:41:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Likes to brake

[2024-01-23T12:46:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I missed the big ones going on the top of the building sliding on rails type
[2024-01-23T12:47:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is some in the back but looks small
[2024-01-23T12:48:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 50-100 t crane hook is bigger than your head
[2024-01-23T12:49:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I worked in a place where even bridge parts were made ,so everything was huge

[2024-01-23T12:51:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Inside was colder than outside coz metal sheet tons kept the temp
[2024-01-23T12:53:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Would be not too nice around 80-100🙈
[2024-01-23T12:54:41] Face de Pin Sucé: On most thunder before 2021 we use reinforced folding parts
[2024-01-23T12:54:57] Face de Pin Sucé: On newer ones, it seems to be solid if you change the clamp
[2024-01-23T13:09:25] Mirono escooters: yes, hahaha, they got heaters 24/7
[2024-01-23T13:09:27] Mirono escooters: and big ones

[2024-01-23T13:09:51] Mirono escooters: drawing, designing, assembly and final production
[2024-01-23T13:25:50] Paolo ⁭: BMS don't explode batt randomly i think hahaha
[2024-01-23T13:27:08] Paolo ⁭: 2 years ago when I doing fpv drone I charger 5s battery with 6s battery, I was sleeping and some stranger noise heard. And BOOM, but strangely no fire🙈 it exploded in my bedroom
[2024-01-23T13:33:09] haku: are laoties and china scoots allowed in the track?
[2024-01-23T13:36:24] Mirono escooters: I never let lipo charger alone
[2024-01-23T13:36:31] Mirono escooters: If the charger go brt, boom
[2024-01-23T13:43:28] Gabe Enzo: I charged a 2S LIPO with a 7.4v NiMH charger on my bed. came back to my bed on fire. Threw the cell on the floor and still have a hole in my floor.
[2024-01-23T13:43:35] Gabe Enzo: This was back when I was around 12.
[2024-01-23T13:46:03] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12400@23-01-2024_13-46-03.jpg>
[2024-01-23T13:47:10] Paolo ⁭: On bed lol
[2024-01-23T13:56:55] haku: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $10.87 7%OFF | Juupine For Bambu Lab Build Plate Pey Build Plate P1S X1C Textured Pei Sheet 257x257mm Peo Sheet For P1P Lab Bamboo Heated Bed https://a.aliexpress.com/_msRzI1e
[2024-01-23T13:57:20] haku: how does this transfer the colors to the prints?
[2024-01-23T14:03:03] Happy Giraffe: Bed perfect place to not let charger cool itself😂
[2024-01-23T14:06:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, as long as they follow the rules
[2024-01-23T14:06:42] Face de Pin Sucé: but honestly, I don't think having a laotie in competition is good idea
[2024-01-23T14:27:47] Happy Giraffe: I doubt it does, just like the textured PEI sheet might leave that pattern on bottom
[2024-01-23T14:28:33] R3VOLT: Bruh i m lost in this spaghetti
[2024-01-23T14:29:11] Happy Giraffe: Oh I see, it does it this way but only single use
[2024-01-23T14:29:22] Happy Giraffe: Like a sticker
[2024-01-23T14:29:24] sombre_enfant: Wrost ubox atm + fuse💀
[2024-01-23T14:29:33] Mirono escooters: Obviously?
[2024-01-23T14:29:58] Mirono escooters: Only a small part gets access to SNSC G2 makes way more sense commercially, less work and buyable
[2024-01-23T14:30:07] haku: oh dam. what is peo?
[2024-01-23T14:30:31] Mirono escooters: Some customer came to me, and oh boy did that monorim have sideways wobble, horrible. Horrible suspension
[2024-01-23T14:30:39] Happy Giraffe: No idea, this is funky stuff because no customer gave the real prints pictures on reviews
[2024-01-23T14:31:47] haku: ill try this one out.
[2024-01-23T14:31:57] Mirono escooters: Was there any worse place to charge then on your bed?
[2024-01-23T15:05:42] R3VOLT: How big these holes on ADC adapter gotta be like Mia Khalifa to fit these
[2024-01-23T15:07:56] R3VOLT: I got my package with the 75V 100A ( 200 ) X2 non J version , i m not installing anything as of yet for a while at least until i get bearings and other parts to start
[2024-01-23T15:12:25] R3VOLT: Ideally, i'd want 2 U7 lights and 1 horn . Is ADC adapter alright with cutting the cable end connectors from the rear light and connect moto light directly with step converter
[2024-01-23T15:13:47] R3VOLT: That yellow cable from what i understood should trigger a mode function like angel eye only if connected
[2024-01-23T15:14:30] R3VOLT: I ve ordered a pair of horns from the spintend shop too , but i did not receive the cables
[2024-01-23T15:14:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. R3VOLT has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-23T16:29:52] Gabe Enzo: No normie tightens their vehicle
[2024-01-23T16:29:57] Gabe Enzo: hahahahahaha
[2024-01-23T16:30:11] Gabe Enzo: my monorim front is great
[2024-01-23T16:30:32] Mirono escooters: No, it was tightened Just shit
[2024-01-23T16:31:37] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if side arms that have more support material for axle would help this🤔
[2024-01-23T16:31:47] Mirono escooters: No
[2024-01-23T16:32:00] Mirono escooters: Just not using shitty bearings and axles with .5mm tolerance helps
[2024-01-23T16:32:31] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_12406@23-01-2024_16-32-31.jpg>
[2024-01-23T16:33:10] Happy Giraffe: If it had 5mm of this kind of tube thingy coming out to support axle instead of just the arm thickness
[2024-01-23T16:33:24] Mirono escooters: Stupidly overengineered..
[2024-01-23T16:34:10] Mirono escooters: Any engineer knows to use bushings for that.. 😂 And properly machines axles That's really all u need
[2024-01-23T16:35:26] Happy Giraffe: Would be interesting to try stuff when I get access to CNC, tomorrow might get first tastes if we have enough time to make a test custom brake disc for me🤔
[2024-01-23T16:52:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure but i can show you in some days
[2024-01-23T17:16:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He maybe put blanket on to make more heat 😅🙈
[2024-01-23T17:17:37] Happy Giraffe: I sleep with 10kg lithium in my boxers and wear it like a belt
[2024-01-23T17:19:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats pet pei
[2024-01-23T17:20:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You are use to it ,jihad bag fella😁
[2024-01-23T17:23:11] Happy Giraffe: Thought about lathing a tri-barrel cannon for air bombs for next new year
[2024-01-23T17:23:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2024-01-23T17:25:33] Happy Giraffe: Too bad I didnt steal dynamite from army😂
[2024-01-23T17:27:37] Jan: Can make yourself, not so complicated
[2024-01-23T17:27:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also pei stuff needs the magnetic base, than you have to know what you like , From pei side should be super easy to remove peo side harder Trick if it sticks ,sheet out with the print and put into the fridge Than in few minutes should be easy remove from peo ,never force it coz you damage peo
[2024-01-23T17:28:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pei
[2024-01-23T17:28:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12408@23-01-2024_17-28-06.jpg>
[2024-01-23T17:28:07] Jan: Just surveiled ingredients
[2024-01-23T17:28:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12409@23-01-2024_17-28-11.jpg>
[2024-01-23T17:28:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Peo
[2024-01-23T17:28:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Customer pics for Happy
[2024-01-23T17:28:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But in some days i should send my self
[2024-01-23T17:31:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I Unsure about how much i have here but i Guess more ,but makes no sense to worry , I have liquid oxigen what is lot more dangerous I am not into fireworks too much
[2024-01-23T17:32:19] haku: thats cool
[2024-01-23T17:32:44] Happy Giraffe: Not eatable😭
[2024-01-23T17:36:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am unsure how big but i never use does , tiny shitty screw solution tbh Better solder all from the otherside, than cover with 704 or such Also swiches and potmeters after they are set on the otherside,even connections Cables from one direction,not like a flower head Than if done and dry You could insert into an antistatic bag and 704 to battery or where you like , just better use some foam pad if its on the bottom plate to avoid legs damage or such
[2024-01-23T17:41:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not totally sure what u7 are but If you spintend vesc you have dedicated max power for adc2 If your lights consume more and support higher voltgate,you may like to wire individualy to a swich from bat and light
[2024-01-23T17:42:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Didn't tried yet
[2024-01-23T17:42:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But hey if you go McDonald's its eating plastic also😁
[2024-01-23T17:44:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As i Always say open it ,that fuse is good for nothing basically
[2024-01-23T17:45:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lot monorim comes with too long bolts ,than even with all washers its not tight,better cut a bit and done
[2024-01-23T17:46:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if long term use like that , arms need to be changed for sure
[2024-01-23T17:47:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But basically it's shitty, where they stole the idea ,they used big tires Than tiny tires made that bend and that maked it super weak to side damage But mirrored is full different thing like comparing a greyhound to a pittbull as they stand infront of you🤣😅 reallly
[2024-01-23T17:50:14] R3VOLT: <photos/photo_12410@23-01-2024_17-50-14.jpg>
[2024-01-23T17:50:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Problem comes from there remake and long bolts
[2024-01-23T17:51:32] R3VOLT: I haven t really DYI myself anything besides soldering a capacitor to a display
[2024-01-23T17:51:48] R3VOLT: Hence why i wanna make sure i ain t frying anythinf and require baby steps
[2024-01-23T17:51:50] R3VOLT: Gugu gaga
[2024-01-23T17:51:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Custom brake disc , that is hard one ,i mean you need material for that also ,but cant wait to see if it happens
[2024-01-23T17:53:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brake light thingy surly good
[2024-01-23T17:53:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Other needs description to know how much it eats
[2024-01-23T17:54:20] R3VOLT: Brake says 12v nothing else
[2024-01-23T17:54:42] R3VOLT: <photos/photo_12411@23-01-2024_17-54-42.jpg>
[2024-01-23T17:58:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This not description and we were talking about main light
[2024-01-23T17:59:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats was clear from first second that it's 12 v
[2024-01-23T18:00:03] R3VOLT: How many amps it runs ?
[2024-01-23T18:00:44] R3VOLT: <photos/photo_12412@23-01-2024_18-00-44.jpg>

[2024-01-23T18:04:22] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow should be able to do a test sample of 2mm acid proof steel
[2024-01-23T18:05:00] Happy Giraffe: Biggest and baddest material we have, will be interesting to see how it handles the heat when put against a motor
[2024-01-23T18:12:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Should be good This also has more types but more sturdy than steel mostly in any side of the story We call it acid proof also or Inox
[2024-01-23T18:13:48] Happy Giraffe: My friend is overly negative about DIY brake discs but will see when I test them
[2024-01-23T18:14:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mainly its about ,can you make it
[2024-01-23T18:14:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's more the thing,if they bend by cut not good
[2024-01-23T18:15:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But in brakco brand you find inox disc in 1,8 mm thickness ,so you should be fine
[2024-01-23T18:19:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lol why you have that relay
[2024-01-23T18:19:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It can work from adc2
[2024-01-23T18:21:04] R3VOLT: Came in the package
[2024-01-23T18:26:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 1A * 12 V =12 w
[2024-01-23T18:27:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or I = P / U = 24 / 12 = 2 A
[2024-01-23T18:28:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So you have 1 A for brake l and horn and blinkers since brake light knows function
[2024-01-23T18:29:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You were asking in help topic ,not here just saying 😅
[2024-01-23T18:31:03] Happy Giraffe: Will be from 2mm sheet and cut with a mill
[2024-01-23T18:45:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They have some design or design before there?
[2024-01-23T18:46:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like " fuck the police" cutted disc would be nice Or omelette du fromage for Francois 🤣 Or baguette shaped cuts
[2024-01-23T18:58:53] Happy Giraffe: Lets continue in PM I can share design with you but dont share forward
[2024-01-23T19:04:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Share with self destruck 1s
[2024-01-23T19:06:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I like it
[2024-01-23T21:27:44] haku: solder them its easier. make custom connectors
[2024-01-23T21:30:13] haku: <photos/photo_12414@23-01-2024_21-30-13.jpg>
[2024-01-23T21:30:14] haku: <photos/photo_12415@23-01-2024_21-30-14.jpg>
[2024-01-23T22:06:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice solution 👌
[2024-01-23T22:29:35] Mirono escooters: Print on glass and not pei? Get smooth pei?
[2024-01-23T22:29:59] Mirono escooters: That seems like way to rough pei Also a few .0x mm higher leveling Or that thing auto levels
[2024-01-23T22:30:11] Mirono escooters: Stupid screw terminals
[2024-01-23T22:41:41] Mirono escooters: 🤔
[2024-01-23T22:44:51] haku: i have that problem too. im getting smooth pei from ali and see how that works
[2024-01-23T22:45:27] haku: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $13.60 72%OFF | ENERGETIC Upgrade Bambu Lab x1 PEI Build Plate Double Side Smooth PEI Magnetic Spring Steel Sheet Heat Bed 257x257mm https://a.aliexpress.com/_mKIy8au
[2024-01-23T22:46:30] haku: very affordable i think
[2024-01-23T22:46:39] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_12416@23-01-2024_22-46-39.jpg>
[2024-01-23T22:47:22] haku: i will test see how this performs. im sure this bootleg will be fine
[2024-01-23T22:49:23] haku: this is the bambu version
[2024-01-23T22:51:03] haku: what scooter is that?
[2024-01-23T22:51:05] Happy Giraffe: Colder bed temperature😁
[2024-01-23T22:55:17] Franchesco Carofano: Nami blast Max 🔥
[2024-01-23T22:56:27] haku: cool. does it have a bigger deck space than bunie
[2024-01-23T22:58:44] haku: petg sticks really well on textured pei. maybe apply glue they say
[2024-01-23T22:59:07] haku: i havent tried that method yet
[2024-01-23T23:00:48] Franchesco Carofano: The deck is shorter but the scooter is very stable, much more than the burn-e, taking curves with the incredible
[2024-01-23T23:03:01] haku: very good to know. i always wondered about this suspension design
[2024-01-23T23:03:01] Happy Giraffe: Told you its crap😂
[2024-01-23T23:03:36] Happy Giraffe: And you gotta wait PEI to cool down like 3 min atleast usually
[2024-01-23T23:09:18] Happy Giraffe: hahah
[2024-01-23T23:09:32] Mirono escooters: Upside down can of air and cool that mofo to -20
[2024-01-23T23:10:09] Mirono escooters: That's what we glass users do Idk if works for pei Problably
[2024-01-23T23:10:29] Mirono escooters: When I'm inpatient I spray glass with it and hope it doesn't shatter in a bazillion pieces
[2024-01-23T23:11:29] Mirono escooters: Had it happen once, not because cooling, just 5 uggabuggas pulling it off and well
[2024-01-23T23:11:36] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2024-01-23T23:13:02] haku: can you put pei plate in the dishwasher or wash it with dish soap. ive read this somewhere
[2024-01-23T23:15:47] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2024-01-23T23:15:50] Mirono escooters: Or clean with ipa
[2024-01-23T23:43:35] Gabe Enzo: Guys I ordered a glitter welder and BMS from china. Irish post services usually send a message on your phone number with a link to pay for customs. I have just realized I entered my number incorrectly on AliExpress. Do I cancel the order? im unsure if I even can. How fucked am I?
[2024-01-23T23:45:01] Mirono escooters: Cant you through tracking?
[2024-01-23T23:45:23] Gabe Enzo: Oh, correct I should be able to. I will check that ASAP
[2024-01-23T23:46:41] haku: wich glitter did you get?
[2024-01-23T23:47:13] Gabe Enzo: OK so I need a customs reference number. But that should come in my email hopefully. Not all hope is lost.
[2024-01-23T23:47:18] Gabe Enzo: 801D.
[2024-01-23T23:47:28] Mirono escooters: Vat wasn't include?
[2024-01-23T23:48:45] haku: please let me know how that welds. im very intrested
[2024-01-23T23:49:51] Gabe Enzo: Unsure, hopefully should be included. But you never know with these Irish assholes, they could add extra.
[2024-01-23T23:50:08] Gabe Enzo: They made me pay for my spintend.
[2024-01-23T23:50:12] Mirono escooters: Vat is vat, that's impossible
[2024-01-23T23:50:16] Mirono escooters: Not vat include
[2024-01-23T23:50:23] Mirono escooters: Alieexpress under 150 bucks is include :)
[2024-01-23T23:50:31] Gabe Enzo: OK, so I'm good. Thank fuck dude, you saved me from a heart attack.
[2024-01-23T23:50:36] Gabe Enzo: Glitter was 200
[2024-01-23T23:50:52] Gabe Enzo: you mean over?
[2024-01-23T23:50:55] Mirono escooters: Under
[2024-01-23T23:51:06] Gabe Enzo: Uh oh.... bad news?
[2024-01-23T23:51:10] Mirono escooters: Check order If it charged ya vat
[2024-01-23T23:51:21] Happy Giraffe: usually even higher amounts have vat nowadays included, check listing page and make seller pay if they say vat ready
[2024-01-23T23:51:31] Mirono escooters: Nop just means u pay to Shipp company Otherwise alieexpress does for u, safe time and fees
[2024-01-23T23:51:43] Mirono escooters: Well yes, but I can only guarantee 150
[2024-01-23T23:51:49] Mirono escooters: So he should check his order
[2024-01-23T23:52:02] Gabe Enzo: Says vat included, PHEW
[2024-01-23T23:52:02] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_12420@23-01-2024_23-52-02.jpg>
[2024-01-23T23:52:59] Mirono escooters: Cool. No problems then with mommy govment
[2024-01-23T23:53:08] Gabe Enzo: Now I can go to sleep
[2024-01-23T23:53:12] Mirono escooters: Dodo
[2024-01-23T23:54:09] Jan: Teflon spray, then you got absolute zero adhesion for sure
[2024-01-23T23:55:01] haku: would that be ok with textured pei plates?
[2024-01-23T23:55:02] Jan: For real, at one point just replace the pei sheet
[2024-01-23T23:55:17] Jan: Never teflon spray pls 😅😅
[2024-01-23T23:55:46] Jan: The weirdest shit that actually worked was wood glue (up to 100°C)
[2024-01-23T23:56:06] Jan: Hairspray is also super nice up to 60°C
[2024-01-23T23:56:19] haku: i keep reading that glue works well for not sticking in plate
[2024-01-23T23:57:09] Jan: If you really want proper adhesion buy one of those pvp chemical adhesion pens
[2024-01-23T23:57:36] Jan: https://magigoo.myshopify.com/collections/all/
[2024-01-23T23:57:56] Jan: Every professional company in additive manufacturing uses these
[2024-01-23T23:58:42] haku: awsome. thanks
[2024-01-23T23:59:09] Jan: Ive been to Formnext Fair where about 860 companies in 3D printing where present
[2024-01-23T23:59:29] Jan: Like 99% of FDM printing was magigoo
[2024-01-24T00:00:32] Jan: I need to ride a Nami, everyone is telling its so great but i cant imagine it
[2024-01-24T00:01:26] Jan: Suspension solution looks asthetically terrible. From the principle kinda great, from execution mediocre
[2024-01-24T00:01:42] Franchesco Carofano: Good now leaving work to fly
[2024-01-24T00:02:02] haku: same. when they first came out they were really hot items ive read. now in 2024 theres alot of other brands
[2024-01-24T00:02:04] Mirono escooters: Yeah aesthetics really ruin it Plus scooter even bigger And a lil more change to top over (not super big problem)
[2024-01-24T00:02:07] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_12421@24-01-2024_00-02-07.jpg>
[2024-01-24T00:02:19] Mirono escooters: Oh different scooter
[2024-01-24T00:02:47] Jan: If there was a scooter that actually solved it ... Guess which one😬😬
[2024-01-24T00:03:11] Franchesco Carofano: Friend, I thought the same thing until I put it together, it's super stable, it gets pretty, it's an incredible scooter, the suspension makes it very firm, it's a high impact suspension.
[2024-01-24T00:03:20] haku: my vote is laotie. brand loyalty is a mofo
[2024-01-24T00:03:39] Gabe Enzo: Some asshole stole my helmet today. I should've locked it.
[2024-01-24T00:03:53] Gabe Enzo: Honestly I always told myself if someone's gonna steal that shit then they need it more than I do
[2024-01-24T00:04:05] Gabe Enzo: Pretty petty. Probably won't even be their size.
[2024-01-24T00:04:05] Jan: Yes as said the principle is kinda great, thats why its stable. They made a patent on it too
[2024-01-24T00:04:14] haku: what brand is it?
[2024-01-24T00:04:17] Franchesco Carofano: impeccable scooter friend, try it then talk about it, I have both and they are both different things
[2024-01-24T00:04:23] Gabe Enzo: XL Moto, was about 100€.
[2024-01-24T00:04:53] Franchesco Carofano: Rich scooter friend
[2024-01-24T00:05:09] Gabe Enzo: I'll get another, idrc. I have enough money for anything I need. Just a bummer what this world has become.
[2024-01-24T00:05:23] Jan: Thats the issue in my opinion
[2024-01-24T00:05:31] Jan: Mechanical weakpoint
[2024-01-24T00:05:37] Franchesco Carofano: I have tried almost all the dualtron kaabo zero vsett and nami is one of the best for my taste, I will not change it
[2024-01-24T00:05:52] Jan: Segway GT2
[2024-01-24T00:05:54] Gabe Enzo: I actually have another but it's for mountain biking, it's a full face one. but that's fine I don't go more than 35kmh rn I'm on a stock ebike.
[2024-01-24T00:06:20] haku: at this price range the inmotion RS seems its built better. but who knows. i know i wont buy it
[2024-01-24T00:06:28] Franchesco Carofano: It comes with steel reinforcement. It no longer breaks so easily. It is made of steel. All new models come with the piece already reinforced.
[2024-01-24T00:06:42] Jan: Inmotion RS also is really legit engineering behind it
[2024-01-24T00:07:06] haku: if i was going to buy something its that scoot.
[2024-01-24T00:07:23] Jan: It violates the principle of beam inertia by quite a lot
[2024-01-24T00:07:33] Jan: Im not saying its bad
[2024-01-24T00:07:46] Jan: Im saying if it breaks, its gonna be there 100%
[2024-01-24T00:08:53] Franchesco Carofano: Of course I understand my friend
[2024-01-24T00:08:54] Jan: Im not gonna buy any 11inch scooter, too big for me, but im happy to ride one if i get another opportunity
[2024-01-24T00:09:30] haku: 12 inch or nada. 😂
[2024-01-24T00:10:11] Gabe Enzo: And once I sign up for door dash when I make my molicel pack I'll be able to rack in another 1200$ per month.
[2024-01-24T00:10:37] Jan: That would be an idea ❤️
[2024-01-24T00:10:44] Jan: Momen tricher style
[2024-01-24T00:12:11] Jan: <photos/photo_12423@24-01-2024_00-12-11.jpg>
[2024-01-24T00:12:11] Jan: <photos/photo_12424@24-01-2024_00-12-11.jpg>

[2024-01-24T00:12:11] Jan: <photos/photo_12426@24-01-2024_00-12-11.jpg>
[2024-01-24T00:12:25] Jan: Thats actually also a legit engineering behind
[2024-01-24T00:12:38] Mirono escooters: Gt2 🔥
[2024-01-24T00:12:46] Mirono escooters: Took a long enough time xD
[2024-01-24T00:12:48] haku: ali express really competing now. they deliver to my door instead of walking to the mailbox. even if its a $2 item with free shipping 😂
[2024-01-24T00:12:57] Jan: I would say from all the hyperscooter, GT2, Inmotion RS and this Momen Tricher are the only ones who got it right so far
[2024-01-24T00:13:10] Jan: Nobody guessed it
[2024-01-24T00:13:13] Jan: 😭
[2024-01-24T00:13:18] Mirono escooters: Seems stronk
[2024-01-24T00:13:25] Mirono escooters: Am wrong?
[2024-01-24T00:13:32] Mirono escooters: St2? Any Segway?
[2024-01-24T00:13:52] Jan: ST2 i need to see closer firsr, cant say from the pictures
[2024-01-24T00:14:21] Gabe Enzo: once I ordered a chocolate bar for 1€ on Amazon and it came in 12 hours in the morning at 6am. I felt so bad for the guy who had to do deliver it.
[2024-01-24T00:14:27] Mirono escooters: O ok
[2024-01-24T00:14:29] Gabe Enzo: Amazon is cruel
[2024-01-24T00:14:35] haku: i really dont know how they making money on that. paying americans to hand deliver items
[2024-01-24T00:14:38] Кирилл: Looks like will work same as GT about steering
[2024-01-24T00:14:59] Gabe Enzo: AND IT WAS RAINING
[2024-01-24T00:14:59] Кирилл: at least the differences are minimal
[2024-01-24T00:15:09] Gabe Enzo: AND THEY MAKE THEM CYCLE ON LITTLE TRICYCLES
[2024-01-24T00:15:29] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_12427@24-01-2024_00-15-29.jpg>
[2024-01-24T00:15:30] Кирилл: They nailed it finally
[2024-01-24T00:15:35] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_12428@24-01-2024_00-15-35.jpg>
[2024-01-24T00:15:52] haku: i think drone delivery will be a hot thing in 2024. amazon and walmart already starting to do it
[2024-01-24T00:16:09] Jan: Ok, yeah i need to see more pictures or videos
[2024-01-24T00:16:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Turn over that
[2024-01-24T00:16:32] haku: they pay pretty good wages for drone pilots ive heard
[2024-01-24T00:16:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's peo side
[2024-01-24T00:16:57] Кирилл: <photos/photo_12429@24-01-2024_00-16-57.jpg>
[2024-01-24T00:17:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hair spray
[2024-01-24T00:17:18] Jan: Its unfortunately all under covers
[2024-01-24T00:17:27] Jan: Whole suspension mechanism
[2024-01-24T00:17:53] Jan: Its basically GT2 but with more profit margin
[2024-01-24T00:18:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pet doesnt like too fast that was a problem of hairs in mine
[2024-01-24T00:18:48] haku: you think they will cut the gt line? they are heavily discounted. those frames might get really rare in the future
[2024-01-24T00:19:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Buys drone hunter gun
[2024-01-24T00:19:14] Кирилл: ST1 will be a straight fork with shock absorber between forks and st2 will be just like GT series suspension - parallelogram one, but with a little difference
[2024-01-24T00:19:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <animation>
[2024-01-24T00:19:30] Jan: I guess the GT2 made not enough profits

[2024-01-24T00:32:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure if glasses included or not
[2024-01-24T00:33:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But now need to buy just the glass
[2024-01-24T00:34:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: After 2 years fox lexan glass outer film started to get off , doenst really bother just looks shit

[2024-01-24T00:42:02] Gabe Enzo: It had an impact, so it's basically dangerous to use. Dude who uses it will probably die on next impact.
[2024-01-24T00:42:15] Gabe Enzo: Helmets basically one use.
[2024-01-24T00:43:19] Gabe Enzo: Should replace after every hard impact.
[2024-01-24T00:44:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Surly
[2024-01-24T00:47:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pls guy keep room clean for help ,off in off Chit Chat from scooter related in general

[2024-01-24T00:50:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ok if it starts stick after some tune , and doenst get of put to fridge dont force coz you fuck pei layer
[2024-01-24T00:50:53] Gabe Enzo: I'm stuck on a decision here XD build a 13s6p LG pack, or 20s4p? Idk what to feed this 800w blade motor for speed/range.. I'll be limited on amps with the 4p option. These cells are only 8a each.
[2024-01-24T00:52:01] Gabe Enzo: I feel 20s would be more optimal, but 13s has a crazy kick, even back when I had a single pro 10s and 3s external I went 45 without FWK. Unsure what would be better range wise
[2024-01-24T00:52:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Everybody got the flow 😅
[2024-01-24T00:52:58] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-01-24T00:53:29] Gabe Enzo: I could also do 14s5p and add a 3s6p EVE external.
[2024-01-24T01:00:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What was engine rated for basically?
[2024-01-24T01:02:41] Gabe Enzo: 800w blade from Paolo
[2024-01-24T01:03:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Rated voltage
[2024-01-24T01:03:21] Gabe Enzo: Lmao, I was taught motors don't care about volts, only watts
[2024-01-24T01:03:28] Gabe Enzo: Who knows haha 48v most likely
[2024-01-24T01:03:33] haku: theres a 800w blade. thats good to know
[2024-01-24T01:03:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What was it in?
[2024-01-24T01:03:56] Gabe Enzo: yeah it says 48v on it
[2024-01-24T01:04:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than probably 20 s not best idea for her and for your range also
[2024-01-24T01:04:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Go 60 v or such
[2024-01-24T01:05:00] Gabe Enzo: Her? rizzler.
[2024-01-24T01:05:17] Gabe Enzo: 17s it is then.
[2024-01-24T01:06:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mostly call scooter and stuff like this womanish
[2024-01-24T01:06:17] Gabe Enzo: In polish all vehicles are female
[2024-01-24T01:06:26] Gabe Enzo: romance languages iassume the same
[2024-01-24T01:06:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am just bit lower on the map 😁
[2024-01-24T01:07:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure where i get it but it was always like this
[2024-01-24T01:07:06] Gabe Enzo: This perfect. 15ah + 15ah
[2024-01-24T01:08:16] Gabe Enzo: Just gotta buy a 14s bms and charger.
[2024-01-24T01:08:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Anyway if nice nice ,but some times some scooters act like bitch so saying vehicles female makes sense
[2024-01-24T01:08:39] Gabe Enzo: I like my women how I like my coffee. Bitter.
[2024-01-24T01:08:49] Gabe Enzo: with hints of sweet.
[2024-01-24T01:09:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cant say I agree, but lets not off general too 🤣
[2024-01-24T01:10:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you like ,i am not really a fun of serial connections tbh
[2024-01-24T01:11:17] Gabe Enzo: Yeah it's pretty dirty. could just go with 20s and Monitor temps.
[2024-01-24T01:11:27] Gabe Enzo: I have a thermal probe.
[2024-01-24T01:12:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🙈🙈🙈now i am confused what i will recieve, basically I should get all ,ok not all ,coz there is petpei and that's what i wanted basically,but there was no choice shipping, so fuck it

[2024-01-24T01:13:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did you raised temps?
[2024-01-24T01:14:16] Franchesco Carofano: No problem on the friendly street, more stability when cornering
[2024-01-24T01:14:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also build one thing at a time, better till you not a pro
[2024-01-24T01:16:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you have a cam to make video about handlebar movement on the road , that's a telling one
[2024-01-24T01:16:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But no cheating on best road possible 😁
[2024-01-24T01:16:32] Franchesco Carofano: total 59ah 24ah in the bag and 35 down on the deck
[2024-01-24T01:16:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As you like
[2024-01-24T01:17:13] haku: wow your scooter is so cool. how fast does it go? and what batteries do you use?
[2024-01-24T01:18:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I Hope in the bag tube and bottom side isolated to take hits ,so battery doesnt get damaged
[2024-01-24T01:18:16] Franchesco Carofano: It's all a matter of taste but it doesn't move, it's tied with Velcro and it works well. There are several Nami here in Chile with the same modification and without a problem, it's a matter of taste. I don't like the double floor.
[2024-01-24T01:21:00] Franchesco Carofano: It is at 120km hour with the controls 200ah 75200 22x3 motors 70h 3000watt battery in the panasonic series deck 18650 original nami with 100ah bms 24 ah external battery with sun power china 21700 cells 120ah bms each cell discharge of the subpower 20ah per cell we were testing them
[2024-01-24T01:22:04] haku: very cool. what vesc are you using?
[2024-01-24T01:22:07] Franchesco Carofano: You're right but the bag has a good back brother and remember that the nami is soft, the suspension is super soft. It works well
[2024-01-24T01:23:25] Franchesco Carofano: https://t.me/VescHelpGroup/176427/197769
[2024-01-24T01:23:28] Franchesco Carofano: Esas
[2024-01-24T01:26:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would still say put a foam layer on tube and bottom side ,it makes your life safer
[2024-01-24T01:26:31] Franchesco Carofano: <animation>
[2024-01-24T01:27:04] Franchesco Carofano: <video_file>

[2024-01-24T08:45:12] Finn: Wtf did he do with the batteries in the bed😳
[2024-01-24T09:11:53] Albert Rembisz: Is it possible to set something like KERS in Xiaomi in VESC controller ? And the second question how high should be regenerating current if I have set phase current 120-150A? :)
[2024-01-24T09:13:52] Mirono escooters: That is entirely up to you, test 80-100 and see if you like it And kers, why?
[2024-01-24T09:14:12] Mirono escooters: Put da battery in da hole
[2024-01-24T09:35:57] Finn: Oh god
[2024-01-24T10:23:24] Happy Giraffe: Battery Regen current you can set whatever is the battery max charge current

[2024-01-24T10:32:23] Mirono escooters: Perfectly fine for a few seconds. High battery ebrake helps with highspeed braking
[2024-01-24T11:37:38] R3VOLT: What is it Ninebot doing with their " hyper " scoot brake disc, heard it's an unusual disc size

[2024-01-24T13:01:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never set a lot e brake or regen, just let's say while work together as i like with hidro's
[2024-01-24T13:03:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Regen is nice but slows you a lot with a high number When you just free ride
[2024-01-24T13:11:53] Happy Giraffe: He talked about vesc regen not xiaomi esc😁
[2024-01-24T13:35:34] R3VOLT: guys , any decent soldering station from Aliexpress pls
[2024-01-24T13:36:31] R3VOLT: or shall i go for something local
[2024-01-24T13:36:35] R3VOLT: such as https://www.toolstation.com/draper-soldering-station/p62910?utm_source=googleshopping&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=googleshoppingfeed&mkwid=_dc&pcrid=null&pkw=null&pmt=null&gad_source=1&acs_info=ZmluYWxfdXJsOiAiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9vbHN0YXRpb24uY29tL3A2MjkxMCIK&gclid=Cj0KCQiAh8OtBhCQARIsAIkWb68bInD0J_X-oSM4zQwnvK-rRoqdFIuu4tZbuxtWVT261rwcAehWszEaAsgfEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
[2024-01-24T13:55:09] R3VOLT: what y'all rocking , 600 euro stuff ?
[2024-01-24T14:07:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yep
[2024-01-24T14:07:37] Happy Giraffe: Bro you can get good soldering iron for way less, stations not needed
[2024-01-24T14:08:01] francois schempers: I would advise a ts100 solder Pen with BC2 Tips, best combinaison I've tried, the Pen can easily be powerful enough, can work while connected in typeC and you can easily change the temperature
[2024-01-24T14:08:10] Happy Giraffe: My Ryobi 120w soldering iron works with their batteries and costed like 50-60€😁
[2024-01-24T14:12:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For smaller jobs you can find cheap 230 v type with screen 80w claimed , that will do, if you dont solder too thick stuff
[2024-01-24T14:41:41] cihan: I've ridden Ninebot f2 pro under rain several times and front tire bearing lost its grease. I opened the bearing and there was very slight rust and water inside housing and on the axle. I'm going to apply poliurea synthetic NLGI 2 grease on bearings and bearing housing. I can also use marine grease which is calcium soap based as I know. Is there any recommendation to keep water outside of bearings and axle? Unfortunately there's no other cap on bearing cap on ninebot f2 pro. So falling rain can hit bearing caps easily.
[2024-01-24T14:46:13] cihan: What do you think about applying silicone over bearing caps after inserting the axle ?
[2024-01-24T15:10:38] Mirono escooters: Budget?
[2024-01-24T15:10:49] Mirono escooters: A station is just the best when you only do desk soldering
[2024-01-24T15:11:23] Mirono escooters: Good bearings, only way. 2rs
[2024-01-24T15:11:36] Oreo huzky: I aint no cheap h*e
[2024-01-24T15:14:25] R3VOLT: Got this crap atm
[2024-01-24T15:14:35] R3VOLT: 100£
[2024-01-24T15:14:43] Oreo huzky: I started there too
[2024-01-24T15:14:50] Oreo huzky: Works fine for the basics
[2024-01-24T15:14:52] Mirono escooters: Oh easy
[2024-01-24T15:15:08] R3VOLT: Shall i just stick with this or grab some kit with pen holder etc
[2024-01-24T15:15:21] R3VOLT: If there s any in this price tag of course
[2024-01-24T15:15:23] Mirono escooters: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EvRcxxf
[2024-01-24T15:15:23] Mirono escooters: This one is best Price quality
[2024-01-24T15:15:23] Mirono escooters: Tiny 24v 5a psu
[2024-01-24T15:15:23] Mirono escooters: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EyrNBdL
[2024-01-24T15:16:07] Mirono escooters: This is best price quality ever Every maker workroom here has it Unbeatable And a desk one is still superior then such a tiny portable imo (I got a ts100 too, for mobile soldering But I ain't using that all day everyday)
[2024-01-24T15:34:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: First dont expect Chinese Bearings to be good when they didn't think about simering
[2024-01-24T15:34:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Use skf rsh That has thicker sealing
[2024-01-24T15:34:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_12439@24-01-2024_15-34-58.jpg>
[2024-01-24T15:35:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All f and d series are like that ,just changed yesterday
[2024-01-24T15:36:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Only good thing is they used bigger bearing and sensorless hfi is fun ,but Wiring over the frame two times And joke coil and magnets in this housing is sad
[2024-01-24T15:37:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Since they spin not a good idea
[2024-01-24T15:40:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Search Similar with screen what's 80 w That's more useful
[2024-01-24T16:38:19] sombre_enfant: 4 year i have this and it been trough intensive work, 60€ kit back in time
[2024-01-24T16:39:34] R3VOLT: that thing thick
[2024-01-24T16:56:27] sombre_enfant: Its actualy small...
[2024-01-24T17:01:36] R3VOLT: the pen i mean
[2024-01-24T17:03:04] sombre_enfant: Brother stop the meds, watch carefully
[2024-01-24T17:04:09] Mirono escooters: (one is a heat gun)
[2024-01-24T17:09:06] R3VOLT: i only looked to the left lol
[2024-01-24T17:32:26] Happy Giraffe: Damn handlebar extension was so tight even putting it to -20°c fridge and hammering it down with the power of the sun left 18mm to go...gonna just call it a day, weld this on and put something to make surface more even. Then cut the 18mm from the end. Now after heating up it will never come off even without the welding😅
[2024-01-24T17:32:46] Mirono escooters: Oof that got deformed at the top
[2024-01-24T17:32:51] Mirono escooters: Why didn't you just lathe .05 off :)
[2024-01-24T17:32:58] Happy Giraffe: Then too loose
[2024-01-24T17:33:04] Mirono escooters: No
[2024-01-24T17:33:17] Mirono escooters: .05 off and then freezer
[2024-01-24T17:33:20] Happy Giraffe: This is exact press fit with thermal expansion😁
[2024-01-24T17:33:31] Happy Giraffe: Propably .02
[2024-01-24T17:33:33] Mirono escooters: You could say it's a press fit
[2024-01-24T17:33:41] Mirono escooters: Whatever. Just as little as humanly possible
[2024-01-24T17:34:15] Happy Giraffe: Putting it again in lathe jaws would have made it not round too😁
[2024-01-24T17:34:45] Mirono escooters: But you.. clamp it at the top?..
[2024-01-24T17:34:49] Happy Giraffe: Next one I make .03 smaller and hammer it in on school so
[2024-01-24T17:35:06] Mirono escooters: Don't got a hydraulic press? Even we got 20ton one
[2024-01-24T17:35:10] Happy Giraffe: I will cut 18mm of it away because didnt go fully in
[2024-01-24T17:35:18] Happy Giraffe: The handlebar will break
[2024-01-24T17:35:45] Mirono escooters: Just make it a lil lil lil tinier lol
[2024-01-24T17:35:55] Mirono escooters: No one need such a press fit, if you cooled it that's just incredible
[2024-01-24T17:35:57] Happy Giraffe: It's one way ticket
[2024-01-24T17:36:23] Happy Giraffe: Now it will be here for eternity if not drilled out😂
[2024-01-24T17:37:47] Happy Giraffe: Its ok, just need to cut it a little and fill the gap perhaps with some TPU
[2024-01-24T17:46:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Best solution to insert would be a press
[2024-01-24T17:46:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And heated tube near cold extension
[2024-01-24T17:47:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But maybe was not fully round and that fucked it
[2024-01-24T17:47:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is the handlebar pole or the handlebar?
[2024-01-24T17:48:36] Happy Giraffe: Handlebar
[2024-01-24T17:48:56] Happy Giraffe: Yes small deviation from handlebar inner wall
[2024-01-24T17:49:30] Happy Giraffe: But it's tight enough now and 30mm in. With weld it will be 100x strong enough even for DH use😅
[2024-01-24T17:50:46] Happy Giraffe: Then gonna put TPU spacer in so supports handlebar body inside

[2024-01-24T17:58:55] Mirono escooters: I'm wondering how that works
[2024-01-24T18:03:42] Unknown: HOW ??
[2024-01-24T18:04:14] puneDir: Adjustable shunt
[2024-01-24T18:04:18] puneDir: Ask cengiz
[2024-01-24T18:04:29] puneDir: It adjusts the shunt
[2024-01-24T18:05:22] Mirono escooters: What the hell

[2024-01-24T18:06:39] R3VOLT: rip to the outsiders buying these for full RRP
[2024-01-24T18:07:05] puneDir: Its actually amazing lol Wheelie mode It gives max power when you put it in single mode (or add another swith)
[2024-01-24T18:27:59] Mirono escooters: What the
[2024-01-24T18:28:06] Mirono escooters: @lBabacar

[2024-01-24T18:57:08] haku: holy cow. ive read insurance is cancelling some battery maker shops in the US. amazon will stop shipping non UL certified batteries. its already starting in new york
[2024-01-24T18:58:08] haku: gonna be alot of underground battery makers popping up
[2024-01-24T18:58:45] haku: <photos/photo_12446@24-01-2024_18-58-45.jpg>
[2024-01-24T18:59:50] Mirono escooters: Nothing different from now
[2024-01-24T19:00:46] haku: the legit battery makers here price gonna skyrocket because they need UL certification
[2024-01-24T19:01:43] Mirono escooters: Govment scam actually reasonable considering the safety
[2024-01-24T19:02:35] haku: agreed. but this will force folks to make a jumbled up batteries. home made bombs
[2024-01-24T19:02:48] Mirono escooters: They already do
[2024-01-24T19:04:03] haku: we will see how this will work out
[2024-01-24T19:04:32] haku: UL certification is bs anyways.
[2024-01-24T19:20:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fuck cares i would say

[2024-01-24T19:24:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Better ali batts are good to run some lights ,like unnamed 2ah brown one But not a scooter, lets say not with real load but i only know coz i use to defuse bombs

[2024-01-24T19:30:23] cihan: Fag was considered to be higher quality than SKF in past but I have no idea if it's still better.
[2024-01-24T19:30:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Crap
[2024-01-24T19:30:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure if it was ever better
[2024-01-24T19:31:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Skf existed back in 18th

[2024-01-24T22:01:03] Mirono escooters: Any lathe has feed rate. That's it's whole point, it's just a axle on the main axle with various gears
[2024-01-24T22:01:11] Mirono escooters: It would be pointless to not spend 50 bucks for that

[2024-01-25T00:05:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats the motor or just a rim?

[2024-01-25T00:06:33] cihan: Sorry, I couldn't understand the question, could you rephrase please? F2 pro is rear wheel drive and this is front wheel bearing.
[2024-01-25T00:07:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh ok
[2024-01-25T00:07:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So rear is motor
[2024-01-25T00:08:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: With f40 and f30 e I ment 6203 bearing pair for motor
[2024-01-25T00:08:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On does motor on front
[2024-01-25T00:08:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tire in the rear 6001
[2024-01-25T00:09:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So far they are the same
[2024-01-25T00:09:20] cihan: Are these 6xxx numbers universal for bearings?
[2024-01-25T00:10:16] cihan: I have no idea about rear yet Since rear bearing has more protection for rain and since I also block rain, rear is still fine.
[2024-01-25T00:10:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its there naming
[2024-01-25T00:11:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Same old Same cheapest Chinese inside now ,better change that too ,i would say

[2024-01-25T00:11:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if you open it make some pictures
[2024-01-25T00:11:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes
[2024-01-25T00:12:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ai answer sounds nice

[2024-01-25T00:12:31] cihan: OK. I'll consider doing it soon. I'll also have chance to see if deck has any water inside. It shouldn't since they sell it as IPX5.
[2024-01-25T00:12:51] Konstantin: Need to test ;))))
[2024-01-25T00:13:26] cihan: For myself or for the group? Is there anything specific you want to see? So I can clearly take photo of what you want to see
[2024-01-25T00:16:51] Mirono escooters: It *can* but no one has programmed it yet
[2024-01-25T00:17:20] Mirono escooters: Tis a chatbot msg overall

[2024-01-25T00:24:30] Konstantin: <files/JBD CANBUS communication protocol (1).pdf>
[2024-01-25T00:43:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You should find water damage indicator stickers probably inside

[2024-01-25T00:49:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lot metals have effect on you ,like if you touch alu for a day in thin gloves ,your whole hand is grey from it Copper doesnt color you but any drink or food or cigarette turns sweet from it
[2024-01-25T00:50:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Almost all metals not to body friendly,some is less and some is more
[2024-01-25T00:52:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Copper has a few nice things ,like no wonder why water System can be done from it, kills thousands of types of bacteria coz it's copper
[2024-01-25T00:55:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On the Otherway around like to eat things and effect them , Like connection with pure alu ends in microcorrosion and copper wins Also if you happen to know some ppl who has zink rainline or roof ,just put piece of copper on top of the house and in 3 months everything Will be full of holes
[2024-01-25T00:55:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Similar can be done with salmia salt
[2024-01-25T00:56:03] haku: waht about fumes from welding?
[2024-01-25T00:56:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That eats even galvanised painted surfaces also
[2024-01-25T00:56:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Non is life friendly lets say

[2024-01-25T00:58:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Better put something to slow air coz does not fun
[2024-01-25T00:59:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Unsure what gasses come from all ,but nothing to friendly
[2024-01-25T00:59:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Stick welding makes ozone
[2024-01-25T00:59:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's for sure
[2024-01-25T00:59:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But near that metal burns or basic oilish surface burns on it
[2024-01-25T01:00:16] haku: my grand dad did welding he lived a old age.
[2024-01-25T01:00:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Didnt say you die early

[2024-01-25T01:03:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically two sheets of metal with holes
[2024-01-25T01:04:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You push them in middle ,lighter Than together and pull off
[2024-01-25T01:04:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But this is when you pre do it
[2024-01-25T01:04:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or if bolted type
[2024-01-25T01:04:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz if not you cant get it off
[2024-01-25T01:05:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Now you could only get the ends and cut like 45°
[2024-01-25T01:05:54] haku: @james you can run different filanents on the same print. bambu will tell you
[2024-01-25T01:06:14] haku: <photos/photo_12469@25-01-2024_01-06-14.jpg>
[2024-01-25T01:06:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hold them ligher ,push together and cut whats over the size

[2024-01-25T01:07:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: With 1 extruder you can change easy spool ?

[2024-01-25T01:08:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably knows earlier than problem starts
[2024-01-25T01:08:53] haku: even with no ams. i had mine run out mid print then babmu told me to put in new one in
[2024-01-25T01:09:29] cihan: It's written in specs and under the deck too. I think I'll find same inside. Skf has both 2rsh and 2rs c3. 2rs c3 is stainless steel. Could it be better alternative?
[2024-01-25T01:09:34] haku: mine did not. i think
[2024-01-25T01:10:01] haku: or maybe when its almost gone try to push in new fillament
[2024-01-25T01:10:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: C3 is marking about size also ,less sealing on 2rs That's how rsh comes in the picture
[2024-01-25T01:10:48] haku: had this happen a few times

[2024-01-25T16:04:30] puneDir: Zero 10x adjustable shunt mod Works with eco turbo button
[2024-01-25T16:05:13] puneDir: I builded it but idea from cengiz Anyways im going to vesc it next week
[2024-01-25T16:05:31] puneDir: Or maybe run it until it blows fet
[2024-01-25T16:09:02] Mirono escooters: That's, cool If it works
[2024-01-25T16:09:16] puneDir: It does
[2024-01-25T16:09:17] Mirono escooters: So the full 2 days?
[2024-01-25T16:09:23] puneDir: Yes
[2024-01-25T16:09:26] Mirono escooters: You are crazy punedir :)
[2024-01-25T16:09:50] puneDir: Btw it gives more power if you add fets in paralel
[2024-01-25T16:10:19] puneDir: I liked the mod
[2024-01-25T16:10:38] puneDir: Atleast Eco turbo is really eco turbo now
[2024-01-25T16:43:13] Jan: I dont like this concept of different driving modes. I remember my vsett 10+ having, single motor, dual motor, 5 different throttle mappings. I dont understand why they just can use one good instead of 10x shit driving modes. I mean its only 2800W, that should be more than doable
[2024-01-25T16:43:55] Jan: I prefer 1 good throttle mapping that is for everything. Can cruise 5kmh around pedestrians and when you hit it you get 20kW+ without having to remap
[2024-01-25T16:44:00] Tommy ª: imagine my m365 with 3 modes
[2024-01-25T16:44:10] Jan: Yeah its so stupid XD
[2024-01-25T16:44:23] Jan: I also had M365
[2024-01-25T16:44:29] Jan: Was permanently in Sport
[2024-01-25T16:44:32] Jan: "Sport" lol
[2024-01-25T16:44:42] Jan: 500W is really peak performance
[2024-01-25T16:44:43] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jan has been muted for 2 minutes!
[2024-01-25T16:45:40] Tommy ª: i just moded it, in sport goes over 50kmh but for my dad i set them on "D" (30kmh limit) also the "eco" or "walk" mode its stupid
[2024-01-25T16:47:05] Tommy ª: ah yes, you have the police here checking every mode speed 💀
[2024-01-25T16:57:46] francois schempers: yeah just put 1A of coasting residual current and your scooter just go alone, if you need to walk beside it, you tape the throttle once, and the residual current make the scooter weightless, you just make it follow around, useful in a supermarket or smth like that where you can't ride it
[2024-01-25T16:58:42] Happy Giraffe: Or use your body and push it like a man?🌚
[2024-01-25T17:00:03] Tommy ª: casually i do that because the intensive uphills here, the scooter cant climb so i push a bit the thorttle for walk nvm, i set the "walk mode" at 2 amps only for that, i just push at max and now its "light" (?)
[2024-01-25T17:12:27] sombre_enfant: <animation>

[2024-01-25T20:48:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Rest of cables and connectors up to need ,but nothing to much is in them ,i use to use double shaded wires , depends on build ,but i always have 3-5 lines extra , if there is something afterwards from customer,you have the wires already
[2024-01-25T20:52:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What is main goal? on what scooter

[2024-01-25T21:02:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well external is welded on the bottom , probably looking inside would tell , but i am guessing epoxy for internal how ever it can happen that internal was welded first than install external and weld that too
[2024-01-25T21:02:35] Mirono escooters: I can set any color, is handy, but overkill
[2024-01-25T21:02:59] Mirono escooters: <video_file>

[2024-01-25T21:08:29] Mirono escooters: Best way
[2024-01-25T21:09:12] francois schempers: wire is shielded and plenty of wire to send data or 5v to the stem 👌

[2024-01-25T21:14:00] Mirono escooters: You do pay it : D
[2024-01-25T21:14:01] francois schempers: I feel like I'm hearing a scratch record 😂 we'll see soon enough if single is bad 😘
[2024-01-25T21:14:02] Unknown: why are you ....
[2024-01-25T21:14:11] NetworkDir: Wled + esp32 is best and cheap driver for ws2812
[2024-01-25T21:14:26] Mirono escooters: This is 2815
[2024-01-25T21:14:35] NetworkDir: Works with esp32
[2024-01-25T21:14:44] Mirono escooters: And I really didn't feel like including a 5v stepdown, a esp32 and a 12v source
[2024-01-25T21:14:48] NetworkDir: Ws281x supported by esp32
[2024-01-25T21:14:53] Mirono escooters: This works fine, I'm already overkill
[2024-01-25T21:15:11] Mirono escooters: Btw over a meter you really want 2815 2812 5v is horrible, so much amps
[2024-01-25T21:15:12] NetworkDir: Using esp32 for power supply is crazy
[2024-01-25T21:15:24] NetworkDir: Because works with 5v and max 800mA
[2024-01-25T21:15:41] NetworkDir: Yep for scooters 2815 better
[2024-01-25T21:15:51] Unknown: You should. It works flawlessly
[2024-01-25T21:16:25] Mirono escooters: ?????
[2024-01-25T21:16:28] Mirono escooters: I mean 2815 and esp32
[2024-01-25T21:16:37] Mirono escooters: Then I needed a 5v regulator and space for a esp32
[2024-01-25T21:18:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe with new build
[2024-01-25T21:18:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I like that you dont need to leave key in it
[2024-01-25T21:18:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Atleast go cat6 or sftp that's shaded well
[2024-01-25T21:20:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yep back in the day still have the frame and top together,body only has the shunt mode inside,all rest new life
[2024-01-25T21:21:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2024-01-25T21:23:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Agreed, if you have it use it, If not you just struggle one while you have two
[2024-01-25T21:24:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably if you have experience,next question is where 😁
[2024-01-25T21:26:19] sombre_enfant: What u think of my idea to remove the stem holder then press it back
[2024-01-25T21:30:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Stem holder you mean bottom of the folding mechanism?
[2024-01-25T21:30:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would say remove all and look inside ,all places possible
[2024-01-25T21:31:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If its an epoxy glue ,heat area and try press
[2024-01-25T21:31:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But if good epoxy still super hard to do so , depends how its made
[2024-01-25T21:32:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never did such ,so i am Unsure what you find
[2024-01-25T21:37:48] sombre_enfant: <video_file>

[2024-01-25T22:31:44] haku: i dont want to freak anybody. but the guy who did 100mph on a e mtb died on a moto crash. rest in peace. the guy is a legend
[2024-01-25T22:38:47] Gabe Enzo: Surprised that 75100x2 fits in that pro 2 place honestly
[2024-01-25T23:31:27] Happy Giraffe: The proper shielded multi strand flexible cable is so cheap could also get that instead
[2024-01-25T23:39:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is doable, What you say 👌
[2024-01-25T23:39:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just think over several times than go slow with cuts to come out nice
[2024-01-25T23:41:36] Mirono escooters: True but.. that's kinda what Ethernet wire is.
[2024-01-25T23:49:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sad R.I.P Is there a vid of that guy with that speed unsure i know who is he
[2024-01-25T23:53:08] Happy Giraffe: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! €5.58 27%OFF | 26AWG 24AWG 22AWG 2/3/4/5/6/7/8 core Shielded cable 5meters pure copper RVVP shielded wire control cable UL2464 signal wire https://a.aliexpress.com/_EzYE6vj

[2024-01-25T23:53:56] Happy Giraffe: Had to be careful not to break them, these wires have tiny strands so never snap and cause voltage to go max throttle🌚
[2024-01-26T00:00:33] haku: yes. his driver ebikekenievel
[2024-01-26T00:01:17] haku: not the youtuber but the tester who did the 100mph. RIP

[2024-01-27T04:42:18] Jason Nelson: Can someone help me understand the field weakening and the correlation with battery and phase amps?
[2024-01-27T10:12:11] cihan: Thanks. In fact I thought about using c bearing and more viscous grease to have extra damping. By the way I was advised to fill bearing but I also read it's a bad idea since it causes more drag. Then I read 10-20 % is enough and that's probably right. I filled like 70 % but extra amount was extruded out while riding. Strange thing is extra grease was only extruded to the right side of the wheel. Probably left side also extruded out but to the axle inside the wheel. Is this related with direction of spinning or did I do something wrong? Bearings aren't marked with rolling direction and I think they can be used to rotate in any direction and they seemed symmetrical.
[2024-01-27T10:20:08] Gabe Enzo: Oh my godd
[2024-01-27T11:05:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Any who said to you to open a closed bearing is🙈🙈🙈🙈 Second part probably the opened side leaks out also can happen spin direction
[2024-01-27T11:09:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Removeable pad should let go easy if not wait or freezer Than peel

[2024-01-27T11:36:19] haku: ty. my son likes mario movie
[2024-01-27T11:59:02] Unknown: You will not get help
[2024-01-27T12:02:06] Gabe Enzo: ESC acts as a transformer / inverter, you can have higher amps and less voltage. It's not always equal to battery DC amps.
[2024-01-27T12:03:48] Gabe Enzo: It just reduces the magnetic field of the motor and dumps more amps into it. Allows it to spin faster
[2024-01-27T12:43:38] Happy Giraffe: My understanding it shifts the target spot for magneticnfield bit further. Reducing torque but gaining speed. However if you are voltage limited then it kinda gives another"gear" to use. @jamessoderstrom Was I even remotely correct?😂
[2024-01-27T12:47:40] cihan: It isn't sealed that hard. It's just a plastic cover with a thin metal placed under it. I didn't damage anything when opening, it was so easy. Are there such fully sealed bearings? I thought sealing on SKF you recommended is the same as the stock Chinese ones. By the way bicycle wheel bearings are cup cone and they say they are much better sealed and changing balls and greasing is a year is enough for maintenance. Can we somehow use cup cone bearings for scooter too?
[2024-01-27T12:52:58] Jan: Have you tried with google, wikipedia and chatgpt? Is there still something you would like to further discuss here?

[2024-01-27T13:48:25] Finn: Yes
[2024-01-27T13:48:34] Finn: White has 3,3V to tx
[2024-01-27T13:48:52] Finn: Are they swapped on ubox
[2024-01-27T13:49:06] Jason Nelson: That's the first place I looked and all it could tell me is it uses both battery and phase amps with field weakening
[2024-01-27T13:50:17] Jason Nelson: Ultimately my question is that I have a battery 36v capable of 220a output and I'm wondering if it is safe to apply more than 100a of field weakening to a flipsky 75100 alum
[2024-01-27T13:51:59] Happy Giraffe: Pls enlighten us more😁

[2024-01-27T14:05:06] Happy Giraffe: So kinda neutralizes the drag and negative effects of the magnets not being used to rotate usually?🤔
[2024-01-27T14:07:31] francois schempers: Once you put gpt4 into an expert rôle, the answer is spot on
[2024-01-27T14:09:31] francois schempers: <photos/photo_12531@27-01-2024_14-09-31.jpg>
[2024-01-27T14:12:57] Happy Giraffe: Higher voltage demagnetize permanent magnets?😅😳
[2024-01-27T14:27:41] francois schempers: Well heat is a cause, but you can demagnetise a permanent magnet by subjecting it to a too strong contradictory magnetic field
[2024-01-27T14:27:59] francois schempers: I think that was what it meant
[2024-01-27T14:32:48] haku: from my understanding field weakening requires it own amps. like it cant activate if you already pushing max amps.
[2024-01-27T14:36:57] Mirono escooters: How would you do dat xD
[2024-01-27T14:40:33] francois schempers: I think what it tried to say was that with higher power you make more heat, especially with field weakening since you dump even more Amps in the motor, and it tried to say that it would lead to demagnetisation by excess heat
[2024-01-27T14:40:54] francois schempers: but you indeed can demagnetise with a stronger field too
[2024-01-27T14:45:16] francois schempers: yes and no, if your pushing max amp at max speed, part of the Amps are just there to counter backEMF, so, if you reduce what your pushing and put some on Daxis to reduce back emf, in the end, you will be able to go faster since more of your phase amp is used for torque instead of combating back emf
[2024-01-27T14:52:17] Happy Giraffe: I'm thinking is there a limit on how much fw can be pushed besides overheating?
[2024-01-27T14:52:48] Happy Giraffe: ASI Bacs can safely put 40% FW so I guess thats 40% from battery current power going into D axis
[2024-01-27T14:55:50] Mirono escooters: Well, at some point you just lose power to even speed up, regardless of motor
[2024-01-27T14:56:23] haku: i see. thanks
[2024-01-27T14:56:47] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but would be interesting to know where these people get their 40% or 20% FW max being safe
[2024-01-27T14:57:26] Mirono escooters: Magic (Problably irl tests)
[2024-01-27T14:57:55] Happy Giraffe: Kinda annoying when people hear these kinds of "thruths" from someone and spread them without even asking why and whats happening in motor then🌚
[2024-01-27T14:58:41] Happy Giraffe: Like saying BBSHD can only take 3500w safely at 72v. Im like wtf if I have a thermistor on winding then sure can push more batt current if overheated, no?😂
[2024-01-27T14:59:13] Mirono escooters: many morons out there
[2024-01-27T14:59:21] Mirono escooters: who sadly can spread misinformation quivjk
[2024-01-27T14:59:27] Mirono escooters: before internet it was books
[2024-01-27T14:59:43] Happy Giraffe: 100A batt current (7200w) is just a 100A phase that lasts a little longer?🌚😂
[2024-01-27T15:00:13] Happy Giraffe: They said motor cant do more, maybe BAC 2000 can
[2024-01-27T15:00:26] Mirono escooters: Poor noise with all that fwk amps
[2024-01-27T15:01:08] Happy Giraffe: They talked about the bigger Lightning Rods motors🤔 Being safe to 25% fw max lmao
[2024-01-27T15:01:20] Happy Giraffe: And bbshd somehow 40% 🙈
[2024-01-27T15:02:33] Happy Giraffe: A guy from finland and generally creator of LR and the shops selling the kits for it
[2024-01-27T15:03:21] Happy Giraffe: Theres also some morons who say "external motor housing temperature" is well calibrated into motor core temp😂
