[2021-04-04T00:27:28] Unknown: I will go for this i think the 100 volts and 22s packs are tempting....
[2021-04-04T00:31:00] francois schempers: but dam it's pricey, but hey, it should to the work properly at least
[2021-04-04T00:31:40] Unknown: Yeah I have to rethink the vesc plan...
[2021-04-04T00:35:47] Happy Giraffe: I will go single vesc and order another later if I really need awd...
[2021-04-04T00:36:08] Happy Giraffe: Awd not so practical in Pro, need bigger battery
[2021-04-04T00:36:33] Unknown: We have our jihad packs....

[2021-04-04T01:19:30] Unknown: I think the same i will ask you about the display...

[2021-04-04T02:05:39] Happy Giraffe: So hard to find a decent light or horn. Maybe this would be nice addition to my existing light and bell👀

[2021-04-04T02:08:23] Happy Giraffe: Its not 800 lumen but even 400 could be a good addition to my existing lamp

[2021-04-04T17:46:34] Unknown: Welcome ..... @Babubib
[2021-04-04T17:48:58] Babubi: Thx
[2021-04-04T19:12:38] Happy Giraffe: And also as I heard now vesc gives better maxspeed, does it also give longer range?👀
[2021-04-04T19:50:08] francois schempers: controller is essentially a converter, it convert your battery variable input into a steady wattage, either by moduling voltage or amperage, better converter will effectively result in better management of energy. and more importantly, our old esc where hard coded FOC algorithm, means it make the motor run, but not at it's best, because it's just taking default value. Vesc mesure your motor and you can apply fine tuned FOC algorithms to it, making it run more cool, faster, and you can manage amps more efficiently for stronger acceleration
[2021-04-04T20:00:40] Happy Giraffe: 👋🍆💦
[2021-04-04T20:00:52] Happy Giraffe: Sounds good to me

[2021-04-05T00:57:02] Happy Giraffe: Maybe 1000km
[2021-04-05T00:57:30] Unknown: And already bearings change???
[2021-04-05T00:57:34] Happy Giraffe: I put grease outside bearings also to further protect them lol

[2021-04-06T12:26:06] Happy Giraffe: Seems I will be the beta tester of 600w...
[2021-04-06T12:26:29] francois schempers: 👌
[2021-04-06T12:26:49] francois schempers: @rosheee you have the 1200w right ?
[2021-04-06T12:28:00] Happy Giraffe: Let's shop together on AliExpress with new user coupons Your € 1,73 in coupons are here! https://a.aliexpress.com/_mKSd8y3
[2021-04-06T12:28:24] Happy Giraffe: This shop goes 1000w max so it must be different store atleast👀
[2021-04-06T12:34:34] francois schempers: look on the store, they have different things, like this https://a.aliexpress.com/_uxp0vr
[2021-04-06T12:36:09] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, must be different model in all aspects then? Like Kv etc.
[2021-04-06T12:36:45] francois schempers: I think so
[2021-04-06T12:37:20] Happy Giraffe: I wonder how hard is 1000w to drive with correct settings👀
[2021-04-06T15:34:37] Unknown: From 55 kmh above is very hard to handle the G30, I cannot imagine 60kmh with a m365, the frame is just too week....
[2021-04-06T15:36:01] francois schempers: well the feeling is certainly different when you drive on those beast
[2021-04-06T15:36:22] francois schempers: <photos/photo_40@06-04-2021_15-36-22.jpg>

[2021-04-06T15:40:25] Unknown: 10 inch stays 10 inch...sure this big cst will give some stability....the problem is steering with a 10 inch angle and movement
[2021-04-06T16:14:20] francois schempers: whats a g30 drame gonna do for me ?
[2021-04-06T16:24:38] Unknown: More stability More metal More regidity
[2021-04-06T16:27:57] francois schempers: well its bigger yes, but the alloy is not thicker, plus I am reinforcing mine with steel, I think it's more rigide than a g30 ^^
[2021-04-06T16:39:50] Happy Giraffe: Mine will be front 2.5 rear 2" abomination😂
[2021-04-06T16:44:00] francois schempers: xD
[2021-04-06T16:44:41] francois schempers: if you go for inverted front monorim, go all out and do 3" xd
[2021-04-06T16:45:02] Happy Giraffe: Are you sure its a good idea?👀
[2021-04-06T16:45:23] francois schempers: go 3" front and 2.5 rear
[2021-04-06T16:45:28] Happy Giraffe: I dont do offroad or other stuff
[2021-04-06T16:45:35] Happy Giraffe: I would prefer 2.5 both
[2021-04-06T16:45:45] francois schempers: you will get ton more grip when you need to do delivery in the rain
[2021-04-06T16:45:50] Happy Giraffe: But stock rear wheel😅

[2021-04-06T16:51:37] Happy Giraffe: Time to give hero a call😂
[2021-04-06T16:58:33] Unknown: It didn't fit I tested it
[2021-04-06T17:02:26] francois schempers: you need to grind the rim ?
[2021-04-10T10:15:07] francois schempers: next battery for me will be made from Samsung 40T internal 15s5p, 150A able
[2021-04-10T12:06:09] francois schempers: i think i need to switch to xt90 xD

[2021-04-10T12:49:07] francois schempers: with that i will be able to comfortably do 40A per motor without any Vdrop
[2021-04-10T12:53:08] Happy Giraffe: But short range?
[2021-04-10T12:53:46] Happy Giraffe: Oh not too bad, 4Ah
[2021-04-10T12:57:10] francois schempers: yeah, 40A will be max torque value, once done accelerating it will sit a lot lower when just maintaining speed
[2021-04-10T12:57:52] francois schempers: just bought those too, temperature sensor for inside the motor, compatible Vsec https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B06ZZFY8MK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glc_i_FX9JNA86Y4D18ECJ7TAB?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

[2021-04-10T13:39:04] Unknown: 😳
[2021-04-10T13:40:02] Unknown: 6 Euro.....
[2021-04-10T14:10:20] francois schempers: well you pay for the high density + high current combo ^^
[2021-04-10T14:55:30] Unknown: I tested this cells..i paid 4 Euro i think
[2021-04-10T14:56:40] Unknown: I talked with denis about this cell, we agreed that 5000 mAh is better for the formfactor...
[2021-04-10T14:58:33] Happy Giraffe: But for G30, has wider body👀
[2021-04-10T14:58:43] Happy Giraffe: So fitting 6p should be possible
[2021-04-10T14:59:01] Happy Giraffe: Only battery to handle awd with internal only
[2021-04-10T15:00:10] Unknown: The original internal is 10s6p
[2021-04-10T15:00:41] Happy Giraffe: Maybe even more then👀
[2021-04-10T15:00:55] Unknown: Without casing more is possible
[2021-04-10T15:01:19] Unknown: Gluing instead of caging ...
[2021-04-10T15:01:44] Unknown: The stock is ugly glued.. together..
[2021-04-10T15:02:08] Unknown: That's why they need casing to hide they're shite
[2021-04-10T15:12:22] francois schempers: well with the 3cm spacer it should do the trick ;)
[2021-04-10T15:12:40] francois schempers: space is space is 36x9x8,3cm
[2021-04-10T15:12:46] Unknown: 3cm spacer???
[2021-04-10T15:13:05] francois schempers: under the deck
[2021-04-10T15:25:16] Happy Giraffe: I wonder whats max battery size 21700 on G30 if glued and small foam protection
[2021-04-10T15:25:40] Happy Giraffe: 15s7p 40T would be beast
[2021-04-10T15:26:11] Happy Giraffe: Then metal bottom cover is needed ofcourse
[2021-04-10T15:29:42] francois schempers: if you go for 7p then maybe 50E would be better, that leave around 70A range of current but get you a lot more ah
[2021-04-10T15:30:04] francois schempers: 40T is good to have high current on lower P
[2021-04-10T15:30:44] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, 35A each wheel is plenty of power😅
[2021-04-10T15:36:23] francois schempers: turn out the dual Vsec have anti spark integrated

[2021-04-10T22:44:28] Unknown: Carbon very light
[2021-04-10T22:46:15] francois schempers: and gonna study field weakening, and try to provoke it on purpose, it change the Kv drastically, if I could trigger it when I'm at good speed, I could triple the top speed, a bit like delta, but all software

[2021-04-12T19:20:23] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-04-12T19:21:22] Happy Giraffe: Effectiveness?
[2021-04-12T19:21:54] Happy Giraffe: 1200w is 90%, 1500w is 100%?
[2021-04-12T20:05:48] Unknown: <sticker>
[2021-04-12T20:06:06] Unknown: <sticker>
[2021-04-12T20:10:46] francois schempers: no i think 90% is max, it is around what a brushless motor can do. so when 1500w of electricity is given to the motor, you get around 1200w of output force
[2021-04-12T20:11:06] francois schempers: only the new tesla motor can go up to 96%
[2021-04-13T11:18:00] Happy Giraffe: Got these ready for vesc😎
[2021-04-13T13:22:17] francois schempers: ahah nic3

[2021-04-13T21:54:46] francois schempers: i had a butane zippo, it had a huge flame, i watched countless of my friend burn they eyebrows when they steal it xD
[2021-04-13T21:56:19] Happy Giraffe: Haha, this can be used as a blowtorch lmao
[2021-04-13T22:30:34] Unknown: For what use?
[2021-04-13T22:30:58] Happy Giraffe: Melting steel beams

[2021-04-30T22:36:47] Artem Bulashev: We are actively discussing esp32 based co pilot for Spintend UBOX vesc
[2021-04-30T22:36:56] Artem Bulashev: Here is the plan
[2021-04-30T22:37:01] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_45@30-04-2021_22-37-01.jpg>
[2021-04-30T22:37:08] Artem Bulashev: Hi :))
[2021-04-30T22:37:22] Artem Bulashev: That looks fabulous!
[2021-04-30T22:37:29] Unknown: Hi Artem
[2021-04-30T22:38:25] Unknown: Wow this looks promising...
[2021-04-30T22:39:04] francois schempers: yup looks nice, and a lot a work 🤣
[2021-04-30T22:39:08] Artem Bulashev: Yeah screen integration is something that I only now started to look in. So this video is REALLY inspiring!
[2021-04-30T22:39:23] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but I have something ;-)
[2021-04-30T22:39:25] Artem Bulashev: Look
[2021-04-30T22:45:21] Unknown: Luckily we (@Babubib and i) have some knowledge about esp32 and dashboard.. communication....but first we have to get a vesc...
[2021-04-30T22:46:19] francois schempers: i can advise mine, for now im please with it
[2021-04-30T22:48:44] Artem Bulashev: http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50033&Id=1246&FId=t3:50033:3 Step 1. This is ESP32 + gps + sim module all built 1. Add mpu6050 2. Add rfid reader 3. Add mosfet to open power to siren 4. Configure Blynk app for push notification and live tracking on map = 3g gps tracker is ready with built in motion sensing alarm 😃 Step 2. - add connection to VESC to get telemetry for screen and enable configuration of VESC parameters - run break signal and power button signal to allow esp to wake up and sleep and engage motor breaking (like in triggered alarm, read screen shot) - run mode selecting buttons through ESP32 to get « Limited legal» mode, read above screen shot for more detail Step 3 Get telemetry and all on screen 🔥☺️
[2021-04-30T22:50:45] Artem Bulashev: Nice, I have already collected all HW, Ubox is on the way as final part device is assembled and pined out as it needs to be, but question now is to get the code working correctly This device at the link is fucking fabulous 😁😁
[2021-05-01T00:14:27] Artem Bulashev: Is it over can line or uart?
[2021-05-01T00:37:58] Artem Bulashev: Guy. An idea - what I’d we use PI and install Android on it, than get wireless telemetry and Vesc app 😅😅
[2021-05-01T00:38:24] Artem Bulashev: + computer with Io/out control as we desire ✅
[2021-05-01T15:30:17] Unknown: That's a good idea maybe the zero w will be enough.. and hotspot wifi connection..
[2021-05-01T15:32:47] Unknown: But instead of gps jerome suggested lorawan...and i have already Lora equipment...
[2021-05-01T15:33:37] Unknown: Yeah..nice idea Scooter OS ...
[2021-05-01T15:36:05] Unknown: I want to organize races that's why I want a telemetry measurement device...

[2021-05-01T15:37:45] Unknown: What do you think of this vesc...
[2021-05-01T15:38:39] Unknown: I need more than 70V ...that's why this...
[2021-05-01T19:41:19] Artem Bulashev: What S count ?
[2021-05-01T19:43:18] Artem Bulashev: - Ridiculous amount of amps - made in colab with original creator, so quality for sure - high price I would go for 17s capable without regen Ubox Spintend instead (if your battery is 18s and more than no idea, what else is even available)
[2021-05-01T19:43:48] Artem Bulashev: In short there is nothing wrong with this vesc, it is great. But over priced and over Amped
[2021-05-01T19:58:18] Unknown: I'm a vedder fan since 7 years i contributed to vesc community so I think some extra bucks for extra amps...are ok....i like Benjamin and his team but trampa?..i will try it it's the only vesc that supports 100 v
[2021-05-01T20:08:44] Artem Bulashev: I heated that many vesc are more capable that Trampa in real life. But than again, you won’t be pushing voltage limits or def not the amp limit 😂 so it will work great (make sure you take vesc 6 based, because 4 has issue with FOC operation mode) What is your battery ?
[2021-05-01T20:16:53] Unknown: Not sure yet, I'm a pack builder but between 16s and 22s...but look what we do with 10s stock...
[2021-05-01T20:16:57] Unknown: https://youtu.be/o1fQ_BrPBsU
[2021-05-01T20:18:00] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2021-05-01T20:19:17] Artem Bulashev: Well 16s in vsett10+ (sinewave controller) beats almost any in class in terms of acceleration and has top speed 77kmh on flat road 10inch tier
[2021-05-01T20:19:41] Artem Bulashev: So on vesc it will be very very capable
[2021-05-01T20:20:41] Unknown: I think too, we need the buffer, because delta in high mode produces amp spikes....
[2021-05-01T20:21:59] Unknown: I think i will run it on 70v....but dual Delta has never done ..so I better sum up spikes...
[2021-05-01T20:22:22] Artem Bulashev: For example 16s Ubox Spintend Can handle 16s no issue and 17s without recup And does well 110-130amp phase current and Absolute setting 160amps. Battery amp it can take 110amps no problem - stays barely warm

[2021-05-01T20:24:36] Artem Bulashev: What a count it will be?
[2021-05-01T20:25:01] Unknown: 70 nominal...
[2021-05-01T20:25:44] Artem Bulashev: 18-19s?
[2021-05-01T20:25:47] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-05-01T20:26:02] Unknown: Start low...16s
[2021-05-01T20:26:18] Unknown: But I must beat a Rion
[2021-05-01T20:45:38] Artem Bulashev: Lol

[2021-05-01T20:57:55] Artem Bulashev: I see ok ✅ just letting you know, I like English speaking format, but there is sooo much info coming from that Russian group discussions :) and development going on Even Spintend them self joined up on my invite to follow 😁😁 very open minded company - they told me that they decided to make scooter / bicycle screen and throttle and generally will try to now get into Scooters market instead of skates oriented approche that most brands have
[2021-05-01T21:05:32] francois schempers: oh glade to have bought ubox then, means more scooter accessories are comings :3
[2021-05-01T21:08:24] Happy Giraffe: Interesting👀

[2021-05-01T21:14:12] Artem Bulashev: Yeah a lot of development from many people
[2021-05-01T21:14:55] Artem Bulashev: Haha yes
[2021-05-01T21:15:02] Artem Bulashev: Also it’s hard to find
[2021-05-01T21:15:25] Artem Bulashev: Because vesc is popular nick name unfortunately 😅😅
[2021-05-01T21:16:00] Artem Bulashev: Maybe try VESC controllers
[2021-05-01T21:16:16] Artem Bulashev: Or we can create one more group called That and re direct people here

[2021-05-01T22:10:54] Artem Bulashev: Highly unlikely 😅😅
[2021-05-02T16:57:45] Unknown: Hey @francois_schempers do you got links to these project display used.,driver etc...?
[2021-05-02T16:58:10] Artem Bulashev: Yeah it would be interesting like a lot to try
[2021-05-02T16:58:54] Unknown: You know these?? https://davega.eu/
[2021-05-02T17:00:16] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-02T17:00:25] Artem Bulashev: But looks bulky
[2021-05-02T17:00:34] Artem Bulashev: For scooter implementation
[2021-05-02T17:01:24] Artem Bulashev: Unless we custom re design casing completely to 3D print
[2021-05-02T17:03:01] Unknown: It's ready to work...i think they work also with an esp..
[2021-05-02T17:03:28] Artem Bulashev: What you mean?
[2021-05-02T17:03:57] Unknown: They have an esp32 implemented...
[2021-05-02T17:04:37] Unknown: How is this going francois
[2021-05-02T17:07:59] Unknown: I will write the guys and ask about scooter implemention .
[2021-05-02T17:14:11] Artem Bulashev: Oh i see, you mean it is based on ESP32, cool
[2021-05-02T17:14:41] Artem Bulashev: I think this is also based on ESP32

[2021-05-02T17:29:06] Happy Giraffe: What could be the smallest screen for voltage/trip meter?
[2021-05-02T17:29:22] Happy Giraffe: For the ultimate stealth sleeper
[2021-05-02T17:31:44] francois schempers: i think this https://davega.eu/ maybe it even passe in place of the ble
[2021-05-02T17:31:49] Artem Bulashev: Amazing 🤩
[2021-05-02T17:32:00] Artem Bulashev: Lots of functions
[2021-05-02T17:32:05] francois schempers: ;)
[2021-05-02T17:33:00] Artem Bulashev: Completely up to the person, for sleeper may need to use same case of the your current display - like eye3
[2021-05-02T17:34:11] Happy Giraffe: Would be perfect if current display could be wired up for the Vesc somehow. Its great already so why not to use it haha😉
[2021-05-02T17:35:48] Unknown: That was my idea
[2021-05-02T17:36:51] Unknown: You can put the ble out and somehow bolt davega it to the base plate..
[2021-05-02T17:38:13] Happy Giraffe: Raspberry Pie in scooter😂
[2021-05-02T17:39:21] Artem Bulashev: That’s unlikely :) mini motor display houses half of the brains of the minimorters if I’m not mistaken
[2021-05-02T17:39:24] Unknown: Of course
[2021-05-02T17:40:39] Unknown: I'm thinking over a year of it, I bought an enviro kit from pimoroni for zero w to track data from inside the scooter...
[2021-05-02T17:41:11] Unknown: And trackdata
[2021-05-02T17:41:12] Happy Giraffe: Only thing I would need is to see voltage without the bluetooth app
[2021-05-02T17:41:17] Unknown: From street
[2021-05-02T17:41:32] Unknown: About bump and holes
[2021-05-02T17:41:53] Happy Giraffe: Also would be cool to use the headlight space for something, propably a brighter 5v light maybe
[2021-05-02T17:42:03] Happy Giraffe: 👀
[2021-05-02T17:43:14] Unknown: Precious data we could use the data for bettering street conditions
[2021-05-02T17:44:42] Unknown: In my town the bike lanes are in horrible condition

[2021-05-02T17:45:49] Happy Giraffe: The beam pattern is a bit awkward
[2021-05-02T17:45:51] Artem Bulashev: I have been looking at this one. I’m worried it is is too directional
[2021-05-02T17:46:27] Happy Giraffe: Best is LED with a mirror, no light gets wasted on trees or blinding the people in front of you

[2021-05-02T17:47:04] Artem Bulashev: I’m considering this - small, good light pattern it seems, good enough power
[2021-05-02T17:47:21] Artem Bulashev: And best all clean stealthy install
[2021-05-02T17:49:10] francois schempers: well just change the optique
[2021-05-02T17:49:42] Happy Giraffe: USB light like this would be best, mirror doesnt blind people. This one cell light doesnt have enough power tho lol
[2021-05-02T17:49:57] Happy Giraffe: Really hard to diy😅
[2021-05-02T17:51:03] Happy Giraffe: Im surprised nobody did mirror usb or 12v light

[2021-05-02T17:52:51] Artem Bulashev: Easier to change led for brighter one if needed In the one that I sent - it also doesn’t blind cars
[2021-05-02T17:52:57] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2021-05-02T17:53:09] Happy Giraffe: But this one blinds people
[2021-05-02T17:53:29] Artem Bulashev: But will blind because no mirror
[2021-05-02T17:53:38] Happy Giraffe: Yep haha
[2021-05-02T17:54:43] Happy Giraffe: This looks good but need more pictures of the beam pattern

[2021-05-02T20:22:37] francois schempers: what happened ? to hight firmware ?
[2021-05-02T20:23:00] Luis Magalhaes: oh the pictures in the russion vesc channel ?
[2021-05-02T20:23:09] francois schempers: yes xD
[2021-05-02T20:23:24] Luis Magalhaes: yeah did not see the name 😅🤣
[2021-05-02T20:23:27] Luis Magalhaes: nice nice
[2021-05-02T20:23:28] francois schempers: <video_file>
[2021-05-02T20:24:45] Luis Magalhaes: i was only configurating motor's in the motor wizard, it was not running normal that time, and earlier it stop working when it was upgrading firmware in vesc tools,
[2021-05-02T20:25:49] Luis Magalhaes: in the motor wizard the B side was not running normal and then it shut off, then i did not know what's wrong and unplug the battery
[2021-05-02T20:26:06] Luis Magalhaes: when i plug it in again it start in flames 😅
[2021-05-02T20:27:26] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-05-02T20:27:33] Artem Bulashev: Defect it seems
[2021-05-02T20:28:03] Artem Bulashev: They replace controller for you?
[2021-05-02T20:48:11] Luis Magalhaes: nice, what specs you have there? i have a friend here in portugal with a m365 22s battery 50A lolol
[2021-05-02T20:49:12] Luis Magalhaes: yes they said just to wait 1 or 2 weeks to have stock in europe and they will send me a new one
[2021-05-02T20:49:41] Luis Magalhaes: they also asked about my battery and motor specs to test it at my specs
[2021-05-02T20:49:49] Artem Bulashev: That is the same with my order :) ordered in 31st before price went up
[2021-05-02T20:50:10] Luis Magalhaes: but the way it burn in the air was not normal lolol
[2021-05-02T20:50:36] Artem Bulashev: Probably short circuit defect
[2021-05-02T20:50:47] Artem Bulashev: Component over heat and melt solder
[2021-05-02T20:50:58] Artem Bulashev: Than move and short circuit something else
[2021-05-02T20:51:07] Luis Magalhaes: yes, the electronic components are getting expensive
[2021-05-02T20:51:24] Luis Magalhaes: same with the battery cell's
[2021-05-02T20:51:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 250$ was amazing for dual
[2021-05-02T20:51:32] Artem Bulashev: Now 299
[2021-05-02T20:51:46] Artem Bulashev: So 150$ per motor, still good
[2021-05-02T20:52:02] Artem Bulashev: Just not amazing price any more :)
[2021-05-02T20:52:48] Luis Magalhaes: yes it looks like it, i think the B side mosfets overheat the board and the battery + wire moved 😅
[2021-05-02T20:52:50] Artem Bulashev: But other brands will also increase and thus price differences will become again large
[2021-05-02T20:53:01] Artem Bulashev: 🙈
[2021-05-02T20:53:12] Artem Bulashev: Shit happens 1/500 is very good
[2021-05-02T20:53:39] Luis Magalhaes: yes, it was a great price seeing the rest of the similar vesc
[2021-05-02T20:54:24] Luis Magalhaes: yup, my friends say im crazy to test it again 🤣
[2021-05-02T20:54:37] Luis Magalhaes: say i want to burn my house down 😅
[2021-05-02T20:55:20] Luis Magalhaes: I'm already at a loss, new bms and 3 cells 😅
[2021-05-02T20:56:03] Luis Magalhaes: hope to see it runing good next time
[2021-05-02T20:56:50] Luis Magalhaes: @francois_schempers did your ubox come with the 5.1 version too? you had to upgrade it in vesc tools?
[2021-05-02T21:07:45] Artem Bulashev: What I find strange is that 3 cells burned inside out and BMS also
[2021-05-02T21:07:48] Artem Bulashev: Seems strange
[2021-05-02T21:08:13] Artem Bulashev: As if fire got started from over charging those cells
[2021-05-02T21:11:35] Luis Magalhaes: only 1 had really fire, it looks like it overheated by the amps of the short circuit and melt the top isolation of the cell, then it shot circuit that cell till getting a litle flame
[2021-05-02T21:11:49] Luis Magalhaes: i change the other 2 cells just as precaucion
[2021-05-02T21:12:00] Luis Magalhaes: precaution
[2021-05-02T21:21:19] francois schempers: i left the firmware as is, dont know witch one it was, but i have all the features I want, so no need to upgrade ^^
[2021-05-02T21:21:56] francois schempers: I was at 15s8p but I burned my 2s extension x) so now I'm at 13s8p (the video is 13s perf)
[2021-05-02T21:22:36] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I’m also not sure why would you flash it :) 110amps from battery and 110-130 phase current and 160 Absolute current is enough to burn down 1400w motor
[2021-05-02T21:22:41] francois schempers: next thing to buy for me, in autome is a 15s6p of samsung 40T with 150A bms ^^
[2021-05-02T21:23:21] Artem Bulashev: Wait till Samsung 50s come out - will be performance of 40t but with 5000mah even under 1-2C load
[2021-05-02T21:24:45] francois schempers: hum interesting, I will see what's available around october ;)
[2021-05-02T21:24:54] Artem Bulashev: Should be by than
[2021-05-02T21:25:31] Luis Magalhaes: 👍 ok
[2021-05-02T21:25:44] francois schempers: maybe the new tesla tabless cell could be interesting to
[2021-05-02T21:25:52] Artem Bulashev: Planning to sell my stock 52v13ah though asap, will need something more capable
[2021-05-02T21:26:03] Artem Bulashev: Not at all, low current applicatio.
[2021-05-02T21:26:31] Artem Bulashev: Oh wait
[2021-05-02T21:26:34] Artem Bulashev: Which once ?
[2021-05-02T21:26:40] Artem Bulashev: 4860?
[2021-05-02T21:26:40] Luis Magalhaes: Yup its enough to me too 🤣 i upgrade it because vesc tools was not letting me do the wizard
[2021-05-02T21:26:42] francois schempers: you sure about that ? they have 10x less internal resistance, so no heat generated
[2021-05-02T21:27:16] Artem Bulashev: I see :) yeah there was some thing wrong for sure
[2021-05-02T21:27:52] francois schempers: yes
[2021-05-02T21:28:11] Artem Bulashev: I have not seen test reports about those yet
[2021-05-02T21:28:31] Luis Magalhaes: Dam hope next time it works, for now i have to ride my shunted minimotors 😅

[2021-05-02T21:29:30] Unknown: I'm seeing it
[2021-05-02T21:29:35] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-05-02T21:29:43] Artem Bulashev: You will Like what you see
[2021-05-02T21:29:57] Unknown: I really like it already...
[2021-05-02T21:31:07] francois schempers: they aren't out, but apparently, since they heat up so much less they are capable of lipo Amps range
[2021-05-02T21:32:01] francois schempers: and a 8cm cell, could fit just fine with a deck extension, I could fit a few of those, we will see once they are tested and available to buy ;)
[2021-05-02T22:03:18] Luis Magalhaes: Should be expensive too no? 😁
[2021-05-02T22:05:48] Luis Magalhaes: Looks good to me👌👌
[2021-05-02T23:27:16] Artem Bulashev: 8cm?
[2021-05-02T23:57:58] Happy Giraffe: Your soul will thank you for this without proper protection gear😂
[2021-05-02T23:58:32] Happy Giraffe: That fits inside pro?
[2021-05-02T23:58:55] Happy Giraffe: Oh damn, that's juicy
[2021-05-03T00:04:08] Artem Bulashev: https://www.lupine-shop.com/en/detail/index/sArticle/1874 Best lamp if money is not the issue 😅

[2021-05-03T00:06:05] Happy Giraffe: I buy vesc, motor and other stuff for that money haha
[2021-05-03T00:06:13] Artem Bulashev: Yeah :))
[2021-05-03T00:06:57] Happy Giraffe: I am amazed how hard it is to make a USB or 12v light with mirror and no battery
[2021-05-03T00:08:09] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-05-03T00:08:32] Luis Magalhaes: thats too much
[2021-05-03T00:08:56] Luis Magalhaes: i like my stock wolf light
[2021-05-03T00:09:05] Luis Magalhaes: is cheaper...🤣
[2021-05-03T00:09:24] Happy Giraffe: Me with Xiaomi light, yeah...its weak but still blinds people😂
[2021-05-03T00:09:52] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-03T00:10:33] Luis Magalhaes: i had one too, when i use it to go to work and it was night i use my smartphone light too 🤣
[2021-05-03T21:52:39] Happy Giraffe: M365 Guard https://m365guard.io/
[2021-05-03T21:52:45] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if this works with Vesc
[2021-05-03T21:54:51] francois schempers: look like it's not connected to the esc but you your phone, so it should be ^^
[2021-05-03T21:57:24] Happy Giraffe: Hmmmmmm
[2021-05-04T00:10:05] Happy Giraffe: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1elSP6trYg8
[2021-05-04T00:23:16] Artem Bulashev: Yeah saw that
[2021-05-04T00:23:18] Artem Bulashev: Neat
[2021-05-04T00:23:49] Artem Bulashev: On a small side though
[2021-05-04T00:24:13] Artem Bulashev: But could be hidden Into classic eye3 display for sleeper
[2021-05-04T00:30:31] Happy Giraffe: I would only need voltage and sometimes speed, could be in my pocket haha
[2021-05-04T03:00:48] Artem Bulashev: https://www.instagram.com/p/COGeW24r9jU/
[2021-05-04T03:01:37] Artem Bulashev: an other candidate for VESC dispaly for ZERO / VSETT / KAboo scooters with Eye3 like displays
[2021-05-04T03:01:48] Artem Bulashev: for stealthy instal 🙂
[2021-05-04T03:05:32] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_60@04-05-2021_03-05-32.jpg>
[2021-05-04T07:33:54] francois schempers: on my side iv just gave up on a neat screen and ordered a phone holder x)
[2021-05-04T09:17:42] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-05-04T10:06:35] Unknown: 😳😳🙈🙈🙈
[2021-05-04T12:48:24] Babubi: 😂
[2021-05-04T12:58:45] Unknown: Send the stuff to me please, I buy your try stuff
[2021-05-04T12:59:15] Unknown: @artBula for what the Relais...??????
[2021-05-04T12:59:25] Artem Bulashev: Lol that hard ?))
[2021-05-04T13:00:29] Artem Bulashev: Relay is what let’s line open or close up on signal detection on signal input
[2021-05-04T13:01:07] Artem Bulashev: For example you give 5v signal, only 0.1 amp and it will open gate for 60v 30amps to flow
[2021-05-04T13:01:43] Unknown: I work every day with big Relais every day
[2021-05-04T13:01:56] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2021-05-04T13:01:57] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2021-05-04T13:02:19] Unknown: I don't know if this is the way...
[2021-05-04T13:07:59] Unknown: And round displays only on watches...sorry..
[2021-05-04T13:09:28] Artem Bulashev: This is just example of the screen shape with tiny ESP32 that would fit into ZERO/ vsett / mantis and many many other eye3 displays to look like non modified scooters - if police suspect manipulations they take scooter for technical inspection
[2021-05-04T13:10:22] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_61@04-05-2021_13-10-22.jpg>
[2021-05-04T13:16:48] Unknown: My scoots are blinking signs that's said " I'm tuned to Hell" stealth is over for me....
[2021-05-04T13:17:00] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2021-05-04T13:21:00] Unknown: If the German police Sees something like that on german streets, they confiscated it in 5 min.
[2021-05-04T13:21:33] Unknown: For german standard this is not stealth...
[2021-05-04T13:25:11] francois schempers: and mine ? ^^
[2021-05-04T13:25:31] Artem Bulashev: Like what ?
[2021-05-04T13:25:33] francois schempers: i dont have anything ^^
[2021-05-04T13:25:58] Artem Bulashev: This is one scooter. It can have 500w limit easy and be legal
[2021-05-04T13:26:39] francois schempers: yeah but for technical inspection, they dont care about software limit
[2021-05-04T13:26:42] Artem Bulashev: For example my vsett9
[2021-05-04T13:26:46] Artem Bulashev: Came with such
[2021-05-04T13:26:55] Artem Bulashev: And it is 500w motor engraved
[2021-05-04T13:27:06] Artem Bulashev: 500w 25kmh plate on it
[2021-05-04T13:27:17] Artem Bulashev: And purchase documents say 25kmh 500w scooter
[2021-05-04T13:27:44] Artem Bulashev: So I showed all of that to police and they agreed it’s ok, without even testing it
[2021-05-04T13:28:07] francois schempers: but then they presente you the speedometer they use to see that you went 40km/h and take it anyway x)
[2021-05-04T13:28:11] Artem Bulashev: I just spinner the wheel in the air on speed 3 and it showed 26kmh
[2021-05-04T13:28:25] Artem Bulashev: It was speed limited via remote control
[2021-05-04T13:28:28] Artem Bulashev: ;-)
[2021-05-04T13:29:06] francois schempers: in france they stop you with proof, if your stopped, your fucked, they don't even test the scooter
[2021-05-04T13:29:33] Artem Bulashev: Yeah if they measured you going over speed limit than sure
[2021-05-04T13:29:42] Artem Bulashev: https://youtu.be/RKc69LQk__0
[2021-05-04T13:30:09] Artem Bulashev: Small relay with remote to close contact on power/speed limiting wire
[2021-05-04T13:31:41] francois schempers: I just use two profiles, one that work until restart that is max, and the default is 25, so if I'm stop I just power down the scooter like in good faith that I'm not going anywhere, and when it is powered up again, it take the default profile
[2021-05-04T13:33:24] Artem Bulashev: That can work if there is no mode switch on steering - otherwise mode switch input would need to be disabled (which Is again easy to implement)
[2021-05-04T13:33:41] Artem Bulashev: I like to have physical buttons
[2021-05-04T13:34:03] francois schempers: no mode switch on mine, I just have power on/off
[2021-05-04T13:40:44] Artem Bulashev: Mode one 6km, mode 2 25kmh, mode 3 unlimited :) than up on esp32 receiving l’on command (5 times break press in 6sec) it will reconfigure it to: - mode low = set mode 1 (6kmh, 500w) - mode high = set mode 2 (25kmh, 500w) When not limited will be - mode low = set to mode 2 (25kmh) - mode high = set to mode 3 (unlimited) This way police will see that there is factory screen and there is mode switch, and will not see you go into your phone or pocket. They will have no reason to suspect, if they do they can test it and you will be ok again. At least that’s what I will try to archive
[2021-05-04T13:43:54] Happy Giraffe: I would love to have a button for 2000w 50kmh and 600w 20kmh😂😂😂
[2021-05-04T13:44:07] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-05-04T13:44:23] Artem Bulashev: That’s the plan which is why I need vesc programmability
[2021-05-04T13:44:49] Artem Bulashev: Point is police does expect to see multiple modes.
[2021-05-04T13:44:58] Artem Bulashev: With a switch in my opinion
[2021-05-04T13:45:12] Artem Bulashev: Which is why I intend to do it as described above
[2021-05-04T13:46:40] Happy Giraffe: Sounds great😉
[2021-05-04T14:00:10] Babubi: I also implemented this on my e-bike using radio relays. 1. Button 50% Speed ​​Limit. (in Germany only 25km / h, speed limit in controller 50km / h standard.) 2. Button switches off the throttle because it is illegal to use hand throttle in DE.
[2021-05-04T14:00:40] Happy Giraffe: That's cool!
[2021-05-04T14:01:33] Babubi: <photos/photo_62@04-05-2021_14-01-33.jpg>
[2021-05-04T14:02:18] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2021-05-04T14:03:17] Artem Bulashev: 👌 yeah vesc doesn’t have such input for limit mode. So need other solution on external MCU and uart communication to reconfigure VESC up on a signal
[2021-05-04T14:53:51] Luis Magalhaes: The profile modes can't do that?
[2021-05-04T14:54:29] Luis Magalhaes: I have a relay i was going to mount on my minimotors setup but didn't mount it and now going to ubox
[2021-05-04T14:55:11] Artem Bulashev: You can configure max power and rpm (speed) per profile yes
[2021-05-04T14:55:32] Luis Magalhaes: But here in Portugal the law is changing but no one is over the electric vehicle right now, if you dont speed in front of them your ok
[2021-05-04T14:55:50] Artem Bulashev: That’s great 😀
[2021-05-04T14:55:55] Luis Magalhaes: And can use that mode until reset (off)
[2021-05-04T14:56:43] Luis Magalhaes: Is this what you use ?
[2021-05-04T14:56:58] Artem Bulashev: Yeah if police is easy going in your country I guess it is enough 👍
[2021-05-05T16:42:03] Happy Giraffe: https://massivestator.com/products/focbox-unity-dual-motor-controller

[2021-05-05T16:42:32] Happy Giraffe: Saw on pirates video
[2021-05-05T16:44:49] Luis Magalhaes: $239.00
[2021-05-05T16:44:55] Luis Magalhaes: Its cheaper now
[2021-05-05T16:44:56] Happy Giraffe: 60v tho
[2021-05-05T16:46:07] Luis Magalhaes: Yup but 300A looks like
[2021-05-05T16:46:33] Happy Giraffe: 13s Li-ion seems to be too much😔
[2021-05-05T16:46:37] Luis Magalhaes: They put it cheaper maybe because spintend was seeling more 😂
[2021-05-05T16:46:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-05-05T16:47:16] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, for me it was not enough, my setup is 16S
[2021-05-05T16:48:17] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2021-05-05T16:48:40] francois schempers: looks like a toy x)
[2021-05-05T16:48:59] Happy Giraffe: 🔞toy
[2021-05-05T16:49:01] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-05-05T16:49:16] Happy Giraffe: But nice additional heatsink 👀
[2021-05-05T16:50:31] Luis Magalhaes: They say it was good, but only 60v max
[2021-05-05T16:52:55] Artem Bulashev: This one only stable up to 12s, can’t recommend higher.
[2021-05-05T16:53:15] Artem Bulashev: My set up also 14s minimum, 16s usually ideal
[2021-05-05T16:55:37] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, maybe I go with the same what Francois bought. Should not melt with 80A total haha
[2021-05-05T16:57:23] francois schempers: plus I can help you install it, since I did it successfully
[2021-05-05T16:58:10] Happy Giraffe: Thanks, It will have to wait after summer😉
[2021-05-05T17:00:03] Artem Bulashev: Which one you bought?
[2021-05-05T17:02:53] francois schempers: https://spintend.com/products/75v-200a-dual-motor-controller-ubox-based-on-vesc
[2021-05-05T17:04:29] Artem Bulashev: Ubox
[2021-05-05T17:04:32] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-05T17:04:36] Artem Bulashev: Same here 🙋‍♂️
[2021-05-05T17:04:41] Artem Bulashev: Best of all worlds
[2021-05-05T17:06:41] Happy Giraffe: That 12v will be nice for a horn. I can fuk with the cars brakechecking me
[2021-05-05T17:27:21] Luis Magalhaes: My burn in the test 🤣🤣
[2021-05-05T17:28:41] Luis Magalhaes: But mine had a problem 😂
[2021-05-05T17:31:33] Happy Giraffe: Wow, I better change my punctured tire now or theres a 6km walking problem😂
[2021-05-05T20:07:12] Artem Bulashev: Smart Display They also have smart controller, which can integrate into zero/vesc/eye3 and other controllers https://github.com/Koxx3/SmartController_SmartDisplay_ESP32

[2021-05-05T20:59:14] francois schempers: I know ;)
[2021-05-05T20:59:25] francois schempers: I'm in there dev telegram group ^^
[2021-05-05T21:00:06] Luis Magalhaes: Nice
[2021-05-05T21:00:19] Luis Magalhaes: Did not know it could be set to vesc
[2021-05-05T21:00:42] Luis Magalhaes: I see it can be used in the eye minimotors
[2021-05-06T01:21:34] Artem Bulashev: Yeah, what most interesting to me is - it has eye3/zero screen protocol cracked - it has vesc protocol working = so it should be possible to use eye3 on vesc with that « SmartController » transcoding signal between them 🙃🙃 And creater already confirmed that to me, but it’s not his objective for now because of his SmartDisplay 🤷‍♂️🙃
[2021-05-06T01:22:46] Luis Magalhaes: Nice, it would be great to use eye with the ubox 😁
[2021-05-06T01:23:15] Luis Magalhaes: Just to see the usual things we see in eye like speed battery and distance
[2021-05-06T01:24:30] Luis Magalhaes: I always ride with my phone in the hadlebar holder so thats not a problem
[2021-05-06T01:33:25] Artem Bulashev: https://www.facebook.com/groups/zero.vsett.fr/permalink/2733704310267449/ This is the post, in comments he said that vesc+eye hw is ready but not coded - if more people would ask may be he would be in for it eventually ;-)
[2021-05-09T20:58:22] Unknown: Anyone have flipsky 7550? 😁
[2021-05-09T22:10:14] Luis Magalhaes: not me
[2021-05-09T22:10:45] Luis Magalhaes: spintend is sending me the new ubox today 😁
[2021-05-09T22:11:00] Luis Magalhaes: lets see if this time i can test it on road 🤣🤣

[2021-05-11T06:28:43] francois schempers: you should rather change the breaking and regen in the current section ;)
[2021-05-11T09:40:24] Luis Magalhaes: I think thats only a limiter for power, but if you adjust the amps section of the motor it would be better, @francois_schempers its that what your thinking?
[2021-05-11T09:47:33] Artem Bulashev: Any one in eu needs Samsung 35e?

[2021-05-11T11:20:00] Unknown: Yup 20700
[2021-05-11T11:20:27] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-05-11T11:20:31] Artem Bulashev: It’s 3.5ah
[2021-05-11T11:20:33] Artem Bulashev: 20700
[2021-05-11T11:20:38] Artem Bulashev: Low capacity
[2021-05-11T11:20:56] Artem Bulashev: Under 10amp laid load gives 9.8wh only
[2021-05-11T11:20:57] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-05-11T11:21:11] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_71@11-05-2021_11-21-11.jpg>
[2021-05-11T11:21:55] Artem Bulashev: 35e and Sanyo ga 18650 give 9.3-9.4wh down to 3v! (Not full discharge) Edit this one gave 9.8 down to 3.2v so still better off with 18650
[2021-05-11T11:22:15] Unknown: That's sanyo GA
[2021-05-11T11:22:23] Unknown: Ohh
[2021-05-11T11:23:16] Artem Bulashev: Well
[2021-05-11T11:23:22] Artem Bulashev: It’s more for high load
[2021-05-11T11:23:58] Artem Bulashev: It can give 20 amps very well with 8.5wh that’s pretty good I think fro 3.5ah battery , but it is huge 20700
[2021-05-11T11:24:35] Unknown: This page is nice, just looked through
[2021-05-11T12:23:35] francois schempers: yes
[2021-05-11T12:25:00] francois schempers: sanyo is a known brand in the cell industries
[2021-05-11T12:33:00] Artem Bulashev: I love 18650ga one of best cells
[2021-05-11T12:37:17] Unknown: What I use for my 12s9p scooter hehe, they deliver well with decent vdrop
[2021-05-11T12:39:24] Artem Bulashev: Vtc6 best for higher load than 7amps 10amps short term (use it for 10amp - 15amp short term application) Sanyo Ga is second best for mid load 7a constant max and 10amps short term max My application is 16s 7p = so at 3amps that would give 21amp at 60v = 1250w (that like cruising 40kmh. So for long lower load 35e wins some what) Both ga and 35e are best choices in low mid rage load. Once you get into 15amp range even for a bit vtc6 dominates
[2021-05-11T12:41:38] Unknown: The GA do perform well
[2021-05-11T12:41:45] Unknown: Need to try other cells and see maybe
[2021-05-11T12:42:10] Unknown: I'm planning on buying faulty clone m365 packs from a shop £10 a pack👀
[2021-05-11T12:42:16] Unknown: Faulty m365 ESC.. £5
[2021-05-11T12:42:24] Unknown: Faulty 250-300w motor, £10 👀
[2021-05-11T12:42:27] Artem Bulashev: Yeah because you have 9p that’s a lot of amps :) 9*7amps*12*3.75= 2835w in nominal voltage without heating up much
[2021-05-11T12:42:41] Unknown: Oh yah easyy power for scooter
[2021-05-11T12:42:52] Unknown: On ebike 50-60A gets it warmm
[2021-05-11T12:43:32] Unknown: Will make a 3s9p extension or higher voltage, attach to 12s9p👀 make AWD scooter with 300w motors
[2021-05-11T12:43:34] Artem Bulashev: It should get to about 60c at that 7amp load
[2021-05-11T12:43:47] Unknown: That's pretty high
[2021-05-11T12:43:48] Artem Bulashev: 40c above ambient
[2021-05-11T12:43:52] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-11T12:44:03] Unknown: It was probably about 40-50 under 60ish A
[2021-05-11T12:44:09] Unknown: To hand it was warm
[2021-05-11T12:44:18] Unknown: To my cold hand it was feeling very warm
[2021-05-11T12:44:19] Artem Bulashev: So that’s normal
[2021-05-11T12:44:37] Unknown: Hot even but my hand was cold af to cheek it was just warm
[2021-05-11T12:44:54] Artem Bulashev: Thermally of course VCT6 wins those.
[2021-05-11T12:44:55] Unknown: Gonna use clone cells and make a 3s extension for AWD I wonder how 300w motors will perform
[2021-05-11T12:45:54] Artem Bulashev: To get more from 300w motor you need to increase voltage because it is mainly limited by amps it can take
[2021-05-11T12:45:59] Unknown: If I make 3sxp out of clone cells... To match my sanyo GA 9P.. u think I should
[2021-05-11T12:46:01] Unknown: Oh yah
[2021-05-11T12:46:04] Unknown: 12s+3s
[2021-05-11T12:46:06] Unknown: 15s baby
[2021-05-11T12:46:20] Unknown: Ok 350w I use 32A@12s
[2021-05-11T12:46:20] Artem Bulashev: Don’t start form 0kmh
[2021-05-11T12:46:29] Unknown: Nop 1kmh
[2021-05-11T12:46:59] Unknown: Phases make vibrations when tryna start from stop on ebike
[2021-05-11T12:47:09] Unknown: So I push off on my vehicles before throttle
[2021-05-11T12:49:09] Artem Bulashev: Because controller work this way: the less rpm the less voltage on wheel and more Amps. As rpm increases voltage goes up and amps needed go down By increasing voltage you will not make 0-5kmh acceleration faster at all, but voltage increasing rate on the wheel will become faster so you will start to fill difference in acceleration 5-20kmh and really feel difference 20 to max speed Also max speed usually increases by about 2.5kmh per series (so you can expect + 7.5kmh from that mod)
[2021-05-11T12:49:56] Unknown: Oh yah I get about 40-50kmh on 12s9p currently
[2021-05-11T12:50:05] Unknown: Highest GPS/app was 53? I think
[2021-05-11T12:50:06] Unknown: Downhill
[2021-05-11T12:50:09] Unknown: On full charge
[2021-05-11T12:50:18] Artem Bulashev: That’s probably on sensorless motor or poor controller set up. It is not recommended to apply power at 0kmh because basically motor gets like 10v only and huge amount of amps)
[2021-05-11T12:50:39] Unknown: Interesting, learnt something new
[2021-05-11T12:50:51] Unknown: Made sense that voltage and amps increases and decreases accordingly
[2021-05-11T12:51:06] Unknown: But didn't know that on slower rpm less voltage is applied and more A then slowly more voltage
[2021-05-11T12:51:17] Artem Bulashev: That’s fast for 12s :-) what set up is that?
[2021-05-11T12:51:46] Unknown: 12s9p sanyo GA, 350w motor, 70kg load
[2021-05-11T12:51:52] Artem Bulashev: Than More voltage ;-) not to confuse people that read it after
[2021-05-11T12:52:12] Unknown: Oops yes
[2021-05-11T12:52:14] Artem Bulashev: 350w single motor going 40-50kmh on 12s?? 10 inch wheel?
[2021-05-11T12:52:24] Unknown: 10" tyres yes
[2021-05-11T12:52:28] Artem Bulashev: Wow
[2021-05-11T12:52:31] Unknown: I for some reason fly on it
[2021-05-11T12:52:36] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-05-11T12:52:39] Unknown: 44kmh easy constant
[2021-05-11T12:52:42] Artem Bulashev: That’s with vesc?
[2021-05-11T12:52:42] Unknown: Easy..
[2021-05-11T12:52:45] Unknown: No
[2021-05-11T12:52:48] Unknown: 365 ESC
[2021-05-11T12:52:50] Unknown: Upgraded
[2021-05-11T12:52:54] Artem Bulashev: 🙈🙈🙈
[2021-05-11T12:53:03] Artem Bulashev: Those controllers don’t stop surprising me
[2021-05-11T12:53:06] Unknown: Downhill I fly.
[2021-05-11T12:53:18] Unknown: On flat is 44-48 constant
[2021-05-11T12:53:27] Unknown: The downhill... Scary speeds 😭😭😂😂😂
[2021-05-11T12:53:34] Artem Bulashev: Not many 13-14s scooters can get 45kmh from factory
[2021-05-11T12:53:40] Artem Bulashev: How many amps you are pushing ?
[2021-05-11T12:53:45] Unknown: 32.5
[2021-05-11T12:53:47] Artem Bulashev: 30-35?
[2021-05-11T12:53:49] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-05-11T12:53:50] Artem Bulashev: Close
[2021-05-11T12:53:50] Unknown: Max xiaogen amps
[2021-05-11T12:53:52] Unknown: Yah
[2021-05-11T12:53:54] Artem Bulashev: Makes sense
[2021-05-11T12:54:14] Artem Bulashev: Thanks for info :)
[2021-05-11T12:54:29] Unknown: Motor gets toasty some days tho
[2021-05-11T12:54:33] Unknown: Prettyyy toasty
[2021-05-11T12:54:51] Unknown: I think if I do this 3s extension + AWD ... It'll be amazing.
[2021-05-11T12:54:54] Artem Bulashev: You may want to dial it down abit after increasing voltage to 15s :)
[2021-05-11T12:55:00] Unknown: My battery can handle it for sure
[2021-05-11T12:55:09] Unknown: Yeahh maybe 25 but I'll still test 32
[2021-05-11T12:55:11] Artem Bulashev: Yeah no question there
[2021-05-11T12:55:13] Unknown: To see shear force
[2021-05-11T12:55:25] Unknown: But poor 300w
[2021-05-11T12:55:26] Unknown: 😂😂😂😂
[2021-05-11T12:55:41] Unknown: End of the day I'm paying £10 a motor and battery so fuck it I'll experiment
[2021-05-11T12:55:50] Unknown: Maybe I can even research how to do delta and try 🤷🏽‍♂️
[2021-05-11T12:56:38] Artem Bulashev: 15s 26amp would = to your current max Watt at 12s 32.5a
[2021-05-11T12:56:47] Unknown: XD
[2021-05-11T12:56:48] Artem Bulashev: So yeah go for like 28amp ;-)
[2021-05-11T12:56:56] Artem Bulashev: Coller electronics
[2021-05-11T12:57:00] Unknown: That would be more efficient too no? Battery would drain slower 🧐
[2021-05-11T12:57:01] Artem Bulashev: And a lot more power
[2021-05-11T12:57:26] Unknown: Same capacity, less amps, higher voltage
[2021-05-11T12:58:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 28amp would give you 112w extra
[2021-05-11T12:58:41] Artem Bulashev: While all temps will be lower
[2021-05-11T12:58:49] Unknown: I'll be going faster
[2021-05-11T12:58:49] Unknown: Hehe
[2021-05-11T12:59:01] Unknown: Yeah I learnt that 12s high current isn't that good lol
[2021-05-11T12:59:12] Unknown: I'm sad I got vesc limited to that but it's ok
[2021-05-11T12:59:26] Unknown: After ebike project is finished I'll sell it and make e dirt bike
[2021-05-11T12:59:30] Unknown: DIY surron 😂😂😂
[2021-05-11T12:59:41] Unknown: 20s, hundreds of A 😎😩
[2021-05-11T12:59:47] Artem Bulashev: Also that is 25% increase in Wh of the battery if you add 3s9p = 25% more rage almost should see
[2021-05-11T13:00:14] Unknown: That sounds gooodd
[2021-05-11T13:00:24] Unknown: I'm gonna look and see
[2021-05-11T13:00:26] Unknown: Cos
[2021-05-11T13:00:31] Unknown: If I can make my ESC for 20s
[2021-05-11T13:00:35] Artem Bulashev: Btw
[2021-05-11T13:00:40] Artem Bulashev: You have cells already ?
[2021-05-11T13:00:44] Unknown: Naw
[2021-05-11T13:00:49] Unknown: Gonna get the faulty clones
[2021-05-11T13:00:58] Artem Bulashev: 😀😀
[2021-05-11T13:01:03] Unknown: Why :p
[2021-05-11T13:02:37] Artem Bulashev: If I get 200 cells of 35e (which are very close to your Ga cells in specs) than I can get them at like 3.9€
[2021-05-11T13:02:41] Artem Bulashev: I need 112
[2021-05-11T13:02:45] Artem Bulashev: So yeah
[2021-05-11T13:02:54] Unknown: 3.9 😩
[2021-05-11T13:02:56] Unknown: So expensive man
[2021-05-11T13:02:59] Unknown: Fuck corona
[2021-05-11T13:08:11] Luis Magalhaes: I know one that was on 22S 50A 😂 that's a surprising controller, have other mosfets, 100v caps, traces of copper and some magic says the oner 😂😂
[2021-05-11T13:09:15] Luis Magalhaes: It was single motor and stock pro motor, he wanted to get a gmax motor
[2021-05-11T13:09:17] francois schempers: i have plans to make a 15s10p of sony murata vtc6 150A bms :3
[2021-05-11T13:11:35] Luis Magalhaes: Olha ai a 20s do jppl
[2021-05-11T13:11:56] Luis Magalhaes: Here is another friend but only 20S
[2021-05-11T13:52:48] Artem Bulashev: Haha have a guy in eu selling those 5.5€, Those cells are very expensive
[2021-05-11T15:00:05] francois schempers: yeah, but they are the best 18650 you can find current wise, they will be no Vdrop on this batterie ^^
[2021-05-11T15:00:59] francois schempers: 10p will do easily 300A current, so a puny 150A will make no Vdrop ;)
[2021-05-11T15:01:53] Artem Bulashev: Yeah vtc is nuts
[2021-05-11T15:02:04] Artem Bulashev: That’s why they tested so well ;-)
[2021-05-11T15:02:39] Artem Bulashev: I was only surprised to see them have less Wh at low current like 3amp than many other cells
[2021-05-11T15:02:54] Artem Bulashev: Typical for high current cells
[2021-05-11T15:03:35] Artem Bulashev: Lol never mind forgot they are 3000ah 😁😁😁
[2021-05-11T15:04:10] Artem Bulashev: And they deliver more than beat 3500 cells under 10amp load haha
[2021-05-11T18:35:29] Happy Giraffe: 50s pls
[2021-05-11T18:35:57] Happy Giraffe: When does Samsung release those?
[2021-05-11T20:49:28] Artem Bulashev: I wish I knew
[2021-05-11T20:49:42] Artem Bulashev: I have placed pre order on 150 of those
[2021-05-11T20:50:14] Artem Bulashev: A friend of mine in Russian Samsung distributor
[2021-05-11T20:50:15] Artem Bulashev: Will see
[2021-05-11T20:50:28] Artem Bulashev: But they have no eta
[2021-05-11T20:51:14] Artem Bulashev: it was mid April
[2021-05-11T20:51:30] Artem Bulashev: Now mid 2021 it says
[2021-05-11T20:52:21] Artem Bulashev: 21700 will be more cost effective than 18650 (should be at least) but power density is still less
[2021-05-14T16:46:18] Artem Bulashev: Guy need advice. In order to save hight, I arranged my parallel cells in the way that would not require any isolation top to bottom - only between series left to right 2 times and front to back 3-4 times. Also to lower height I spaced the cells 2mm away from each other, this why top cell drops in lower (cells size 18.4mm but total height 49.2 = 16.4mm per cell, so I saved 2mm*3=6mm total!! Should be 55.2mm. And there is still space between each cell 0.17mm My question, how do I weld series between each other in such configuration? 🤣 And are there any flaws in my build logic here that I missed?
[2021-05-14T18:39:47] Luis Magalhaes: https://youtu.be/ZWkagSLqOp8
[2021-05-14T18:40:03] Luis Magalhaes: Waiting yo see it roling 😂

[2021-05-14T20:49:32] Unknown: Design my own Flipsky 7550 housing 😅
[2021-05-14T22:11:33] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌
[2021-05-15T02:25:58] Unknown: I want to find this out too, But a theory from what I've seen If you were to spot weld them and then add fish paper and whatever Inbetween ,then proceed to fold the battery with the nickel plate It would work You get me?
[2021-05-15T02:26:29] Unknown: So like them up accordingly, spot weld with slightly longer nickel strip and then fold over
[2021-05-15T09:45:06] Artem Bulashev: Yes problem is 0.15mm 8mm wide strip can pass only about 6amps, so you need to have 3 layers and at least 3 lines going at the fold to really provide 54amps flow) Other option is to use a 54mm wide nickel plate (at 0.15mm thickness 54mm would provide 6.75 times the current of 8mm wide strip = 6.75*6 = 40.5amp, so than 0.3mm would provide 81amp well) This means you would fold it and apply it on the side with 3 cells in the row
[2021-05-15T09:48:31] Artem Bulashev: Kind of like this (cutting to shape one solid plate and folding it than at the line for series front to back) - no isolation need between folded nickel (the more contacts it makes to each other the shorter transfer will be= higher amp capacity, and less waste heat)
[2021-05-15T10:28:19] Unknown: What size pack is it?
[2021-05-15T10:28:25] Unknown: How many s how many p
[2021-05-15T10:28:36] Artem Bulashev: 16s7p
[2021-05-15T10:28:43] Unknown: 7p right
[2021-05-15T10:28:56] Unknown: How many A per cell
[2021-05-15T10:29:05] Artem Bulashev: Samsung 35e
[2021-05-15T10:29:05] Unknown: Wait nvm lol can calculate one sec
[2021-05-15T10:29:29] Artem Bulashev: So it can do 7amp without over heating and non stop
[2021-05-15T10:29:41] Artem Bulashev: 10amps it can do for few min without temp rise
[2021-05-15T10:29:44] Unknown: So u need 50A
[2021-05-15T10:29:51] Unknown: In 7p
[2021-05-15T10:30:01] Artem Bulashev: 15amp it can do for a minute without heating up too much
[2021-05-15T10:30:17] Unknown: That means you'll have 7.1A per row
[2021-05-15T10:30:29] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-05-15T10:30:35] Artem Bulashev: 7*7
[2021-05-15T10:30:42] Artem Bulashev: Nominal max
[2021-05-15T10:30:43] Unknown: Nickel plate speaking
[2021-05-15T10:31:03] Unknown: Ok let's say 7A from each cell
[2021-05-15T10:31:34] Artem Bulashev: Yes, but with such arrangement i can’t connect 7 strips - one from each cell. Best can do is 3 strips
[2021-05-15T10:31:46] Unknown: 3 strips for 7p
[2021-05-15T10:31:52] Unknown: Wait were not understanding eachother
[2021-05-15T10:31:53] Unknown: Haha
[2021-05-15T10:32:01] Unknown: Okay so between series connections
[2021-05-15T10:32:11] Unknown: If you have 7 strips total connecting each series group
[2021-05-15T10:32:15] Unknown: 2*8mm
[2021-05-15T10:32:15] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_76@15-05-2021_10-32-15.jpg>
[2021-05-15T10:32:21] Unknown: You should be 👌🏼
[2021-05-15T10:33:27] Unknown: If you have a 2*8mm nickel plate connected to every single cell to another cell it will be okay for 7A per cell
[2021-05-15T10:34:48] Unknown: This is for 2*7mm , 2*8mm you'll have room to play
[2021-05-15T10:34:59] Unknown: Double check with an expert!! But I'm sure it'll be ok

[2021-05-15T10:39:05] Artem Bulashev: 0.3*7 = 10amps I need 50amp minimum in optimal (so that it can take over load up to 70amp) 7*5 = 35mm /3 = 11.66mm So I need 0.3 x 11.66 in order for just 3 strips between series to handle 50amp constant and 70amps burst current without heating up (around optimal)
[2021-05-15T10:40:06] Unknown: I personally would recommend going back to the drawing board and making a way that u can have maximum strips between series
[2021-05-15T10:40:13] Unknown: 3 ... Idk it just will not be enough
[2021-05-15T10:41:41] Artem Bulashev: There is no other way to arrange those without requiring isolation top to bottom (which increases hight, my pack is 49mm, space is 50mm) - I did everything to reduce pack hight
[2021-05-15T10:42:15] Unknown: 7 strips of 2*8mm will give u what you need 100% , from there I am not an expert so I'd suggest asking in the group chat
[2021-05-15T10:43:32] Unknown: Only other thing I could say is to layer the strips however as u said the folding will cause a problem there
[2021-05-15T10:44:02] Unknown: Only other thing I can think of right now is using wire and soldering... But that's obviously a bad idea as we should avoid soldering on cells
[2021-05-15T10:44:40] Unknown: What are you planning on using this pack for :p
[2021-05-15T10:45:22] Artem Bulashev: Thanks though it did give me some. Clearity 0.3 by 35mm will carry al curent i need 👌👌 7pcs * 8mm = 56mm * 0.2 = 11.2mm2 3pcs * 12mm = 36mm * 0.3 = 10.8mm2 (but easier to use in my arrangement)
[2021-05-15T10:45:46] Artem Bulashev: No no never :))
[2021-05-15T10:45:55] Unknown: Can u even get 0.3*35mm strips😂😂😂
[2021-05-15T10:47:05] Artem Bulashev: I’m thinking of getting a full like 0.5m x 0.5m sheet and than cut out plates like I draw above (that’s about 0.3 x 45mm 👌😁😁)

[2021-05-15T16:02:31] Unknown: Dont know whats the problem with my flipsky 7550 controller.. In the air it works so good but then when i stand on it, it cutoff almost instant just a little bit of power :/ Anyone know whats wrong?
[2021-05-15T16:04:31] Unknown: Have u tested BMS?
[2021-05-15T16:04:41] Unknown: Maybe BMS cutoff current when ur standing on it
[2021-05-15T16:04:44] Unknown: That's what it sounds like
[2021-05-15T16:06:03] Unknown: How to test Bms? :)
[2021-05-15T16:08:03] Unknown: Well what BMS do u have
[2021-05-15T16:08:16] Unknown: First try another battery
[2021-05-15T16:08:18] Unknown: With controller
[2021-05-15T16:08:36] Unknown: By the sound of it, sounds like BMS cuts off power when ur on it

[2021-05-15T16:16:45] Unknown: Yes in air it works correct
[2021-05-15T16:18:47] Unknown: Try 30A battery current
[2021-05-15T16:18:51] Unknown: And ride it
[2021-05-15T16:20:43] Unknown: Now it dont even turn on
[2021-05-15T16:20:58] Unknown: Battery issue

[2021-05-15T16:30:01] Happy Giraffe: There will be a big vdrop. My 13s6p 35E on 40A drops 54->47v 😂
[2021-05-15T16:30:34] Happy Giraffe: And that's 6.6A per cell
[2021-05-15T16:34:38] Unknown: It dont work with 30A
[2021-05-15T16:35:05] Unknown: Still same in air works awesome, on Ground cutoff
[2021-05-15T16:36:43] Unknown: Wow...
[2021-05-15T16:36:57] Unknown: I'm gonna do a test today when I FINALLY GET MY BABY WORKING AGAIN

[2021-05-15T17:15:46] Luis Magalhaes: Did you try pushing it first before you throttle ?
[2021-05-15T17:16:44] Luis Magalhaes: Just to see if its not a amp spike thats trigger the bms cut
[2021-05-15T17:48:04] Unknown: Dont work what should i use here?
[2021-05-15T17:48:06] Unknown: <photos/photo_79@15-05-2021_17-48-06.jpg>
[2021-05-15T17:59:05] Luis Magalhaes: I think its ok on current no reverse adc, @francois_schempers can you help? 😜
[2021-05-15T17:59:58] Luis Magalhaes: But that looks like battery fault or bms, can you see what happens with the voltagem when you try do run it on the ground?
[2021-05-15T18:05:09] Unknown: I think it's BMS issue with BMS current cutoff limit
[2021-05-15T18:05:15] Unknown: Works in air,not on ground
[2021-05-15T18:05:18] Unknown: With load
[2021-05-15T18:05:28] Unknown: Air takes like 3A then 1 to maintain if that
[2021-05-15T18:06:13] Luis Magalhaes: Yes it looks like it
[2021-05-15T18:06:29] Luis Magalhaes: Did you use that battery before?

[2021-05-15T22:11:10] Artem Bulashev: It drops it yes but it still give more wh down to 3v than almost any other battery
[2021-05-15T22:11:34] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_83@15-05-2021_22-11-34.jpg>
[2021-05-15T22:12:26] Artem Bulashev: Nearly same Wh under load as Sanyo 18650GA :-)
[2021-05-15T22:15:00] Artem Bulashev: Drop of 7v on 13s = 0.538v per series Some what a lot I agree. Check your cells may be, will see soon ;-)
[2021-05-15T22:20:34] Happy Giraffe: I bought my battery from a good maker. I just think its the cells...50E should drop less. MJ1 was so bad 12s went same speed than 10s MH1 lmao
[2021-05-15T22:27:40] francois schempers: sony murata vtc6 :3 or samsung 40T and no more Vdrop ever ^^
[2021-05-15T22:43:45] Happy Giraffe: I have only 2 kidneys

[2021-05-16T01:05:01] Artem Bulashev: It is way below even optimal, which means should be hot
[2021-05-16T01:05:07] Artem Bulashev: Unless cells can’t handle
[2021-05-16T01:05:11] Artem Bulashev: What cell is that?

[2021-05-16T01:05:34] Unknown: Umm
[2021-05-16T01:05:39] Unknown: There's versions?
[2021-05-16T01:05:40] Artem Bulashev: 1 / 2 /3?
[2021-05-16T01:05:43] Artem Bulashev: Show me

[2021-05-16T01:06:57] Artem Bulashev: V1 was not as good
[2021-05-16T01:07:03] Artem Bulashev: V2 is much better
[2021-05-16T01:07:16] Artem Bulashev: V3 is almost same as v2 but slighy improved
[2021-05-16T01:07:28] Unknown: I never knew that, interestingg
[2021-05-16T01:07:33] Unknown: So what u think temps will be like

[2021-05-16T01:07:47] Unknown: Under 40-80A
[2021-05-16T01:07:53] Unknown: Yah I noticed hehe I looked straightway
[2021-05-16T01:19:13] Artem Bulashev: So
[2021-05-16T01:19:40] Artem Bulashev: At 5amp discharge it heats up about 0-20 degree above ambient
[2021-05-16T01:19:56] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_91@16-05-2021_01-19-56.jpg>
[2021-05-16T01:21:31] Artem Bulashev: At 10amps continuous it heats up about 40c above embient Max temp for them is 60c or so
[2021-05-16T01:21:45] Artem Bulashev: It is NOT high drain cell by any mean
[2021-05-16T01:23:34] Artem Bulashev: It can not give more than 10 amp And 10amp only for more than 15min or so without over heating in the pack I expect (out on open it can barely discharge fully at 10amp without over heating in the room 22c)
[2021-05-16T01:25:51] Artem Bulashev: For compare Samsung 50g (v2) can give full continuous 10amps without going above 30c temp increase And 15amp with 45c temp increase

[2021-05-16T01:34:41] Artem Bulashev: There is almost no 5000mah 21700 that can do 10amp cool enough to use in pack 50G is probably the only 5000mah cell there
[2021-05-16T01:36:15] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_94@16-05-2021_01-36-15.jpg>
[2021-05-16T01:38:07] Artem Bulashev: 50e 12.5 hotter (which is over 40% hotter)
[2021-05-16T01:40:29] Artem Bulashev: 40 constant it will do well . 60a long term like 15min it should do ok . 80amp for sort term like 1-2 min or should do ok 50G would be better, but we all have to work with what we got (would love VTC6, but hey, almost no gain over 35e and 2x times more expensive)
[2021-05-16T01:52:02] Happy Giraffe: 50S...

[2021-05-16T01:52:21] Happy Giraffe: I bet they become available 2027

[2021-05-16T02:01:00] Artem Bulashev: What to choose 18650 or 21700 comes down to space allocation - which ever one uses it more efficiently :) In my set up I got 16s 28ah with 18650 (80amp constant max possible with 1193wh at that load) Vs even 50g 21700 I could fit only 20amph (983wh at 10amp = 40total 🤣)
[2021-05-16T02:04:22] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_97@16-05-2021_02-04-22.jpg>
[2021-05-16T02:06:05] Artem Bulashev: Interestingly Samsung 48G actually gives out more Wh at 10amp load than 50e does (this website has tested 50e v1 only so your v2 can have much better results. Some say it is as almost as good as 50g!
[2021-05-16T02:14:03] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2021-05-16T02:14:46] Happy Giraffe: Vapcell T50 it is😂
[2021-05-16T03:12:38] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I know :) but price is unacceptable:))
[2021-05-16T03:13:22] Artem Bulashev: Also even that one is not always better fitment than 18650 :) really depends on space shape/dimensions
[2021-05-16T03:14:00] Artem Bulashev: Example where 21700 fit in the best 👌👌
[2021-05-16T03:14:00] Artem Bulashev: How about vsett10+ 40ah without need for spacer? 🔥🔥 😅😅 16s8p 5000mah set up will fit - controller would need to move only to make room for a small slim up front Best arrangement 2x4cells
[2021-05-16T03:14:58] Happy Giraffe: How much? 😂
[2021-05-16T03:15:10] Artem Bulashev: Moment
[2021-05-16T03:16:12] Artem Bulashev: T50 unit price is $6.5 for more than 100pcs, $6.35 for more than 1000pcs.
[2021-05-16T03:16:21] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2021-05-16T03:16:51] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that’s without delivery / tax / transaction fees
[2021-05-16T03:17:25] Artem Bulashev: Final would be about 7.8$ before tax
[2021-05-16T03:17:30] Happy Giraffe: 35A from that cell 😅
[2021-05-16T03:17:35] Artem Bulashev: 20
[2021-05-16T03:17:47] Artem Bulashev: Without cooling
[2021-05-16T03:17:59] Happy Giraffe: Aah yes, 20A continuous 👍
[2021-05-16T03:18:00] Artem Bulashev: Which you can’t have inside pack
[2021-05-16T03:18:14] Artem Bulashev: It can do 35amp continuous if there is cooling
[2021-05-16T03:18:22] Artem Bulashev: For example on Quad copter
[2021-05-16T03:18:26] Artem Bulashev: 4s1p / 6s1p pack or something
[2021-05-16T03:19:11] Happy Giraffe: Square shape in scooters so can't put any thermal pad in between effectively 🤔
[2021-05-16T03:19:38] Happy Giraffe: Would need to be laid down 1p at a time😂
[2021-05-16T03:20:46] Artem Bulashev: Problem is that surrounding cells will heat up, inside enclosure there is no airflow, so ambient temp for cells on outside of the pack will be 20c, but for cells in the middle of the pack it will be 50c
[2021-05-16T03:20:59] Artem Bulashev: Can’t cool cells in the middle
[2021-05-16T03:21:36] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, would need a giant flat surface and 1p at a time😂
[2021-05-16T03:54:14] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/Y8lYqoNxMgE
[2021-05-16T03:54:59] Happy Giraffe: Can these be used without phone?🤔 If police stops me I would love to limit it to 35kmh and slower accelration😂
[2021-05-16T04:04:19] Artem Bulashev: you can connect any kind of Pi0, ESP to VESC UART and than connect some of the buttons on steering whee, or even the break - and than tell Pi0/ESP32 to start sending command MODE1 every 50ms if break was perssed 5times in less than 6 sec - for example.
[2021-05-16T04:04:59] Happy Giraffe: That's too complicated for my poor brain
[2021-05-16T04:05:03] Artem Bulashev: 🙂
[2021-05-16T04:06:03] Artem Bulashev: I'm not aware of any easier method to Lock it in this mode - best would bee via phone over Bluetooth
[2021-05-16T04:06:23] Happy Giraffe: Then I need fast hands😂
[2021-05-16T04:06:29] Artem Bulashev: may be you can set up a quick automation task on the phone
[2021-05-16T04:06:42] Artem Bulashev: so that you click once on main screen and it does it
[2021-05-16T04:07:25] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, I know on windows you can set those but is there an Android app or something?
[2021-05-16T04:47:00] Happy Giraffe: Check out "MacroDroid - Device Automation" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlosoft.macrodroid
[2021-05-16T04:47:22] Happy Giraffe: Screen UI operations don't seem to work with this one
[2021-05-16T04:47:25] Unknown: Tasker
[2021-05-16T04:47:43] Unknown: You need to root
[2021-05-16T04:47:51] Happy Giraffe: Uff
[2021-05-16T04:48:33] Happy Giraffe: I rely on my quick hands I think😂
[2021-05-16T06:28:43] francois schempers: your not choosing the right cell then, do you calculs with sony murata vtc6 or samsung 40T you will get 150+Amps capability
[2021-05-16T11:50:11] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_99@16-05-2021_11-50-11.jpg>
[2021-05-16T11:56:11] francois schempers: this does not show Vdrop over current drawn, wich is a crucial info for scooter cells
[2021-05-16T11:58:59] Artem Bulashev: It is not wrong :-) I don’t need 40T or VTC6 because my most typical currents are: Around 3amps*8 24amps at 60v = 1440w And long term max 7amps*8=56amp And only for extremely short time my current will spike to 10amps (10sec) Now let’s see how cells compare At 3amp discharge down to 3v I get a lot more Wh from 35e than VTC6 (about 10%) At 7amp - which is not shown here (need to compare them manually. both of those give out equal amount of Wh - difference is in the curve (35e lower voltage but more Ah vs VTC higher voltage but shorter Ah discharge = work done Wh is same) On 10amp we get VTC as clear winner, getting 0.95Wh more than 35e - but remember this is very short term load for me because motor can’t handle 80amp for more than some seconds without heating up. = 35e will deliver more Wh over normal discharge 0-7 amps Than VTC6, because my load is not high enough to utilise VTC6 gains. VTC6 cost ALOT more than 35e, so no reason. I would lose about 10% range and would pay about 25% more for it with VTc6
[2021-05-16T11:59:15] Artem Bulashev: It does = Wh at target load, see what is said above 🙃
[2021-05-16T12:01:36] Artem Bulashev: Wh test = ah over V at every instance during discharge. In this case in edition we only look at it down to 3v - which is what scooters need. 👍but you know that , this is for other people that may read it later
[2021-05-16T12:02:53] Unknown: My sanyo GA had only 3vdrop on 12s4p doing 30A
[2021-05-16T12:02:55] Unknown: Nice
[2021-05-16T12:05:14] francois schempers: I don't understand your reasoning, at fixed amps only the Voltage differ from both cell, with vtc staying at higher V. thus higher Wh without cosing more heat, heat is cause by Amps, not Wattage, that's why power line are 100k+ volt, so they heat up less with lower amps, the same wattage at 200v would instantly vaporize the line. you will get more performance for less heat out of a cell that don't Vdrop for the same Amps
[2021-05-16T12:10:57] Artem Bulashev: Again there is no heat issue, because at amps I will be using my cell there is no heat issue with 35e 👌 Because I have LOW Amp load! 😁😁
[2021-05-16T12:11:14] francois schempers: ahh yes didn't read that part x)
[2021-05-16T12:11:21] Artem Bulashev: At low amp loads Vtc6 will deliver less Wh over discharge cycle
[2021-05-16T12:11:30] Artem Bulashev: My load is 3-7amps per cell
[2021-05-16T12:11:32] francois schempers: I used to see like 10V drop on 35E that's why xD
[2021-05-16T12:11:58] francois schempers: yeah 35E is perfect then
[2021-05-16T12:12:13] francois schempers: 50E even better is you can use 21 cell
[2021-05-16T12:12:19] Artem Bulashev: Yeah VTC6 would give less Wh, and would cost more
[2021-05-16T12:13:14] Artem Bulashev: 21700 doesn’t fit my space efficiently 50mm x 154mm x 400mm
[2021-05-16T12:13:49] Artem Bulashev: Max I can get is like 4p there with about 1cm of air above that I can’t fill in
[2021-05-16T12:14:51] Artem Bulashev: 18650 on other hand I can fit better 3 layers
[2021-05-16T12:15:12] francois schempers: 35E it is then x)
[2021-05-16T12:15:18] Artem Bulashev: (May need 2mm spacer)
[2021-05-16T16:58:31] Luis Magalhaes: Any one using Ant bms?
[2021-05-16T17:38:36] Artem Bulashev: Nope
[2021-05-16T17:38:40] Artem Bulashev: Waiting for:
[2021-05-16T17:39:21] Artem Bulashev: 1. FlexiBMS 18s lite in development - 26.5mm x 83mm 2. DieBieMS fork: - ENNOID 18s full BMS SS 180usd charge/discharge 60 x100mm (available) - ENNOID 18s BMS SS-Lite 170$ chargé only 60x65mm - ENNOID 18s X-LITE charge only 35mm x 85mm 3. Trampa 18s 36 x 130mm
[2021-05-16T17:54:02] Unknown: 32.5A draw from scoot, hopefully in the next 10 cycles the batteries balance out .. today is the first ride in a month 😩
[2021-05-16T18:34:07] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-05-16T19:15:30] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_100@16-05-2021_19-15-30.jpg>
[2021-05-16T19:15:39] Artem Bulashev: Sleepers become reality 🙃👌
[2021-05-16T19:21:48] Happy Giraffe: Sleeper gang👀
[2021-05-16T19:38:41] Luis Magalhaes: dam your's are more unballenced then mine, i was thinking it was because of the short circuit it made 😅🙈
[2021-05-16T19:42:33] Luis Magalhaes: nice
[2021-05-16T19:49:47] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_101@16-05-2021_19-49-47.jpg>
[2021-05-16T19:50:21] Luis Magalhaes: im trying to balance the group 1 and 16 😅
[2021-05-16T19:57:10] Unknown: My other battery is the same as this
[2021-05-16T19:58:25] Luis Magalhaes: i think the group 1 has less resistence and it go's up first
[2021-05-16T19:58:34] Luis Magalhaes: it has 3 new cell's 😅
[2021-05-16T20:01:30] Artem Bulashev: May be pack balancing lead is too long too small Awg.
[2021-05-16T20:04:31] Luis Magalhaes: i think it is the 3 new cell's... well lets see if it comes to balance in time lol
[2021-05-16T22:41:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hello !
[2021-05-16T22:41:36] Artem Bulashev: Hi man 🙃
[2021-05-16T22:41:50] Artem Bulashev: It’s me Artem, sent you the link on Facebook
[2021-05-16T22:41:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hehehe. it's my project 😉
[2021-05-16T22:42:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah, thanks !
[2021-05-16T22:42:16] Artem Bulashev: 🙂✅✅ beautiful one ;-)
[2021-05-16T22:42:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 9 months of hard work 🤪
[2021-05-16T22:42:54] Artem Bulashev: I bet!
[2021-05-16T22:43:06] Artem Bulashev: It’s not easy task to transcode systems
[2021-05-16T22:43:27] Artem Bulashev: Specially not open sourced once
[2021-05-16T22:43:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, but it's all the things around too. wifi, bluetooth, tft screen, storage... and all the electronic design
[2021-05-16T22:46:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: some pictures

[2021-05-16T22:48:59] Artem Bulashev: Amazing dude :) Screen looks fabulous for custom builds
[2021-05-16T22:49:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: still work in progress 😅😅
[2021-05-16T22:51:19] Artem Bulashev: Should add a RFID reader on the back of display for Alarm feuture! 😅😅😅
[2021-05-16T22:52:14] Artem Bulashev: Joking :) but would be cooool
[2021-05-16T22:52:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: rfid is a pain : can't pass metal, need an antenna design, more chips. and it's too easy to clone/bypass
[2021-05-16T22:54:12] Artem Bulashev: Does it have gyro?
[2021-05-16T22:55:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no
[2021-05-16T22:55:56] Artem Bulashev: Or I think vesc has gyro some times which may be can be utilized for Armed mode :-) (motion detected and controller activates full power breaking with both motors to make it harder to roll away)
[2021-05-16T22:56:06] Artem Bulashev: Ok :)
[2021-05-16T22:57:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i didn't understand 😅😅
[2021-05-16T22:59:14] Artem Bulashev: Well your controller can already speak to VESC and other controllers. So if it would have alarm mode and it could detect movement (gyro) it could activate full power motor breaking - this would make very hard to roll away the scooter Or bicycle for the thief
[2021-05-16T22:59:46] Artem Bulashev: :-)
[2021-05-16T22:59:52] Artem Bulashev: Just an idea
[2021-05-16T23:01:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's a bit more complicated. it would need to power up the vesc in live (when motion is detected) and always have the esp powered too to get imu datas.
[2021-05-16T23:02:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: does anybody use 7550 ? how are the perfs and on which escooter ? can it really support continuous 50a ?
[2021-05-16T23:04:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah in armed state esp would need to be in low power mode only chewing for gyro change, the rest could be off Again just an idea, may be some day in the future :)
[2021-05-16T23:04:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sure 😉
[2021-05-16T23:06:17] Artem Bulashev: This guy has it, but he had problem with it I think :)
[2021-05-16T23:35:24] Luis Magalhaes: hi 💪
[2021-05-17T04:11:17] francois schempers: well well well, seams like the Francois's keep bumping into each others 🤣🤣 welcome mate ;)
[2021-05-17T04:16:29] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2021-05-17T04:16:46] Happy Giraffe: 🥖🥖
[2021-05-17T04:17:26] francois schempers: the baguette club 🤣
[2021-05-17T04:18:10] Happy Giraffe: Im going to defend myself with the Danish smørrebrød
[2021-05-17T04:29:50] Unknown: And we Germans have the best bread...so guys you loose...
[2021-05-17T04:30:39] Happy Giraffe: 😂
[2021-05-17T04:31:45] Happy Giraffe: Not if I team up with Francois and then have smørrebaguette. Its the final boss form with maximum power
[2021-05-17T05:11:57] francois schempers: I don't need team up, french bread is far superior, that's all, it's not for nothing that Denis's is give baguette and not Blitzkrieg (sorry I don't speak German ahah)
[2021-05-17T05:13:00] Unknown: We will have a bread contest....after racing...
[2021-05-17T05:13:33] francois schempers: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-17T05:13:36] Unknown: You only have baguette and croissant...that's it...
[2021-05-17T05:13:59] francois schempers: you dont know the power of the french side 😅
[2021-05-17T05:14:30] Unknown: Be careful we have Merkel
[2021-05-17T06:35:18] Ivan: this is how WW begins...
[2021-05-17T06:47:49] francois schempers: xD
[2021-05-17T08:48:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hehehe. yeah 🤪
[2021-05-17T11:17:15] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 4 day old Baguette 🥖 is as good as baseball bet 🤣🤣
[2021-05-17T11:17:43] Happy Giraffe: You had better before...
[2021-05-17T11:17:52] Happy Giraffe: Oh fuk I need to go now😂
[2021-05-17T11:18:30] Artem Bulashev: 😳🤣
[2021-05-17T11:18:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: get out ! 🤪🤣
[2021-05-17T11:18:55] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2021-05-17T11:19:06] Happy Giraffe: With sound
[2021-05-17T11:19:23] Artem Bulashev: 🎁
[2021-05-17T11:19:26] Artem Bulashev: Surprise
[2021-05-17T11:19:33] Artem Bulashev: 😂
[2021-05-17T11:20:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so... Valentin , how are those flipsky going ?
[2021-05-17T11:20:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-17T11:20:59] Happy Giraffe: Pirate made them 7550 to work atleast, but hes a guy who mounts the tire in the wrong way😂🙈
[2021-05-17T11:21:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahhhh ! good ! and what about perfs ?
[2021-05-17T11:22:23] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/_SzJw-h6Nd0
[2021-05-17T11:22:27] Happy Giraffe: This is all he told
[2021-05-17T11:23:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ah yes. i've seen this video 😉
[2021-05-17T11:23:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: still waiting to see the perfs 😅😅
[2021-05-17T11:24:29] francois schempers: Valentin didnt manage to get it working yet, de are still working on it
[2021-05-17T11:24:44] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, me too. I will do vesc vs upgraded Xiaomi esc comparison after summer😂
[2021-05-17T11:24:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'll receive my connectors in ~10 days, then i'll be able to mount it on my dualtron mini to test.
[2021-05-17T11:25:29] Happy Giraffe: These are the values he got for m365 and Pro motors🤔 Cant wait to test this on 500w monorim motor
[2021-05-17T11:26:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: motor current at 23a ? it seems low, no ?
[2021-05-17T11:26:20] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-17T11:26:55] Artem Bulashev: May be it is battery current
[2021-05-17T11:27:07] Happy Giraffe: I used pro motor at 30A battery current. I think it has to be that
[2021-05-17T11:27:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we'll need all the vesc tools settings (export or screenshots) to check
[2021-05-17T11:27:24] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-17T14:20:40] Artem Bulashev: reead this careefully
[2021-05-17T14:24:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very interesting ! i was wondering if i should screw my 2 pcb together. i guess the answer is no 🤣
[2021-05-17T14:36:22] francois schempers: x-
[2021-05-17T14:36:23] francois schempers: xD
[2021-05-17T14:39:01] francois schempers: i must ask my supplier x)
[2021-05-17T15:17:36] Luis Magalhaes: They should use it like the drones
[2021-05-17T15:18:03] Luis Magalhaes: A stack with some rubber to reduce vibrations 😂
[2021-05-17T15:18:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vesc were designed for esk8, lot of vibrations too 😅
[2021-05-17T15:19:03] Luis Magalhaes: Yes they should adopt some methods 😁
[2021-05-17T15:19:43] Luis Magalhaes: Well lets see if my new ubox comes with that mod they talk
[2021-05-17T15:20:16] Luis Magalhaes: And if this time it does not come as a heater to the room 😂😂
[2021-05-17T15:27:14] Happy Giraffe: ”Because we are a start-up company and financial status is not good, we cannot provide a refund because we will go bankrupt after the refund"
[2021-05-17T15:27:17] Happy Giraffe: Big oof
[2021-05-17T16:00:02] Artem Bulashev: Honestly though. How many actually had that problem? Non of that I know of. They could have slipped a quite change like that without telling any one.
[2021-05-17T16:02:12] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-17T16:02:59] Luis Magalhaes: Yes that's true!
[2021-05-18T03:18:06] francois schempers: im perfectly fine with mine as is, and next time i open the scooter i will put pad in the Ubox to consolidate, still very please with my acquisition. plus they fixed it in there next version
[2021-05-18T03:18:59] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, just makes you wonder if its a good long term buy from a startup?😅
[2021-05-18T03:19:56] Artem Bulashev: From fail rates we see between groups and forums I would say best bet at the moment
[2021-05-18T03:20:16] Artem Bulashev: Also there is not much options for 16s dual vesc6 based
[2021-05-18T03:20:21] Artem Bulashev: If any other at all
[2021-05-18T03:20:39] Artem Bulashev: And def not in 250$ budget ;-)
[2021-05-18T03:21:28] francois schempers: I run mine at 2500w and it barely get warmer than 35⁰ after 20km ride, so the board is not heat stressed at all
[2021-05-18T03:21:45] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌👌
[2021-05-18T03:21:49] Artem Bulashev: That’s impressive
[2021-05-18T03:22:13] Artem Bulashev: This means less heat to near by battery too
[2021-05-18T03:22:17] francois schempers: yeah the ubox is a beast
[2021-05-18T03:22:31] Happy Giraffe: Damn, that's "cool" pun intended
[2021-05-18T03:23:02] francois schempers: the motors too, with the 500w monorim for the same performance I would have burned them, here the 1000w are just warm, not even hot
[2021-05-18T03:23:22] Artem Bulashev: 2500 total or each motor output? What amps? 40a*60v?
[2021-05-18T03:24:16] francois schempers: total, I'm battery limited for now I can't go higher, but soon, I will have a battery of murata vtc6 with 150A bms ;)
[2021-05-18T03:25:05] Artem Bulashev: So you can put more Watts through motor because it is running so much more efficient and cooler = end result you get better performance from the motor than you could with stock modified controller because it would burn the motor Right?
[2021-05-18T03:25:38] Artem Bulashev: You really start making me consider more battery head room
[2021-05-18T03:26:26] Artem Bulashev: I thought my 650w 8.5inch vsett wheel motors won’t handle much more than stock 23amps
[2021-05-18T03:27:05] Artem Bulashev: But it sounds like 35amps may be possible if not more.
[2021-05-18T03:28:08] Artem Bulashev: Vesc amps config is much different it seems from usual controllers
[2021-05-18T03:28:17] Happy Giraffe: "300w" Xiaomi Pro does 30A fine if you dont go uphill or against wind 24/7
[2021-05-18T03:28:20] francois schempers: yes, and the FOC algo, damn, so much more efficient when the Vesc actually measure your motor. xiaomi just use stock foc for stock motor, no wonder if is a waste of energy on any motor that are not identically build
[2021-05-18T03:29:58] Artem Bulashev: Two wheels 30amps should be really fast already than
[2021-05-18T03:30:23] Happy Giraffe: Not enough for Francois it seems...😂😂
[2021-05-18T03:30:30] francois schempers: hehe ^^
[2021-05-18T03:31:53] Artem Bulashev: Lol vsett10+ is sort of a king right now in terms of accelearation / efficiency from stock (people actually lower acceleration value in settings haha) - it has two 30amps 60v controllers (35amps turbo)
[2021-05-18T03:32:05] Artem Bulashev: - SINE wave controller
[2021-05-18T03:32:36] Artem Bulashev: That’s why for me 30amp sounds a lot already, but may be that’s not so much on lower voltage
[2021-05-18T03:32:51] francois schempers: just to put in perspective, same battery, 13s8p (because I burned my 2s extension) for the same battery, Xiaomi 500w monorim struggled to maintain 45km/h at 13s with lots of heat, with ubox and those 1000w motor (still the same 13s8p so the same power available) it is used so much more efficiently that top speed is now 55km/h with no heat generated
[2021-05-18T03:33:17] francois schempers: yes that's FOC
[2021-05-18T03:35:13] Artem Bulashev: That’s comes from the percision pole control. Depending on the angle it can either maintain speed at low amp draw or accelerate like crazy :))
[2021-05-18T03:35:32] Artem Bulashev: And battery doesnt over heat any more than before ?
[2021-05-18T03:37:59] francois schempers: no, I'm bms limited, the battery is fine, thats why my next battery will be 15s10p of murata vtc6 (300A of current capable) with a 150A bms, so when I use 80A on it, I will have literally no Vdrop
[2021-05-18T04:08:04] Happy Giraffe: How cool would that be if someone made Pro body wider from both sides so internal could be 10-12p alone👀😂
[2021-05-18T04:08:11] Happy Giraffe: But welding alu...
[2021-05-18T10:27:54] francois schempers: thats called a g30 xD
[2021-05-18T10:28:17] Happy Giraffe: Need more DIY
[2021-05-18T10:28:38] francois schempers: this is Tudor's, look at how easy the Ubox fit compared to mine x)
[2021-05-18T10:28:38] francois schempers: <photos/photo_112@18-05-2021_10-28-38.jpg>
[2021-05-18T10:29:10] Happy Giraffe: Sideways vs vertical damn
[2021-05-18T10:33:30] francois schempers: here @Tudor_VTA since i was shoping your stuff, welcom to the Vesc help group, mauve you can help some people here in the future ;)
[2021-05-18T10:35:20] Happy Giraffe: Did you test monorim 500w motor with vesc? Im also wondering if 2.25" 10" tire fits on stock pro fork without suspension 🤔
[2021-05-18T10:35:43] Tudor: Alohaaa
[2021-05-18T10:35:59] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-05-18T10:36:14] Happy Giraffe: That's a good profile pic haha
[2021-05-18T10:36:18] Tudor: Yeahh
[2021-05-18T10:36:20] Tudor: 😂😂😂😂
[2021-05-18T10:36:43] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_113@18-05-2021_10-36-43.jpg>
[2021-05-18T10:36:55] Tudor: Even my GF it's saying i am the Grinch
[2021-05-18T10:37:03] Tudor: Thats much love 😂😂😂
[2021-05-18T10:37:11] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2021-05-18T10:37:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sine and foc are different 😉
[2021-05-18T10:41:01] francois schempers: seriously ? I thought the Foc was doing sin waves, what does it do then, square ? 🤔 or there is something I didn't understand ^^
[2021-05-18T10:43:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yep, most 'sine' controllers are rudimentary
[2021-05-18T10:43:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <sticker>
[2021-05-18T10:45:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: foc is the most advanced control which measure field orientation to apply the correct torque current. 😉
[2021-05-18T10:46:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you can do simple sine without taking into account this field measurement and simply the hall sensor position
[2021-05-18T10:46:21] francois schempers: humm interesting, this just went in my saved message 🤣🤣
[2021-05-18T10:46:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah
[2021-05-18T10:47:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we've done a real foc open source firmware for m365 controller. lot of work, mostly work but we have some troubles
[2021-05-18T10:48:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://github.com/Koxx3/SmartESC_STM32_v3
[2021-05-18T10:48:52] francois schempers: yeah we talked about that with Raphael, this could help a lot of people wanting other motors and stuff x) plus I'm not sure those 500w monorim motor are efficiently used, a proper FOC measurement would be cool
[2021-05-18T10:49:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you are interested in foc, there a lot of documentation in the git
[2021-05-18T10:49:21] francois schempers: I'll check that out, thanks
[2021-05-18T10:50:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Raphaël managed to get 90A from the m365 controller with this firmware 🤣🤣🤣 reinforced of course...
[2021-05-18T10:52:46] francois schempers: yeah thoses little things are beast when upgraded, a shame that the firmware is a mess, and no one realised a proper user friendly FOC measurement methode
[2021-05-18T10:53:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this is the great strength of the vesc
[2021-05-18T10:53:46] Artem Bulashev: In simple terms all FOC is Sine wave , but not all sine wave controllers are FOC.
[2021-05-18T10:53:50] francois schempers: yeah, soooo much heat is wasted in an non optimised FOC
[2021-05-18T10:58:06] Artem Bulashev: Btw man, your adapter communicates via Can line or uart to Vesc?
[2021-05-18T10:58:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: uart
[2021-05-18T10:58:42] Artem Bulashev: I’m asking because on high currents there is real problem with throttle line catching EMI when fed to Vesc
[2021-05-18T10:59:12] Artem Bulashev: So uart could also be disrupted
[2021-05-18T10:59:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh ? really ? most controllers use uart
[2021-05-18T10:59:42] Artem Bulashev: Can is more rigid as it is differential
[2021-05-18T10:59:51] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t give a shit about EMI
[2021-05-18T10:59:59] Artem Bulashev: As it self cancels out
[2021-05-18T11:00:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: in fact, i use uart + 1 adc (current mode, no reverse, center brake)
[2021-05-18T11:00:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah, i know. i was about to add can bus, but i didn't really see the advantage for most escooters
[2021-05-18T11:02:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is a 'but'. we need to use a low speed uart to avoid too much noise effects
[2021-05-18T11:10:09] Artem Bulashev: ✅
[2021-05-18T11:10:24] Artem Bulashev: Can is over all better communication protocol :)
[2021-05-18T11:10:35] Artem Bulashev: Car manufacturers know that well ;-)
[2021-05-18T11:10:50] Artem Bulashev: But may be hard to implement didn’t get into it
[2021-05-18T11:11:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i already have some SN65HVD230 transceivers, i'll make tests if i have time... one day 🤣🤣
[2021-05-18T11:11:48] Artem Bulashev: Lol 😅
[2021-05-18T11:11:57] Artem Bulashev: Alright! 👌👌
[2021-05-18T11:12:02] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2021-05-18T11:13:01] Artem Bulashev: Is all can line differential or it requires a driver written for it ?
[2021-05-18T11:13:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: good question. i don't know
[2021-05-18T11:15:31] Tudor: Much better now. I cut the vesc case legs
[2021-05-18T11:15:35] Tudor: <photos/photo_114@18-05-2021_11-15-35.jpg>
[2021-05-18T11:15:35] Tudor: <photos/photo_115@18-05-2021_11-15-35.jpg>
[2021-05-18T11:15:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you can have a look at SN65HVD230 chip
[2021-05-18T11:16:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-05-18T11:16:50] Artem Bulashev: 16s 5p fits into m365 pro?
[2021-05-18T11:17:04] Artem Bulashev: Or what is this scooter ?
[2021-05-18T11:17:10] Tudor: Not really with 21700
[2021-05-18T11:17:15] Tudor: This is ninebot max
[2021-05-18T11:17:21] Tudor: Xiaomi big brother
[2021-05-18T11:17:44] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok 👌
[2021-05-18T11:18:02] Artem Bulashev: This is 5p 21700??
[2021-05-18T11:18:13] Tudor: 16s5p
[2021-05-18T11:18:43] Artem Bulashev: How much spacer needed ?
[2021-05-18T11:19:15] Tudor: 16s4p goes in m365 pro with 27mm extension
[2021-05-18T11:19:26] Tudor: <photos/photo_116@18-05-2021_11-19-26.jpg>
[2021-05-18T11:19:29] Tudor: Like this one
[2021-05-18T11:19:40] Tudor: This is 15 s4p 20ah
[2021-05-18T11:25:44] francois schempers: <animation>
[2021-05-18T12:07:24] Happy Giraffe: 16s4p Samsung 50S🌚🔥
[2021-05-18T12:35:21] Artem Bulashev: What we use on cables guys?
[2021-05-18T12:35:29] Tudor: Yeahh
[2021-05-18T12:35:38] Tudor: 20A discharge and 5000mah
[2021-05-18T12:35:42] Tudor: 😍😍😍
[2021-05-18T12:35:53] Artem Bulashev: Xt150 on battery? MT60 on motor wires ? (May be not enough?)
[2021-05-18T12:36:01] Artem Bulashev: Yeap without cooling
[2021-05-18T12:36:25] Artem Bulashev: Best 21700 cell out there. But right now 6.5$
[2021-05-18T12:36:50] Tudor: You pay for quality
[2021-05-18T12:36:57] Tudor: And prices wont go down
[2021-05-18T12:36:57] Artem Bulashev: Not really
[2021-05-18T12:37:01] Artem Bulashev: It is Vapecell
[2021-05-18T12:37:02] Tudor: The only way is up
[2021-05-18T12:37:06] Happy Giraffe: 35A with 80°c cutoff👀 So maybe short burst to make Francois to move😂
[2021-05-18T12:37:08] Artem Bulashev: Who sells those under their brand
[2021-05-18T12:37:12] Artem Bulashev: So you pay premium
[2021-05-18T12:37:31] Artem Bulashev: Once Samsung releases it will cost about 4.5-5$
[2021-05-18T12:37:53] Artem Bulashev: It will be VERY cost effective when compare to 18650 like VTC6 Sony
[2021-05-18T12:39:58] Artem Bulashev: Yeah it can discharge full capasity at 35amp which it nuts :) It is max continuous load! With cooling - not our use case But it does mean that you will be able to use like 30 amps for 30sec during first stage of acceleration where current is at its maximum without any heating up
[2021-05-18T12:40:55] Artem Bulashev: Low rpm = low voltage to motor and max amp to motor High rpm = high voltage and current adjusted not to go above Watt limit
[2021-05-18T13:02:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I don't think XT150 will ever be necessary 😅 XT90 can already support continuous 90A battery and more than 200A for 10 seconds ;)
[2021-05-18T13:03:30] Happy Giraffe: XT150, I have lost my masculinity with my current XT30 now...
[2021-05-18T13:03:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-18T13:04:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lunch break ... improving my display case 😅😅
[2021-05-18T13:04:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-18_13-04-25.png>
[2021-05-18T13:05:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: pre-cut to output wires (number of wires depends of the configuration ... can't do a clean prepared output)
[2021-05-18T13:15:41] Luis Magalhaes: Looks nice 👌👌
[2021-05-18T13:47:21] francois schempers: yeah, for me it's not a question of if I will buy one, but when 🤣🤣 keep it up koxx / Francois Deslandes, great work 👌
[2021-05-18T13:47:32] francois schempers: <sticker>
[2021-05-18T13:47:54] Tudor: Vesc dash?
[2021-05-18T13:48:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-18T13:48:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: "any" controller dash ;) support : dualtron, speedway, futecher, zero, vsett & vesc
[2021-05-18T13:48:46] Happy Giraffe: How I imagine two Francois in one group😂😂😂😂
[2021-05-18T13:49:13] francois schempers: we are the francois², you can't stop us ! 🤣🤣
[2021-05-18T13:49:16] Tudor: Interesting
[2021-05-18T13:49:22] Tudor: Tou make them?
[2021-05-18T13:49:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-05-18T13:49:44] francois schempers: show him all your video koxx / Francois Deslandes 😁
[2021-05-18T13:49:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: trying to, yes 🤣
[2021-05-18T13:49:51] Happy Giraffe: I would be interested in a Xiaomi Pro replacement👀

[2021-05-18T13:50:59] francois schempers: forwarded to saved message, thanks ;)
[2021-05-18T13:51:10] Artem Bulashev: 👍🙃
[2021-05-18T13:51:42] Artem Bulashev: Ubox cables are 12awg and 10awg for battery So they get hot
[2021-05-18T13:51:47] Happy Giraffe: I got like 2 meters total of AWG16 for 40A with xt30😂
[2021-05-18T13:51:56] Artem Bulashev: Better replace if you are skilled enough with iron
[2021-05-18T13:52:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳
[2021-05-18T13:54:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I let @Tudor_VTA search the group :D
[2021-05-18T13:54:51] Unknown: Should + - terminal be equally layered with nickel or does a specific terminal release the current 🧐🧐🧐
[2021-05-18T13:55:25] francois schempers: ah yes you posted them already ^^
[2021-05-18T13:55:56] francois schempers: check this @Tudor_VTA ;)
[2021-05-18T13:55:56] francois schempers: some pictures
[2021-05-18T13:55:56] francois schempers: <video_file>
[2021-05-18T13:55:56] francois schempers: <photos/photo_110@16-05-2021_22-46-12.jpg>
[2021-05-18T13:59:57] Happy Giraffe: Could those two buttons be programmed to change vesc profile? Like if pressed together 2 times rapidly it could activate some speedlimits profiles for police?👀
[2021-05-18T14:00:23] francois schempers: I am obligated to buy one of those x) again, great work françois, you're worthy of your name 🤣🤣
[2021-05-18T14:01:57] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-05-18T14:02:45] Artem Bulashev: They go into ESP32 so sure it’s simple code input = output
[2021-05-18T14:03:33] francois schempers: and with a simple & gate, you can make it work only if both are pressed ;)
[2021-05-18T14:04:09] Happy Giraffe: Yeah something that can be done quick but so it doesnt activate by accident
[2021-05-18T14:04:23] Happy Giraffe: Like doubletap both at same time for example
[2021-05-18T14:04:52] Artem Bulashev: So def possible, like press 2 buttons 3 times in less than 3 sec and esp will start sending command to Vesc every 50ms to set mode1, unless this combination has been pressed again 3 times in 3 sec time frame This will prevent vesc from switching into other modes even if police tries to cycle modes
[2021-05-18T14:07:08] Tudor: Ok. I am in
[2021-05-18T14:07:17] Happy Giraffe: It would have to be implemented in a way it stays when vesc is off I think
[2021-05-18T14:07:32] Tudor: I want one at least for my project
[2021-05-18T14:07:39] Artem Bulashev: Or could do it even easier Combination pressed results in - disable mode switch input - send mode switch command to mode 1 2 times to be safe to Vesc Than if combination repeated - enable mode switch input
[2021-05-18T14:07:49] Tudor: There is that davega dadh for vesc
[2021-05-18T14:07:55] Tudor: Dash
[2021-05-18T14:08:15] Artem Bulashev: Yes in case police reboots system
[2021-05-18T14:12:42] Unknown: @Tudor_VTA hellooo
[2021-05-18T14:13:46] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, would be nice to put the limit to 37 kmh or so that police are not completely pissed off if it goes 60 but still dont seem too suspicious if they saw you do 40-45 on road
[2021-05-18T14:14:18] Tudor: Hi
[2021-05-18T14:14:22] Artem Bulashev: Should not be too hard to make esp remember that mode input was disabled or enabled last time. If this is done, than it would be as simple as adding if command to the boot - if mode switch input disabled - than wait 2 sec and send mode 1 command to VESC - check - repeat if not set - check - finish boot sequence
[2021-05-18T14:15:16] Happy Giraffe: Or put the limit always on after reboot
[2021-05-18T14:15:35] Happy Giraffe: And then "hold two buttons while turning on"
[2021-05-18T14:15:37] Artem Bulashev: May be annoying to have that default
[2021-05-18T14:16:19] Artem Bulashev: Than you won’t be able to switch in and out without reboot
[2021-05-18T14:16:36] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, we need to think about some simple and reliable solution rhat can be done quickly
[2021-05-18T14:16:49] Happy Giraffe: Yep
[2021-05-18T14:16:49] Artem Bulashev: But honestly I would take any even least comfortable one of those
[2021-05-18T14:17:03] Unknown: We in Germany have the German maneuver app...for g30
[2021-05-18T14:17:21] Artem Bulashev: I wish I knew how to code
[2021-05-18T14:17:25] Unknown: So you need the app to unlock
[2021-05-18T14:17:32] Unknown: The us mode
[2021-05-18T14:17:43] Happy Giraffe: I can do "Hello World" but you have to continue from that
[2021-05-18T14:17:50] Unknown: After rebooting you are in German mode
[2021-05-18T14:17:52] Artem Bulashev: Haha same
[2021-05-18T14:17:59] Artem Bulashev: I can do skittle more
[2021-05-18T14:18:04] Artem Bulashev: But not too much
[2021-05-18T14:18:09] francois schempers: thats not everything, look at me, I know how to code but I'm lazy as fuck xD
[2021-05-18T14:18:18] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-05-18T14:18:27] Happy Giraffe: Then we put you into work🌚
[2021-05-18T14:18:29] Unknown: Lol i knew that...
[2021-05-18T14:18:31] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-05-18T14:18:40] Artem Bulashev: @francois_schempers How does 350-1000€ fine sound ? Good enough reason to do it?))
[2021-05-18T14:18:56] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-05-18T14:19:01] Luis Magalhaes: Happy to live in Portugal yet..
[2021-05-18T14:19:03] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-05-18T14:19:10] Artem Bulashev: 🤣
[2021-05-18T14:19:47] Luis Magalhaes: The police doesn't care, and they buy scooters to go to work too 😂
[2021-05-18T14:20:00] Unknown: Men i drive 50 kmh allowed 20...
[2021-05-18T14:20:05] francois schempers: well mine is default 25km/h on start up, with no mode switch, I have to connect by bluetooth every time to set the super profile until reboot. this way, I know I'm safe from police ever finding the profil
[2021-05-18T14:20:41] Luis Magalhaes: Yes we have a 25kmh limit too but no one cares about it
[2021-05-18T14:20:45] Unknown: This is the vesc German maneuver

[2021-05-18T14:27:22] Luis Magalhaes: Straight
[2021-05-18T14:27:35] Unknown: With the right motor I'm sure
[2021-05-18T14:27:46] Luis Magalhaes: On this speeds yes 😂 normaly its only full face helmet
[2021-05-18T14:27:48] Artem Bulashev: Not most convenient haha :-) would be cool to use something like rfid to unlock speed profile, and could double as alarm ke
[2021-05-18T14:28:57] Luis Magalhaes: I was trying yo check what max amps are they doing on bigger scooters but not many info
[2021-05-18T14:29:15] Luis Magalhaes: Just saw a video of a thunder but not running yet 😁
[2021-05-18T14:29:18] Unknown: G30 frame for my rion killer

[2021-05-18T14:29:53] Luis Magalhaes: Nice looking 👌👌
[2021-05-18T14:30:09] Artem Bulashev: Did you custom make this frame to look like g30 or it is just g30?
[2021-05-18T14:30:15] Unknown: Still in progress...
[2021-05-18T14:30:23] Luis Magalhaes: Well you win 😂💪 100+ it goes
[2021-05-18T14:30:49] Unknown: Just g30 frame...coating off wet sanding now
[2021-05-18T14:31:06] Artem Bulashev: Understood :)
[2021-05-18T14:31:08] Happy Giraffe: RE90 also goes 100+👀
[2021-05-18T14:31:14] Unknown: And tomorrow alu polisher
[2021-05-18T14:31:15] Artem Bulashev: 130+
[2021-05-18T14:31:29] Happy Giraffe: Yes, so it will be tough😂
[2021-05-18T14:31:38] Happy Giraffe: Especially with frame and steering
[2021-05-18T14:31:47] Unknown: I will kill this motherfucker Luxus skoot
[2021-05-18T14:32:23] Happy Giraffe: Then you need Super Hornet Growler electronic warfare systems😂
[2021-05-18T14:32:34] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-05-18T14:33:15] Happy Giraffe: But in bigger scooters the rigidity of stem and steering must be a big advantage on modding smaller ones
[2021-05-18T14:33:42] Unknown: The g30 has a good frame
[2021-05-18T14:33:45] Luis Magalhaes: Yes its a loot stable
[2021-05-18T14:33:46] Artem Bulashev: Also wheels you want to have some bump ability there
[2021-05-18T14:33:54] Artem Bulashev: Not for 50+ kmh
[2021-05-18T14:33:57] Unknown: And the steam will be fix
[2021-05-18T14:34:26] Unknown: I'm using it all the time over 50 kmh

[2021-05-18T14:35:27] Unknown: <photos/photo_125@18-05-2021_14-35-27.jpg>
[2021-05-18T14:35:29] Artem Bulashev: I don’t like going 50+ even on my vsett9 which has amazing dual suspension
[2021-05-18T14:35:30] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-05-18T14:36:11] Unknown: Delta Motor. ..dont ask.... Kickstarter coming
[2021-05-18T14:36:17] Artem Bulashev: That’s impressive for g30 indeed What are your motors / batter
[2021-05-18T14:36:28] Artem Bulashev: Ok😅
[2021-05-18T14:36:32] Luis Magalhaes: Some friends on zero 11x was having some wobble problems passing 80 they use a stearing dumper and say its fine now
[2021-05-18T14:36:33] Unknown: Delta motor 10s
[2021-05-18T14:36:52] Unknown: G1 motor
[2021-05-18T14:36:57] Luis Magalhaes: Mine does not have any of that but its a heavier front because of the suspension type
[2021-05-18T14:37:05] Unknown: And I'm driving slow...
[2021-05-18T14:37:31] Artem Bulashev: 10s battery?😳
[2021-05-18T14:37:52] Unknown: On 12s i did 64
[2021-05-18T14:37:58] Unknown: Yes
[2021-05-18T14:38:02] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅😅
[2021-05-18T14:38:40] Artem Bulashev: 10s 20amps lol
[2021-05-18T14:38:51] Artem Bulashev: That must be super high kv haha
[2021-05-18T14:39:00] Artem Bulashev: Do you have any acceleration at all?)
[2021-05-18T14:39:11] Luis Magalhaes: And a xiamantis ? 😂😂
[2021-05-18T14:39:12] Luis Magalhaes: <files/4_5836883121022176031.mp4>
[2021-05-18T14:39:19] Unknown: I beat a Tesla ass
[2021-05-18T14:40:04] Artem Bulashev: Man… 10s * 4v = 40v and 20amps = 800w max - you use 700w max 😅😅 What am I missing
[2021-05-18T14:40:54] Unknown: Yes that cfw I'm working is on efficiency and safety
[2021-05-18T14:41:24] Unknown: For my everyday scooter 50 kmh is enough
[2021-05-18T14:42:04] Luis Magalhaes: 50kmh on 10S looks good mine was doing only 32kmh 😂😂
[2021-05-18T14:42:22] Luis Magalhaes: But just use a cfw firmware nothing else
[2021-05-18T14:42:36] Unknown: Using 700 watts and under 25A
[2021-05-18T14:42:57] Luis Magalhaes: I did not measured 😂
[2021-05-18T14:43:08] Unknown: But I do
[2021-05-18T14:43:15] Luis Magalhaes: But it looks good to me 50 at 10S👌
[2021-05-18T14:43:42] Artem Bulashev: Yes that I agree on sweet spot 50stable
[2021-05-18T14:44:00] Luis Magalhaes: Oh and i was on a m365 yours a g30 so different motors
[2021-05-18T14:44:06] Unknown: No thermal or electrical problems
[2021-05-18T14:44:22] Unknown: Yes....
[2021-05-18T14:45:14] Luis Magalhaes: Did you see the video i put of the xiaomi mantis ? Up there 😂😂
[2021-05-18T14:45:22] Unknown: But I'm working right now on the m365 original 250 watt motor..i will try to get 50kmh on 10s out off this motor
[2021-05-18T14:45:35] Luis Magalhaes: It only goes 60kmh but looks good 😂
[2021-05-18T14:46:32] Luis Magalhaes: Nice , here ar all going to at least 12S and some to 22S 😅
[2021-05-18T14:46:43] Unknown: Monster....
[2021-05-18T14:47:05] Luis Magalhaes: I just sell mine and buy a bigger one because i wanted more range too 😁
[2021-05-18T14:47:17] Unknown: Yeah on my Rion killer i will go 20s
[2021-05-18T14:48:40] Artem Bulashev: Higher kv= less torque at the low end
[2021-05-18T14:49:05] Luis Magalhaes: I was going to put some ykz 72v 80A controllers on my wolf but they where huge and the vesc always get me itching so i saw the spintend ask some questions and then buy it lets see if i can do some more power but in controll and more efficient 😁
[2021-05-18T14:49:10] Artem Bulashev: Otherwise getting 50kmh is not hard from it, just won’t accelerate fast enough
[2021-05-18T14:50:15] Unknown: I'm balancing between torque and end Kmh that's right
[2021-05-18T15:11:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, the speed limit change is alteady programmed 😉 even a 25km/h speed limit 😉
[2021-05-18T15:11:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ❤️❤️
[2021-05-18T15:12:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: currently : short & long pressed are managed and the functions are mapped in the settings
[2021-05-18T15:12:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it starts with the 'startup mode' from thz settings
[2021-05-18T15:14:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i have an option to start with a speed limiter set a wanted speed (25). pressing brake during startup disable the limit (setting again)
[2021-05-18T15:15:15] Unknown: Cool
[2021-05-18T15:17:29] Artem Bulashev: Fun project! All I can add is that airgap gap between motor magnets and stator teeth effects efficiency - the smaller the hight efficiency motor will have. That’s why curved magnets are prefered, they also allow for higher magnet thickness than and in combination with N52H magnets can yea
[2021-05-18T15:20:06] Happy Giraffe: This is cool!
[2021-05-18T15:21:10] Unknown: We could talk for hours about magnets and stator effects for hours but It will be boring for the others... And i have to work a little bit.
[2021-05-18T15:21:32] Artem Bulashev: No bad 👌👌👌 would be best if it would allow to to limit not only speed but also watts (because most countries have watt limit)
[2021-05-18T15:21:57] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅 me too :) ✅

[2021-05-18T15:26:05] Unknown: Tired of these shitty chips maannnn
[2021-05-18T15:26:23] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t fit scooters well that one :(
[2021-05-18T15:26:38] Artem Bulashev: What is that?

[2021-05-18T15:41:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sy8502 ? what caused that ? i am planning to use SY8501 (100V version) for my next board version 😅
[2021-05-18T15:41:40] Unknown: I need to try and order and install 100v version
[2021-05-18T15:41:50] Unknown: It Always happens during a long, soft brake...
[2021-05-18T15:41:52] Unknown: Never a sharp one...
[2021-05-18T15:42:04] Unknown: Always when I hold brake very softly for a good few seconds
[2021-05-18T15:42:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sure. that's where it took the idea of square tondraw big numbers. it requires less cpu than fonts tondraw/refresh the screen
[2021-05-18T15:43:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok. too much back voltage/bemf coming back with regen. you must pass the 85v limit 😅😅😅
[2021-05-18T15:44:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if the sy8501 has the same pinout and components around (if i remember, the answer is yes), try it 😉
[2021-05-18T15:44:52] Unknown: But hoooowwww ugh I'm only on 12s battery
[2021-05-18T15:45:14] Unknown: I need hot air station so hmm
[2021-05-18T15:45:18] Unknown: I only have soldering iron lol
[2021-05-18T15:46:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: doable with soldering iron except the bottom pad 🤣🔥
[2021-05-18T15:46:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: whoooo ! from 50v to 80v, weird...
[2021-05-18T15:47:12] Unknown: Exactly :/
[2021-05-18T17:03:52] Artem Bulashev: This is what can happen with UBOX after some time and what stress relief / vibration dampening foam should prevent
[2021-05-18T17:05:09] Artem Bulashev: I don’t believe this is actually UBOX but just an example photo

[2021-05-18T17:11:35] Tudor: You should have used 0.1 mm copper and sandwich welded
[2021-05-18T17:11:45] Tudor: If you want to draw 80A
[2021-05-18T17:12:10] Unknown: 2*8mm pure nickel, - terminal has 8 layers
[2021-05-18T17:12:24] Unknown: Hmm I see
[2021-05-18T17:12:44] Tudor: Have you tested the welds?
[2021-05-18T17:12:52] Tudor: To see if they dont come.off easy ?
[2021-05-18T17:12:55] Unknown: 💪
[2021-05-18T17:13:00] Tudor: 8 layers
[2021-05-18T17:13:08] Tudor: Hard to weld them with that welder
[2021-05-18T17:13:21] Unknown: I'll test the terminal, it's not 8 on 8 directly , it's like a pyramid
[2021-05-18T17:13:54] Unknown: Roughly

[2021-05-18T17:18:07] Unknown: Righttt so u got thin copper sheet and welder over?
[2021-05-18T17:18:42] Tudor: <photos/photo_138@18-05-2021_17-18-42.jpg>
[2021-05-18T17:19:47] Unknown: Big difference, almost 4x wow
[2021-05-18T17:20:16] Unknown: How it's built now will still be good tho right ?
[2021-05-18T17:20:25] Tudor: Calculate
[2021-05-18T17:20:29] Tudor: I dont teust the welds
[2021-05-18T17:20:33] Tudor: Trust
[2021-05-18T17:21:19] Unknown: Do I need 80A carrying capability ALLOVER pack or mainly in terminals
[2021-05-18T17:21:42] Tudor: Per total in all series connections
[2021-05-18T17:21:52] Unknown: Series connections ok lemme calculate
[2021-05-18T17:22:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not very happy with the datas i sent him, but i manage tondisplay somthing other than '0 km/h' 😁😁
[2021-05-18T17:23:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: next step ... display real speed !
[2021-05-18T17:23:28] Unknown: 7 series connections roughly per group, 7*6.4= 44.8, if I double layer I'll have 89.6
[2021-05-18T17:23:56] Unknown: If I double layer series connections I'll have 90A roughly
[2021-05-18T17:34:37] Artem Bulashev: Oh awesome 😎 I can see how that would be wildly popular thing to do in future ☺️☺️☺️
[2021-05-18T17:36:08] Happy Giraffe: Btw, what do you think about the Nutt and Zoom mechanical brakes? The ones that have both pistons moving. I bought TRP Spyke but it was 2mm too wide for xiaomi rim/tire

[2021-05-18T17:45:23] Unknown: Huh
[2021-05-18T17:45:25] Unknown: 😂😂
[2021-05-18T17:45:54] Unknown: Way to much...
[2021-05-18T17:46:11] Unknown: Nickel is a precious metal
[2021-05-18T17:46:21] Unknown: how can I build for high current using nickel
[2021-05-18T17:46:24] Unknown: We recycle it...
[2021-05-18T17:46:32] Unknown: Yes
[2021-05-18T17:46:49] Unknown: If you need so much use cooper bars
[2021-05-18T17:46:58] Unknown: I will from now!
[2021-05-18T17:47:26] Unknown: Really sold metal bars on the Nickelstrip
[2021-05-18T17:47:43] Unknown: And then weld
[2021-05-18T17:47:45] Unknown: Got it
[2021-05-18T17:47:58] Unknown: Just between the cells preheat both sides
[2021-05-18T17:48:33] Unknown: For now however to finish this battery without ordering more pieces cos I'm broke for a week, will multiple layers of nickel handle such current ?
[2021-05-18T17:48:39] Unknown: It would be the best
[2021-05-18T17:49:09] Unknown: .2*8mm pure nickel, I wish to use 80A
[2021-05-18T17:49:21] Tudor: Good
[2021-05-18T17:49:23] Tudor: I use them
[2021-05-18T17:49:40] Artem Bulashev: Kind of hard to follow. Look current caring capasity is only needed between series. It will be same curren 70amps, it will only gain voltage as it passes from terminal to out terminal 70amps is not crazy a lot d’or copper
[2021-05-18T17:49:41] Tudor: <photos/photo_140@18-05-2021_17-49-41.jpg>
[2021-05-18T17:50:23] Unknown: Righttt
[2021-05-18T17:50:26] Unknown: I understand now
[2021-05-18T17:50:51] Unknown: So for future I will use copper, but for now.. nickel is my only option
[2021-05-18T17:50:59] Unknown: Spent too much money lol..
[2021-05-18T17:51:20] Happy Giraffe: Thanks, I slowly lost pressure from all my Zoom semi-hydros now... Better have a tiny bit weaker but more reliable brake. I think the bottleneck is still the tire grip if I pull the lever hard🤔
[2021-05-18T17:51:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it begins !
[2021-05-18T17:51:59] Happy Giraffe: Nice 😎
[2021-05-18T17:52:14] Artem Bulashev: Just awesome man :)
[2021-05-18T17:52:18] Unknown: Nice!
[2021-05-18T17:53:02] Artem Bulashev: Feels good? 😁😁😁
[2021-05-18T17:53:08] Tudor: 🙇‍♂🙇‍♂🙇‍♂
[2021-05-18T17:53:53] Artem Bulashev: 😁
[2021-05-18T17:54:07] Unknown: The flipsky is nice....and your laugh, lol
[2021-05-18T17:54:11] Unknown: RFID? Nice
[2021-05-18T17:54:33] Artem Bulashev: Fuckin love it :))
[2021-05-18T17:54:46] Unknown: RFID? And Volts??? Coool
[2021-05-18T17:55:22] Artem Bulashev: Vsett - latest generation of zero line This display works plug and play on Zero controllers with Water proof plug
[2021-05-18T17:55:31] Unknown: I don't know if i love or hate the display.
[2021-05-18T17:56:09] Unknown: And the thing with the finger... I'm skeptical
[2021-05-18T17:56:11] Artem Bulashev: Yeah agree there - not bright enough - throttle not the one I like, but any other can be soldered to it in place of this one
[2021-05-18T17:56:57] Tudor: Can the trigger throttle work?
[2021-05-18T17:57:01] Unknown: I don't know if i want round as cockpit display...
[2021-05-18T17:57:12] Artem Bulashev: But what koxx / Francois Deslandes is doing will def get so many more people to Vesc
[2021-05-18T17:57:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I also don’t think miniMotor eye style is not optimal - but common
[2021-05-18T17:58:09] Unknown: Mennn I'm talking 7 years to people about vesc....
[2021-05-18T17:58:58] Unknown: And it's true
[2021-05-18T17:59:20] Unknown: We have to make it nice for people...
[2021-05-18T17:59:36] Unknown: So normal drivers adopt it...
[2021-05-18T17:59:48] Unknown: We are all crazy here...
[2021-05-18T18:00:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, I just lack a voltage divider on my pcb right now.
[2021-05-18T18:00:44] Artem Bulashev: Displaying values is read, but throttle would be Send function, should be also possible, matter of transcoding again :) In theory with proper « language libraries » transcoding can be integrated deeply, incl settings
[2021-05-18T18:00:47] Happy Giraffe: Definitely some Xiaomi square screen replacement would come in handy
[2021-05-18T18:00:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-05-18T18:01:01] Artem Bulashev: I think he meant using trigger of eye
[2021-05-18T18:01:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's analog ;)
[2021-05-18T18:01:14] Artem Bulashev: It sends digital signal to contrôler
[2021-05-18T18:01:15] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2021-05-18T18:01:16] Unknown: I will do it for the davega x
[2021-05-18T18:01:17] Artem Bulashev: Crap
[2021-05-18T18:01:26] Artem Bulashev: Wait
[2021-05-18T18:01:30] Artem Bulashev: Throttle yeah
[2021-05-18T18:01:35] Artem Bulashev: It goes into eye
[2021-05-18T18:01:51] Artem Bulashev: Than eye communicates it back to esc in what shape? Analog ?
[2021-05-18T18:02:20] Artem Bulashev: Display just passed it though to a dedicated wire than?
[2021-05-18T18:02:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: EYE to CNTRL : serial + analog CNTRL to EYE : serial
[2021-05-18T18:03:09] Tudor: There is Arduino also ised?
[2021-05-18T18:03:26] Tudor: I havent been long i. This group i missed a lot
[2021-05-18T18:03:28] Tudor: 😁😁😁
[2021-05-18T18:03:28] Artem Bulashev: I see. Is analog solely throttle signal (like it’s just passed through eye?)
[2021-05-18T18:06:07] Unknown: Anyone up for trying to help me with my scooter problem? The one that solve the problem, Will get a donation! :)
[2021-05-18T18:08:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ESP32 ;)
[2021-05-18T18:08:29] Unknown: We don't need donation we help for free
[2021-05-18T18:11:11] Unknown: <video_file>
[2021-05-18T18:11:41] Unknown: Have resolder Hallsensor and many stuff for some week now, cant make it work
[2021-05-18T18:11:49] Unknown: Maybe need a new motor :(
[2021-05-18T18:12:13] Tudor: Show us what and where you soldered
[2021-05-18T18:12:23] Tudor: And what settings
[2021-05-18T18:14:05] Unknown: <files/Vescmotor.xml>
[2021-05-18T18:14:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: modes & brake indicator 😁😁
[2021-05-18T18:16:00] Artem Bulashev: Awesome
[2021-05-18T18:16:10] Artem Bulashev: 😳😳😳
[2021-05-18T18:17:09] Tudor: This works with any trigger throttle/display?
[2021-05-18T18:17:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: anything providing an analog output between 0-5V or 0-3.3V, yes
[2021-05-18T18:18:09] Artem Bulashev: Are you making it like a in common language between them, and than assigning their value for break for example to the break value of incommon language?
[2021-05-18T18:18:12] Tudor: So the cheap lh100 etc will.work
[2021-05-18T18:18:21] Happy Giraffe: He he hee😉
[2021-05-18T18:18:25] Artem Bulashev: Or you interconnect them directly to each other?
[2021-05-18T18:19:05] Artem Bulashev: Throttle is connected to Vesc
[2021-05-18T18:19:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, it's almost impossible. I have to modify bits on a prepared frame. it's a bit anoying, but it works.
[2021-05-18T18:19:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, not directly
[2021-05-18T18:19:44] Tudor: Its connected to "arduino "
[2021-05-18T18:19:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: throttle + 1 or 2 brake lever => ESP32 => DAC => 1 analog output => VESC
[2021-05-18T18:20:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: brake lever can have digital or analog sensors (like xiaomi)
[2021-05-18T18:20:09] Tudor: I am lost
[2021-05-18T18:20:14] Tudor: 😅😅😅😅
[2021-05-18T18:20:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol
[2021-05-18T18:21:00] Artem Bulashev: This means that later on you could also do one only decoding of another display and it would also than work on vesc, without changing vesc side decoding ?
[2021-05-18T18:21:18] Artem Bulashev: I’m doing my best to follow lol sorry I’m im saying jibrish 😅
[2021-05-18T18:21:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sure, it could work too, but you'll loose many features of my board
[2021-05-18T18:22:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: example : I have an anti-theft feature that lock throttle ADC output if you are too far from your escooter. If I can't intercept ADC between throttle and VESC, it won't work
[2021-05-18T18:23:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: another example : EYE analog output is 0.9V -> 4.1V. this is too much for the VESC. my board adapt signals levels
[2021-05-18T18:24:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: my app also provide a full dashboard
[2021-05-18T18:24:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_142@18-05-2021_18-24-40.jpg>
[2021-05-18T18:25:14] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-05-18T18:25:23] Artem Bulashev: Awesome man for real
[2021-05-18T18:25:30] Artem Bulashev: About anti theft
[2021-05-18T18:26:37] Artem Bulashev: Would it not be better to disable throttle input and than allow esp to engage breaking out put in case of motion for example while locked
[2021-05-18T18:27:32] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_143@18-05-2021_18-27-32.jpg>
[2021-05-18T18:28:00] Artem Bulashev: I use this tiny MPU6050
[2021-05-18T18:28:07] Artem Bulashev: Direct soldered
[2021-05-18T18:29:02] Artem Bulashev: That’s make it harder to roll away instead of just not letting it drive
[2021-05-18T18:29:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I consider it dangerous. If the anti-theft beacon isn't detected for any reason, it would engage the electric brake ? It happened to me once, I didn't enjoy it 🤣 and this is not really a security because you can always shutdown the electronic and push the scotter. this is more an anti jacking system.
[2021-05-18T18:29:53] Artem Bulashev: That can be countered easily by exclusion parameter like speed reading 0
[2021-05-18T18:30:01] Artem Bulashev: But I do see your point
[2021-05-18T18:30:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahaha ... yes, but power off ... and you can push it... or simply carry it (on a short distance).
[2021-05-18T18:31:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: like most motocycle stealing, they carry it in a truck. here, even a car is enough for a escooter.
[2021-05-18T18:31:42] Artem Bulashev: Shut down hm, in alarm mode , power switch could be disabled by a simple mosfet :-)
[2021-05-18T18:32:22] Artem Bulashev: Yeah we can t do much about it
[2021-05-18T18:32:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: simple mosfet with 100A / 200A for VESC ;)
[2021-05-18T18:32:40] Artem Bulashev: No haha
[2021-05-18T18:33:31] Artem Bulashev: Power button, you can’t in a a few relay/ fets to cut out turn on / off button from équation while keeping cuircuite closed and system powered
[2021-05-18T18:34:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for now, my biggest concern for the flipsky is the power on system. it doesn't have any "power on" electronic. I'll have to add a XT60/90 power key 😭😭 or buy an antispark with remote control (not cheap).
[2021-05-18T18:35:31] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_145@18-05-2021_18-35-31.jpg>
[2021-05-18T18:36:25] Happy Giraffe: This is how I secure my scooter, a bit DIY but nobody dares to try especially when you leave it alone in a visible place😉 Hardened chain and U-locks
[2021-05-18T18:36:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍 it will push away most thiefs
[2021-05-18T18:37:50] Happy Giraffe: Only big bolt cutters could do this but when you leave your scooter in a visible place (not in bike parking, that's the worst place) then they don't want the attention for 400€ sake😂
[2021-05-18T18:38:34] Unknown: Hehehe
[2021-05-18T18:38:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: most thefts we see in france : - the driver is pushed and the thief goes with the escooter - burglary inside house/office is rare to see someone steal it attached in the street. also because most users don't let it stay in the street
[2021-05-18T18:39:13] Happy Giraffe: If you have a bigger scooter, you could get a larger bag for 14mm manganese chain and then nobody will try
[2021-05-18T18:39:47] Happy Giraffe: They push you away from the scooter, wtf?!
[2021-05-18T18:40:06] Tudor: Heheh how can i get my hands on this ...?
[2021-05-18T18:40:20] Tudor: My precious 😁😁😁
[2021-05-18T18:41:12] Unknown: I have a biometric ulock and gps inside and motion alarm ....my 3 way antiitheft
[2021-05-18T18:41:34] Unknown: 3 alarm systems
[2021-05-18T18:41:58] Artem Bulashev: Isn’t there like a power switch that puts vesc / some times
[2021-05-18T18:42:00] Unknown: Fuck in they can steal my skoot they can have it...
[2021-05-18T18:42:31] Unknown: Lol
[2021-05-18T18:42:40] Happy Giraffe: I trust oldschool german locks, the drug users here would carry 100db alarm away
[2021-05-18T18:42:46] Unknown: 😂😂😂
[2021-05-18T18:44:41] Artem Bulashev: I see there is not low power turn of switch to put controller into hybrrnation ?? All normal controllers never fully off, they just in deep sleep state I believe
[2021-05-18T18:45:00] Artem Bulashev: Not a case here it seems
[2021-05-18T18:46:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for now, I need money to launch a new batch of boards with the latest design (100V regulator, eye throttle support and few others fixes). if you want to make donations, you're welcome : paypal / koxx3@free.fr :D I substract the donation from the 30/40€ of R&D in the final price currently, for the smartcontroller, it's targeted for 120€ with shipping 😅 the smartdisplay is too expensive in the current status (~400€ with all the cabling / printing / assembly time)
[2021-05-18T18:47:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: only on VESC 6 MK3 minimum
[2021-05-18T18:47:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think Spinted has one
[2021-05-18T18:47:22] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-18T18:47:24] Artem Bulashev: Think so
[2021-05-18T18:47:34] Artem Bulashev: So it is just not a case for older once
[2021-05-18T18:48:29] Artem Bulashev: In that case my diagram could work :-) may be even could be simplified further considering it is 3.3 v logic most likely
[2021-05-18T18:50:01] Artem Bulashev: That would allow esp to control to limited extend . If contrôler turns of mosfet would need to change back to allow button to work, which will happen as soon as signal from ESP32 disappears (it is powered from Vesc power output that is now off )
[2021-05-18T18:50:59] Artem Bulashev: 🙈 spagetti but should work on UBOX
[2021-05-18T18:51:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yep
[2021-05-18T18:51:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: latest board

[2021-05-18T18:53:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not for this one ;) I published the 1.4.2
[2021-05-18T18:53:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-05-18T18:53:30] Unknown: I want one
[2021-05-18T18:53:48] Unknown: Maybe 2...
[2021-05-18T18:54:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i have some 1.4.2 😉

[2021-05-18T18:55:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: wideworld shortage 😭😭
[2021-05-18T18:55:29] Unknown: Yessss
[2021-05-18T18:55:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you can power it with an external buck in 5v
[2021-05-18T18:56:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it uses 200mA
[2021-05-18T18:56:10] Unknown: Nice
[2021-05-18T18:56:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 360mA with tft screen
[2021-05-18T18:56:39] Unknown: I talk to you later...
[2021-05-18T18:56:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-05-18T18:57:03] Unknown: But very cool
[2021-05-18T19:00:43] Happy Giraffe: Its very cool to be here with you guys who know more of this stuff than I do. Really nice to stalk here and learn
[2021-05-18T19:00:45] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-05-18T19:19:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: FUCK FUCK FUCK !!! motor is not spinning any more !
[2021-05-18T19:19:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: even in detection mode
[2021-05-18T19:19:18] Luis Magalhaes: 💪💪💪
[2021-05-18T19:19:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I just ear the detection noise (HFI ?) but no spining.
[2021-05-18T19:19:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😭
[2021-05-18T19:22:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-18_19-22-42.png>
[2021-05-18T19:22:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no fault ... but flat line 😭
[2021-05-18T19:23:22] Luis Magalhaes: Thats the way 👌👌
[2021-05-18T19:28:20] Unknown: Yes, This is the way.
[2021-05-18T19:28:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if I inject current, I can feel a resistance in the motor. no hard point. so, I guess mosfets are ok ?
[2021-05-18T19:33:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: motor wiring resistance are ok between phases
[2021-05-18T19:33:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what the heck
[2021-05-18T19:33:41] Artem Bulashev: Spin it with vesc tool
[2021-05-18T19:33:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nothing. even in detection mode
[2021-05-18T19:33:59] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-05-18T19:34:04] Artem Bulashev: Odd
[2021-05-18T19:34:16] Artem Bulashev: Time

[2021-05-18T19:34:22] Artem Bulashev: 🙃
[2021-05-18T19:34:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: pffff ... I already spent 1000€ in my electronic designs. I can't afford spending more. 😔
[2021-05-18T19:35:02] Artem Bulashev: Joking, should be ok
[2021-05-18T19:35:23] Artem Bulashev: No magic smoke no pops
[2021-05-18T19:35:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no
[2021-05-18T19:35:35] Artem Bulashev: Disconnect esp
[2021-05-18T19:35:41] Artem Bulashev: I guess you did
[2021-05-18T19:35:46] Artem Bulashev: Re plug power
[2021-05-18T19:35:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I just did a 'violent' braking, but I am on lab power supply
[2021-05-18T19:36:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, I unplugged/replugeed everything
[2021-05-18T19:36:20] Artem Bulashev: Is power supply Ok
[2021-05-18T19:36:27] Artem Bulashev: It looks like power is ok to logic
[2021-05-18T19:36:37] Luis Magalhaes: thats what happen to me before it breaks 🤣
[2021-05-18T19:36:39] Artem Bulashev: But not ok high voltage
[2021-05-18T19:36:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it seems so. I'll try on battery
[2021-05-18T19:37:21] Luis Magalhaes: i did this too but it was plugged and not powered lolol
[2021-05-18T19:37:22] Artem Bulashev: Check with multi meter the power in along the line
[2021-05-18T19:37:36] Artem Bulashev: What controller?
[2021-05-18T19:38:01] Luis Magalhaes: the burned spintend 🤣 but was not the same thing appening here just joking
[2021-05-18T19:38:30] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok, so not same symptoms 👌
[2021-05-18T19:39:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: same on battery
[2021-05-18T19:39:28] Luis Magalhaes: it was jerky on detection mode and then shut's down
[2021-05-18T19:39:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: shit
[2021-05-18T19:39:34] Luis Magalhaes: those where my sintoms lolol
[2021-05-18T19:40:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the detection "seems" fine ...
[2021-05-18T19:40:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-18_19-40-00.png>
[2021-05-18T19:40:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but no spinning
[2021-05-18T19:40:12] Luis Magalhaes: you already pass the part that i plug in the xt90 and it all gets in flames so your ok 🤣
[2021-05-18T19:40:32] Luis Magalhaes: strange 😅
[2021-05-18T19:44:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 12v is kinda ok (11V)
[2021-05-18T19:45:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 3.3V ok
[2021-05-18T19:45:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 5V ok (5.1V)
[2021-05-18T19:45:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: pffff .... what can it be

[2021-05-18T19:47:45] Unknown: Hallelujah
[2021-05-18T19:47:59] Unknown: Unbalanced during discharge but sorts out right away once I leave throttle
[2021-05-18T19:48:22] Unknown: 12s4p, done. Next test is on my 12s5p, next is finishing 21700 ebike pack
[2021-05-18T19:56:25] Artem Bulashev: How is high power ?
[2021-05-18T19:56:51] Artem Bulashev: Check if fets open up
[2021-05-18T19:57:00] Artem Bulashev: Up on attempt to spin
[2021-05-18T19:57:11] Artem Bulashev: But do they have voltage in them ?
[2021-05-18T19:57:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: reflashed firmware (just in case) ... same thing
[2021-05-18T19:57:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on the power supply, all good
[2021-05-18T19:57:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ues, i'll open the case
[2021-05-18T20:00:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nothing blow up on what i guess is the power stage
[2021-05-18T20:01:31] Artem Bulashev: Show more photos
[2021-05-18T20:01:34] Artem Bulashev: Other side
[2021-05-18T20:01:36] Artem Bulashev: May be
[2021-05-18T20:02:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: fuck. i cracked the connectors removing the upper board... pfffff
[2021-05-18T20:02:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, that can be replaced
[2021-05-18T20:02:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_151@18-05-2021_20-02-42.jpg>
[2021-05-18T20:02:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seems ok here
[2021-05-18T20:03:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_153@18-05-2021_20-03-39.jpg>
[2021-05-18T20:10:44] Artem Bulashev: Anything under there?
[2021-05-18T20:10:54] Artem Bulashev: Fets should be there
[2021-05-18T20:12:05] Luis Magalhaes: a friend of mine had a similar problem
[2021-05-18T20:12:22] Luis Magalhaes: he said it just stop working after he ride it one time
[2021-05-18T20:12:23] Luis Magalhaes: lol
[2021-05-18T20:12:42] Artem Bulashev: Which controller he had?
[2021-05-18T20:12:44] Luis Magalhaes: bangood send them a new one he did not test it yet
[2021-05-18T20:13:44] Artem Bulashev: Those are nearly open source
[2021-05-18T20:13:51] Artem Bulashev: Should be repairable
[2021-05-18T20:22:36] Luis Magalhaes: it was one of those 50A
[2021-05-18T20:23:54] Luis Magalhaes: Flipsky FSESC 7550
[2021-05-18T20:24:38] Luis Magalhaes: yes but they send them a new one and i think i did not look at it yet too
[2021-05-18T20:24:56] Luis Magalhaes: is a project scooter lol he has a 11x too
[2021-05-18T20:29:33] Unknown: I also have flipsky 7550 not working for me either
[2021-05-18T20:34:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but solidly attached. can't access
[2021-05-18T20:34:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: shit
[2021-05-18T20:35:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nothing weird /exploded on the board
[2021-05-18T20:35:31] Happy Giraffe: Do you think 6.5v vdrop is ok for 13s7p 35E @40A load?
[2021-05-18T20:36:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: mosfets here
[2021-05-18T20:36:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_154@18-05-2021_20-36-32.jpg>
[2021-05-18T20:36:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_155@18-05-2021_20-36-32.jpg>
[2021-05-18T20:36:35] Happy Giraffe: Battery has XT30 that heats up a bit but I wonder if its still somewhat good result
[2021-05-18T20:37:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_156@18-05-2021_20-37-30.jpg>
[2021-05-18T20:41:36] Unknown: Do you connect throttle to 5V or 3,3V on Common?
[2021-05-18T20:42:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 3.3V throttle (dac output of the ESP32) and dac readings are fine in vesc tools
[2021-05-18T20:43:28] Unknown: Okey i connected it to 5V maybe thats my problem then
[2021-05-18T20:43:41] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_157@18-05-2021_20-43-41.jpg>
[2021-05-18T20:43:55] Artem Bulashev: 40/7=5.7amp
[2021-05-18T20:44:14] Artem Bulashev: 6.5/13= 0.5v per cell drop
[2021-05-18T20:44:17] Artem Bulashev: See graph
[2021-05-18T20:44:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on VESC ADC entries : NEVER !
[2021-05-18T20:44:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: STM32 support 5V on GPIO but not on ADC
[2021-05-18T20:45:36] Unknown: So i should change to 3,3v?
[2021-05-18T20:45:53] Artem Bulashev: Should be more like 0.35v drop
[2021-05-18T20:46:07] Artem Bulashev: May be your pack assembly is introducing high losses
[2021-05-18T20:46:26] Unknown: <photos/photo_158@18-05-2021_20-46-26.jpg>
[2021-05-18T20:46:33] Unknown: He use 5v
[2021-05-18T20:46:42] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-05-18T20:46:45] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_159@18-05-2021_20-46-45.jpg>

[2021-05-18T20:46:45] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_161@18-05-2021_20-46-45.jpg>
[2021-05-18T20:46:52] Artem Bulashev: Other wise can damage controller
[2021-05-18T20:47:27] Artem Bulashev: 0.2mm pure nickel?
[2021-05-18T20:47:28] Happy Giraffe: This is the pack, I will produce so many sad noises if this aint enough🙈 I think its the stupid XT30 connector
[2021-05-18T20:47:41] Artem Bulashev: Wait what
[2021-05-18T20:47:43] Happy Giraffe: Im not 100% sure😅
[2021-05-18T20:47:52] Artem Bulashev: You have xt30 on that pack???
[2021-05-18T20:47:53] Happy Giraffe: Yes...xt30
[2021-05-18T20:47:55] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-05-18T20:47:57] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-05-18T20:48:02] Artem Bulashev: It is nominal 15amps man
[2021-05-18T20:48:04] Artem Bulashev: 30 max
[2021-05-18T20:48:05] Happy Giraffe: It heats up a bit haha
[2021-05-18T20:48:15] Artem Bulashev: Change it
[2021-05-18T20:48:17] Happy Giraffe: I will change it to XT60 tho
[2021-05-18T20:48:30] Artem Bulashev: You will see reduction in sag
[2021-05-18T20:48:45] Happy Giraffe: But...Rita and controller still has XT30
[2021-05-18T20:49:08] Artem Bulashev: Change them all
[2021-05-18T20:49:25] Artem Bulashev: Xt30 is not good for that
[2021-05-18T20:49:33] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I should just lower the amps to 32
[2021-05-18T20:49:46] Happy Giraffe: I will get vesc after summer anyways
[2021-05-18T20:49:52] Artem Bulashev: Rita can’t do over 30
[2021-05-18T20:50:13] Artem Bulashev: It 30 max
[2021-05-18T20:50:14] Happy Giraffe: Mine can do 60A burst and 40 sustained
[2021-05-18T20:50:21] Artem Bulashev: Rita?
[2021-05-18T20:50:35] Happy Giraffe: Yes, I got a special unit
[2021-05-18T20:50:38] Artem Bulashev: Special
[2021-05-18T20:50:40] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok
[2021-05-18T20:50:44] Artem Bulashev: Interesting
[2021-05-18T20:50:50] Artem Bulashev: Charge connectors
[2021-05-18T20:51:33] Happy Giraffe: Haha, there's like 3 of them in my power link
[2021-05-18T20:52:14] Happy Giraffe: Battery - extension - Rita - controller
[2021-05-18T20:52:27] Happy Giraffe: All doing power losses🙈
[2021-05-18T20:52:32] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-18T20:53:57] Happy Giraffe: AWG16 should do ok tho?
[2021-05-18T20:54:06] Happy Giraffe: Its full copper
[2021-05-18T20:55:17] Artem Bulashev: How many cm one way from battery to controller ?
[2021-05-18T20:55:25] Happy Giraffe: 200🙈
[2021-05-18T20:55:30] Happy Giraffe: Almost
[2021-05-18T20:55:33] Artem Bulashev: Ohh
[2021-05-18T20:55:38] Artem Bulashev: And 40amps max ?
[2021-05-18T20:56:01] Artem Bulashev: 200 one way or both ways?
[2021-05-18T20:56:05] Happy Giraffe: Yeah... Its coming from backpack to controller, travelling through scooter stem
[2021-05-18T20:56:14] Happy Giraffe: One way
[2021-05-18T20:56:18] Artem Bulashev: Dammm
[2021-05-18T20:56:24] Artem Bulashev: Man no wonder hahah
[2021-05-18T20:56:38] Artem Bulashev: 4m of 16awg no way
[2021-05-18T20:56:46] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but what can I do if battery has AWG16🙈
[2021-05-18T20:57:03] Artem Bulashev: Use the rest as big as possible
[2021-05-18T20:57:12] Artem Bulashev: To reduce a over all resistance
[2021-05-18T20:57:15] Happy Giraffe: If I keep it short 5cm and then use AWG12?
[2021-05-18T20:57:20] Artem Bulashev: Or change the lay out to reduce length
[2021-05-18T20:57:27] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-05-18T20:57:36] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_162@18-05-2021_20-57-36.jpg>
[2021-05-18T20:58:10] Happy Giraffe: 5 cm AWG16 is ok?
[2021-05-18T20:58:26] Happy Giraffe: Because Im not able to change the battery myself
[2021-05-18T20:58:50] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_163@18-05-2021_20-58-50.jpg>
[2021-05-18T21:00:09] Artem Bulashev: Too long chart but look at 14ga 7amps load 😁😁 6-7m max
[2021-05-18T21:00:31] Happy Giraffe: Oh shiet
[2021-05-18T21:00:50] Happy Giraffe: Is even 12AWG enough then? 😅
[2021-05-18T21:01:19] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_164@18-05-2021_21-01-19.jpg>
[2021-05-18T21:01:27] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_165@18-05-2021_21-01-27.jpg>
[2021-05-18T21:02:15] Unknown: I get 4v on 30A 12s4p sanyo GA ..
[2021-05-18T21:02:39] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_166@18-05-2021_21-02-39.jpg>
[2021-05-18T21:03:06] Artem Bulashev: For 4m long 40 amps you would need 8ga wire in ideal world
[2021-05-18T21:03:56] Artem Bulashev: That’s to have less than 2% voltage drop over the wire resistance alone
[2021-05-18T21:04:13] Artem Bulashev: If you use smaller ga you will simply have more % drop
[2021-05-18T21:06:26] Happy Giraffe: Wtf
[2021-05-18T21:07:12] Happy Giraffe: Then I would need some XT90 to fit that 10AWG lmao
[2021-05-18T21:10:25] Artem Bulashev: Impossible to get to 0 resistance
[2021-05-18T21:11:56] Artem Bulashev: So I would not over do because 40 amps is peak current typical one is 20-30 I guess and for that 10Ga would be ideal 12Ga should be okey
[2021-05-18T21:21:19] Happy Giraffe: I will make a plan a bit later tonight
[2021-05-18T21:21:31] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-05-18T21:21:42] Artem Bulashev: Def not 16ga haha
[2021-05-18T21:21:55] Artem Bulashev: 😎😎 can’t wait to see how much it changes the performance
[2021-05-18T21:22:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: better and better ....
[2021-05-18T21:22:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: remounted... try new motor detection ... same
[2021-05-18T21:22:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and now ! no detected in USB now... so
[2021-05-18T21:22:39] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2021-05-18T21:22:48] Artem Bulashev: koxx / Francois Deslandes when you type
[2021-05-18T21:22:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahaha
[2021-05-18T21:23:28] Happy Giraffe: I will go XT90/60 AWG12/10 hybrid I think
[2021-05-18T21:24:07] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌

[2021-05-19T12:39:16] Luis Magalhaes: Hows the temperature?
[2021-05-19T12:44:16] Ivan: it's feel very fast)
[2021-05-19T12:44:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I am more interested in accelerations 😁
[2021-05-19T12:44:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: does it burn ? 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-05-19T12:45:15] Ivan: nope but tri it after my hand feel fine)
[2021-05-19T12:47:42] Ivan: smooth start but after 15-20 kmph i feel some g in my body)

[2021-05-19T15:56:04] Tudor: What did i miss?
[2021-05-19T15:56:07] Tudor: What happened?
[2021-05-19T15:56:57] Tudor: Who needs a vesc?
[2021-05-19T15:57:09] Tudor: I have lots sitting around
[2021-05-19T15:57:30] Unknown: @koxx had a failure with his vesc
[2021-05-19T15:58:35] Tudor: Burned?
[2021-05-19T15:59:35] Tudor: Any vesc will do?
[2021-05-19T15:59:44] Tudor: Or you need a specific one?
[2021-05-19T16:01:46] Tudor: koxx / Francois Deslandes so which do you need?
[2021-05-19T16:19:32] francois schempers: tudor is the best ;)
[2021-05-19T16:27:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: me 😓😓 my flipsky 7550 died
[2021-05-19T16:28:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: something supporting my 58.8v battery (75v vesc).
[2021-05-19T16:28:16] Artem Bulashev: No burn no damage, just stoped working
[2021-05-19T16:28:25] Tudor: Ok

[2021-05-19T16:28:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nothing visible. it started to fail with motor not spining, then usb dead
[2021-05-19T16:29:03] Tudor: I will donate you a vesc
[2021-05-19T16:29:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ❤️❤️❤️ done
[2021-05-19T16:29:54] Mirono escooters: Tudor is boss
[2021-05-19T16:30:10] Mirono escooters: Maybe fixable? Its open source atleast
[2021-05-19T16:31:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: usb dead seems bad sign. i think the stm32 died.
[2021-05-19T16:31:26] Artem Bulashev: That can be due to connector that fall off?
[2021-05-19T16:32:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i resoldered them and checked the connections. usb doesn't go in the 'lower' board (mosfet/shunts stage)
[2021-05-19T16:32:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and usb worked after repair
[2021-05-19T16:33:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: flashing the firmware took forever. it was really weird before dying.
[2021-05-19T16:35:01] Tudor: <photos/photo_181@19-05-2021_16-35-01.jpg>
[2021-05-19T16:37:30] Mirono escooters: Jezus xd
[2021-05-19T16:37:47] Mirono escooters: U can get a new stm tho?
[2021-05-19T16:37:48] Mirono escooters: Hot air
[2021-05-19T16:39:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sure, but 1/ a real pain 2/ not sure only that part is dead 3/ still waiting for my hot air station
[2021-05-19T16:48:23] Mirono escooters: Yes but for 300€😅
[2021-05-19T16:48:25] Mirono escooters: Maybe later
[2021-05-19T16:50:27] Artem Bulashev: I see sucks
[2021-05-19T16:53:12] Artem Bulashev: Yeah MCU died probably. May be we should be adding lowEsr cap to it on the input 👌 at least 2 470uF should do the trick
[2021-05-19T18:18:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, may be
[2021-05-19T18:21:36] Unknown: What u guys think of adding caps just before , in the cable 🧐
[2021-05-19T18:21:50] Unknown: I have wanted to do that for a while. But how big capacitors are needed?
[2021-05-19T18:27:22] francois schempers: whats the objective ?
[2021-05-19T22:57:09] Artem Bulashev: LowESR capacitors on input of ESC are used to clear up back EMF noise that comes from motor - normally battery will act as capacitor, so it will be filtering out the system, but if cables are to long than inductivity will prevent battery from absorbing those super quick spikes that may be as short as 0.5ms - noise will accumulate in the system and will get to low voltage system - such as low power 5v and 3.3v, this can cause anything from cycles timing going out of sync and missing target, to fried MCUs LowESR caps need to be placed as close the noise source as possible (esc power input to reduce inductance) 2pcs 470uf lowEsr caps in parallel have lower esr than 1pc 1000uf capacitor! So better few smaller once Best one is Panasonic FM and FR series caps, has been tested many many times in community
[2021-05-19T23:16:49] francois schempers: hum interesting read, why don't they do that from the start when making an esc ? 🤔
[2021-05-20T01:05:41] Artem Bulashev: They do. Looks like 7550 was poor design. So many of them failing in similar fashion to noise fried MCU.
[2021-05-20T02:09:11] Artem Bulashev: Man I have a question :) So we can connect to 9 ADCs of esp32 - throttle trigger - breaks levellers - left turn signal button - right turn signal button (if they are individual) - horn button - front light activation button - mode select switch - power on of button - those inputs = this means than 2 DAC is used to pass through throttle and Break info to VESC = This means than we can use P-mosfet (0v - flow) on alarm mode to disable on/off switch (so that scooter could not be power down by button without first disarming alarm) = this mean we can use 3 n-mosfets to make it work as led controller + use another n-mosfet with trigger connected to all of those in order to enable Headlight when ever Led light are on - they than could be contrôler from an App, like color and brightness = this means we can have n-mosfet on ESP32 for alarm system components (it would open power to horn/sirent/headlight/stop light either directly or via their n-mosfet This is just a brain storm on very analog way to create peripheral board which also could expend current functions of your board :) (Trying to find compact way to bring all cheap Chinese scooter functions to work from single esp controller)
[2021-05-20T02:55:41] Unknown: You crazy motherf....😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
[2021-05-20T03:34:26] Artem Bulashev: Late night brain fart 💨😅😅
[2021-05-20T03:35:22] Happy Giraffe: Having a brain to fart is better than no brain, Im still figuring out whats this all about😂
[2021-05-20T09:31:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: check my ESP32 usage ;)
[2021-05-20T09:31:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-20_09-31-26.png>
[2021-05-20T09:31:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's full already
[2021-05-20T09:40:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but I am planning to develop very small board with an one-wire extension bus. we'll see if it works. if not, may be I'll swtich to CAN bus.
[2021-05-20T09:41:03] Tudor: Just helping the cause 🛴💨💨💨
[2021-05-20T09:56:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: = this means than 2 DAC is used to pass through throttle and Break info to VESC » integrated DAC if not good enought (8bits). I had to add an external DAC with an amplifier = This means than we can use P-mosfet (0v - flow) on alarm mode to disable on/off switch (so that scooter could not be power down by button without first disarming alarm) » I already have a mosfet to control power output (up to 100V 1A) = this mean we can use 3 n-mosfets to make it work as led controller + use another n-mosfet with trigger connected to all of those in order to enable Headlight when ever Led light are on - they than could be contrôler from an App, like color and brightness = this means we can have n-mosfet on ESP32 for alarm system components (it would open power to horn/sirent/headlight/stop light either directly or via their n-mosfet » this can be done with the expansion boards ;) if my expansion board works, it will allow you to create all sort of features and explode them in the scooter without a bunch of wires.
[2021-05-20T09:59:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you haven't seen my features yet :
[2021-05-20T09:59:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-20_09-59-17.png>
[2021-05-20T11:30:35] francois schempers: about that mj1 cell ref, here and in Denis's group, we all use samsung 35E for internal and booster pack, maybe a 35E settings would be great ;)
[2021-05-20T11:37:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you provide the math formula, no problem 🤣🤣
[2021-05-20T11:37:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: uint8_t newPercent = max(0,(int)round(-1439.34794384241 * pow(voltByCell, 6)+ 31480.0982535788 * pow(voltByCell, 5) - 286201.985664439 * pow(voltByCell, 4) + 1384323.16517329 * pow(voltByCell, 3) - 3756691.18815474 * pow(voltByCell, 2) + 5422659.60130914 * voltByCell - 3252516.81708377));

[2021-05-20T11:44:36] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁 yeah series i2c board could always workout
[2021-05-20T11:45:22] Artem Bulashev: Looking good
[2021-05-20T11:46:17] Artem Bulashev: I have good news
[2021-05-20T11:46:24] Artem Bulashev: About 35e cells
[2021-05-20T11:46:40] Artem Bulashev: I have v3 and getting v4 latest now for my pack
[2021-05-20T11:47:00] Artem Bulashev: I will send 2 samples of v3 and 2 samples of v4 to the test
[2021-05-20T11:47:06] francois schempers: https://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Common18650IndividualTest%20UK.html
[2021-05-20T11:47:13] francois schempers: here koxx / Francois Deslandes
[2021-05-20T11:47:48] Artem Bulashev: This guy agreed to test it Because his test was done on very first v0 https://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Samsung%20INR18650-35E%203500mAh%20%28Pink%29%20UK.html
[2021-05-20T11:48:15] Artem Bulashev: So we will be all his amazing graphs and will be able to see how v0 v3 and v4 compare
[2021-05-20T11:48:17] francois schempers: https://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Samsung%20INR18650-35E%203500mAh%20%28Pink%29%20UK.html
[2021-05-20T11:49:19] francois schempers: he doesn't have murata vtc6 😭
[2021-05-20T11:49:31] Artem Bulashev: https://lygte-info.dk/info/batteryIndex.html This is the best way to compare any cells His Sanyo GA are v2 latest
[2021-05-20T11:49:43] Artem Bulashev: It’s same as Vtc6
[2021-05-20T11:49:49] Artem Bulashev: Only label changed
[2021-05-20T11:49:55] Artem Bulashev: No chemical difference
[2021-05-20T11:50:03] Artem Bulashev: Have seen people compare them
[2021-05-20T11:51:43] Artem Bulashev: Test is 2016 so I guess if some one would be ready to send 2 pcs to him he would agree to test Murata VTC6 as well, I can ask if any one has
[2021-05-20T11:52:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for bus, it's complicated 😅 I2C : can't really do "long distance" 😅 SPI : not good on long distance RS485 : not easy to use with ESP32 UART : require 4 wires, can't be chained CAN BUS : require chip able to process CAN bus (expensive) One-wire : cheap (bitbang), long distance (up to 800m) ... can even work with only 2 wires (including power) and some sensors/chips are directly compatible with one-wire. PJON : very rare. never tried. few libraries. but very interesting

[2021-05-20T11:53:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: when you place the "head" (SmartDisplay) on the handlebar, it needs to support over 1.5/2m distance.
[2021-05-20T11:53:48] francois schempers: i will order 150 for my futur battery, 160 to be safe so I will spare 2 for him to test ;)
[2021-05-20T11:54:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, the issue is : they don't provide raw datas for the graphics. I have to recreate the discharge curve in numbers in excel, redraw it, and extract an estimated formula.
[2021-05-20T11:55:08] Artem Bulashev: Uart - requires 3 lines 5v could be taken locally to second board
[2021-05-20T11:55:21] Artem Bulashev: I will have them for 35e
[2021-05-20T11:55:28] Artem Bulashev: I donate cells to him
[2021-05-20T11:55:34] Artem Bulashev: Will it help?
[2021-05-20T11:55:41] francois schempers: even if you msg him ? he must have the info already in excel format
[2021-05-20T11:55:56] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-05-20T11:56:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for VESC, on some devices, yes (but max current available isn't often indicated). on most escotter, never seen. mostly vbat and 12V for lights & co.
[2021-05-20T11:56:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: never tried, it's a good idea !
[2021-05-20T11:57:31] francois schempers: imagine he give you a big excel with all the curves of all the battery 😂😂
[2021-05-20T11:57:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it would be awesome !
[2021-05-20T11:57:57] Artem Bulashev: Perfect than I will ask him for that data once he tests my 35e3 and 35e4
[2021-05-20T12:02:50] Artem Bulashev: 80gb xcel
[2021-05-20T19:00:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: onewire bus working between the smart and what will become the first expansion board 😉

[2021-05-20T19:32:28] Unknown: 👍
[2021-05-20T21:46:29] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌 what is that board ?
[2021-05-20T21:47:40] Artem Bulashev: Looks like esp as well. May be wireless communication between them could also be an option like LBE
[2021-05-20T21:50:43] Artem Bulashev: Pain to implement though may be
[2021-05-20T21:50:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it will be an expansion board, to allow any kind of control with a 3 wires bus
[2021-05-20T21:51:11] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2021-05-20T21:51:18] Mirono escooters: Ur smort af
[2021-05-20T21:51:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ?? 🤣
[2021-05-20T21:51:46] Mirono escooters: U are smort
[2021-05-20T21:51:51] Mirono escooters: Smort is smart
[2021-05-20T21:52:16] Artem Bulashev: A
[2021-05-20T21:52:18] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-05-20T21:52:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a small esp8266 (to have enougth power tonprocess the bus and control other devices - i tried attiny, it's shit)
[2021-05-20T21:53:01] Artem Bulashev: Attiny?
[2021-05-20T21:53:14] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2021-05-20T21:53:19] Artem Bulashev: MCU
[2021-05-20T21:53:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. in 3.3v it's limited to 8/12mhz
[2021-05-20T21:53:26] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-05-20T21:55:09] Artem Bulashev: Strange ATiny85 is commonly used for such simple tasks
[2021-05-20T21:55:11] Artem Bulashev: But ok :)
[2021-05-20T21:55:25] Artem Bulashev: I’m not expert in E design
[2021-05-20T21:56:13] Artem Bulashev: It’s bigger bro?
[2021-05-20T21:57:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: onewire and pjon buses can't work corretcly with only 8mhz 😓
[2021-05-20T21:59:27] Artem Bulashev: Makes sense ok
[2021-05-20T22:02:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: much much bigger, yes 😁 my goal : the smallest to avoid taking too much space in the deck 😉
[2021-05-20T23:43:19] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌 same goal than hehe
[2021-05-21T17:47:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: trying a new PCB fully integrated for SmartDisplay ;)
[2021-05-21T17:47:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-21_17-47-17.png>
[2021-05-21T17:55:01] Mirono escooters: Designed with wich program?
[2021-05-21T17:56:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: EasyEDA (for easier components stock management & printing with JLCPDB)
[2021-05-21T17:56:39] Mirono escooters: Gottit! I wanna get into designing pcb

[2021-05-21T18:30:08] Happy Giraffe: 10k cycle 82% capacity damn
[2021-05-21T18:30:28] Happy Giraffe: With Samsung inr maybe 400-500 lol
[2021-05-21T18:44:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if it really arrive on the market ... at good price ... yes. but every month we see something "revolutionary" in batteries, and nothing comes up. 😢
[2021-05-21T18:48:39] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, 10 years of testing
[2021-05-21T18:53:09] Artem Bulashev: True even 50s Samsung :))
[2021-05-21T19:00:37] Happy Giraffe: 18650 li-ion is like 1990 tech haha
[2021-05-21T19:00:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😁😁
[2021-05-21T19:53:47] francois schempers: yeah lets talk about Tesla's tabless design, all that fuss for nothing, nothing out of factory 1 years after ^^
[2021-05-21T19:55:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😂😅
[2021-05-22T19:48:19] Unknown: Tesla 4680 tablesd nickel batteries at the end of 2022
[2021-05-22T19:49:22] Unknown: And he is mixing tech from other companies...or universities...
[2021-05-22T19:49:23] Mirono escooters: They dont even have a cid Dangerous when mis handled😅😅

[2021-05-22T21:43:41] Artem Bulashev: Log
[2021-05-22T22:17:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: let's go with the latest boards !
[2021-05-22T22:17:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-22_22-17-56.png>
[2021-05-22T22:18:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I'll try manual assembly ;)
[2021-05-22T23:37:28] Unknown: If you can solder shouldn't be a problem....
[2021-05-22T23:41:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: now i have eveything. not pro material, but a good ksger soldering station, hot gun, hot plate, solder paste, flux. it should be ok. 😅😅
[2021-05-23T09:24:15] Artem Bulashev: Sounds like you should be good :)) I assembled similar type / size component boards with just No brand reflow station 👌👌 just need the past that flows well 😁
[2021-05-23T10:49:29] Unknown: Oo good luck man! What site?
[2021-05-23T10:56:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: jlcpcb
[2021-05-23T10:56:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-05-23T10:56:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i also added a new 'vesc' jumper to force the uart output in 3.3v 😁
[2021-05-23T21:06:29] Artem Bulashev: That’s good one
[2021-05-24T14:57:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: new assembly with anti-glare glass and silicone... and the new 3.5" VA screen (high constrat. i am curious to see the result under sun.
[2021-05-24T14:57:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_184@24-05-2021_14-57-33.jpg>
[2021-05-24T14:59:05] Artem Bulashev: 😍😍
[2021-05-24T14:59:39] Artem Bulashev: Love the buttons :) best part they can be custom fit into any 3D print we later want
[2021-05-24T14:59:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes 😉
[2021-05-24T15:00:50] Artem Bulashev: Can’t wait to test it out
[2021-05-24T15:02:20] Artem Bulashev: How much you figure it would cost to get a kit like such ? :-) want to start testing it on vesc 😅😁😁
[2021-05-24T15:04:23] Unknown: I like the buttons too
[2021-05-24T15:13:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: only the hardware, not assembled ? it will be around 100€ (10€ for buttons / 90€ for SmartDisplay parts ... (just the screen, it's 20€ 😅😅)) + 40€ for R&D + 10€ for shipping you'll need to : - print 3D parts - solder everything by yourself (including some hard stuff like LCD FPC connector, hot gun and solder paste recommended) in this case, it's really a DIY kit and require some electronic skills ;)
[2021-05-24T15:21:35] Artem Bulashev: Perfect kit for me 😁😁👌👌👌 when can we make some love exchange? 😛
[2021-05-24T15:23:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: in 2 weeks, I should receive all the parts (new PCB + components). I need to make some tests (especially with the new voltage regulator). I'll keep you informed.
[2021-05-24T15:23:51] Tudor: Can i have one reserved for me ? I need this for my vescs 😁😁
[2021-05-24T15:24:19] Artem Bulashev: Would love that too :))
[2021-05-24T15:24:43] Artem Bulashev: Did you work anything out with Spintend btw? They said you contacted them all ok
[2021-05-24T15:25:18] Tudor: I have 2 scooters for now with vescs
[2021-05-24T15:25:24] Tudor: One is 13 s and one 16 s
[2021-05-24T15:25:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hahaha ... keep cool guys, it's not ready until it's tested :D
[2021-05-24T15:25:37] Artem Bulashev: 🥰🥰
[2021-05-24T15:27:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if everything works, I'll be able to order assembled PCB, but if you want naked PCB + components, I should have some. currently : 4 boards for me / 2 boards for a friend = 4 parts left.
[2021-05-24T15:30:30] Artem Bulashev: I suspect larger order assembled will cost similar to small boards + components
[2021-05-24T15:41:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think too.
[2021-05-24T15:45:37] Unknown: 2 for me please
[2021-05-24T15:46:14] Unknown: Luxus Tudor....nice
[2021-05-24T16:00:21] Luis Magalhaes: Spintend contacted me too about the foam, my ubox is coming without the mod too i have to do it my self 😜
[2021-05-24T16:00:38] Luis Magalhaes: Whats the 16S?
[2021-05-24T17:33:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: latest version mounted !
[2021-05-24T17:34:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and one photo with direct sun reflection

[2021-05-24T17:35:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with this new high contrast screen and anti-glare glass, it's much better. still not perfect under direct sunlight, bit i don't think it's possible to do better with a true lcd screen
[2021-05-24T17:35:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: or may be a mate anti-glare filter (but uglier)
[2021-05-24T17:37:04] Luis Magalhaes: Direct sun is always a problem 😅
[2021-05-24T17:37:13] Luis Magalhaes: Looks nice 👌
[2021-05-24T17:49:41] Unknown: Great, we are moving forward
[2021-05-24T17:50:26] Mirono escooters: The display is soooo good
[2021-05-24T17:50:33] Mirono escooters: But loose cables give me anxiety
[2021-05-24T17:50:33] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2021-05-24T17:51:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I've just fixed them ;)
[2021-05-24T17:51:13] Unknown: 😂😂😂😂😂
[2021-05-24T17:52:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: better, no ? 😁
[2021-05-24T17:53:29] Happy Giraffe: We can just use hand to cover the screen. Not many direct sunny days in Denmark in a year😂
[2021-05-24T17:55:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah ... yes, and direct sun reflection is quite rare. there is often an angle ;)
[2021-05-24T17:56:51] Happy Giraffe: I dont see anything on my xiaomi display with cover and lights on anyways😂
[2021-05-24T17:58:00] Happy Giraffe: Not that important when riding and looking for potholes
[2021-05-24T17:58:11] Happy Giraffe: And cars that want to kill you
[2021-05-24T17:58:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: does anyone have electronic skills ? I think a need a better PNP (Q6) for brightness control. this one is heating a lot. (130mA for the screen backlight). 52°C (+27°C vs ambiant temperature) on the PCB once in the box.
[2021-05-24T17:58:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-24_17-58-24.png>
[2021-05-24T17:58:32] Happy Giraffe: Denis Yurev👀 but hes a busy man
[2021-05-24T17:59:32] Happy Giraffe: What about Oled screen?
[2021-05-24T17:59:38] Happy Giraffe: Too expensive?
[2021-05-24T18:00:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: often, yes, and it often require more than 5V input.
[2021-05-24T18:01:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I had a LOT of difficulties to find this one :
[2021-05-24T18:02:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: - fast SPI (for quick refresh) - vsync - high contrast & luminosity (I tried a lot of cheap & dirty TFT TN screen 😢) - 3.3V
[2021-05-24T18:03:44] Happy Giraffe: Vsync lmao, what about the oldschool screens used in 2000- phones?
[2021-05-24T18:04:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: none compatible with SPI bus
[2021-05-24T18:04:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with 'slow' SPI refresh and tearing, I can warranty you it was uggly 😅😅
[2021-05-24T18:05:03] Happy Giraffe: Then I guess what you have now is really impressive, direct sunlight is a rarity. We shouldnt overengineer to make a car missile proof
[2021-05-24T18:05:36] Happy Giraffe: Next, variable refresh rate and G-sync with DLSS 2.0
[2021-05-24T18:05:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-24T18:06:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahaha... no, but my last screen, just during a normal day light, it was almost impossible to see something.
[2021-05-24T18:06:52] Happy Giraffe: Here with small head movement you could actually see I think
[2021-05-24T18:07:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, and as told, this exposition almost never happen 😋
[2021-05-24T18:07:44] Happy Giraffe: And we would wear sunglasses on day like that, no?😂
[2021-05-24T18:09:17] Mirono escooters: Oof Add heatsink?
[2021-05-24T18:09:45] Mirono escooters: Them365dash uses oled Its very nice
[2021-05-24T18:11:57] Happy Giraffe: Tiny heatsinks require air flow to be somewhat useful
[2021-05-24T18:12:50] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-24T18:12:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 52/53° is not really an issue (most components works up to 125°C), but it bother me. as soon as you ride, the temperature drop to ambiant temperature.
[2021-05-24T18:15:25] Happy Giraffe: Maybe only warms up if left on a direct sunlight on parking lot/traffic light then🤔
[2021-05-24T18:27:48] Mirono escooters: Fair enough.
[2021-05-24T18:38:32] Luis Magalhaes: Talking about heat, do you think i should use something above the spintend ou just the deck of the scooter is enough to cool it ?
[2021-05-24T18:39:39] Luis Magalhaes: The vesc is so tinny that im always thinking it will work hot 😅
[2021-05-24T19:12:08] francois schempers: what about a plain old cube of copper ? if the problem occurs only at iddle, and disappear when you ride, you just need to buy some time until the rider goes. a heat mass on the thing should keep it low temps for several minutes, that would be enough no ?
[2021-05-24T19:22:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but before that, I'd like to rethink the circuit ;)
[2021-05-24T19:39:15] francois schempers: true true x)
[2021-05-24T19:39:53] Happy Giraffe: Does some other componen near heat it?
[2021-05-24T19:42:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the temperature sensor is at 1cm of the TFT dim PNP. no other heating component close to the sensor on the same PCB. but on the other ESP PCB, there is the AMS 5->3.3V regulator heating a bit. the main regulator is on the other side of the shield board (this one heat ... impossible to go from 50-100V to 5V without heating 😁 ). in fact, I think the whole board is heating through the GND plan on the back of the shield acting as radiator
[2021-05-24T19:44:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-24_19-44-45.png>
[2021-05-24T19:45:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1 = PNP TFT 2 = temperature sensor 3 = main regulator
[2021-05-24T19:45:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I would need a thermal imager to find exactly what's heating 🤣
[2021-05-24T19:47:26] Mirono escooters: Expensive stuff. I want one for long xd
[2021-05-24T19:47:51] Mirono escooters: Some.chips just use the pcb as a tiny heatsink
[2021-05-24T19:47:54] Mirono escooters: Like those small step up
[2021-05-24T19:47:59] Mirono escooters: Get real hot
[2021-05-24T19:48:01] Mirono escooters: 100*+
[2021-05-24T19:52:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: completly true. the main reugulator does that. the bottom pad is a thermal pad. I even used vias to communicate the temparature to the bottom GND plan ;)
[2021-05-24T19:53:11] Mirono escooters: Hahah wow. Smort
[2021-05-24T19:53:17] Mirono escooters: Features😎😆
[2021-05-24T21:59:49] Unknown: They're no so expensive depends on the resolution
[2021-05-24T22:01:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you find me references in 3-3.5" with SPI and 3.3v or 5V power suply, I'm listening ;)
[2021-05-25T10:30:12] Artem Bulashev: Thermals start from 40€
[2021-05-25T10:30:43] Artem Bulashev: US $48.22 20％ Off | AMG8833 Thermal Imaging Camera Infrared Thermal Imager Mini IR Imaging Senor https://a.aliexpress.com/_AED36L
[2021-05-25T10:31:48] Mirono escooters: Not accurate tho and small
[2021-05-25T10:42:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i worked with thermal imager in a previous job. it's very complicated. i don't know they could make such small things with accurate datas. it require a colling machine (at least peltier cooler) to get good images.
[2021-05-25T10:42:42] Mirono escooters: Anyone know a decent thermal camera like flir. But not for 400€ xd
[2021-05-25T10:42:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2021-05-25T10:43:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a good calibrated ntc should do the job.
[2021-05-25T10:43:22] Artem Bulashev: You need only relative compare
[2021-05-25T10:43:35] Artem Bulashev: For that any will work
[2021-05-25T10:43:47] Artem Bulashev: Because it will compare amount sensors correctly
[2021-05-25T10:45:01] Artem Bulashev: But ultimate measurement may not be accurate indeed (so it will say spot A 5c spot b 25c - difference will be accurate 20c but ultimate it may be 8c and 28c, not 5c and 25c) - from my knowledge of how those are built
[2021-05-25T10:45:55] Mirono escooters: I just need to see heat location not * tbh
[2021-05-25T10:45:59] Mirono escooters: I got a finger to feel heat xd
[2021-05-25T10:46:02] Mirono escooters: Or a temp probe
[2021-05-25T10:46:08] Mirono escooters: Just cznt find the small spot with finger
[2021-05-25T12:07:57] francois schempers: maybe you can just rent a very good one for a day, since you will juste test your stuff and be done with it
[2021-05-25T12:18:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: excellent idea !
[2021-05-25T12:31:52] Unknown: What could be the reason that scooter rides fine, but the kers doesn't work🧐
[2021-05-25T12:33:11] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I’m sure some one has one near by
[2021-05-25T12:34:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with vesc ?
[2021-05-25T12:35:45] Unknown: No Xiaomi ESC 🧐

[2021-05-25T13:22:09] francois schempers: fully charged batterie ?
[2021-05-25T13:25:58] Happy Giraffe: And Rita v4?👀
[2021-05-25T13:32:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for those having vesc working on escooters, could you plase you motor and app xlm config files ?
[2021-05-25T13:34:12] Artem Bulashev: Will do later this week hopefully 😁
[2021-05-25T13:34:30] Mirono escooters: @Tudor_VTA
[2021-05-26T06:16:24] Artem Bulashev: Just worked out interesting data 10% and 20% depending on load - DoD 100-20 extends life of battery and prevents excessive heating up (lower charge = higher battery resistance) This explains why VSETT limits 60v controller at 52v = 3.25v (this data is from 35e that generally less steep curve but consistently 0.5v lower voltage than most cells) • vsett controllers lower output power gradually, almost as if “battery max current” is lower every time battery gets down to 52v, out put lowers, voltage goes up, once it gets to 52v again it lower output again. That keeps on happening until about 1amp discharge per cell = 7amp on battery than = 360w at 52.5v at which point it just lets it discharge to 52v and shuts off than. • this gradual power reduction with change in output power down to 1amp per cell at 1amp load means battery is protected, driver is warned, and there is exactly 10% charge left in battery to extend battery life = also prevent battery over heat at low charge levels This is def something VESC should implement (specially with all the smart BMS)

[2021-05-26T09:16:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah. this is something i was planning to do, but with 'stupid controller' like minimotors, it's very hard. i should try with vesc, really easy.
[2021-05-26T10:39:42] Happy Giraffe: You have so many good ideas, maybe you could define the questions in a list and send to Benjamin?👀
[2021-05-26T10:41:02] francois schempers: who is Benjamin ? xD
[2021-05-26T10:48:38] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-05-26T11:07:57] Artem Bulashev: Just would require 2 values: total voltage + number of cells in the battery (can be entered manually, this way no need for smart BMS and would work even on mini-motor ;-) - doesn’t mini motor do similar thing as I did river above? Because vsett/zero are very similar to mini motor in many ways
[2021-05-26T12:33:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, they keep the same power when the battery voltage is becoming low. and the lcd starts to blink... then the controller cut the power (but way too early since a big acceleration kill the last volts)
[2021-05-26T12:47:30] Artem Bulashev: I see, that is stupid

[2021-05-26T14:29:44] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2021-05-26T14:29:53] Artem Bulashev: 🤣
[2021-05-26T14:30:36] Luis Magalhaes: Need to change the motor conectors to put them in 😁
[2021-05-26T14:32:21] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I’m considering, not sure what kind of amps I will be able to put through 650w 52v nominal motor
[2021-05-26T14:32:54] Luis Magalhaes: I will start low 😂
[2021-05-26T14:33:39] Luis Magalhaes: 60v 1200w nominal motor
[2021-05-26T14:37:42] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2021-05-26T14:38:10] Artem Bulashev: I will start 60v 28amp battery amps per motor (for now one motor, second one is on the way)
[2021-05-26T14:39:27] Luis Magalhaes: Nice
[2021-05-26T14:39:38] Artem Bulashev: I think we had estimatations above what different nominal motors can handle
[2021-05-26T14:40:19] Luis Magalhaes: I'm waiting for the conneters, dont want to remove the ones on my minimotors controllers again 😅
[2021-05-26T14:41:21] Luis Magalhaes: I want to get at 50A battery and 100A motors
[2021-05-26T14:41:36] Luis Magalhaes: To be like the minimotors controllers i have
[2021-05-26T14:42:02] Luis Magalhaes: It will be diferent and i want to know how diferent in this controller
[2021-05-26T14:45:40] Artem Bulashev: Should be able to handle that Yes Most 500w can take 25amp well even on square wave
[2021-05-26T14:46:05] Artem Bulashev: So 50amps for 1200w and on sinewave should be safe even, but do check temp ;-)
[2021-05-26T14:52:22] Luis Magalhaes: Yes it was getting that on square no problem hope on sine i dont have problems 😂
[2021-05-26T14:52:53] Luis Magalhaes: If its like it was but more manageable and eficient i will be ok 😁
[2021-05-26T14:57:33] Artem Bulashev: Should get 80 on sine :) careful with battery limit though!! 😁😁 May be test max in single motor ahah
[2021-05-26T14:58:26] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-05-26T14:58:45] Luis Magalhaes: Have a 16s10p lg mj1
[2021-05-26T14:58:48] Luis Magalhaes: As main
[2021-05-26T14:59:09] Luis Magalhaes: And a lg mh1 16s6p in parallel
[2021-05-26T14:59:42] Luis Magalhaes: But don't want to pass the 100A for now 😂
[2021-05-26T15:03:48] Artem Bulashev: Oh man 10amps max before total over heat
[2021-05-26T15:04:02] Artem Bulashev: So def I would not go above 100amps on 10p
[2021-05-26T15:04:20] Artem Bulashev: Ohhh
[2021-05-26T15:45:23] Unknown: With ubox do you get Female and male connectors for motor cables?
[2021-05-26T15:45:45] Unknown: And is it xt60 or xt90 for battery?
[2021-05-26T15:59:14] Luis Magalhaes: Xt90
[2021-05-26T15:59:35] Luis Magalhaes: And just female
[2021-05-26T15:59:50] Luis Magalhaes: But i have to change them to 5.5mm conectors
[2021-05-26T16:00:29] Luis Magalhaes: Yup thats the max i want to go even with the other one in parallel
[2021-05-26T16:01:29] Luis Magalhaes: In minimotor pushing 100A the 10p was giving ~65A and the parallel the rest to 100A
[2021-05-26T17:11:00] francois schempers: tien tien tien x)
[2021-05-26T18:06:26] Artem Bulashev: You get motor cable connector the other side - xt90
[2021-05-26T18:06:36] Artem Bulashev: But not motor connectors

[2021-05-27T00:01:54] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_207@27-05-2021_00-01-54.jpg>
[2021-05-27T00:02:07] Luis Magalhaes: And show this in firmware configurator
[2021-05-27T00:02:27] Luis Magalhaes: Why is it coming with 75/300?
[2021-05-27T00:02:42] Luis Magalhaes: Going to try to plug the pc by usb

[2021-05-27T00:08:39] Luis Magalhaes: And the battery current is for each motor right?
[2021-05-27T00:14:34] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_211@27-05-2021_00-14-34.jpg>
[2021-05-27T00:15:11] Luis Magalhaes: @artBula any help please?
[2021-05-27T00:16:23] Artem Bulashev: Yeah. All that space is only there to mount top cover. Could be easily designed without need for those dedicated 10 screws.
[2021-05-27T00:17:19] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-05-27T00:17:29] Artem Bulashev: I didn’t plug it in yet.
[2021-05-27T00:17:51] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2021-05-27T00:17:54] Artem Bulashev: Sounds like different escs have different sw version
[2021-05-27T00:18:04] Artem Bulashev: Check data in both with Usb cable

[2021-05-27T00:18:31] Artem Bulashev: I bet 😁
[2021-05-27T00:18:52] Luis Magalhaes: The last one had other firmware
[2021-05-27T00:19:34] Luis Magalhaes: But they said to me that they would test it before sending to me maybe that's why some values are not as default 😅

[2021-05-27T00:21:39] Luis Magalhaes: In the other vesc
[2021-05-27T00:22:25] Luis Magalhaes: And do you guys think i should do it with medium outruner?
[2021-05-27T00:22:34] Luis Magalhaes: I did it last time
[2021-05-27T00:28:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: my advise ? take the firmawre version from spinted website and flash it on both vesc cores
[2021-05-27T00:32:43] Luis Magalhaes: It came from spintend like this 😅

[2021-05-27T01:49:17] Luis Magalhaes: In windows i had no problemm
[2021-05-27T01:49:33] Luis Magalhaes: Have to connect to battery
[2021-05-27T01:58:25] Luis Magalhaes: @artBula how are you fixing the vesc ?
[2021-05-27T02:07:05] Artem Bulashev: Not connecting via usb
[2021-05-27T02:07:10] Artem Bulashev: Remote works
[2021-05-27T02:07:47] Artem Bulashev: Tried to spin a wheel - but since it is not configured it fails (don’t worry I’m not pushing it, it can fry aomething if I would)
[2021-05-27T02:07:55] Artem Bulashev: But no connection over Usb
[2021-05-27T02:11:25] Luis Magalhaes: strange
[2021-05-27T02:12:12] Luis Magalhaes: mine connected via Bluetooth in the android phone, and via usb in windows
[2021-05-27T02:16:37] Artem Bulashev: 🤷‍♂️
[2021-05-27T02:28:30] Luis Magalhaes: it was powered on before you try to conect via usb?
[2021-05-27T02:28:43] Luis Magalhaes: stupid question i know... lolol
[2021-05-27T02:28:58] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I rebooted via button multiple times
[2021-05-27T02:29:09] Artem Bulashev: And re plugged
[2021-05-27T02:29:29] Artem Bulashev: Lois like it’s dead on arrival😖
[2021-05-27T02:29:34] Luis Magalhaes: and did your computer reconized the usb conection ?
[2021-05-27T02:31:45] Luis Magalhaes: mine makes a sound when i plug the usb cable
[2021-05-27T02:41:33] Artem Bulashev: Done
[2021-05-27T02:42:04] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_221@27-05-2021_02-42-04.jpg>
[2021-05-27T02:43:11] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know why it would be even possible, but it worked with this powered adapter to usb2.
[2021-05-27T02:43:41] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-05-27T02:43:58] Artem Bulashev: But not with passive usb c to Usb2 adapter and not with any of usbC-usbC cables 😂👌
[2021-05-27T02:43:59] Luis Magalhaes: it worked just that matters
[2021-05-27T02:44:03] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-27T02:44:38] Luis Magalhaes: i used my tablet cable is the only usb type C at home 🤣
[2021-05-27T03:03:56] Artem Bulashev: Did you set motor poles?
[2021-05-27T03:27:25] Luis Magalhaes: no just did the motor wizard
[2021-05-27T05:45:26] Artem Bulashev: UBOX fits in beautifully even into Vsett9 - not finally way it will be. (Need to remove UBOX mounting holes on one side, this will free extra 1cm of space for battery) - power wires + motor wires run on left side of the deck (in outside plastic) - signal wires + wires to ESP32 and breaks and extras like Gps will run on right side of the deck (in outside plastic) = clean EMI environment.

[2021-05-27T17:16:55] Artem Bulashev: Is there iPhone app?
[2021-05-27T17:17:30] Artem Bulashev: Don’t have a single android device beside 65inch TV 🥵 would not be convinient
[2021-05-27T17:17:32] Luis Magalhaes: But have batery to 50A and the bms shows me 52A
[2021-05-27T17:17:43] Luis Magalhaes: Even using 80A
[2021-05-27T17:18:06] Luis Magalhaes: Is it the mas battery for the 2 sides or for each side?
[2021-05-27T17:18:27] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂 you can do it i belive in you 😜
[2021-05-27T17:18:47] Artem Bulashev: That’s the 4% efficiency loss
[2021-05-27T17:18:47] Luis Magalhaes: Did not vesc tools work in aplle devices?
[2021-05-27T17:19:28] Luis Magalhaes: I was thinking it was 50A for each controller
[2021-05-27T17:19:38] Luis Magalhaes: The bms should show 100A +-
[2021-05-27T17:26:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't think there is
[2021-05-27T17:29:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_228@27-05-2021_17-29-09.jpg>
[2021-05-27T17:29:35] Mirono escooters: Fck apple
[2021-05-27T17:32:37] Happy Giraffe: You can get older Huawei phones really cheap on used market
[2021-05-27T17:58:41] Artem Bulashev: Yeah down to 20€ on flee market like Facebook
[2021-05-27T18:34:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-27T18:37:16] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_229@27-05-2021_18-37-16.jpg>
[2021-05-27T18:38:21] Luis Magalhaes: Had the mosfet start cuting power at 55°c it did not hit 55 but was cutting power 😅
[2021-05-27T18:38:36] Mirono escooters: Battery?
[2021-05-27T18:39:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you checked the temp just after the cut ?
[2021-05-27T18:42:49] Luis Magalhaes: Yes battery
[2021-05-27T18:43:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: arff ... BMS cut 😅😅
[2021-05-27T18:43:35] Luis Magalhaes: It was not a hard cut it was reducing the power, the higher o saw was 52°c
[2021-05-27T18:43:45] Luis Magalhaes: But it cool down rapidly
[2021-05-27T18:44:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I wonder if VESC doesn't limit power before exceeding the max temperature set
[2021-05-27T18:44:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: anyway, mosfets can go muchhhh higher
[2021-05-27T18:44:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 55°C is cold for a MOSFET :D
[2021-05-27T18:48:19] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i know i was just playing safe 😂 the default is 80 or 85
[2021-05-27T18:48:47] Luis Magalhaes: The max i amp i showed is higher then that 😂
[2021-05-27T18:48:57] Luis Magalhaes: Forget i had the parallel battery
[2021-05-27T18:49:04] Luis Magalhaes: No smart bms in that one
[2021-05-27T18:49:12] Luis Magalhaes: This was just the mais battery
[2021-05-27T18:49:36] Luis Magalhaes: Is 60A battery to each controller in vesc tools
[2021-05-27T18:49:57] Luis Magalhaes: Had to tune the pid too it was to slow on start 😅
[2021-05-27T18:50:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahha ... so, VESC can burn tires ? 🤣
[2021-05-27T19:17:35] Luis Magalhaes: Well mine does not burn 😅
[2021-05-27T19:18:05] Luis Magalhaes: It can do something in the sand 😂😂
[2021-05-27T19:18:23] Luis Magalhaes: Maybe have to adjust something
[2021-05-27T19:18:37] Luis Magalhaes: The pid helped a lot
[2021-05-27T19:21:41] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_230@27-05-2021_19-21-41.jpg>
[2021-05-27T19:21:49] Luis Magalhaes: Only the main battery
[2021-05-27T19:21:55] Mirono escooters: Poor thing
[2021-05-27T19:22:16] Luis Magalhaes: Why? 😂
[2021-05-27T19:22:31] Mirono escooters: Alot of amps xd
[2021-05-27T19:32:25] Luis Magalhaes: Too many? 😅
[2021-05-27T19:32:34] Mirono escooters: Never too much
[2021-05-27T19:32:39] Mirono escooters: Just a lot
[2021-05-27T19:32:43] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-05-27T19:38:10] Luis Magalhaes: Hope i can give it a bit more torque , but don't know how 😂
[2021-05-27T19:39:52] Mirono escooters: Even moreee??😆
[2021-05-27T19:41:31] Luis Magalhaes: Yes its not that powerfull 😅
[2021-05-27T19:41:40] Mirono escooters: Awd?
[2021-05-27T19:41:42] Mirono escooters: Wich motor
[2021-05-27T19:41:50] Luis Magalhaes: Awd
[2021-05-27T19:41:53] Mirono escooters: Wlw
[2021-05-27T19:41:55] Mirono escooters: Wow
[2021-05-27T19:42:17] Luis Magalhaes: They are the too at 60A battery and 100A motor 😅
[2021-05-27T19:42:41] Luis Magalhaes: The pid mods helped a lot even at start
[2021-05-27T19:42:51] Luis Magalhaes: It was ramping up too slow 😂
[2021-05-27T19:42:53] Mirono escooters: I have 2000w total on xiaomi controllers awd and think it's fast already in pull up😅
[2021-05-27T19:43:07] Luis Magalhaes: Good for amp draw but not cool
[2021-05-27T19:43:09] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2021-05-27T19:44:49] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i know it should be ok but my comparison term is with the minimotors setup i had
[2021-05-27T19:45:36] Luis Magalhaes: It was too mutch torque to start up but was more responsive
[2021-05-27T19:46:44] Luis Magalhaes: That was wheel spining 😂 no i almoust can't wheel spin in some sand on road 😂
[2021-05-27T19:47:02] Luis Magalhaes: I think it can be adjusted but don't know how
[2021-05-27T19:50:17] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2021-05-27T19:54:18] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-05-27T22:18:36] Artem Bulashev: https://open-smartwatch.github.io
[2021-05-28T19:39:19] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2021-05-28T19:39:35] Luis Magalhaes: If i pass the control do duty cycle it make this
[2021-05-28T19:39:51] Luis Magalhaes: And the acelerator pulses to 1.5v 😅
[2021-05-28T19:40:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳
[2021-05-28T19:40:17] Luis Magalhaes: But the lights are off and directly to battery 🙈
[2021-05-28T19:40:55] Luis Magalhaes: In current mode no problem and the min throtlle flutuates from 0.83 +-0.02
[2021-05-28T19:41:38] Luis Magalhaes: In duty cycle she wants to start by itself 😂😂
[2021-05-28T19:41:57] Luis Magalhaes: Any one knows why?
[2021-05-28T19:42:46] Luis Magalhaes: In current no reverse 50% brake it flashes the light too and de motor have spikes
[2021-05-28T19:45:55] Luis Magalhaes: So if i throtlle it lights up a little too
[2021-05-28T19:45:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: just a warning, most throttle are equiped with honeywell S49E sensors. Those sensors are not made to work very well with only 3.3V. You need to power them with 5V ... but then, the output is between 0.8V and 4.2V ... which his too much for the VESC. this is also why I had to make the adaptation board with programmable output DAC voltage. I made the error at the beginning and my 49E sensor output was VERY noisy when powered with only 3.3V
[2021-05-28T19:45:58] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2021-05-28T19:46:44] Luis Magalhaes: Oh shit 😅
[2021-05-28T19:47:12] Luis Magalhaes: Ok so that explains the flutuating values
[2021-05-28T19:47:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think, yes
[2021-05-28T19:47:38] Luis Magalhaes: But it look likes only doing that at minimum value
[2021-05-28T19:48:05] Luis Magalhaes: And i dont think its doing that in current controll mode
[2021-05-28T19:48:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: VESC can do numeric filter on it, but I should increase latency a bit.
[2021-05-28T19:50:22] Luis Magalhaes: Yep its always unless until 3.3v
[2021-05-28T19:51:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but if it's only +0.02V noise, it's really low. You just need to add "dead band"
[2021-05-28T19:51:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: send a screenshot of ADC mapping page
[2021-05-28T19:53:02] Artem Bulashev: Forgot to share
[2021-05-28T19:53:14] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_231@28-05-2021_19-53-14.jpg>
[2021-05-28T19:53:17] Artem Bulashev: 😁
[2021-05-28T19:53:44] Artem Bulashev: It is quickest 500-600w single motor times I ever saw :)) It is same times as 1000-1200w single motor scooters haha Actually it is as fast up to 30kmh as Widewheely Pro (dual motor)
[2021-05-28T19:53:47] Luis Magalhaes: And its pluged in 5v to 😅
[2021-05-28T19:54:16] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_232@28-05-2021_19-54-16.jpg>
[2021-05-28T19:55:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ARGHHH !!!! /!\/!\/!\ big warning ! input more than 3.3V on ADC input of the VESC STM32 can quickly fry it !
[2021-05-28T19:55:17] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_233@28-05-2021_19-55-17.jpg>
[2021-05-28T19:55:17] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_234@28-05-2021_19-55-17.jpg>
[2021-05-28T19:55:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's clearly written in STM32 specs
[2021-05-28T19:55:28] Luis Magalhaes: Shit
[2021-05-28T19:55:39] Luis Magalhaes: Did not see that 😅
[2021-05-28T19:56:02] Luis Magalhaes: @koxx3 your a life safer mate
[2021-05-28T19:56:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah. there is no voltage divider or protection between ADC input and STM32
[2021-05-28T19:56:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: at least on all official schematics of VESC 4/6
[2021-05-28T19:56:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but I doubt ubox has
[2021-05-28T19:57:35] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i doubt it too, they have a add on to plug acelerator and brakes to add to vesc because of flutuating and shit should be in there i think
[2021-05-28T19:58:14] Luis Magalhaes: Wait
[2021-05-28T19:58:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: direct connection ... VESC 6
[2021-05-28T19:58:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-28_19-58-34.png>
[2021-05-28T19:58:34] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_235@28-05-2021_19-58-34.jpg>
[2021-05-28T19:58:41] Luis Magalhaes: Only 5v?!
[2021-05-28T19:59:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: measure VCC. I guess it's 3.3V
[2021-05-28T19:59:30] Luis Magalhaes: Ok
[2021-05-28T20:00:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: STM32 works a 3.3V or 3.4V on most VESCs
[2021-05-28T20:00:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-28_20-00-56.png>
[2021-05-28T20:02:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and THAT is the most important :
[2021-05-28T20:02:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-28_20-02-31.png>
[2021-05-28T20:02:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: UART pin mav voltage : 3.3V + 4V = 7.3V
[2021-05-28T20:03:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ADC pin : 4V
[2021-05-28T20:03:25] Ivan: vcc is 3.3v
[2021-05-28T20:03:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and this is ABSOLUTE MAX. throttle can often go to 4.1 / 4.2V if powered in 5V
[2021-05-28T20:04:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-05-28T20:04:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the other option is to simply use a voltage divider made of 2 resistors (1K an 2K will do the job) on the output and still power the S49E throttle at 5V
[2021-05-28T20:04:58] Luis Magalhaes: Vcc 3.3
[2021-05-28T20:05:42] Luis Magalhaes: Sorry did not read was mesuring 😂
[2021-05-28T20:06:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol ... power off before you burn something 🤣🤣
[2021-05-28T20:07:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: normal limits :
[2021-05-28T20:07:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-28_20-07-03.png>
[2021-05-28T20:07:37] Luis Magalhaes: All off
[2021-05-28T20:07:51] Luis Magalhaes: I made 53km today with ot 😅
[2021-05-28T20:08:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-05-28T20:08:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: don't forget, it's not because it works not that it won't stress the STM ... and die 😅😅
[2021-05-28T20:08:28] Luis Magalhaes: I did not full throttle many times 😂😂
[2021-05-28T20:08:55] Artem Bulashev: They are golden right now with this shortage ahah
[2021-05-28T20:08:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I made the same mistake ... this is why I looked. 🙈🤣
[2021-05-28T20:09:03] Luis Magalhaes: Yes will change it to vcc
[2021-05-28T20:09:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah ... and check if the output doesn't vary too much
[2021-05-28T20:09:43] Luis Magalhaes: So this throtlle will not work well in 3.3v?
[2021-05-28T20:09:56] Artem Bulashev: Best to use converter on the way
[2021-05-28T20:09:57] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_236@28-05-2021_20-09-57.jpg>
[2021-05-28T20:10:06] Luis Magalhaes: Dont know what this use 😂😂
[2021-05-28T20:10:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: mine didn't (multiple version). a lot of noise at 3.3V. but you will quickly see in ADC panel of VESC tools
[2021-05-28T20:10:27] Artem Bulashev: It’s not great to run 5v throttle from 3v or or 5v on 3v MCU
[2021-05-28T20:10:50] Luis Magalhaes: 😅🙈
[2021-05-28T20:11:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 2 resistors, it's not the end of the world ;)
[2021-05-28T20:11:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: here is what I use :
[2021-05-28T20:11:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-28_20-11-54.png>
[2021-05-28T20:12:10] Artem Bulashev: True easy solution for some people
[2021-05-28T20:12:21] Artem Bulashev: For some easier to buy other throttle haha
[2021-05-28T20:12:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: forget OUT_THROT_LCD and the capacitor
[2021-05-28T20:12:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-28T20:13:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: true, but you'll never know what sensor is inside 😅
[2021-05-28T20:16:34] Luis Magalhaes: At 3.3v its giving 0v
[2021-05-28T20:17:08] Luis Magalhaes: Does not work with 3.3v input?
[2021-05-28T20:18:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: argh ... mine did work but with a lot of noise
[2021-05-28T20:19:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: then voltage divider is your only hope
[2021-05-28T20:21:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh yes, I forgot. I fried multiple ESP32 with normal throttle output (4.1/4.2V) 😭😭
[2021-05-28T20:22:13] Luis Magalhaes: Using it conected to 5v?
[2021-05-28T20:22:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-05-28T20:22:43] Luis Magalhaes: So its 2 resistor conecting the adc1 output to ground?
[2021-05-28T20:22:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with 103X, 270X and minimotors throttle
[2021-05-28T20:23:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, as a voltage divider ;)
[2021-05-28T20:23:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: up
[2021-05-28T20:24:25] Luis Magalhaes: 1 in series with the adc1 and one in parallel from adc1 to ground?
[2021-05-28T20:24:48] Luis Magalhaes: Im not a electronic master 😅
[2021-05-28T20:25:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes 👍
[2021-05-28T20:25:12] Luis Magalhaes: The condenser have to use it too or is it just noise reduction?
[2021-05-28T20:25:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, forget it
[2021-05-28T20:26:08] Luis Magalhaes: So 1k ohm and 2k ohm resistor wright?
[2021-05-28T20:29:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-05-28T20:31:11] Luis Magalhaes: Tks, lets see if my friend have some to help me 😅
[2021-05-28T20:31:40] Luis Magalhaes: Was going to ride it to work tomorrow, i think im not going 😅
[2021-05-28T20:32:11] Luis Magalhaes: So another thing it heats a bit runing those 53km today
[2021-05-28T20:33:17] Luis Magalhaes: Had experienced something like front motor cutting and released throtlle at that time
[2021-05-28T20:33:38] Luis Magalhaes: Did see 75°c mos temp
[2021-05-28T20:34:02] Luis Magalhaes: Just when i accelerate a bit
[2021-05-28T20:34:39] Luis Magalhaes: And where runing in 60°c and after it get hot 70°c
[2021-05-28T20:34:57] Luis Magalhaes: Motors where almost cold
[2021-05-28T20:35:42] Artem Bulashev: Than you need to add more power 😁😁😁
[2021-05-28T20:35:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what is the max mosfet temp advised by ubox ?
[2021-05-28T20:36:03] Artem Bulashev: No idea
[2021-05-28T20:36:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we should ask them
[2021-05-28T20:36:17] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-05-28T20:36:35] Luis Magalhaes: In the settings its 85°c to start cutting
[2021-05-28T20:36:45] Luis Magalhaes: And 100°c to shutdown
[2021-05-28T20:37:07] Luis Magalhaes: Will send them an email 😅
[2021-05-28T20:37:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍👍👍👍👍
[2021-05-28T20:37:22] Luis Magalhaes: So i tryed to log it too
[2021-05-28T20:37:30] Luis Magalhaes: Where can i see the log in pc?
[2021-05-28T20:37:38] Luis Magalhaes: Any program ?
[2021-05-28T20:37:49] Luis Magalhaes: Or even in android 😅
[2021-05-28T20:39:40] Luis Magalhaes: Email send

[2021-05-28T20:42:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thanks, but no max temp advise ;)
[2021-05-28T20:43:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: current is a limit, but temperature is another one if you don't want to burn mosfets ;)
[2021-05-28T20:44:30] Luis Magalhaes: I dont want to burn any thing else 😂😂😂

[2021-05-28T20:45:54] Artem Bulashev: 135a max tested
[2021-05-28T20:47:44] Luis Magalhaes: It would get very hot in my setup 😅
[2021-05-28T20:48:00] Luis Magalhaes: Need to find a way to cool it down
[2021-05-28T20:52:13] Luis Magalhaes: My minimotors setup was +- 3s faster 0 to 70 😂

[2021-05-28T20:52:44] Artem Bulashev: I think those are the fets
[2021-05-28T20:53:33] Artem Bulashev: Fets operating temp is -55 to 175c
[2021-05-28T20:53:37] Artem Bulashev: So let it get hot
[2021-05-28T20:53:53] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't go over 100 tbh
[2021-05-28T20:54:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, it's good. but the temperature sensor is not inside the MOSFET ;)
[2021-05-28T20:54:52] Artem Bulashev: Just make sure Ubox is screwed down properly to the metal frame of scooter and set it power reduction at 100 and power down at 110c
[2021-05-28T20:55:02] Artem Bulashev: It is over 60c of headroom
[2021-05-28T20:55:06] Artem Bulashev: Should be safe
[2021-05-28T20:55:56] Artem Bulashev: Could also use best in class thermal past
[2021-05-28T20:56:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍

[2021-05-28T21:04:55] Artem Bulashev: Speed test of ubox config
[2021-05-28T21:04:59] Artem Bulashev: From other group
[2021-05-28T21:05:11] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2021-05-28T21:05:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seriously ? oh shit ... this is my biggest nightmare. I wan't VESC to increase acceleration. If it doesn't work, it's a fail 😅😅
[2021-05-28T21:05:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seems nice, no ?
[2021-05-28T21:05:59] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-05-28T21:06:05] Artem Bulashev: Very I would say haha
[2021-05-28T21:06:21] Artem Bulashev: I don’t think I would want it to accelerate faster lol
[2021-05-28T21:06:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we need to get his xml config files 😁😁
[2021-05-28T21:06:32] Artem Bulashev: I will do
[2021-05-28T21:06:55] Luis Magalhaes: need to go this way, had see some people on 11x using some type of fans near the controllers should it help? its inside de deck 🙈😅
[2021-05-28T21:07:42] Luis Magalhaes: yap and im using 60A battery and 100A fase, the minimotors 50A 110A
[2021-05-28T21:08:10] Luis Magalhaes: but it was faster starting i think is the diference till 70
[2021-05-28T21:08:19] Luis Magalhaes: did not run it full speed yet lol
[2021-05-28T21:08:52] Luis Magalhaes: its from a friend of mine 11x
[2021-05-28T21:08:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: " the minimotors 50A 110A" ???
[2021-05-28T21:09:40] Luis Magalhaes: if its andre vinagre he dont have ubox 🙈
[2021-05-28T21:10:06] Artem Bulashev: What he has?
[2021-05-28T21:10:36] Luis Magalhaes: im asking him 🤣 but he has a 11x with "stock controllers"
[2021-05-28T21:11:02] Artem Bulashev: Set phase current higher 110 at least I tested 110 even on my motor but with battery current 48a - no issues - single motor 650w nominal
[2021-05-28T21:11:37] Luis Magalhaes: the 11x controllers are coming some with 35A others with 50A he bought some and check what of them do more amps só they are stock lolol
[2021-05-28T21:11:52] Artem Bulashev: I think than for such high power you simply need more powerful phase current vesc
[2021-05-28T21:12:00] Artem Bulashev: Ubox is very very small
[2021-05-28T21:12:13] Luis Magalhaes: yes my motor after testing was not even hot lol
[2021-05-28T21:12:19] Artem Bulashev: Compare to MiniMotor stock controller even
[2021-05-28T21:14:48] Artem Bulashev: US $178.00 | Original ZERO 11X controller 72 V 45A Electric Scooter Controller https://a.aliexpress.com/_9GvWnZ
[2021-05-28T21:14:55] Luis Magalhaes: i was going to buy the ykz7280 but the ubox was getting me itchy
[2021-05-28T21:15:51] Luis Magalhaes: yes thats what was used in that pic
[2021-05-28T21:16:04] Artem Bulashev: 72v as well
[2021-05-28T21:16:09] Luis Magalhaes: he has a 11x
[2021-05-28T21:16:13] Luis Magalhaes: 72v
[2021-05-28T21:16:20] Artem Bulashev: That’s 4s more
[2021-05-28T21:16:33] Luis Magalhaes: have a smart bms and another battery in parallel
[2021-05-28T21:16:34] Artem Bulashev: Which produces more watts from same current
[2021-05-28T21:17:10] Artem Bulashev: 3240w So /60=54amps equivalent
[2021-05-28T21:17:34] Artem Bulashev: So 60v 60amps in sine wave sould give you similar performance
[2021-05-28T21:18:05] Luis Magalhaes: my setup was 60v 50x2
[2021-05-28T21:18:12] Artem Bulashev: And for phase current 110*72/60=132amps
[2021-05-28T21:18:21] Artem Bulashev: Oh is see
[2021-05-28T21:18:47] Luis Magalhaes: this one is 72v 50x2
[2021-05-28T21:18:53] Luis Magalhaes: +-
[2021-05-28T21:19:27] Luis Magalhaes: not from a ubox is from a square controller like you put up there
[2021-05-28T21:19:31] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-05-28T21:20:05] Luis Magalhaes: Diz mesmo controladoras originais com 55A
[2021-05-28T21:20:05] Luis Magalhaes: Bateria com 170A de descarga
[2021-05-28T21:20:19] Luis Magalhaes: is saying 55A controller
[2021-05-28T21:20:37] Luis Magalhaes: and battery with 170A max discharge
[2021-05-28T21:20:43] Luis Magalhaes: because of the parallel one
[2021-05-28T21:20:51] Artem Bulashev: 72 55a is nuts = 60* 66a square
[2021-05-28T21:21:07] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-05-28T21:21:10] Artem Bulashev: No wonder
[2021-05-28T21:21:11] Luis Magalhaes: yes and he did not full speed in that grafic
[2021-05-28T21:21:25] Artem Bulashev: It probably did like 135amp on phase at 72v
[2021-05-28T21:21:50] Luis Magalhaes: dont know about fase amp
[2021-05-28T21:22:15] Artem Bulashev: 75 probably on each + 150a on battery
[2021-05-28T21:25:45] Luis Magalhaes: he says he never mesure fase
[2021-05-28T21:26:08] Luis Magalhaes: but probably its something like 130
[2021-05-28T21:26:26] Luis Magalhaes: the dtx controllers 50A do 130A fase
[2021-05-28T21:26:44] Luis Magalhaes: have 2 friends using them
[2021-05-28T22:08:59] Artem Bulashev: I just figured out the complete relation between settings - Phase current is what heats up motor - Battery current defines simply how long full power phase current will be available during rpm increase (acceleration period) Example • Battery max amps 50amp • current under load voltage 60v = creates a max watt available on input 3000w Now out-put. • 0rpm = for example 10v going to motor, than as rpm increases voltage to motor increases until it is same as current battery voltage under load • max phase current set = 100amps 1. We start accelerate from 0rpm so we have 10v * 100a phase = 1000w (available full phase current) 2. We are now going xxxx RPM and voltage on motor is 30v * 100a phase = 3000w (last moments of full phase current available, not accounting for efficiency losses) 3. We are going faster xxxxRPM, so voltage now is 45v. This means controller can’t use full phase current, or it would pull more than possible from input! 45*100=4500 NO GOOD. So controller decreases phase current (voltage on motor is tied to rpm, can’t control it) new value than 66.6хх amps phase current at 45v) 4. And so on decreasing phase current until voltage on motor is equal to battery under load voltage which is Always than will be = to battery current because VBat*aBat=vMotor * phase current
[2021-05-28T22:11:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very interesting analysis. I'll have to dig to check
[2021-05-28T22:13:45] Artem Bulashev: Controler solves for Phase current vBat* Bat current = vMotor * phase current Phase current = Bat current * vBat / vMotor
[2021-05-28T22:16:52] Luis Magalhaes: nice !!!
[2021-05-28T22:19:20] Artem Bulashev: hope my train of thoughts makes sence, but one another person (high grade expert in VESC, in other group, has confirmed it is to be corret
[2021-05-28T22:20:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍👍
[2021-05-28T22:22:15] Luis Magalhaes: the phae current calculations i dont understand lolol
[2021-05-28T22:22:20] Luis Magalhaes: phase
[2021-05-28T22:22:42] Luis Magalhaes: im using 60A battery and 100A fase
[2021-05-28T22:23:01] Luis Magalhaes: but i see the vesc pulling 100A fase when i pull full throtlle
[2021-05-28T22:23:14] Luis Magalhaes: but the battery amps slowly grows
[2021-05-28T22:24:10] Luis Magalhaes: i think the current controll in adc is controlling the phase current or i'm wrong ?
[2021-05-28T22:28:29] Artem Bulashev: Do you know that your motor has low voltage when you start and full voltage when it get to max rpm?
[2021-05-28T22:28:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes ;)
[2021-05-28T22:29:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a direct relation to "kV" ;)
[2021-05-28T22:29:30] Luis Magalhaes: yes i now that
[2021-05-28T22:29:38] Artem Bulashev: Simply put : Battery amp limit, limits how long (on rpm scale) your full 100amp phase current will be available
[2021-05-28T22:29:48] Luis Magalhaes: the revolution per volt
[2021-05-28T22:29:51] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-05-28T22:30:46] Artem Bulashev: Because it battery amp lim together with current voltage in the battery sets a dynamic watt limit that is available for conteoller to utilise
[2021-05-28T22:30:59] Luis Magalhaes: yes those ar voltage vs phase amps till max output power yes?
[2021-05-28T22:31:28] Artem Bulashev: As voltage grows you get closer to watt limit (defined by input)
[2021-05-28T22:31:37] Luis Magalhaes: what about amp battery vs amp phase ?
[2021-05-28T22:31:51] Luis Magalhaes: or even batt amp vs volts to motor
[2021-05-28T22:32:25] Artem Bulashev: So at one point If controller would keep same phase current as voltage on motor grows, you would get into situation that output watts would be above input watts = impossible
[2021-05-28T22:32:25] Luis Magalhaes: so the max is the power of battery voltagem and batt amp?
[2021-05-28T22:32:33] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-05-28T22:32:39] Luis Magalhaes: ohhh
[2021-05-28T22:32:40] Luis Magalhaes: ok
[2021-05-28T22:33:07] Luis Magalhaes: so if you put more amps in battery you would give full phase amps for more rev ?
[2021-05-28T22:33:19] Artem Bulashev: Voltage of battery * amp lim on battery = Voltage on motor * phase current
[2021-05-28T22:33:26] Artem Bulashev: Correct
[2021-05-28T22:34:22] Luis Magalhaes: ok so in the battery side you chose how long you have full phase amps
[2021-05-28T22:34:40] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-28T22:34:40] Luis Magalhaes: in the motor side you chose how power you put in motor
[2021-05-28T22:34:49] Artem Bulashev: It is a dynamic relationship
[2021-05-28T22:35:00] Luis Magalhaes: nice i understand it now
[2021-05-28T22:35:05] Artem Bulashev: Great
[2021-05-28T22:35:20] Luis Magalhaes: thats why you should not use less phase amps them batt amps lolol
[2021-05-28T22:35:31] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-05-28T22:35:46] Luis Magalhaes: nice i now understand it lolol
[2021-05-28T22:35:46] Artem Bulashev: Key is voltage on motor that is low at first and full at last
[2021-05-28T22:35:58] Luis Magalhaes: yes
[2021-05-28T22:36:17] Luis Magalhaes: the motor side what goes up is the voltage and then reduce the phase
[2021-05-28T22:36:40] Luis Magalhaes: in battery side is the amps go up and the voltage is the same
[2021-05-28T22:36:59] Luis Magalhaes: and them goes down as voltage sag and amps draw 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-05-28T22:38:09] Artem Bulashev: About battery amps going up:
[2021-05-28T22:40:14] Artem Bulashev: They go up because: - 0rpm = 10v - phase current = 100a So you start acceleration with only 1000w requested from battery (at 60v that is like 16amps) Than you see battery amps draw increase AT EXACT rate of motor voltage increasing! Until you get to max watts defined by (vbat * battery amp limit)
[2021-05-28T22:40:24] Artem Bulashev: Is that understandable?
[2021-05-28T22:45:15] Luis Magalhaes: yep totally 👌👌
[2021-05-28T23:43:24] Luis Magalhaes: is it easy to put a button to activate cruise controll in vesc?
[2021-05-28T23:43:36] Artem Bulashev: I use remote
[2021-05-28T23:43:55] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_239@28-05-2021_23-43-55.jpg>
[2021-05-28T23:43:55] Mirono escooters: I hate cruise control. Rather be in control always. Quick reaction. Ur thumb gets used to it
[2021-05-28T23:44:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not possible i think. never seen cruise control on vesc.
[2021-05-28T23:44:31] Artem Bulashev: This remote has built in cruise control un press of the button
[2021-05-28T23:44:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2021-05-28T23:44:42] Artem Bulashev: I like cruise on button
[2021-05-28T23:44:55] Artem Bulashev: Hate it on just throttle hold possible timer
[2021-05-28T23:45:24] Artem Bulashev: This remote also has light on off and horn built in
[2021-05-28T23:45:30] Artem Bulashev: Very nice I have to say :))
[2021-05-28T23:46:41] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-05-28T23:46:45] Artem Bulashev: As I understand it communicates with RX on Ubox - separate sub system built into it They have extra channels that they used for lights and horn directly (outside of vesc system
[2021-05-28T23:47:14] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I know ahah Testing it out, like the scroll movement a lot!
[2021-05-28T23:48:25] Luis Magalhaes: a rion throttle 🤣
[2021-05-28T23:48:47] Luis Magalhaes: 1 less cable there too
[2021-05-28T23:49:19] Luis Magalhaes: dont forget to program if signal is lost 0 throttle lololo
[2021-05-28T23:49:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i could try to do cruise contro on my smart, but really not a big fan. it shouldn't be too hard. set the vesc max speed at current speed, then full throttle (max torque). all engaged with a button.
[2021-05-28T23:49:48] Luis Magalhaes: would like to have cruise for long rides
[2021-05-28T23:49:54] Luis Magalhaes: use it a lot on minimotors
[2021-05-28T23:50:43] Luis Magalhaes: @koxx3 your smart display does it on vesc write?
[2021-05-28T23:50:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: currently, no.
[2021-05-28T23:51:26] Luis Magalhaes: 🙈 it should 😁
[2021-05-28T23:59:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it open source guys. if you want to sublit code, go !
[2021-05-29T00:10:16] Luis Magalhaes: 🙈 code is not for me 🤣
[2021-05-29T01:37:40] Artem Bulashev: More like - 2 cables less on horn - 2 cables less on light control - 3 cables less on Throttle - 3 cables less on e-break - 6 cables less on Display info 🤝😅😅
[2021-05-29T01:37:56] Artem Bulashev: It is by default ;-)
[2021-05-29T01:38:36] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-05-29T01:38:42] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 👌
[2021-05-29T01:44:18] Artem Bulashev: Could make it even easier - button press input - read current dac1 output - set dac1 output to be fix value, unless Adc1 goes to bellow 5% value and than goes back up to above 5% or if adc2 was triggered 🤝 - charge dac output source from dix value back to adc1 input (Because you need not only to set it but also release condition)
[2021-05-29T01:44:56] Artem Bulashev: I’m kind of surprised how much functions they fit into ubox hand hold controller

[2021-05-29T10:57:43] Unknown: I had an idea for hydro e-brakes but I'll need to learn more about them first
[2021-05-29T10:57:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you have a standard on/off lever, it's normal 😅😅
[2021-05-29T10:58:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you need a xiaomi brake lever
[2021-05-29T10:58:07] Unknown: Normal? How do you mean normal
[2021-05-29T10:58:22] Unknown: I'm talking about the actual components and how it detects that u pull it
[2021-05-29T10:58:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vesc can read analog level for brake
[2021-05-29T10:58:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: here, you are sending him either 0v or 3.3v
[2021-05-29T10:59:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nothing between both values
[2021-05-29T10:59:22] Unknown: So how could you do 30% 60% values etc
[2021-05-29T10:59:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on most escooter, it's a simple switch in the lever
[2021-05-29T10:59:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you need an analog 'pressure' sensor for that (like throttle)
[2021-05-29T11:00:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: an easy one to find is the xiaomi BUT it's only for mecanical brakes (not hydro)
[2021-05-29T11:01:30] Unknown: Mhm
[2021-05-29T11:01:37] Unknown: Interesting
[2021-05-29T11:01:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on the smart i added some intelligence to make a progressive braking even with on/off switch. it's based on the pressure time (not force since we don't have this feedback)
[2021-05-29T11:01:59] Unknown: That's nice bro well dome
[2021-05-29T11:02:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😉😅
[2021-05-29T11:02:13] Unknown: Asking because I was in bed last night and had a eureka moment hehehe
[2021-05-29T11:02:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahaha
[2021-05-29T11:03:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i also added a very experimental mode : once you presse the brake lever, the throttle pressure determine the brake force. never tried on the road yet 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-05-29T11:04:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i might be slightly disturbing at first 😂🤪
[2021-05-29T11:06:56] Unknown: Ooo yh that sounds pretty good, interestinggg feature but yes would take some getting used to haha Higher throttle = lower brake ? Or opposite way round 🧐🧐🧐
[2021-05-29T11:07:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: max pressure = max brake for now. but i can change
[2021-05-29T11:07:40] Unknown: Maybe even a feature where ... Braking during throttle affects throttle % If throttle 100% brake 50%, throttle = 75% brake 50%? Something like that
[2021-05-29T11:08:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: may be
[2021-05-29T11:08:10] Unknown: Could be interesting
[2021-05-29T11:08:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: clearly, it's a feature to adjust with ride tests (at low speed, lol)
[2021-05-29T11:08:49] Unknown: Lolol yes
[2021-05-29T11:08:55] Unknown: But I think would be interesting
[2021-05-29T11:09:34] Unknown: But I want to try find a way to use hydro brake and make ebrake too with incremental values not just on/off
[2021-05-29T11:11:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i looked during MANY MANY days for analog pressure sensor we could easily attach to any hydro brake. never found one 😭😭😭 this is why i added this mode
[2021-05-29T11:11:43] Unknown: There must be a solution.
[2021-05-29T11:12:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what do you have ? zoom, nutt, magura ?
[2021-05-29T11:12:29] Unknown: Well I have magura but I'm not thinking of converting
[2021-05-29T11:12:38] Unknown: I want to think of a way to do it and then ... Try make it
[2021-05-29T11:15:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the 'easiest' way is to use a 49e sensor and a magnet, but you'll have to create a 3d printed case adapted to your lever. not so easy
[2021-05-29T15:41:45] Mirono escooters: Hello. I have a friend who is interested in making a 20s vesc and a display for it. I told him ppl in this group are making a display for vesc. Can I add him or isn't that allowed
[2021-05-29T15:50:59] Artem Bulashev: Yeap that was what I wanted to propose, easy to add to any current set up. But I. The end of the day my battery can’t take more than 10amps of charge and controller probably won’t like to have more than 30ampa having to disperse as heat
[2021-05-29T15:59:29] Artem Bulashev: Will most likely look strange - May be take tiny cylindrical magnet and glue it into pre-drilled hole on moving section - than sensors on fixed section of the break trigger. Than as you break more and more - magnet will go further away and magnetic field will weaken
[2021-05-29T16:08:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yesssss 😉👍
[2021-05-29T16:12:36] Artem Bulashev: Sounds like a plan :))
[2021-05-29T17:06:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Sharing SmartElec logs
[2021-05-29T17:07:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh yes, i also have an option to share logs. i've just made my first trip with the latest config. sun readabilty is excellent. really happy. 1 bug to fix and 2/3 improvments to make in the software
[2021-05-29T17:38:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: pcb temperature during ride :
[2021-05-29T17:38:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-29_17-38-27.png>
[2021-05-29T17:51:20] Artem Bulashev: 45c equilibrium temp is good temp👌👌
[2021-05-29T17:52:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes ;)
[2021-05-29T18:02:22] Mirono escooters: Delete if not allowed. But a great guy with a lot of interest in vesc. Think he's a very nice addon to the team
[2021-05-29T18:03:30] Artem Bulashev: 🙃🤝 Jolan welcome
[2021-05-29T18:03:47] Unknown: Ty :)
[2021-05-29T18:06:49] Luis Magalhaes: Welcome 👍
[2021-05-29T18:07:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Hi !
[2021-05-29T18:07:44] Unknown: Hey guys!
[2021-05-29T18:07:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: do you already have a VESC ? if not, what do you intend to use ? ;)
[2021-05-29T18:08:50] Unknown: I don't have a scooter :/ but I have 2 vesc for my electric longboard
[2021-05-29T18:09:05] Mirono escooters: He's getting a free xiaomi frame from me to experiment with ;)
[2021-05-29T18:10:15] Unknown: Thanks miro ✌︎
[2021-05-29T18:13:39] Artem Bulashev: Lol nice :)) Dual 500w motors to it and it will fly
[2021-05-29T18:17:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: good !
[2021-05-29T18:17:29] Mirono escooters: I'm giving him a 250w motor. He can buy others if he want 😅
[2021-05-29T18:17:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: xiaomi motor are "cheap" no ?
[2021-05-29T18:19:46] Mirono escooters: Yea. 350w is only 50€+-
[2021-05-29T18:20:20] Artem Bulashev: Nice:) vsett 650-1100w motor is 110€
[2021-05-29T18:20:41] Artem Bulashev: Because smaller production I suppose partially
[2021-05-29T18:21:35] Mirono escooters: Yes defenitely. These xiaomi motors are bulk
[2021-05-29T18:21:44] Mirono escooters: I had a 1200w motor.from alie. 150€ from spain
[2021-05-29T18:21:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and more copper 😅😅
[2021-05-29T18:21:51] Mirono escooters: Spain without the s for my wallet
[2021-05-29T18:22:39] Mirono escooters: I have like 8 repaired or recycled 250ws So I'm gonna go dual on them and abuse 250w are "ok" but at higher speeds they don't have torque to concuer the air resistance. But dual will overcome this 😀
[2021-05-29T18:23:09] Mirono escooters: Pushed 84v 2000w in a 250w Got pretty hot Good for short rides (10 mins to school) but a 30 min ride to a friend it was too hot to touch.
[2021-05-29T18:24:19] Mirono escooters: I think I passed 80* a few times. And above 80* neodium magnets have demagnetisation. I rlly felt loss of power after prob 2 months. So yea. That motor is toast. Rlly surprised it handled it so long tho :) 10" didn't help w accelerating problems. On a slight hill (like 3%) I went from 50kmh to 39 :/
[2021-05-29T18:24:51] Mirono escooters: Oh and also my motor did not pass 45kmh after 2 months. Part of the demagnetisation. 15s or 20s it did not go faster on road. Just not the power for it. Poor thing
[2021-05-29T18:25:07] Mirono escooters: Sorry for long text. Have fun reading. Im Gonna make batteries :)
[2021-05-29T18:26:38] Artem Bulashev: That means it reached into max rpm under load.
[2021-05-29T18:26:55] Artem Bulashev: Haha, that’s fairly compact by our standards here lol
[2021-05-29T18:27:29] Mirono escooters: Yea 15s or 20s did not matter. Very weird xd
[2021-05-29T18:27:58] Artem Bulashev: I’m more supriced that Xiaomi controllers can take all of that 😅😅
[2021-05-29T18:28:11] Mirono escooters: Mine can :) 100v 3000w max
[2021-05-29T18:28:24] Artem Bulashev: 30 amps
[2021-05-29T18:28:25] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2021-05-29T18:28:35] Mirono escooters: Riding 2600w on 84v for prob 4 months already daily. Temps get a bit toasty (70* sometimes) but good enough
[2021-05-29T18:28:40] Mirono escooters: These were never ever made for it anyways
[2021-05-29T18:28:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, no, interesting 👍
[2021-05-29T18:29:08] Mirono escooters: I run 45A at 12s through one too. Works better then expected xd
[2021-05-29T18:29:10] Mirono escooters: Poor controller
[2021-05-29T18:29:29] Artem Bulashev: 2600w / 84 =31 amp battery load
[2021-05-29T18:29:34] Mirono escooters: I like the simplicity of the original controller and display. It's sleek too. I like sleeper cars too
[2021-05-29T18:29:57] Artem Bulashev: Wonder what kind of Phase current you get
[2021-05-29T18:30:09] Mirono escooters: And they r fairly cheap for me to make too. Things that keep me away from vesc are: Cost And no display Just a student myself don't wanna spend like 300€ on vesc for my scooters 😅😅
[2021-05-29T18:30:10] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that it is
[2021-05-29T18:30:27] Mirono escooters: Can I measure phase current for you?
[2021-05-29T18:30:50] Mirono escooters: I cant go higher then 2600w due to stock battery shitting itself xd
[2021-05-29T18:30:56] Artem Bulashev: Your battery is like 500€ ;-) btw what is the config?
[2021-05-29T18:31:06] Mirono escooters: I will build after exams 1 20s and a 15s for 2 of my scoots🤫😀
[2021-05-29T18:31:17] Mirono escooters: For wich? I have multiple scooters 😅😅
[2021-05-29T18:31:18] Artem Bulashev: Yes need a tool
[2021-05-29T18:32:12] Artem Bulashev: With hall measuring current clamp
[2021-05-29T18:33:10] Mirono escooters: My 15s awd Battery config 15s4p but a beta Battery. Wanted to test awd and scoot. Tests r good. 2000w for now more and it shits itself 12s5p 45A max 250w motor My "cruiser" and daily driver as my other 2 are in need for maintenance and or repair 20s3p 1200w alie motor Rides but was my testing platform and just needs a complete rebuild Will get new Bluetooth internal battery after exams
[2021-05-29T18:34:05] Artem Bulashev: Like so https://www.amazon.de/Qiman-Voltmeter-Amperemeter-coulometer-watt-stunde/dp/B07FYBZB9G/ref=asc_df_B07FY9ZHLY/?tag=&linkCode=df0&hvadid=380273336537&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16492243892405611824&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062729&hvtargid=pla-841243120284&psc=1&th=1&ref=&adgrpid=77035647305
[2021-05-29T18:35:14] Mirono escooters: For my builds for people I use new cells but the prices are so high I did not build a crazy good battery for myself xd. I rather use recycled ones from ebike batteries after testing them in my battery testers (capacity. Ir and max A and discharge curve) and I use those in my scooters usually as I don't mind it. But ye they shit themselves sometimes xd but thats prob due to my old building skills. Will build new batteries with jolan de drone after exams :) I have like 200 recycled 18650. Not the best but for me. Good enough. My scooters are build from donated or cheap parts xd
[2021-05-29T18:35:31] Mirono escooters: I will buy one ! Seems like a good tool
[2021-05-29T18:35:55] Mirono escooters: On scooterhacking custom firmware you don't set batt A but phase amps Running 65 phase amps on my green cruiser😅😅
[2021-05-29T18:36:32] Artem Bulashev: Sure? Can you show me?
[2021-05-29T18:36:36] Mirono escooters: Maybe when scooters have had maintenance I'll build them a nice battery. I have like 700 21700 coming my way 😅😅
[2021-05-29T18:37:15] Mirono escooters: The 3 shunts on controllers are at the 3 phases so I'm certain it uses those as there is no batt input shunt nor I use a original batt w shunt communication :)
[2021-05-29T18:37:22] Mirono escooters: I read somewhere it uses phase amps. Will look for it
[2021-05-29T18:38:00] Artem Bulashev: It ok thanks
[2021-05-29T18:38:16] Mirono escooters: I've messed w these controllers way to much now. I dont know why I persist using them but I like it 😅
[2021-05-29T18:38:28] Artem Bulashev: Strange though :-) battery current setting is kind of Crucial 😅
[2021-05-29T18:38:48] Mirono escooters: Controller has no shunt at batt input 😅
[2021-05-29T18:39:23] Mirono escooters: I have a Bluetooth bms I will go out on it in a bit and measure how much I draw on full throttle. My 12s5p shits itself from 52v to 44 or smth so it's defenitely a lot😅😅
[2021-05-29T18:42:00] Artem Bulashev: 5p 18650?
[2021-05-29T18:42:09] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2021-05-29T18:42:18] Mirono escooters: From recycled 18650 eve 26v from xiaomi batteries
[2021-05-29T18:42:19] Artem Bulashev: You know what cells?
[2021-05-29T18:42:26] Mirono escooters: My friend got his hands on like 20 xiaomi packs :)
[2021-05-29T18:42:26] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2021-05-29T18:42:32] Mirono escooters: Eve 26v Not the best But ue
[2021-05-29T18:42:35] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2021-05-29T18:42:37] Mirono escooters: Free :)
[2021-05-29T18:42:58] Artem Bulashev: Nice haha
[2021-05-29T18:43:19] Artem Bulashev: That cell is 5amps load 7 before over heat
[2021-05-29T18:43:39] Mirono escooters: Indeed. Peak 7 but can't stand that for long. Tested them with my load
[2021-05-29T18:43:44] Artem Bulashev: So 25-35amp limit
[2021-05-29T18:43:54] Artem Bulashev: 5p
[2021-05-29T18:43:54] Mirono escooters: Rlly interesting to mess w a load and see wich abuse and so they handle
[2021-05-29T18:44:02] Mirono escooters: Yep think it's peaking around that
[2021-05-29T18:44:12] Mirono escooters: I will go out soon. I'm curious myself now too
[2021-05-29T18:45:41] Artem Bulashev: I mean for free it is awesome hahah
[2021-05-29T18:45:47] Artem Bulashev: I spent 550€ on cells
[2021-05-29T18:45:57] Mirono escooters: Yea cells are so damn expensive I didn't feel like it
[2021-05-29T18:46:23] Artem Bulashev: 3500 35e Samsung
[2021-05-29T18:46:29] Artem Bulashev: 128 cells
[2021-05-29T18:46:30] Mirono escooters: Yes I had a lot of cells. I shared some with jolan too. We opened the packs together in summer so shared them😀
[2021-05-29T18:46:33] Artem Bulashev: 16s8p
[2021-05-29T18:46:35] Mirono escooters: Damn. Hot 🤤
[2021-05-29T18:46:45] Artem Bulashev: Yeah :)
[2021-05-29T18:46:58] Mirono escooters: I order a lot of cells at a time for my batt building company. But I never used them for my own before. Too much money 😅
[2021-05-29T18:48:01] Mirono escooters: Rather use them recycled ones. Although it's a mess.opening packs and testing takes so long. Then cleaning w dtemel too. But worth it 😁
[2021-05-29T18:48:15] Artem Bulashev: 😁🤝
[2021-05-29T18:48:21] Mirono escooters: Difficulty finding new broken packs recently. Hope summer fixes that when ppl ride scoot more and break more shit ;)
[2021-05-29T18:48:45] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_250@29-05-2021_18-48-45.jpg>
[2021-05-29T18:49:00] Artem Bulashev: Best batteries in terms of wH
[2021-05-29T18:49:17] Artem Bulashev: If you see higher wh on higher load it means this cells heats up less
[2021-05-29T18:49:38] Artem Bulashev: So you can always judge it this way without switching pages / photos
[2021-05-29T18:49:52] Mirono escooters: Smort. I need that 😆
[2021-05-29T18:50:12] Mirono escooters: I use 21700 only now. Better size for Xiaomi scooters. They fit verry close. Better space use then 18650😁

[2021-05-29T18:50:37] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-29T18:51:07] Mirono escooters: That Bluetooth bms app screenshot is battery porn. LG has very good matching ir and capacity 🤤
[2021-05-29T18:51:21] Mirono escooters: (And no thats not balanced from bms bms is set to balance to 0.03v)
[2021-05-29T18:51:24] Artem Bulashev: It is very specific to dimention proportions what fits better
[2021-05-29T18:51:32] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2021-05-29T18:51:39] Mirono escooters: In xiaomi its 21700
[2021-05-29T18:51:42] Mirono escooters: Comes at a cost tho
[2021-05-29T18:51:58] Mirono escooters: 15s3p 15ah 60A peak
[2021-05-29T18:52:10] Artem Bulashev: 21700 are more cost effective
[2021-05-29T18:52:20] Artem Bulashev: If you take high capasity
[2021-05-29T18:52:23] Artem Bulashev: 48x
[2021-05-29T18:52:33] Artem Bulashev: For example
[2021-05-29T18:52:38] Mirono escooters: Yes that's true 😊
[2021-05-29T18:52:46] Mirono escooters: Defenitely when ordering bulk
[2021-05-29T18:52:50] Mirono escooters: Waiting for 700 more
[2021-05-29T18:52:52] Mirono escooters: Spain without s
[2021-05-29T18:53:02] Mirono escooters: But worth it
[2021-05-29T19:06:07] Artem Bulashev: I cant believe how much Samsung 50s is superior to allllll That’s what Vapecell T50 is
[2021-05-29T19:06:10] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_258@29-05-2021_19-06-10.jpg>
[2021-05-29T19:07:04] Artem Bulashev: 48x is next best thing (higher Wh at 0-15amps discharge)
[2021-05-29T19:41:05] Happy Giraffe: Im already digging my kidney up for 50s pack 🌚 goal is g30awd or a pack for M365 pro that can do 80A without too much of a sweat
[2021-05-29T19:41:25] Mirono escooters: 50s???
[2021-05-29T19:41:32] Happy Giraffe: Samsung 50s
[2021-05-29T19:41:35] Mirono escooters: Ohhh
[2021-05-29T19:41:52] Mirono escooters: I want a g30 frame badly. Way more batt space. Cant find any :/ stuck w m365
[2021-05-29T19:42:17] Mirono escooters: I've placed controller externally so I have a lot more space tho😁. 15s4p only needed 5mm lowered
[2021-05-29T19:42:27] Happy Giraffe: I would want that too, but then I would have two scooters which I don't need 🙈
[2021-05-29T19:42:44] Mirono escooters: I have 3 Oops
[2021-05-29T19:42:48] Mirono escooters: Lockdown project nr 541
[2021-05-29T19:42:59] Mirono escooters: 1 only riding Soo yea Xd
[2021-05-29T19:43:16] Mirono escooters: 1 needs repair after crash 1 needs a lot of maintenance
[2021-05-29T19:43:49] Happy Giraffe: I dont really need that much capacity tho, I got my 13s7p jihad bag for that😎
[2021-05-29T19:43:57] Mirono escooters: Hahahah boom
[2021-05-29T19:44:07] Mirono escooters: I dont need it too Butt Why not🤫
[2021-05-29T19:44:21] Mirono escooters: The sea is 120km+- from me I wanna ride to it one day
[2021-05-29T19:45:34] Happy Giraffe: Yeah haha, tough with the repurposing of packs as you move forward you need to sell old ones
[2021-05-29T20:02:36] Artem Bulashev: Yeah even 20amps per cell it well! 15amps would be better though :)
[2021-05-29T20:03:38] Artem Bulashev: 😳😳😳
[2021-05-29T20:04:19] Mirono escooters: Wirh a g30 max perfectly possible w big battery M365.. maybe... prob have a backpack full of batteries
[2021-05-29T20:04:26] Mirono escooters: Maybe with a pit stop and a quick charger
[2021-05-29T20:04:33] Artem Bulashev: That could be possible on 16s 28ah
[2021-05-29T20:04:37] Mirono escooters: 60km at once shouldnt be difficult
[2021-05-29T20:04:42] Artem Bulashev: Ohh
[2021-05-29T20:04:44] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-05-29T20:04:47] Mirono escooters: Depends on cruising speed too. I wonder how fast
[2021-05-29T20:04:53] Artem Bulashev: I was thinking 120 one way
[2021-05-29T20:04:55] Mirono escooters: Yea 120km at once .. prob not possible
[2021-05-29T20:05:01] Mirono escooters: I would like to do it but.. mjeh
[2021-05-29T20:05:21] Mirono escooters: Maybe later. First a good battery in my scooter
[2021-05-29T20:05:26] Mirono escooters: Not cheating out xd
[2021-05-29T20:05:29] Artem Bulashev: Vsett10+ can do 25kmh
[2021-05-29T20:05:29] Mirono escooters: Cheaping
[2021-05-29T20:05:39] Artem Bulashev: 16s 28ah
[2021-05-29T20:05:42] Mirono escooters: At 25kmh it's very boring
[2021-05-29T20:05:46] Mirono escooters: I'd aim for 35kmh
[2021-05-29T20:05:49] Mirono escooters: Maybe a big 13s?
[2021-05-29T20:05:51] Mirono escooters: Or 12q
[2021-05-29T20:05:52] Mirono escooters: 12s
[2021-05-29T20:06:02] Artem Bulashev: At 35-45kmh it can do 75km
[2021-05-29T20:06:16] Mirono escooters: Preferably 40-45kmh for the long roads but mjeh
[2021-05-29T20:06:20] Mirono escooters: 35kmh will do
[2021-05-29T20:06:25] Mirono escooters: That's a project for summer
[2021-05-29T20:06:46] Artem Bulashev: You will draw too much amps on 12s to archive 35kmh
[2021-05-29T20:06:59] Artem Bulashev: Need higher voltage
[2021-05-29T20:07:25] Mirono escooters: Yeah true
[2021-05-29T20:07:34] Mirono escooters: I ride 12s now at 38kmh and it shits the batt
[2021-05-29T20:07:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-05-29T20:10:10] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_259@29-05-2021_20-10-10.jpg>
[2021-05-29T20:10:13] Luis Magalhaes: 😂👍
[2021-05-29T20:10:37] Artem Bulashev: Go figure😅😅😅
[2021-05-29T20:12:13] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_260@29-05-2021_20-12-13.jpg>
[2021-05-29T20:12:36] Mirono escooters: That's hot
[2021-05-29T20:12:37] Luis Magalhaes: This was my longest and slowest ride 😂 not to see the sea
[2021-05-29T20:12:41] Mirono escooters: Doesn't it get boring tho at 27kmh
[2021-05-29T20:13:16] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-05-29T20:13:21] Artem Bulashev: I have car for that
[2021-05-29T20:13:24] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁
[2021-05-29T20:13:37] Luis Magalhaes: Yes a bit 😂 but you have to go in the right mood 😂😂
[2021-05-29T20:13:54] Artem Bulashev: I use scooter to drive through like parks and mountain roads as they are private in Austria
[2021-05-29T20:15:42] Luis Magalhaes: I go to work, go have a cofe, and go cruise 😂
[2021-05-29T20:25:00] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, Im not sure how many 21700 can be fit to Xiaomi pro but atleast 4p, 5p I try
[2021-05-29T22:14:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @artBula , you also have a Aerlang ? what do you think about it ?
[2021-05-30T01:46:03] Happy Giraffe: Ninebot gocart pro controller👀
[2021-05-30T01:46:34] Happy Giraffe: Someone gotta put vesc and suspension into that thing
[2021-05-30T01:47:04] Mirono escooters: Looks beasty already. Double mosfets
[2021-05-30T01:47:17] Mirono escooters: O nvm 2 motots
[2021-05-30T01:47:56] Tudor: 4 p with 27 mm extension
[2021-05-30T01:48:18] Happy Giraffe: *sad noises*
[2021-05-30T01:48:33] Tudor: 16s
[2021-05-30T01:49:27] Happy Giraffe: Thats something👀 , but on 13s it already goes 45kmh with xiaomi controller and with vesc its enough haha
[2021-05-30T12:28:17] Artem Bulashev: Yes I did. - fastest stock 500w scooter ever - amazing electronic controller (super small 48v 25amp, with built in BT, app, led lights control, break light, front light, horn, Alarm with motor breaking up on trigger, and never seen one burn) - 10 inch bwith amazing rear suspensions - amazing suspension available after market for the front - huge 48v 17.5ah battery from stock - light weight - 45kmh - one problem. deck is flat metal plate so it with little time and speed bumps it beds and breaks at the place where neck attaches to the deck…. Sudden snap. Or rear suspention attachment breaks the deck at the back 👌😔 = amazing nearly perfect legal machine, that is unsafe till manufactured does complete redesign of the deck than it will be the only and perfect machine
[2021-05-30T13:32:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: shame ... I followed the beginning of this scooter. it was promissing.
[2021-05-30T13:34:16] Mirono escooters: Aerlang? Whot that is
[2021-05-30T13:34:57] Artem Bulashev: It is actually if you can weld and fix the frame it will be the single best scooter
[2021-05-30T13:35:05] Artem Bulashev: Oh did I say it is 400€ 😅😅
[2021-05-30T13:35:08] Artem Bulashev: ✅
[2021-05-30T13:35:24] Happy Giraffe: Only problem its illegal in nordic countries
[2021-05-30T13:35:25] Mirono escooters: I know someone who lengthened a m365😅🤤
[2021-05-30T13:35:44] Artem Bulashev: Why?
[2021-05-30T13:35:51] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-05-30T13:36:00] Happy Giraffe: Because 20-25kmh limits etc
[2021-05-30T13:36:13] Mirono escooters: Catch me first
[2021-05-30T13:36:27] Artem Bulashev: It is limited to 25kmh
[2021-05-30T13:36:33] Happy Giraffe: 🤔
[2021-05-30T13:36:46] Artem Bulashev: But like always can be removed by 8 clicking fast ;-)
[2021-05-30T13:36:52] Artem Bulashev: And locked back in
[2021-05-30T13:36:59] Artem Bulashev: As I said amazing controller :))
[2021-05-30T13:37:29] Happy Giraffe: Meanwhile I pull 40A on Xiaomi😂
[2021-05-30T13:37:56] Happy Giraffe: Going same speed uphill or flat. -3kmh or something from vdrop😂
[2021-05-30T13:37:56] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but that is different amazing
[2021-05-30T13:39:03] Artem Bulashev: Aerlang amazing from factory because of power and size and cool futures and reliability - but can’t mod it beside shunt mod because SW is read and write encrypted
[2021-05-30T13:39:25] Happy Giraffe: Can put a vesc😉
[2021-05-30T13:39:33] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2021-05-30T13:39:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: snif ...
[2021-05-30T13:39:48] Artem Bulashev: Xiaomi is less impressive from factory and bigger controller, but can do so much moding - so it is more about how amazing community effort is
[2021-05-30T13:39:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1000
[2021-05-30T13:40:17] Mirono escooters: True. Sooooo much mods and community. My #1 reason to mod
[2021-05-30T13:40:26] Mirono escooters: So much fun personalising scoot. Not pre build one. That sucks
[2021-05-30T13:40:51] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi also portable sleeper powerhouse (fits easy above train luggage area)
[2021-05-30T13:41:03] Happy Giraffe: I put jihad pack 13s13p and then its unlimited power
[2021-05-30T13:41:10] Mirono escooters: Indeed. And nice begin frame. But sad not much batt place. G30 nicer for that
[2021-05-30T13:41:18] Mirono escooters: Need backpack or crazy high suspension
[2021-05-30T13:41:52] Artem Bulashev: But than it is no longer a sleeper
[2021-05-30T13:42:04] Happy Giraffe: This one holds 13s7p😂 Shoulder bag
[2021-05-30T13:42:19] Artem Bulashev: Sleeper needs to be legal oem and yet look original after all mods that make it awesome
[2021-05-30T13:42:24] Happy Giraffe: Yeah tomorrow I get monorim v4 and rip sleeper
[2021-05-30T13:42:33] Mirono escooters: Ye but I prefer no bag as I always carry one already / more weight on me
[2021-05-30T13:42:40] Mirono escooters: But prob only solution
[2021-05-30T13:42:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeap at that point police sees it has been modified so need to check
[2021-05-30T13:43:46] Happy Giraffe: Full motorcycle gear, backpack with a power cable, going 40kmh. Police doesnt give damn here if I ride safe haha
[2021-05-30T13:44:04] Mirono escooters: As long as u don't ride like a fucking idiot they don't care
[2021-05-30T13:44:13] Mirono escooters: Wich cop wants to make a paper about a scoot
[2021-05-30T13:44:45] Mirono escooters: I wear almost full motor gear too. As long as u - don't ride like a dick - follow road code -wear protection They let u be
[2021-05-30T13:44:50] Artem Bulashev: That’s nice :))
[2021-05-30T13:45:02] Happy Giraffe: Yeah😉
[2021-05-30T13:50:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so ... guys ... any news about installed VESCs ? 😁😁
[2021-05-30T13:51:07] Happy Giraffe: Will buy one in August😎
[2021-05-30T13:51:49] Mirono escooters: I'm just here for the display 😁
[2021-05-30T13:52:02] Mirono escooters: And mentally preparing to put a lot of money into vesc
[2021-05-30T13:52:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-30T13:53:45] Happy Giraffe: Vesc will give me a massive torque upgrade with Monorim 500w motor too. Sleel display and police mode are interesting for me aswell😉
[2021-05-30T14:32:10] Artem Bulashev: Yeap mine going strong
[2021-05-30T14:33:05] Artem Bulashev: Police mode is the reason why I went to fully programmable Vesc ;-)
[2021-05-30T14:37:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-30T14:37:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: remember it won't help if you exceed too much the law ;)
[2021-05-30T14:38:06] Artem Bulashev: Yeah of course :)
[2021-05-30T14:38:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a guy has been taken at 97 km/h on french roads by cops ... escooter confiscated, 135€ immediate fine and tribunal (1500€ max) is waiting for him
[2021-05-30T14:43:23] Happy Giraffe: Thats why I go max 45kmh myself and limit police mode to 35
[2021-05-30T14:43:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-05-30T14:43:41] Happy Giraffe: I can only be charged for driving without moped license and not having insurance
[2021-05-30T14:43:43] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-05-30T14:43:44] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-05-30T14:44:32] Happy Giraffe: If I got no limits then police will do this to me:
[2021-05-30T14:46:11] Artem Bulashev: Same 45max I want at any charge, may be 50 on long straight roads
[2021-05-30T14:47:11] Happy Giraffe: Maybe the remote could have 3 buttons for 3 modes: -Police mode -Normal, but not too fast mode -Unlocked maxspeed
[2021-05-30T14:47:54] Artem Bulashev: Police mod must be locked to it so that no other mod can be engaged
[2021-05-30T14:48:10] Artem Bulashev: Until special manipulation dance
[2021-05-30T14:48:16] Happy Giraffe: 😂
[2021-05-30T14:48:34] Happy Giraffe: Ok, Im just a noob thinking out loud 🙈
[2021-05-30T14:49:13] Artem Bulashev: I mean police will try to switch to highest mode if it’s simple MODE button on your steering haha
[2021-05-30T14:53:51] Happy Giraffe: Yes haha, makes sense
[2021-05-30T23:52:44] Luis Magalhaes: Mates need your knowledge 😂
[2021-05-30T23:52:57] Mirono escooters: Ask away
[2021-05-30T23:53:17] Mirono escooters: Good all nerds have sleep rithm problems
[2021-05-30T23:53:42] Luis Magalhaes: I did use the resistor as @koxx3 said to me to reduce the voltage in adc1 from throtlle
[2021-05-30T23:53:46] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_263@30-05-2021_23-53-46.jpg>
[2021-05-30T23:53:53] Luis Magalhaes: This are my values now
[2021-05-30T23:55:04] Artem Bulashev: What’s up with value 2?
[2021-05-30T23:55:06] Luis Magalhaes: But if i put the control in duty cycle it is doing the same as before, some spikes in this current doing the motor's start and the light get on
[2021-05-30T23:55:29] Luis Magalhaes: Its adc 2 right? Not even conected 😅
[2021-05-30T23:55:36] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2021-05-30T23:55:38] Artem Bulashev: Ok than
[2021-05-30T23:55:51] Luis Magalhaes: Should it be zero too?
[2021-05-30T23:56:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you place a voltage divider ?
[2021-05-30T23:56:19] Artem Bulashev: Lois like your embient noise it making it move 0.15v
[2021-05-30T23:56:38] Luis Magalhaes: Yes did not have the same resistors and had to use a little more from them so less voltage 😅
[2021-05-30T23:56:47] Mirono escooters: Add a capacitor? Smol one
[2021-05-30T23:56:54] Luis Magalhaes: But i think its no problem after maping adc right?
[2021-05-30T23:57:12] Luis Magalhaes: No just the resistors 😅
[2021-05-30T23:58:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: good. variation of 0.15v is not so important. you can filter it with the vesc. on current mode, when riding, i doubt you'll perceive it. just add some dead band to ignore it when trottle is at rest
[2021-05-31T00:01:06] Luis Magalhaes: Ok so no need for capacitor
[2021-05-31T00:01:07] Luis Magalhaes: ?
[2021-05-31T00:01:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it would help a bit. but vesc can do numeric filter.
[2021-05-31T00:02:15] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_264@31-05-2021_00-02-15.jpg>
[2021-05-31T00:02:25] Luis Magalhaes: Have this one from a drone 😂😂
[2021-05-31T00:02:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: loooool. it's a lottttttt !
[2021-05-31T00:03:02] Mirono escooters: Bigger uf doesnt mean better filtering
[2021-05-31T00:03:19] Mirono escooters: I have numerous ded motherbozrds. Loads of free caps
[2021-05-31T00:03:31] Luis Magalhaes: I was thinking that 😂😂😂
[2021-05-31T00:03:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: usually put 100nf for filter noise 😅
[2021-05-31T00:04:02] Luis Magalhaes: I just solder for the drones and no spares 😂😂
[2021-05-31T00:04:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this one 470000 nf 😁😁
[2021-05-31T00:04:13] Luis Magalhaes: Ups 😂😂
[2021-05-31T00:04:36] Luis Magalhaes: But its noise only seen on duty cycle??
[2021-05-31T00:05:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 100 nf are really small but can be found any many pcbs..they look like resistors (but partly brown)
[2021-05-31T00:05:34] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-05-31T00:05:36] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-05-31T00:05:52] Artem Bulashev: Take any dead esc
[2021-05-31T00:06:24] Artem Bulashev: You see those not black squares, those are caps, des older and biggest one and it will be enough
[2021-05-31T00:06:26] Luis Magalhaes: If i have a dead esc is from a drone 😂😂
[2021-05-31T00:06:37] Artem Bulashev: Every one do haha
[2021-05-31T00:06:53] Artem Bulashev: Or any other dead electronic and show us
[2021-05-31T00:06:57] Luis Magalhaes: Dam 😂
[2021-05-31T00:07:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_265@31-05-2021_00-07-01.jpg>
[2021-05-31T00:07:19] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-31T00:07:40] Luis Magalhaes: But about the duty cycle is from the noise the problem?
[2021-05-31T00:08:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_266@31-05-2021_00-08-05.jpg>
[2021-05-31T00:08:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: dead band
[2021-05-31T00:08:33] Artem Bulashev: That I don’t know. I didn’t see why it would be more susceptible
[2021-05-31T00:08:50] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know enough about how it works
[2021-05-31T00:08:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i really don't like the android app. i do all settings on computer
[2021-05-31T00:10:22] Luis Magalhaes: I can do it on computer too
[2021-05-31T00:10:47] Luis Magalhaes: But the lights come on but weak when i put in duty cycle
[2021-05-31T00:10:59] Luis Magalhaes: They ir direct to battery by a button
[2021-05-31T00:11:06] Luis Magalhaes: Is it normal?

[2021-05-31T00:13:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no. but draw a schemaric to help us understand
[2021-05-31T00:13:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what is that ?
[2021-05-31T00:14:06] Luis Magalhaes: A 4 in 1 esc for a drone 😂
[2021-05-31T00:14:24] Luis Magalhaes: Are these the brown ones? 😂
[2021-05-31T00:14:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes 😁
[2021-05-31T00:15:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but not so easy... now, voltage & capacity 😁
[2021-05-31T00:16:17] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-05-31T00:16:33] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_268@31-05-2021_00-16-33.jpg>
[2021-05-31T00:16:43] Luis Magalhaes: These helps in the voltage?
[2021-05-31T00:16:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol, no
[2021-05-31T00:17:00] Artem Bulashev: Do on pc, cus I’m 🍎😂
[2021-05-31T00:17:12] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-05-31T00:17:53] Luis Magalhaes: So im fuck nothing writed there
[2021-05-31T00:17:56] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-05-31T00:18:03] Artem Bulashev: Those caps are in input filter
[2021-05-31T00:18:13] Artem Bulashev: So they are 4s capable at least
[2021-05-31T00:18:16] Artem Bulashev: 16v
[2021-05-31T00:18:31] Artem Bulashev: Capasity can check once removed
[2021-05-31T00:18:36] Luis Magalhaes: Yes 16.8v max input says here 😂
[2021-05-31T00:18:43] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-31T00:19:07] Luis Magalhaes: How can i check capacity?
[2021-05-31T00:19:15] Artem Bulashev: Those are 25v at least because of voltage spikes that they take not to blow up. May be even 30+ v
[2021-05-31T00:19:28] Artem Bulashev: Need multimeter with that function
[2021-05-31T00:22:06] Artem Bulashev: Set the multimeter to measure capacitance. Most digital multimeters use a symbol similar to –|(– to signify capacitance
[2021-05-31T00:22:11] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_269@31-05-2021_00-22-11.jpg>
[2021-05-31T00:22:13] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2021-05-31T00:22:18] Artem Bulashev: Beautiful
[2021-05-31T00:22:30] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_270@31-05-2021_00-22-30.jpg>
[2021-05-31T00:22:41] Artem Bulashev: Desolder capacitor
[2021-05-31T00:22:54] Artem Bulashev: Than shot circuite by long wire
[2021-05-31T00:22:59] Artem Bulashev: This will discharge it
[2021-05-31T00:23:19] Artem Bulashev: Than touch it with probs in the mode I wrote above
[2021-05-31T00:23:37] Artem Bulashev: It will start charging capacitor to measure
[2021-05-31T00:24:31] Luis Magalhaes: Ok, need polarity?
[2021-05-31T00:24:53] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-05-31T00:25:01] Luis Magalhaes: Ok
[2021-05-31T00:25:04] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t have such
[2021-05-31T00:25:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you thought electronic was simple. not so much 😁😁
[2021-05-31T00:25:14] Luis Magalhaes: Will desolder it
[2021-05-31T00:26:33] Luis Magalhaes: I had electronic in school 10 or more years ago 😂 but most where teoric and i always just lear to pass then forget because not using it 😅
[2021-05-31T00:27:14] Luis Magalhaes: Im a mecatronic 😂 but work as a controll room operator in a factory 😅
[2021-05-31T00:27:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-05-31T00:27:54] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-05-31T00:28:12] Luis Magalhaes: A bad one 😂😂😂
[2021-05-31T00:33:12] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_271@31-05-2021_00-33-12.jpg>
[2021-05-31T00:33:20] Luis Magalhaes: Like this right?
[2021-05-31T00:33:28] Artem Bulashev: This mode
[2021-05-31T00:33:30] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-05-31T00:33:48] Luis Magalhaes: Showing zero 😅
[2021-05-31T00:34:51] Luis Magalhaes: Wait 50 something them zero 😂😂
[2021-05-31T00:35:04] Luis Magalhaes: I can do it from its sides?
[2021-05-31T00:35:20] Artem Bulashev: Has conductive on 2 sides
[2021-05-31T00:36:17] Luis Magalhaes: 50.9. / 55
[2021-05-31T00:36:22] Luis Magalhaes: Then zero
[2021-05-31T00:36:46] Luis Magalhaes: Is this 50 farads?
[2021-05-31T00:38:40] Luis Magalhaes: 50 micro farads
[2021-05-31T00:38:43] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-05-31T00:38:51] Luis Magalhaes: Now is not going to zero
[2021-05-31T00:40:07] Mirono escooters: 50 farads would be a world first for that size
[2021-05-31T00:42:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ♥️♥️
[2021-05-31T00:44:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: try it. if it add too much latency your throttle, then, it's too much..i doubt a capacitor can't handle 4v.
[2021-05-31T00:44:44] Mirono escooters: Elextrixity tip If u hear a small pif It cant handle it
[2021-05-31T00:45:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but, once.more, i strongly suggest tonmake a full.schematic of your wiring..it will really help us to understand what's wrong with your lights.
[2021-05-31T00:45:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-31T00:46:39] Luis Magalhaes: Micro 😂😂
[2021-05-31T00:46:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: example..
[2021-05-31T00:46:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_272@31-05-2021_00-46-49.jpg>
[2021-05-31T00:48:10] Luis Magalhaes: That i know 😂😂 just dont want to burn any more ubox, the first one did some ugly flames 😅
[2021-05-31T00:49:22] Artem Bulashev: I know how those esc work. Those caps are for input voltage so 25v capable
[2021-05-31T00:49:31] Artem Bulashev: 50nF it seems
[2021-05-31T00:49:45] Artem Bulashev: Entirely possible
[2021-05-31T00:50:00] Artem Bulashev: Those secs usually lucky to have 1000 on board
[2021-05-31T00:50:40] Artem Bulashev: And this particular esc is low amp rated 25a is not much so not many caps there
[2021-05-31T00:50:57] Artem Bulashev: About 500mF total it seems
[2021-05-31T00:51:27] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_273@31-05-2021_00-51-27.jpg>
[2021-05-31T00:52:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the only reason to blow a capacitor isnto apply a too high voltage. i don't know any capacitor not acceptive 5v on any pcb 😅😅
[2021-05-31T00:53:35] Luis Magalhaes: The lights are conected in parallel to the wire that conects the 2 parallel battery's 😂
[2021-05-31T00:54:17] Luis Magalhaes: But the cables pass in the same hole as the phase wires to front motor
[2021-05-31T00:54:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what is your battery voltage ? is.your light continuously powered ? what the light max voltage ?
[2021-05-31T00:54:27] Luis Magalhaes: Is it related?
[2021-05-31T00:54:44] Luis Magalhaes: 16S battery's
[2021-05-31T00:55:04] Luis Magalhaes: The lights can handle 85v i think
[2021-05-31T00:55:25] Luis Magalhaes: Forget to put the switch in the wires before the light
[2021-05-31T00:55:26] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-05-31T00:55:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the gnd of the main battery is not connected to anything except the light gnd ?
[2021-05-31T00:56:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if yes, this clarly an issue
[2021-05-31T00:56:40] Artem Bulashev: 2nd batter need to have same Ah other wise you can get into problems
[2021-05-31T00:56:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also, yes.👍
[2021-05-31T00:57:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you really need to connect all gnd together if you want // battery.
[2021-05-31T00:57:58] Artem Bulashev: Uneven discharge load, over discharge as result, fire as result or just dead cells
[2021-05-31T00:58:02] Luis Magalhaes: They have bms in each one
[2021-05-31T00:58:32] Artem Bulashev: Yeah do you know if it is charge only or charge and discharge BMS in them? ;-)
[2021-05-31T00:58:54] Luis Magalhaes: They have comon ports charge and discharge ports
[2021-05-31T00:58:59] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-05-31T00:59:02] Artem Bulashev: Good
[2021-05-31T00:59:17] Artem Bulashev: Moment
[2021-05-31T00:59:24] Artem Bulashev: Voltage is same ?
[2021-05-31T00:59:28] Luis Magalhaes: The main have now a smart bms and i intend to put one in the other battery too
[2021-05-31T00:59:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: even with bms. it's not advised unless it the same cells/capacity. 😉
[2021-05-31T00:59:42] Luis Magalhaes: Yes same voltage 16s
[2021-05-31T00:59:44] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-05-31T00:59:54] Artem Bulashev: In this case you can try
[2021-05-31T01:00:05] Luis Magalhaes: I know it some times charge the other
[2021-05-31T01:00:27] Artem Bulashev: Cross flow can cause too fast charging rate on one
[2021-05-31T01:00:32] Artem Bulashev: Bad for health
[2021-05-31T01:00:44] Artem Bulashev: That’s in event of uneven discharge
[2021-05-31T01:00:55] Artem Bulashev: Physics are on your side though
[2021-05-31T01:01:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok..but is.your schematic good ? gnd of the main battery isn't connected ?
[2021-05-31T01:01:12] Luis Magalhaes: The parallel one has a smaller bms then the main, it discharges most of the amps from mais and some less from the parallel, them the parallel charges the main have seen it
[2021-05-31T01:01:28] Artem Bulashev: Not how it works
[2021-05-31T01:01:40] Artem Bulashev: It will discharge more from battery with less resistance
[2021-05-31T01:01:47] Luis Magalhaes: Ground is conected to ubox
[2021-05-31T01:01:55] Luis Magalhaes: On the main and in the parallel
[2021-05-31T01:01:56] Artem Bulashev: But physics on your side as I said
[2021-05-31T01:02:24] Luis Magalhaes: Yes
[2021-05-31T01:03:19] Artem Bulashev: I have seen people try to connect 1s2p in parallel to 14s8p
[2021-05-31T01:03:20] Luis Magalhaes: It drains like 97A from mais when it is not conected to the parallel and when conected it drains like 70 from the main and the rest from the parallel
[2021-05-31T01:03:22] Artem Bulashev: Fire 🔥
[2021-05-31T01:03:37] Artem Bulashev: 👍👍
[2021-05-31T01:03:38] Luis Magalhaes: Say them to film it 😂😂
[2021-05-31T01:03:45] Luis Magalhaes: Kidding
[2021-05-31T01:04:08] Luis Magalhaes: But i know that parallel same voltage have to be conected
[2021-05-31T01:04:08] Artem Bulashev: Lol I did actually once, facebook keyboards love it
[2021-05-31T01:04:19] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-05-31T01:04:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-05-31T01:05:08] Luis Magalhaes: Oh i see what the shit i have done in the diagram 😂😂
[2021-05-31T01:05:15] Luis Magalhaes: Forget to connect it
[2021-05-31T01:05:21] Artem Bulashev: 🤝 I think you should be ok than also, main is on shorter cable so = less resistance as well, so will be prioritized It basically works like a power source to recharge and assist your main battery lol
[2021-05-31T01:05:48] Artem Bulashev: Just monitor that it doesn’t charge too fast the main pack
[2021-05-31T01:05:58] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_274@31-05-2021_01-05-58.jpg>
[2021-05-31T01:06:00] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2021-05-31T01:06:15] Artem Bulashev: After heavy load when main battery sags
[2021-05-31T01:07:18] Luis Magalhaes: Yes and always charge to the same voltage before conecting 😂😂
[2021-05-31T01:07:51] Luis Magalhaes: Yes that i can see it charges at 2A max
[2021-05-31T01:08:12] Luis Magalhaes: Have a 10P mh1 pack
[2021-05-31T01:08:17] Luis Magalhaes: Mj1
[2021-05-31T01:08:20] Luis Magalhaes: Sorry
[2021-05-31T01:09:41] Artem Bulashev: Mj1 is good
[2021-05-31T01:09:51] Artem Bulashev: I think 7amps max on those if not mistaken
[2021-05-31T01:09:54] Luis Magalhaes: So from the capacitor have to solder in what wires? Signal and ground?
[2021-05-31T01:09:56] Artem Bulashev: Mh1 is like 5amps max
[2021-05-31T01:10:22] Luis Magalhaes: Mj1 10A i think
[2021-05-31T01:11:04] Luis Magalhaes: Kaabo says for the fast charge to not get above 10A too
[2021-05-31T01:11:43] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_275@31-05-2021_01-11-43.jpg>
[2021-05-31T01:11:56] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 10 for short spikes will do
[2021-05-31T01:12:06] Artem Bulashev: But it will over heat in continuous
[2021-05-31T01:13:13] Luis Magalhaes: Yes short spikes 👍
[2021-05-31T01:13:17] Artem Bulashev: 35e also will not like 10amps but keeps its cool slightly better
[2021-05-31T01:13:27] Luis Magalhaes: I charge at most 5A
[2021-05-31T01:13:43] Luis Magalhaes: Normaly at 2A
[2021-05-31T01:13:53] Artem Bulashev: LG has normal charge rate very good 0.5c and fast charge 1c!
[2021-05-31T01:14:04] Artem Bulashev: So you are safe there
[2021-05-31T01:14:16] Luis Magalhaes: 1c is 3.5A right?
[2021-05-31T01:14:19] Luis Magalhaes: Per cell
[2021-05-31T01:14:38] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-31T01:14:44] Artem Bulashev: 3.4 mj1 no?
[2021-05-31T01:14:56] Artem Bulashev: https://eu.nkon.nl/rechargeable/li-ion/18650-size/lg-inr18650-mj1.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4Mylq8Ty8AIVkO5RCh1ohQDZEAAYASAAEgJwDvD_BwE
[2021-05-31T01:15:12] Luis Magalhaes: Don't need to charge it faster then 5A normaly, i have battery to do 90Km at average of 40kmh
[2021-05-31T01:15:24] Luis Magalhaes: At minimotors setup
[2021-05-31T01:15:37] Artem Bulashev: 😱
[2021-05-31T01:15:44] Luis Magalhaes: 3.5 minimum of 3.4 specs i think
[2021-05-31T01:15:58] Artem Bulashev: So yeah 3.5a
[2021-05-31T01:16:27] Luis Magalhaes: Have cells to have 54Ah total
[2021-05-31T01:16:28] Artem Bulashev: But I would highly recommend to use 0.5c as fast charge and 0.2C as normal daily = 2x the life expectancy
[2021-05-31T01:16:56] Artem Bulashev: Dammm
[2021-05-31T01:17:14] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i have 6000+km done right now 5000km only on main battery 😂
[2021-05-31T01:17:32] Luis Magalhaes: Charging only at 2A some times at 5A
[2021-05-31T01:17:43] Artem Bulashev: Vsett10+ with it’s sinewave does 75km with 35kmh and 70kg rider
[2021-05-31T01:18:01] Artem Bulashev: On 28ah
[2021-05-31T01:18:01] Luis Magalhaes: 70kg rider here too 😁
[2021-05-31T01:18:05] Artem Bulashev: 60v
[2021-05-31T01:18:53] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌
[2021-05-31T01:19:11] Luis Magalhaes: Those vsett10 are very good looking
[2021-05-31T01:44:15] Luis Magalhaes: Ok so i put in the capacitor looks the same 😂
[2021-05-31T01:44:42] Luis Magalhaes: Duty mode when not throtlle up it brakes right?
[2021-05-31T01:46:30] Luis Magalhaes: In current no reverse brake adc2 it was doing the same as duty (lights slightly on), i aply to the brakes a value in adc2 minimum of 2v it is now flutuating a little to 1.4v so it was braking
[2021-05-31T01:47:01] Luis Magalhaes: I check the current mode and if i throtlle up the lights get on too 😂
[2021-05-31T01:48:50] Luis Magalhaes: I think it is induction of the phase wires going into the lights, only the front ones lights the rear really needs the 67v to light up the front i did power up once with a 3s lipo
[2021-05-31T11:16:26] Luis Magalhaes: Hi guys thanks for the late night help yesterday and sorry for the too many noob questions 😂
[2021-05-31T11:16:55] Luis Magalhaes: Spintend responds to the email about the MOSFETs max temperature
[2021-05-31T11:16:59] Luis Magalhaes: vesc will triger high temp protection since 75°C ， so if it hits 75°C， it will auto lower down the current. You said in hot weather, it hit70° quickly, what's your current then?
[2021-05-31T11:19:07] Luis Magalhaes: Had respond to them saying my setups and saying what we talked about the datasheet of the mosfet temperatura, it looks they did not respond to the max temperature question but only had it to a safest place thats default vesc temperature cutting
[2021-05-31T11:20:31] Artem Bulashev: If there is a thick pad in between heat sink and fet - than the best solution is to replace it with Copper plate + best thermal past - this can lower temps by 20%
[2021-05-31T11:20:45] Artem Bulashev: Compare to thermalpad
[2021-05-31T11:21:02] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_277@31-05-2021_11-21-02.jpg>
[2021-05-31T11:21:04] Artem Bulashev: Anything above 1mm is thick
[2021-05-31T12:11:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-05-31T12:28:55] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2021-05-31T12:29:09] Artem Bulashev: Guys my rear motor makes this sound at about 10kmh when I accelerate push to max
[2021-05-31T12:29:16] Artem Bulashev: Like a desync ?
[2021-05-31T12:29:46] Artem Bulashev: And after it gets reall great acceleration pull
[2021-05-31T12:29:48] Mirono escooters: U use hall sensor?
[2021-05-31T12:29:51] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-31T12:30:04] Artem Bulashev: Set up passed multiple time every time
[2021-05-31T12:30:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: then it might be the switch from sensored to sensorless at fixed rpm.
[2021-05-31T12:31:03] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-31T12:31:07] Mirono escooters: Why would u switch
[2021-05-31T12:31:07] Artem Bulashev: Seems so to me
[2021-05-31T12:31:32] Artem Bulashev: Vesc apperantly runs without hall sensor reading after 2500rpm
[2021-05-31T12:31:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: usually controller switch, hall are not efficent at "high" speed
[2021-05-31T12:31:42] Artem Bulashev: Or erpm
[2021-05-31T12:31:47] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2021-05-31T12:31:52] Mirono escooters: I thought it was best w hall
[2021-05-31T12:32:16] Face de Pin Sucé: maybe it's a faulty hall sensor
[2021-05-31T12:32:27] Artem Bulashev: Me too, apperantly once rpm is high enough hall is not needed to predict position
[2021-05-31T12:32:31] Mirono escooters: My best bet
[2021-05-31T12:34:11] Face de Pin Sucé: I've seen this on many escooter that has one faulty hall
[2021-05-31T12:34:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: may be. but if it's only at a certain speed, I doubt it. simply put the scooter on a chair, and slowly increse speed. if it rattles at ANY low speed, then it's a failing sensor. if only at a certain speed, I vote for sensor switch. ==> increase the speed switch in vesc config
[2021-05-31T12:34:50] Artem Bulashev: Got you both
[2021-05-31T12:34:55] Artem Bulashev: Cheers will test
[2021-05-31T12:35:14] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_278@31-05-2021_12-35-14.jpg>
[2021-05-31T12:35:42] Face de Pin Sucé: perso, j'ai le même problème sur la Leger en ce moment, du coup je suis passé en sensorless
[2021-05-31T12:36:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-05-31T12:36:29] Artem Bulashev: Works in Senserless mod all ok? No rattle?
[2021-05-31T12:36:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sensorless + PAS and it will be perfect 😁
[2021-05-31T12:36:57] Artem Bulashev: Pas?
[2021-05-31T12:37:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: "pedal assist" (push to start)
[2021-05-31T12:37:14] Artem Bulashev: Oh yes
[2021-05-31T12:37:22] Artem Bulashev: But there is no pas
[2021-05-31T12:37:37] Artem Bulashev: Beside manually of course 😅
[2021-05-31T12:37:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not in the standard VESC, but on the smart, yes ;)
[2021-05-31T12:37:51] Artem Bulashev: Can’t wait to get your smarts
[2021-05-31T12:37:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-05-31T12:38:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so do I, with VESC !!!!!
[2021-05-31T12:38:11] Artem Bulashev: Btw
[2021-05-31T12:38:20] Artem Bulashev: How is vesc coming?
[2021-05-31T12:39:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nothing yet (the one from Tudor). and stil waiting for a connectors (XT60/90) order. seems a bit "lost" ... no movement since 13 days
[2021-05-31T12:39:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😭😭
[2021-05-31T12:39:34] Face de Pin Sucé: coggy from 0 to 1Kmh if you don't push, but after, works fine
[2021-05-31T12:39:44] Artem Bulashev: ✅
[2021-05-31T12:39:55] Artem Bulashev: Here I have coughing at about 10kmh
[2021-05-31T12:39:58] Artem Bulashev: Strange
[2021-05-31T12:40:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: calculate what 2500 ERPM does in km/h
[2021-05-31T12:40:54] Artem Bulashev: I have 14 and 197mm dia
[2021-05-31T12:41:01] Artem Bulashev: Set
[2021-05-31T12:41:12] Artem Bulashev: 14 pairs
[2021-05-31T12:41:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: my formula :
[2021-05-31T12:41:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: float coef = (settings->get_Wheel_size() * 2.54 * 0.001885) / settings->get_Number_of_poles_pairs(); return rpm * coef;
[2021-05-31T12:42:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 10 inches * 2.54 * 0.001885 / 14
[2021-05-31T12:42:33] Artem Bulashev: 8.5
[2021-05-31T12:42:46] Artem Bulashev: Thanks
[2021-05-31T12:42:57] Face de Pin Sucé: maybe I'm very strong and push from 0 to 10 ? 😁😂
[2021-05-31T12:43:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-05-31_12-43-17.png>
[2021-05-31T12:43:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 7.2 km/h
[2021-05-31T12:43:28] Artem Bulashev: Could be that indeed
[2021-05-31T12:43:31] Artem Bulashev: Thanks
[2021-05-31T12:43:44] Artem Bulashev: Also strange that only at max throttle
[2021-05-31T12:43:51] Artem Bulashev: If batte tu is full
[2021-05-31T12:43:59] Artem Bulashev: If battery is like 50% it doesn’t
[2021-05-31T12:44:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I never tested vesc in sensored, so I couldn't tell
[2021-05-31T12:44:38] Artem Bulashev: May be it tries to accelerate faster than it can?
[2021-05-31T12:44:49] Artem Bulashev: Sounds stupid haha
[2021-05-31T12:44:59] Artem Bulashev: Ok cheers man! Thanks every one!
[2021-05-31T13:17:25] Luis Magalhaes: Cooper replacing the thermal pad?
[2021-05-31T13:18:47] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂 im sorry
[2021-05-31T13:19:11] Luis Magalhaes: I think the original pad is like that
[2021-05-31T13:19:33] Artem Bulashev: Copper + thermal plast on each side is way better than one thick thermal pad
[2021-05-31T13:19:44] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_279@31-05-2021_13-19-44.jpg>
[2021-05-31T13:19:54] Artem Bulashev: Here is an example from pc and similar temps
[2021-05-31T13:42:23] Luis Magalhaes: Ok 👌
[2021-05-31T13:43:34] Luis Magalhaes: So replace it with copper but what size?
[2021-05-31T13:43:41] Happy Giraffe: Its great, I was just surprised about the activity here 😂
[2021-05-31T13:44:02] Luis Magalhaes: The deck was not that hot under the zone the controller where too
[2021-05-31T13:44:21] Luis Magalhaes: In minimotor setup it got lot hotter then now
[2021-05-31T13:44:40] Luis Magalhaes: Too many noob questions i have 😂😂
[2021-05-31T14:14:39] Artem Bulashev: Dammm
[2021-05-31T14:14:42] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_280@31-05-2021_14-14-42.jpg>
[2021-05-31T14:14:43] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_281@31-05-2021_14-14-43.jpg>
[2021-05-31T14:14:43] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_282@31-05-2021_14-14-43.jpg>
[2021-05-31T14:15:07] Artem Bulashev: Down 2 degree road Up 1 degree road Perfect flat road 😛😛😛
[2021-05-31T14:15:27] Artem Bulashev: Motor is warmish but far from hot
[2021-05-31T14:17:19] Luis Magalhaes: 💪 and how is your MOSFETs temperature after that?
[2021-05-31T14:17:23] Luis Magalhaes: 😁
[2021-05-31T14:17:36] Artem Bulashev: No idea
[2021-05-31T14:17:44] Artem Bulashev: Only one esc is working
[2021-05-31T14:17:55] Artem Bulashev: So heat sink decepates well
[2021-05-31T14:18:10] Artem Bulashev: Vesc always about 30c to touch
[2021-05-31T14:18:30] Artem Bulashev: But from single when 650w that kind of acceleration?)))
[2021-05-31T14:18:30] Luis Magalhaes: Get a cheap android 😂😂
[2021-05-31T14:18:44] Artem Bulashev: Can’t wait to get 56a battery setting hahaha
[2021-05-31T14:18:58] Artem Bulashev: That should make it go fast
[2021-05-31T14:19:02] Luis Magalhaes: 💪💪 go go go
[2021-05-31T14:19:12] Artem Bulashev: I don’t think you can over heat fets with 28a battery
[2021-05-31T14:20:07] Artem Bulashev: It limits duration of 90amps phase to rather short time I suspect
[2021-05-31T14:20:19] Artem Bulashev: Yeah will get an android phone soon
[2021-05-31T14:20:59] Luis Magalhaes: Its nice to have the vesc tools with you all time
[2021-05-31T14:21:06] Luis Magalhaes: All info in hand
[2021-05-31T14:23:38] Artem Bulashev: Absolutely
[2021-05-31T14:23:39] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-05-31T14:39:41] Happy Giraffe: 650w meaning only like 10-12Amps?😅
[2021-05-31T14:43:09] Luis Magalhaes: not sure what case you use, but in our test without case, we test in summer in room, the temp actually don't grow so quickly. if you run in high speed, suggest you to add extra cooling fun to dissipate it.
[2021-05-31T14:43:18] Luis Magalhaes: Email response of spintend
[2021-05-31T14:43:22] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2021-05-31T14:44:06] Luis Magalhaes: They where testing the ubox without case? Or the case of ubox outside any case ?! 😅
[2021-05-31T14:50:14] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-05-31T14:50:44] Happy Giraffe: You only used 650w battery power?
[2021-05-31T14:51:10] Artem Bulashev: This is nominal power from factory I’m pushing this little guy with 1600+ watts battery
[2021-05-31T14:51:17] Happy Giraffe: Aah
[2021-05-31T14:51:17] Artem Bulashev: 28a battery current
[2021-05-31T14:51:33] Happy Giraffe: 4x nominal should be ok? 👀
[2021-05-31T14:51:35] Artem Bulashev: Battery is Chinese 13ah so don’t want to stress it more
[2021-05-31T14:51:46] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2021-05-31T14:51:59] Artem Bulashev: That’s the benefit of FOC - very little waist in heat
[2021-05-31T14:52:27] Happy Giraffe: Im running 500w motor in Xiaomi as 2000w😂
[2021-05-31T14:52:31] Artem Bulashev: Motor is only barely hot to touch even after 10km (may be like 55c-60c)
[2021-05-31T14:52:59] Happy Giraffe: Some article said FOC is not as energy efficient as the other bld or whatever it was
[2021-05-31T14:53:45] Artem Bulashev: It is more efficient at low and mid loads
[2021-05-31T14:53:52] Artem Bulashev: Duty Cycle
[2021-05-31T14:54:08] Artem Bulashev: But less than square wave at max duty cycle
[2021-05-31T14:54:16] Happy Giraffe: What's the range of mid loads?
[2021-05-31T14:54:34] Artem Bulashev: 0-66% throttle
[2021-05-31T14:54:45] Happy Giraffe: Then its perfect for me 😎
[2021-05-31T14:54:59] Artem Bulashev: 0-66% Duty cycle is more correct to say
[2021-05-31T14:55:07] Artem Bulashev: From my understanding
[2021-05-31T14:56:12] Happy Giraffe: Im a newbie in this haha so I don't know. FOC sounds like it could do 2500w for me. Now motor barely gets 50c
[2021-05-31T14:57:34] Happy Giraffe: I feel like riding at half throttle is best speed/economy balance anyways on Xiaomi atleast. You will go 1-2 kmh slower but save ton of power
[2021-05-31T16:21:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: guys, if you have ideas to integrate in the SmartDisplay/SmartController for VESC, let me know. I'll check what can be done.
[2021-05-31T16:22:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for exemple, i'd like to add an "ECO" mode comparable to ECO modes we have on most escooters.
[2021-05-31T16:22:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it would limit the max current (bat or phase ?)
[2021-05-31T16:22:34] Happy Giraffe: Maybe the remote could have 3 buttons for 3 modes: -Police mode -Normal, but not too fast mode -Unlocked maxspeed
[2021-05-31T16:22:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is alredy 3 modes : 25 km/h, 35 km/h, unlimited
[2021-05-31T16:23:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the scooter can start in "security" mode (mode 2/3 aren't available with buttons)
[2021-05-31T16:23:25] Happy Giraffe: Can the speed limits be customized?
[2021-05-31T16:23:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for now, no. but it's easy to add
[2021-05-31T16:23:59] Happy Giraffe: Could be like 25kmh, 40kmh and unlimited
[2021-05-31T16:24:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and even 20 km/h for the first mode (it's the legal limit in some countries)
[2021-05-31T16:24:49] Happy Giraffe: 40 could be for longer roads, but still not enough for police to make your case with 125cc bike laws
[2021-05-31T16:25:22] Happy Giraffe: Because if police measures your 40, then 25kmh will just piss them off😂
[2021-05-31T16:25:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol
[2021-05-31T16:26:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you enable the "security" mode. the limit can still be removed if you press the brake at startup ;)
[2021-05-31T16:26:13] Happy Giraffe: Can choose 25/20 or 40kmh profile for them, depending if they got you on radar or not
[2021-05-31T16:26:23] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-05-31T16:57:54] Artem Bulashev: Yeah my thought exactly 25-40-unlim but may be customisable is best
[2021-05-31T16:58:07] Artem Bulashev: For that reason as well yeah
[2021-05-31T16:58:34] Artem Bulashev: I think you could make eco mode based on watts lim
[2021-05-31T17:00:39] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-05-31T17:00:42] Artem Bulashev: May be
[2021-05-31T17:11:25] Artem Bulashev: Speed Gears 1/2/3 (no power/acceleration reduction) - 20/25 - 35/30/35 - unlimited speed Modes (legal, eco, normal, boost for 2 min and 5min cool down timer) - 250/500/600w configurable - eco 0.6 multiplier for phase and 0.7 for battery current - normal no change - boost multiplier 1.2 for battery and phase currents
[2021-05-31T17:21:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: peed Gears 1/2/3 (no power/acceleration reduction) - 20/25 - 35/30/35 - unlimited speed » ok
[2021-05-31T17:21:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Modes (legal, eco, normal, boost for 2 min and 5min cool down timer) - 250/500/600w configurable - eco 0.6 multiplier for phase and 0.7 for battery current - normal no change - boost multiplier 1.2 for battery and phase currents » very interesting
[2021-05-31T17:22:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I already have a "nitro boost" option. I need to plug it for VESC ;)
[2021-05-31T17:22:32] Artem Bulashev: Just thinking out loud how to maximise cool futures 😎
[2021-05-31T17:22:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for now, you need to keep a button pushed to activate the boost ;)
[2021-05-31T17:22:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: as soon as you release, it stop the boost
[2021-05-31T17:23:16] Artem Bulashev: Vsett has it and it works like I discrived - push and you have 2 min of added power
[2021-05-31T17:23:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I'll add a warning indicator and mosfet temperature limit to let the user know why boost is disabled
[2021-05-31T17:23:39] Artem Bulashev: Than cooldown timer before it lets to re engage it
[2021-05-31T17:24:09] Artem Bulashev: Yeah with vesc it could be taken further and be smarter
[2021-05-31T17:24:19] Artem Bulashev: 🤝🙃
[2021-05-31T17:25:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: temperature mosfet threshold should do the job (more than timer)
[2021-05-31T17:26:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: added to my TODO list : // TODO : VESC / configurable speed limits // Modes (legal, eco, normal, boost for 2 min and 5min cool down timer) // - 20/25 // - 35/30/35 // - unlimited speed // TODO : VESC / configure ECO & BOOST // - eco 0.6 multiplier for phase and 0.7 for battery current // - normal no change // - boost multiplier 1.2 for battery and phase currents // TODO : VESC / TFT & app warning indicator boost // TODO : VESC / limit boost with threshold if MOSFET are too high
[2021-05-31T17:33:04] Artem Bulashev: Well could be both so that we don’t wait to get over heat :))
[2021-05-31T17:33:26] Artem Bulashev: Love you brother 😘🔥🔥🔥
[2021-05-31T19:00:22] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_283@31-05-2021_19-00-22.jpg>

[2021-05-31T19:00:46] Mirono escooters: O boy
[2021-05-31T19:01:17] Luis Magalhaes: 1 sec less to 70kmh just coolder vesc
[2021-05-31T19:01:33] Luis Magalhaes: Did not charged to full battery
[2021-05-31T19:02:05] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2021-05-31T19:02:34] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-05-31T19:03:22] Happy Giraffe: For real 10 seconds to 70kmh is like 80 horsepower car lol
[2021-05-31T20:27:00] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-05-31T20:27:56] Luis Magalhaes: 2secods to get same time as my old minimotors setup 😂😂
[2021-05-31T20:28:12] Artem Bulashev: I basically nearly same to 30kmh ;-)
[2021-05-31T20:28:58] Artem Bulashev: I mean faster by 0.5sec 😝 but let’s say it is in the margin of error hehe
[2021-05-31T20:32:12] Luis Magalhaes: 😂💪
[2021-05-31T21:19:48] Artem Bulashev: How do you travel 30kmh in 4 sec and 19m, while I got to 30kmh in 3.6sec and and 29m 😅
[2021-05-31T21:24:27] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂 that i dont know
[2021-05-31T21:25:05] Luis Magalhaes: What app are you using? And is it only for ios?
[2021-05-31T21:25:16] Artem Bulashev: End result gps can’t be trusted? 😂 Best to record 60fps the display that was calibrated to have correct speed (at speed you want to measure - travel 40kmh and make sure gps speed is same 40kmh on display, than record screen 0-40kmh)
[2021-05-31T21:25:29] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_284@31-05-2021_21-25-29.jpg>

[2021-05-31T21:27:18] Luis Magalhaes: Im using this but think its only android
[2021-05-31T21:27:26] Artem Bulashev: That one is not for iOS, tried to find
[2021-05-31T21:27:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-05-31T21:27:37] Artem Bulashev: Try to see if you have. Race timer
[2021-05-31T21:27:53] Luis Magalhaes: But today had 75% of gps accuracy in a sunny day it gives a more precise mesure
[2021-05-31T21:27:54] Artem Bulashev: Ideally need something like race logic
[2021-05-31T21:28:00] Artem Bulashev: 👍👍
[2021-05-31T21:28:06] Artem Bulashev: I had 100% today
[2021-05-31T21:28:36] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_286@31-05-2021_21-28-36.jpg>
[2021-05-31T21:28:43] Luis Magalhaes: Will download it
[2021-05-31T21:29:08] Artem Bulashev: Truth is in numbers same - field ideally, same place same direction make 5 runs / average it to get correct result
[2021-05-31T21:30:17] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i should do that to give it more accurate
[2021-05-31T21:30:25] Luis Magalhaes: Was just a small testing
[2021-05-31T21:30:29] Artem Bulashev: Can’t load your photo
[2021-05-31T21:31:05] Luis Magalhaes: Hum, its the gps race timer
[2021-05-31T21:31:15] Luis Magalhaes: Have it for android too
[2021-05-31T21:31:25] Artem Bulashev: ✅✅
[2021-05-31T21:31:34] Artem Bulashev: Not as good as your app
[2021-05-31T21:31:39] Artem Bulashev: But common ground
[2021-05-31T21:32:47] Luis Magalhaes: The drag racer when its not a sunny day sometimes it even let me go 😂
[2021-05-31T22:23:03] Happy Giraffe: I could calculate it from my M365 Dashboard graphs haha, combines gps, time and scooter speedometer readings
[2021-05-31T23:46:02] Artem Bulashev: Yeah you could 🙂 but interesting to see that gps speed is actually very close match 😳 this means doing 5_10 runs and removing outliers and than averaging down the remaining should be very accurate
[2021-05-31T23:58:09] Happy Giraffe: People at the review section disagree lol
[2021-05-31T23:58:56] Artem Bulashev: I’m surprised but your data proves that most out of 10 runs will have correct tracking if gps lock was accurate
[2021-06-01T00:00:11] Artem Bulashev: But here is what I expected to see
[2021-06-01T00:00:25] Artem Bulashev: Phone gps is good at fixing Trevor speed
[2021-06-01T00:00:30] Happy Giraffe: 🤔
[2021-06-01T00:00:35] Artem Bulashev: But not so good to fix starting time
[2021-06-01T00:00:40] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_288@01-06-2021_00-00-40.jpg>
[2021-06-01T00:01:04] Artem Bulashev: So gps measurement doesn’t start for 0.5sec or more when you start moving (example value)
[2021-06-01T00:01:16] Artem Bulashev: But it ends it correctly when you are going 40kmh
[2021-06-01T00:01:34] Artem Bulashev: This your real time 0-40kmh is a little longer than it says it is
[2021-06-01T00:01:59] Artem Bulashev: That’s why calibrated value from wheel is more accurate
[2021-06-01T00:03:50] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, just a bit delay haha
[2021-06-01T00:04:24] Happy Giraffe: But then I can do both apps at the same time and see, if gps is inline with wheel then I can trust the calculation ±10%
[2021-06-01T00:10:38] Luis Magalhaes: in a vesc log it shows speed too 😁
[2021-06-01T00:10:57] Luis Magalhaes: i calibrate mine to be a litlle above the gps speed 😂
[2021-06-01T00:11:39] Luis Magalhaes: in the russion vesc group when they saw 80kmh my gps had see the top speed at 85kmh
[2021-06-01T00:13:34] Artem Bulashev: So alittle positive on vesc setting
[2021-06-01T00:15:58] Artem Bulashev: When you do 0-30kmh in 3-4sec little delay means 1/6-1/8th so alot :) if it was 0.5 out of 20sec, sure, it would be in margin of error 🙃 for faster speed need more precise tools I guess
[2021-06-01T00:23:50] Luis Magalhaes: The vesc is always above the gps 😁
[2021-06-01T00:24:21] Artem Bulashev: Just need to set correct wheel diameter and motor poles
[2021-06-01T00:24:39] Artem Bulashev: Motor poles are used to count RPM
[2021-06-01T00:24:55] Artem Bulashev: Than wheel diameter to convert into distance traveled
[2021-06-01T00:25:00] Artem Bulashev: To set it correctly
[2021-06-01T00:25:48] Artem Bulashev: Stand on scooter and make it flat (parallel to the floor left to right) and ask some one to measure distance from hub Center to floor perpendicularly
[2021-06-01T00:26:21] Artem Bulashev: And *2 to get diameter, as that would be radius
[2021-06-01T00:27:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-06-01T00:44:52] Luis Magalhaes: I mesure a starting point and roll it 1 ful turn
[2021-06-01T00:44:54] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-06-01T00:57:59] Artem Bulashev: That the circumference - if you convert it back to dia sure also great way, just make sure you stand on it with your typical gear when you do it (tyre must compress as on real life)
[2021-06-01T00:59:37] Artem Bulashev: Or May be without gear because when you ride contrefugues forece + heat will expend air and over inflate it which will compensate for added gear weight 😅 - I’m over calculating shit it seems 😂sorry ppl
[2021-06-01T01:00:20] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌
[2021-06-01T01:00:58] Luis Magalhaes: Too much 😂😂
[2021-06-01T01:49:37] Artem Bulashev: In another group person has confirmed that Ubox can take 100amps battery per channel 130 amps phase per channel And it will not even get close to over heating if - you place better thermal pad between fets and case - add good thermal past between ubox and scooter frame 👌
[2021-06-01T01:51:00] Happy Giraffe: Damn, that's insane
[2021-06-01T01:54:12] Artem Bulashev: Also ubox Pro will come that includes few mods that are needed on current Ubox to support 150amps phase without polluting with EMI the logic board 👌👌👌
[2021-06-01T01:54:40] Happy Giraffe: Is it going to be 400-500€?
[2021-06-01T01:54:53] Artem Bulashev: Yeap and it was at like 45c only 🤣
[2021-06-01T01:55:21] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_289@01-06-2021_01-55-21.jpg>
[2021-06-01T01:55:39] Artem Bulashev: Unlikely. Minimal changes, great brand so far and fair / open about prices so I would expect fair price to remain
[2021-06-01T01:55:46] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi spikes to 50c in one throttle on sunny day 28°c
[2021-06-01T01:56:36] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂
[2021-06-01T01:57:07] Happy Giraffe: It has all cooling mods done, but not mosfets bolted directly to frame, but yeah 40A and thermal sensor next to mosfet...
[2021-06-01T01:57:18] Artem Bulashev: I mean… different league
[2021-06-01T01:57:47] Artem Bulashev: Mosfet internal resistance is what heats up + power traces design
[2021-06-01T01:58:17] Artem Bulashev: So good design in Ubox and your get such thermal performance :)
[2021-06-01T01:58:35] Happy Giraffe: Next one Im worried about burning the motor😂
[2021-06-01T01:58:55] Happy Giraffe: Batteries can do 100-120A but only one motor😂
[2021-06-01T01:59:36] Artem Bulashev: That’s just for people that are worried about over heat - I’m not sure how hot would it get with stock pad and no thermal past to the scooter frame though - but those are like 5€ mod to do :)
[2021-06-01T01:59:58] Artem Bulashev: Yes motor is my limitation too - stay visually legal
[2021-06-01T02:00:26] Happy Giraffe: But as FOC heats motor less🤔😎
[2021-06-01T02:00:27] Artem Bulashev: It can take only 90a phase continuously
[2021-06-01T02:00:45] Artem Bulashev: 100% true
[2021-06-01T02:00:51] Happy Giraffe: Btw, how does the auto calibration calculate the Amps?
[2021-06-01T02:01:07] Artem Bulashev: Too low
[2021-06-01T02:01:20] Artem Bulashev: It set mine at 33 motor amps
[2021-06-01T02:01:24] Artem Bulashev: And 80 for battery
[2021-06-01T02:01:26] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-06-01T02:01:28] Happy Giraffe: 👀
[2021-06-01T02:01:35] Artem Bulashev: 13ah Chinese 52v
[2021-06-01T02:01:36] Happy Giraffe: Shouldnt they be other way around lol?
[2021-06-01T02:01:37] Artem Bulashev: No thanks
[2021-06-01T02:01:51] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that would be more reasonable hehe
[2021-06-01T02:01:55] Artem Bulashev: So I set my own
[2021-06-01T02:02:07] Artem Bulashev: 90a phase and 28a battery
[2021-06-01T02:02:15] Artem Bulashev: And it FASST
[2021-06-01T02:02:55] Happy Giraffe: I wonder what happens to the current when it goes to phases, it gets converted to lesser voltage?
[2021-06-01T02:03:05] Happy Giraffe: And thats why higher amps?
[2021-06-01T02:06:28] Artem Bulashev: You have avaible input power = watt So battery voltage at the instant * setting batter amp 28a in my case Let’s say battery voltage is 57.4v = 1607watts available
[2021-06-01T02:07:25] Artem Bulashev: Motor at 4kmh has voltage 5v on it for example and your phase current is 100amps = 500w will be on motor
[2021-06-01T02:08:08] Artem Bulashev: Tan you get to 15kmh and voltage is now 15v for example *100a= 1500w - still able to make full phase current
[2021-06-01T02:09:06] Artem Bulashev: But now you are going 20kmh and voltage is like 18v for example * 100a= would equal 1800w but it’s not possible to produce more than input gives
[2021-06-01T02:09:48] Artem Bulashev: So controller now reduces phase current to stay at available power limit, that is defined by voltage of battery * battery amp setting
[2021-06-01T02:10:25] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-06-01T02:10:33] Happy Giraffe: I see, makes sense. And this is why motor doesnt give all power at start?🤔
[2021-06-01T02:10:41] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-06-01T02:10:50] Artem Bulashev: Voltage is rpm related
[2021-06-01T02:11:01] Artem Bulashev: Higher rpm higher voltage comes to motor
[2021-06-01T02:11:18] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi esc gives exactly 20A before 20kmh and then doubles it to 40A lol
[2021-06-01T02:12:06] Happy Giraffe: Maybe it cant give more Amps due to lack of volts
[2021-06-01T02:12:20] Artem Bulashev: 🤷‍♂️
[2021-06-01T02:12:47] Happy Giraffe: Vesc should be better low end power tho right?😂
[2021-06-01T02:13:02] Happy Giraffe: "electric motor instant torque"...😂
[2021-06-01T02:13:25] Artem Bulashev: Not exactly
[2021-06-01T02:13:37] Artem Bulashev: Torque is better on square wave
[2021-06-01T02:13:41] Artem Bulashev: At low
[2021-06-01T02:14:01] Artem Bulashev: That’s why you can get this punch from 0kmh
[2021-06-01T02:14:25] Artem Bulashev: On sine wave not possible due to less time spent at MAX
[2021-06-01T02:15:06] Happy Giraffe: And FOC is sine?
[2021-06-01T02:15:21] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-06-01T02:15:24] Artem Bulashev: But
[2021-06-01T02:15:40] Artem Bulashev: Foc is much more efficient- less heating up of the motor
[2021-06-01T02:15:56] Artem Bulashev: Which means you can push more into the motor before it over heats
[2021-06-01T02:16:35] Happy Giraffe: How much more do you think? 10%? 30?🤔
[2021-06-01T02:16:35] Artem Bulashev: End result you can get similar first acceleration, almost, and a lot faster 7-40kmh 👌👌👌
[2021-06-01T02:17:00] Happy Giraffe: One more kick gets me already to 15
[2021-06-01T02:17:07] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-06-01T02:17:34] Artem Bulashev: So with kick assist foc will own the pedestal easily
[2021-06-01T02:17:54] Artem Bulashev: Because 0-7 is defined more by your leg 🦵 lol
[2021-06-01T02:17:59] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-01T02:19:12] Happy Giraffe: It definitely will be an experience with a good vesc, maybe even new models come out
[2021-06-01T02:21:15] Happy Giraffe: Two months until Ill be ordering one
[2021-06-01T02:21:19] Artem Bulashev: For my motors 650w ubox is even slight over kill, so it is as good as it gets, unless I go for illegal motor - no need it seems
[2021-06-01T02:22:19] Artem Bulashev: But there will be weaker one coming up
[2021-06-01T02:22:38] Artem Bulashev: Should be perfect for 500w motors and bellow
[2021-06-01T02:23:42] Happy Giraffe: Will be interesting to wait and see what comes out
[2021-06-01T02:27:14] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_290@01-06-2021_02-27-14.jpg>
[2021-06-01T02:27:14] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_291@01-06-2021_02-27-14.jpg>
[2021-06-01T02:27:35] Artem Bulashev: Marcin Juraszek 3.3v/5v/12v all adds recovery fuse. and 5ports for 12v, so user can send signal to control the lights horn freely, also can use our remote to control them. and antispark switch circuit
[2021-06-01T02:28:10] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-01T02:30:26] Luis Magalhaes: mine hit 47ºc in that test today lolol
[2021-06-01T02:30:46] Artem Bulashev: Wo wo
[2021-06-01T02:31:03] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2021-06-01T02:31:10] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣
[2021-06-01T02:31:43] Artem Bulashev: What settings ?
[2021-06-01T02:32:33] Luis Magalhaes: same 60A battery 100A phase but i put some aluminium plates under the ubox that my minimotors used
[2021-06-01T02:32:45] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-06-01T02:33:00] Luis Magalhaes: looks a bit better but have to test more
[2021-06-01T02:33:32] Artem Bulashev: Those were the result after replaceing thermal pad for better one and using good thermal past to the scooter body
[2021-06-01T02:34:08] Artem Bulashev: So with original thermal pad result may be higher, still very cool cucumber 🥒
[2021-06-01T02:34:10] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-06-01T02:37:25] Luis Magalhaes: yes 😂😂 but more time runing full should heat more
[2021-06-01T02:38:04] Artem Bulashev: Could yeah, if you get to 65 consider replacing pad ;-)
[2021-06-01T02:40:28] Luis Magalhaes: should replace it any way if it dissipates more 😂😂
[2021-06-01T02:41:03] Luis Magalhaes: they use pad or paste?
[2021-06-01T02:41:28] Artem Bulashev: There is pad inside between fets and case
[2021-06-01T02:41:41] Artem Bulashev: Buy best pad you can find to use there
[2021-06-01T02:41:57] Artem Bulashev: And than thermal past between case and scooter body
[2021-06-01T02:42:00] Artem Bulashev: 👍🥒
[2021-06-01T02:43:46] Happy Giraffe: What would be the best pad? Gelid?
[2021-06-01T02:44:29] Luis Magalhaes: yes need to know the best pad too 😂😂
[2021-06-01T02:45:03] Happy Giraffe: I think gelid was bit better for me than Arctic
[2021-06-01T02:55:48] Luis Magalhaes: 👍ok
[2021-06-01T02:56:27] Happy Giraffe: But more fragile, especially against the rather sharp fets with pressure
[2021-06-01T17:48:41] Happy Giraffe: @Tudor_VTA Do you have any tips on how to drill the 500w monorim valve hole?
[2021-06-01T17:49:07] Happy Giraffe: I got an Emove tube with a bit offcenter valve 45°
[2021-06-01T17:51:25] Tudor: Check on my fb page
[2021-06-01T17:52:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: which page? 😁

[2021-06-01T17:53:20] Tudor: Have you got rhe vesc?
[2021-06-01T17:53:49] Happy Giraffe: Cool, thanks!
[2021-06-01T22:31:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope 😅😅
[2021-06-01T22:52:41] Luis Magalhaes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7X3trQ2Ze4
[2021-06-01T22:52:47] Luis Magalhaes: Have you seen this video
[2021-06-01T22:53:12] Luis Magalhaes: The show some of the rion controllers and many specs of how its made
[2021-06-01T22:53:53] Luis Magalhaes: I like it a lot, there is not many info about rion things 😂
[2021-06-01T23:13:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nice video. i personnaly don't like Gal (especially because of some 'megalo' interventions on some fb groups), but the machine is really amazing from my point of view. performant, beautiful, well built. nothing we can see actually on 'chinese' models.
[2021-06-01T23:14:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for field weakening, there is some major issues. we made many tests. it consumes a LOT of current for a small increase of speed.
[2021-06-01T23:16:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: their last controller is really massive. nothing like what i've seen before. really impressive. is the heat pipe is a great idea if well designed. to push the heat away from the mosfets to air vents. really good idea without exposing the controller to dust or water.
[2021-06-01T23:17:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: weped seems like real monsters/mecano compared to that 🤣🤣
[2021-06-01T23:18:52] Artem Bulashev: One strange decision is to put radiator up front :)) so air travels through heats up at radiator and and than going into bay with controllers 😂
[2021-06-01T23:19:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: may they divert the air
[2021-06-01T23:19:31] Artem Bulashev: Wha was that motor connector ? It is like mt30 but huge
[2021-06-01T23:19:50] Artem Bulashev: Sure hope they do but I have not seen any other openings
[2021-06-01T23:20:44] Artem Bulashev: MR30 I meant
[2021-06-01T23:20:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on previous models, they had air vents on the front, but controllers were exposed to water if i remember correctly. i guess they won't make the same mistake with this one and pit them in separeted spaces with sealing.
[2021-06-01T23:21:00] Artem Bulashev: But like 8mm size
[2021-06-01T23:21:24] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌 should not be that hard
[2021-06-01T23:21:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly 😉
[2021-06-01T23:21:52] Mirono escooters: I want water cooling Radiator in front of scoot Xd Overkill. I kno
[2021-06-01T23:22:13] Artem Bulashev: Try over heat Ubox for now 😂
[2021-06-01T23:22:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's not water cooling (no active pump to push water), just heap pipes with gas inside if it's like graphic cards
[2021-06-01T23:23:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-06-01T23:23:19] Artem Bulashev: Yeah copper heat pipes
[2021-06-01T23:23:36] Artem Bulashev: Extremely good at caring heat away based on physics (pressure difference and gas dynamics)
[2021-06-01T23:25:08] Artem Bulashev: It is in fact liquid in them that evaporates and than condenses back to liquid
[2021-06-01T23:26:47] Luis Magalhaes: Its a great machine, beautiful design, and lots of power and technology
[2021-06-01T23:28:34] Luis Magalhaes: The field weakening only acts when the motor hits top rpm so it only waste energy to get a little more speed if you push it to max, at those times i think your not thinking about the wasted energy just the little more you can go 😂😂
[2021-06-01T23:30:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: one last thing. their explanation about "sinewave" isn't correct. FOC is more than simple sinewave
[2021-06-01T23:30:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://www.motioncontroltips.com/faq-whats-the-difference-between-field-oriented-control-and-sinusoidal-commutation/
[2021-06-01T23:31:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: clarke and park 😝😝
[2021-06-01T23:34:28] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, i think it was just the basic to the dumb people 😂😂
[2021-06-01T23:35:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah. it's a bit complicated otherwise ☺️
[2021-06-01T23:36:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a very good document to understand it with schematics to help :

[2021-06-01T23:43:49] Happy Giraffe: Rion RE90 23s7p Molicel P42A, so about 235A battery current
[2021-06-01T23:48:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: holy shit ... 20s8p in 31 kgs ? "Production time is 200 days, not less, not more." 😂😂😂

[2021-06-01T23:48:49] Luis Magalhaes: Did not knot abou the sinusoidal
[2021-06-01T23:49:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😊😊
[2021-06-01T23:49:24] Luis Magalhaes: Tks for this @koxx3 😁👍
[2021-06-01T23:50:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, most "chinese" controller annonce "sine-wave" (Zero for example). it's not FOC ;) it's really stupid sinewave.
[2021-06-01T23:50:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's simple, when you open the controller and see a 8 bits controller, it's simply not possible to do FOC.
[2021-06-01T23:51:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: even with a small 32 bits microcontroller, it's already hard. We had a lot of difficulties to fit the FOC in the xiaomi controller... but we did it 😂😂
[2021-06-01T23:59:45] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-06-02T00:00:19] Luis Magalhaes: All foc controllers do file weakening?
[2021-06-02T00:00:53] Happy Giraffe: Meanwhile Im thinking why the fuck Monorim thinks two polished smooth round shapes have good grip
[2021-06-02T00:00:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think yes. it's just a variable to adjust in the FOC loop.
[2021-06-02T00:01:24] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_299@02-06-2021_00-01-24.jpg>
[2021-06-02T00:03:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you want more infos about FOC, have a look at my Xiaomi FOC controller repo ;) https://github.com/Koxx3/SmartESC_STM32_v2/tree/main/docs
[2021-06-02T00:03:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a gathered a lot of documents
[2021-06-02T00:04:41] Luis Magalhaes: 👌 nice
[2021-06-02T01:14:08] Face de Pin Sucé: and still 140mm brake disc... 😂 We saw a RE90, on track, it is powerful yes, but it wasn't faster than Z100X from RageMechanics built in one week by 2 guys that didn't sleep 😂 we had a huge straight line to compare 😁
[2021-06-02T01:14:20] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: j'arrive je scroll je vois tt sauf du vesc
[2021-06-02T01:14:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: je vois des pneus dès Monorim de la merde mais pas de vesc 🤣
[2021-06-02T01:15:06] Face de Pin Sucé: scroll plus haut ;) ils sont tous en spintend ici
[2021-06-02T01:15:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 🤣🤣
[2021-06-02T01:15:33] Happy Giraffe: Our xiaomis have 140mm😂
[2021-06-02T01:15:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: vesc à poil ?
[2021-06-02T01:16:21] Face de Pin Sucé: we laughed a lot, after several corners, you feel a big drop in braking performance
[2021-06-02T01:16:24] Happy Giraffe: Link to the other scooter?
[2021-06-02T01:17:03] Happy Giraffe: Also F in chat for Rion as they advertise using motor amps
[2021-06-02T01:17:24] Face de Pin Sucé: F
[2021-06-02T01:18:17] Face de Pin Sucé: https://youtu.be/xMKMA3e8rP4 you can see it on this video Z100X is a upgraded Zero10X driven by a long blond hair guy haha
[2021-06-02T01:19:20] Face de Pin Sucé: (Video is filmed by a guy running DTX controllers on Thunder with 60V50Ah 21700 50E battery and stock handlebar 😂)
[2021-06-02T02:41:28] Luis Magalhaes: What specs? 😁
[2021-06-02T02:41:58] Luis Magalhaes: Need some magura on that 😂
[2021-06-02T02:42:25] Happy Giraffe: Get some Brembo moto brakes😂
[2021-06-02T02:44:44] Luis Magalhaes: In track the rider count a lot too 😁
[2021-06-02T02:45:31] Luis Magalhaes: But i know there is some rion killers 💪
[2021-06-02T02:53:59] Face de Pin Sucé: yes, that's why we did drag race on the big straight line
[2021-06-02T02:56:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Z100X is 72V40Ah Kelly 7212S external (no overheat, unlimited boost haha) Custom Rage Mechanics motors PMT slick tyres No folding anymore Titanium column with carbon fiber handlebar and hope "potence" Of course, Hope Tech 3V4 😁 We measured 16200W peak once and need to run some dragy around 115/120Kmh
[2021-06-02T02:58:22] Luis Magalhaes: Very impressive 👌
[2021-06-02T02:58:43] Face de Pin Sucé: plan is to switch Kellys to VESC
[2021-06-02T03:00:11] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 😁
[2021-06-02T08:15:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeaaaahhhhh !
[2021-06-02T12:00:09] Artem Bulashev: Yeah had good times at that point too heh :) his technical d’inscription of how you get same max torque was also funny as hell, considering that acceleration is equad torque over time - and square wave there would win hand down due to … well it’s shape lol nothing one can do about it beside making even higher frequency and sine wave and with higher Phase current 👌👌 (less efficient at max throttle than square wave )
[2021-06-02T18:24:51] Unknown: Fml my flipsky 7550 dont work correct, my ubox dont fit 😩
[2021-06-02T18:25:03] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-06-02T18:25:03] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-06-02T18:26:29] Unknown: Maybe remove the frame housing from ubox and just plug it in, im so tierd of this
[2021-06-02T18:36:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Flipsky is a little shitty honestly
[2021-06-02T18:36:47] Face de Pin Sucé: cheap yes, but always a problem
[2021-06-02T19:04:21] Unknown: Okey, i have calm down now 😅 om going to 3d print a new frame for ubox
[2021-06-02T19:06:07] Unknown: And maybe give it to my friend and make it in metall with cnc machine
[2021-06-02T20:32:06] Happy Giraffe: You know the five Monorim 500w motor side screw size?
[2021-06-02T20:32:38] Happy Giraffe: All my bolts are stuck so I gotta take it to a pro to open up...🙈
[2021-06-02T20:54:05] Artem Bulashev: Awesome!
[2021-06-02T20:59:20] Artem Bulashev: I told Spintend already that case could be a lot smaller if it was designed around PCB (tight now case is about 1.5cm too long and 1cm too wide simply because of the screws that do nothing beside holding top cover…)
[2021-06-03T03:17:10] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_300@03-06-2021_03-17-10.jpg>
[2021-06-03T03:17:24] Luis Magalhaes: Analising data 😂😂
[2021-06-03T03:39:34] Artem Bulashev: Wait… 200amps phase 130amp battery amps total right? 😂
[2021-06-03T03:40:27] Luis Magalhaes: Yes total 😂😂
[2021-06-03T03:40:46] Luis Magalhaes: 60A bat and 100A phase is the setup
[2021-06-03T03:40:48] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-06-03T03:41:25] Artem Bulashev: Looks like you could use better heating pad, even though even with this you don’t over heat at any point technically 😅
[2021-06-03T03:42:40] Artem Bulashev: I wonder if it would over heat or touch on thermal throttling with 120a 75a per motor
[2021-06-03T03:42:41] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, this time it runs colder, if i keep it full for more time it rises temperature i think but not looking bad
[2021-06-03T03:43:08] Artem Bulashev: But not sure you could maintain front wheel 😂😂😂
[2021-06-03T03:43:44] Luis Magalhaes: It was hitting it before i used the aluminium plates under the ubox i think it helped
[2021-06-03T03:43:52] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2021-06-03T03:43:54] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-06-03T03:43:59] Artem Bulashev: With past?
[2021-06-03T03:44:12] Luis Magalhaes: Not yet 😂
[2021-06-03T03:44:29] Luis Magalhaes: Its next step 😁
[2021-06-03T03:46:27] Artem Bulashev: lol
[2021-06-03T03:46:49] Artem Bulashev: yeah battery may is a bottle neck than most likely haha
[2021-06-03T03:47:45] Artem Bulashev: I think you can remove metal plate and jsut add good thermal paste between casing and scooter frame
[2021-06-03T03:48:03] Artem Bulashev: this should improve your current result even
[2021-06-03T03:48:20] Artem Bulashev: + less things and more space 🙂
[2021-06-03T03:52:26] Luis Magalhaes: I have the aluminium bolted in the deck and the controller above it, so more aluminium to dissipate the heat i think, before it was above the the and did not dissipate this well, but no termal past in that time too, my minimotors setup was using that aluminium plates to dissipate the heat to the deck too
[2021-06-03T03:52:48] Luis Magalhaes: And they have a bigger aluminium case then the vesc
[2021-06-03T03:59:56] Luis Magalhaes: https://youtu.be/ZWkagSLqOp8

[2021-06-03T19:55:19] Artem Bulashev: Yeah cheapest non-diy solution
[2021-06-03T19:55:35] Artem Bulashev: Though not sexy by any means

[2021-06-04T13:33:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: cooked !
[2021-06-04T13:34:21] Artem Bulashev: ✅
[2021-06-04T13:34:23] Artem Bulashev: 🔥
[2021-06-04T16:57:37] Luis Magalhaes: well using 120A if i throtlle too mutch it cuts power, i think im passing the 180A peak at start, if i go slower to a higher speed like 20kmh and them i can go full and no cut
[2021-06-04T20:11:39] Artem Bulashev: What cuts?
[2021-06-04T20:11:45] Artem Bulashev: BMS?
[2021-06-04T20:21:12] Luis Magalhaes: no the ubox
[2021-06-04T20:21:42] Luis Magalhaes: did not log it but i think its over amp at lowspeed
[2021-06-04T21:33:09] Artem Bulashev: Interesting
[2021-06-04T21:33:12] Artem Bulashev: Should not
[2021-06-04T21:33:44] Artem Bulashev: People run it 150/ 100phase and 120-80 on battery is the craziest I saw
[2021-06-04T21:34:08] Artem Bulashev: Only needed modification to shield electronics from EMI of power board and some heat dispersion mod
[2021-06-04T22:12:53] Luis Magalhaes: I have run it 70A battery and 130A motor but cant push it right from start
[2021-06-04T22:51:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what do you mean about pushing ?
[2021-06-04T22:53:11] Luis Magalhaes: Full throttle
[2021-06-05T01:33:51] Luis Magalhaes: I think its not the amps, but it is related with
[2021-06-05T01:35:26] Luis Magalhaes: At 100 and i think till 110A motor it is ok, after that it faults and cut amps to motors for 1second then i can acelerate again
[2021-06-05T01:35:40] Luis Magalhaes: Did a log but cant open it now 😅
[2021-06-05T01:35:58] Luis Magalhaes: It did the "erro" right at start
[2021-06-05T01:36:51] Luis Magalhaes: If i go like at 20kmh its no problem but before that it makes some kind of fault and cut power to motor
[2021-06-05T09:44:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Why don't you put ABS max current higher ?
[2021-06-05T11:05:00] Luis Magalhaes: Its at max 180A, have to see the logs to see of its current too high or something else 🤔
[2021-06-05T11:09:39] Mirono escooters: Anyone know a good vesc 15s or more but not 300€ lol
[2021-06-05T11:30:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: single or dual ?
[2021-06-05T11:30:33] Mirono escooters: Dual
[2021-06-05T11:30:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: dual ... 15s ... less than 300€ ? forget it 😅
[2021-06-05T11:31:07] Mirono escooters: Damnit
[2021-06-05T11:31:14] Mirono escooters: Dual 13s is only 100 :/
[2021-06-05T11:32:16] Artem Bulashev: UBOX
[2021-06-05T11:32:43] Artem Bulashev: Up 16s
[2021-06-05T11:32:58] Artem Bulashev: 299$ = 265€ or so
[2021-06-05T11:33:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: without taxes and shipping no ?
[2021-06-05T11:33:21] Mirono escooters: Link?
[2021-06-05T11:33:25] Artem Bulashev: Shipping 20
[2021-06-05T11:33:33] Artem Bulashev: Came tax free
[2021-06-05T11:33:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ???
[2021-06-05T11:33:47] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-06-05T11:33:54] Artem Bulashev: It was declared low
[2021-06-05T11:34:01] Artem Bulashev: So no customs
[2021-06-05T11:34:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you bought directly from their website ?
[2021-06-05T11:34:09] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-06-05T11:34:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, I didn't know they shipped like that ;)
[2021-06-05T11:34:41] Artem Bulashev: https://spintend.com
[2021-06-05T11:35:14] Artem Bulashev: Yeah and they declared it this way without me asking even :))
[2021-06-05T15:11:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah ! fully manually assembled Smart is working ! new 100v power stage validated ! (just stress test has to be done)

[2021-06-05T15:30:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah ... wasn't easy. takes 2h total just for soldering
[2021-06-05T15:31:21] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-05T16:36:50] Artem Bulashev: 2h is time it takes trained hand and with correct past and preheater
[2021-06-05T23:25:09] Unknown: Can you Connect throttle and brake to same ground?
[2021-06-05T23:34:38] Tudor: Yes
[2021-06-05T23:35:02] Tudor: Same geound and same poaitive just the signal.is different
[2021-06-05T23:35:16] Tudor: Positive and ground
[2021-06-05T23:42:52] Unknown: I have this mini board
[2021-06-05T23:42:58] Unknown: <photos/photo_312@05-06-2021_23-42-58.jpg>
[2021-06-05T23:45:11] Unknown: So red from throttle and brake to only throttle slot on this mini esc?
[2021-06-05T23:46:36] Unknown: And same with ground?
[2021-06-05T23:47:41] Unknown: So this mini esc board can still read the positiv singnal from thorttle if i plug it in the brake slot?
[2021-06-05T23:48:00] Unknown: @Tudor_VTA
[2021-06-06T00:27:35] Tudor: So for both throttle and brake you need 3.3 v abd ground
[2021-06-06T00:28:10] Unknown: Yeah but they have separate slots on this mini board
[2021-06-06T00:28:17] Unknown: But i can still use same?
[2021-06-06T00:29:42] Unknown: Why dont they just have one slot for ground on this board?
[2021-06-06T00:32:37] Unknown: Does this mini board read the postiv voltage from thottle and brake? Then i need to separate them?
[2021-06-06T00:32:47] Unknown: Hope you understand my question :)

[2021-06-07T14:58:44] Unknown: How can I troubleshoot :/
[2021-06-07T14:58:52] Unknown: £250... 🤧
[2021-06-07T14:59:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: did you check the battery/bms ?
[2021-06-07T14:59:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with a voltmeter
[2021-06-07T15:00:24] Unknown: Yeah man :/
[2021-06-07T15:00:28] Unknown: I tried two batts
[2021-06-07T15:00:37] Unknown: Checked voltage at the vesc point
[2021-06-07T15:00:41] Unknown: Showed correct voltage
[2021-06-07T15:01:00] Unknown: At the +- Terminal that first reaches vesc

[2021-06-07T15:07:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: find the main voltage regulator on the board 😉
[2021-06-07T15:07:45] Unknown: How can I tell
[2021-06-07T15:08:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: take pictures of all 'big' components with 3 to 8 pins
[2021-06-07T15:09:49] Unknown: These are the biggest
[2021-06-07T15:10:44] Unknown: Ok so now, the capacitors are charged
[2021-06-07T15:12:35] Unknown: Ok something is getting hot
[2021-06-07T15:12:37] Unknown: On the board
[2021-06-07T15:13:39] Unknown: This area
[2021-06-07T15:13:58] Unknown: <photos/photo_320@07-06-2021_15-13-58.jpg>
[2021-06-07T15:15:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sorry but we'll need much cleaner picutres where we can read component reference 😅
[2021-06-07T15:15:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, this is a ldo regulator.
[2021-06-07T15:15:44] Unknown: Ldo?
[2021-06-07T15:15:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but may be not the only one
[2021-06-07T15:15:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: linear

[2021-06-07T15:19:41] Unknown: It isn't loading
[2021-06-07T15:19:45] Unknown: What caused this issue tho
[2021-06-07T15:25:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this is a small regulator. on vesc6, i think the main power comes from the DRV
[2021-06-07T15:26:10] Unknown: So what do.you think I can do
[2021-06-07T15:26:16] Unknown: Replace this9
[2021-06-07T15:27:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: check power on this one 😅😅
[2021-06-07T15:27:26] Unknown: How shall I
[2021-06-07T15:33:25] Unknown: You've gotta be fucking kidding me
[2021-06-07T15:33:33] Unknown: I was using voltmeter to check right
[2021-06-07T15:33:42] Unknown: And it sparked? :|
[2021-06-07T15:33:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅😅😅😅
[2021-06-07T15:33:50] Unknown: Im gonna go in a corner and cry.
[2021-06-07T15:34:11] Unknown: What vesc is good 🤧
[2021-06-07T15:35:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: all VESC are VERY sensitives. testing with VESC is awefull. The smallest mistake can burn it. no led ON at all ? not even a little ?
[2021-06-07T15:35:59] Unknown: No now I will get nothing because of the spark at this chip
[2021-06-07T15:36:16] Unknown: Big spark here
[2021-06-07T15:36:21] Unknown: Using voltmeter as well :/
[2021-06-07T15:36:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ohhhh shit
[2021-06-07T15:37:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but spark doesn't mean dead ;)
[2021-06-07T15:38:01] Unknown: I think it does for today
[2021-06-07T15:38:06] Unknown: <photos/photo_324@07-06-2021_15-38-06.jpg>
[2021-06-07T15:40:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: holllllly crap !
[2021-06-07T15:40:25] Unknown: I truly don't fucking understand
[2021-06-07T15:40:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the track is completly dead 😭😭
[2021-06-07T15:41:02] Unknown: I fix battery-> BMS problem I fix BMS -> fitting problem I rebuilt battery, fix everything, ... Now vesc dies
[2021-06-07T15:41:05] Unknown: Bro I honestly
[2021-06-07T15:41:07] Unknown: Don't
[2021-06-07T15:41:09] Unknown: Understand
[2021-06-07T15:41:24] Unknown: I've lost like £500 in few weeks
[2021-06-07T15:43:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: voltmeter has to be with a very precise touch 😓 and if possible with a power supply very limited in current to avoid such issue. now, i often take time to solder a wire before trying such measure. too scary
[2021-06-07T15:43:22] Unknown: Dont give up
[2021-06-07T15:43:40] Unknown: Are you kidding me man I wanna curl up into a ball for a week now
[2021-06-07T15:43:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it always can be repaired, but it takes time and very good skills
[2021-06-07T15:43:58] Unknown: I've been trying to get this working for weeks, as soon as I fix one problem another one comes
[2021-06-07T15:44:08] Unknown: I haven't got hot air station so I can't fix that
[2021-06-07T15:44:14] Unknown: That's normal...
[2021-06-07T15:44:20] Unknown: I know
[2021-06-07T15:44:23] Unknown: But ugh
[2021-06-07T15:44:30] Unknown: So much money so much time with no result
[2021-06-07T15:44:58] Unknown: Now another £250 in the bin + new vesc
[2021-06-07T15:45:00] Unknown: We are here working on a "new" Plattform, we are all learning..
[2021-06-07T15:45:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @SibClimb , you a guy who repair vesc ?
[2021-06-07T15:45:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1000
[2021-06-07T15:45:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also one dead on my side 😭
[2021-06-07T15:45:41] Unknown: I know I know
[2021-06-07T15:45:46] Tudor: That looks like you touched and ahorted it woth the voltmeter probes
[2021-06-07T15:45:53] Unknown: I just don't understand what went wrong the first times
[2021-06-07T15:45:55] Tudor: Stop drinking so you dont shake
[2021-06-07T15:46:08] Unknown: Yeah that's what happened but it was dead in the first place lmao
[2021-06-07T15:46:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol. that's hard 🤣
[2021-06-07T15:46:32] Unknown: I should drink more often by the looks of it ugh
[2021-06-07T15:46:41] Unknown: 😂😂😂😂😂
[2021-06-07T15:46:43] Unknown: @Tudor_VTA what vesc have u got on hand? I need to buy
[2021-06-07T15:50:46] Unknown: I think you're probes were too big.
[2021-06-07T15:51:07] Unknown: Yeah too late now already blown 🤧
[2021-06-07T15:51:29] Unknown: Is it even worth spending another £250 on a vesc man
[2021-06-07T15:51:33] Unknown: Like @koxx3 said short is not the end..
[2021-06-07T15:52:43] Unknown: What do you guys think I should do
[2021-06-07T15:52:44] Unknown: :/
[2021-06-07T15:53:22] Unknown: Try to repair it, give it to somebody...
[2021-06-07T15:53:36] Unknown: That's not the only thing that's wrong tho
[2021-06-07T15:53:53] Unknown: It's that + maybe voltage regulator otherwise unknown issue
[2021-06-07T15:54:04] Tudor: Lots
[2021-06-07T15:54:07] Unknown: I'm gonna order hot air station.
[2021-06-07T15:54:14] Tudor: Any you may wish
[2021-06-07T15:54:17] Unknown: I have 12s, wanna do 70-80A plz
[2021-06-07T15:54:21] Unknown: Which one u got how much
[2021-06-07T15:54:33] Unknown: I'll collect tomorrow morning sir
[2021-06-07T15:54:42] Unknown: Unless u can ship next day I'll pay
[2021-06-07T15:55:41] Face de Pin Sucé: yes, sorry I couldn't read everything, what's the problem ?
[2021-06-07T15:55:48] Unknown: My vesc
[2021-06-07T15:56:37] Unknown: Initially it wouldn't turn on, open it and power.. no power but board heats up. I notice the small regulator was heating up a lot, then I tried checking voltage of a chip and poof
[2021-06-07T16:01:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOb9pk6EquY
[2021-06-07T16:02:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-06-07T16:04:11] Face de Pin Sucé: From what I read, it seems you touched 2 pins with multimeter, it happened to me on a non so essential component last time :/
[2021-06-07T16:04:53] Unknown: Yup but also the voltage regulator , the board wasn't working before I touched it
[2021-06-07T16:05:03] Unknown: Thank you
[2021-06-07T16:05:25] Face de Pin Sucé: but last picture is not good, as Koxx said, tracks seem damaged
[2021-06-07T16:38:42] Mirono escooters: Sounds like a fuse died
[2021-06-07T16:39:09] Unknown: 2 of them blown away
[2021-06-07T16:39:56] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2021-06-07T16:42:27] Unknown: First this was getting rlly hot, board not turning on
[2021-06-07T16:42:35] Unknown: Then as I check pins..
[2021-06-07T16:42:54] Unknown: Send the board back... Guarantee..
[2021-06-07T16:53:32] Unknown: No because if u open it u lose warranty
[2021-06-07T18:07:59] Luis Magalhaes: @CloverTronix dam .. in my case was worse, it burst in fire and broke my battery too 😅
[2021-06-07T18:17:57] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2021-06-07T18:18:00] Luis Magalhaes: Looks good
[2021-06-07T18:18:20] Luis Magalhaes: Have to use google translate to understand what they where talking 😂
[2021-06-07T18:18:50] Luis Magalhaes: Its a wolf like mine but with diferent motors battery and a box with the ubox outside deck 👍
[2021-06-07T18:19:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 4500w, good start !
[2021-06-07T18:20:29] Artem Bulashev: Could probably fix it in an hour if at least a smal blip of the leg remains on chip Fixed worse
[2021-06-07T18:20:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: my goal : 52v x 50A in the dt mini (single motor)
[2021-06-07T18:20:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍👍👍
[2021-06-07T18:20:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: worse the trial !
[2021-06-07T18:21:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what worries me is : we can't see the track even arriving
[2021-06-07T18:22:10] Artem Bulashev: Needs cleaning and will see
[2021-06-07T18:22:34] Luis Magalhaes: Yes a great start 😂 i did go slower 😂😂

[2021-06-07T18:24:38] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_328@07-06-2021_18-24-38.jpg>
[2021-06-07T18:24:49] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm not sure your motor will survive summer
[2021-06-07T18:25:38] Artem Bulashev: 800w motor?
[2021-06-07T18:26:19] Artem Bulashev: Should benok with 110 amps phase
[2021-06-07T18:26:43] Artem Bulashev: Battery current just defines how long max phase current will last in terms of rpm / speed
[2021-06-07T19:02:04] Unknown: When you installed ubox do you need to install firmware? Or is it preinstalled?
[2021-06-07T19:02:20] Artem Bulashev: No need
[2021-06-07T19:02:26] Artem Bulashev: Just configure settings and go
[2021-06-07T19:02:36] Unknown: Via bluetooth?
[2021-06-07T19:02:46] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-06-07T19:02:50] Artem Bulashev: Or usb c
[2021-06-07T19:03:30] Unknown: Okey, becuse my switch buttom light is always on, and i cant connect to bluetooth :/
[2021-06-07T20:07:51] Unknown: <photos/photo_329@07-06-2021_20-07-51.jpg>
[2021-06-07T20:08:25] Unknown: Do i have hallsensor plugged in on wrong side?
[2021-06-07T20:08:52] Mirono escooters: Is that motor toast?
[2021-06-07T20:08:56] Unknown: Yes
[2021-06-07T20:09:20] Unknown: It says sensorless :/
[2021-06-07T20:09:31] Mirono escooters: Also 8a Lol
[2021-06-07T20:09:35] Mirono escooters: And high =
[2021-06-07T20:09:35] Mirono escooters: R
[2021-06-07T20:09:59] Unknown: I only have 1 motor
[2021-06-07T20:14:03] Unknown: <photos/photo_330@07-06-2021_20-14-03.jpg>
[2021-06-07T20:14:19] Unknown: Did one more test :/
[2021-06-07T20:16:32] Mirono escooters: It reads hall sensors no?
[2021-06-07T20:16:39] Unknown: Yes
[2021-06-07T20:16:46] Unknown: Now it did
[2021-06-07T20:17:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think. but it's already taking 40A battery. 😁
[2021-06-07T20:18:36] Unknown: Whats the diffrence Vesc id and Vescs on Can-bus?
[2021-06-07T20:37:58] Unknown: How can it find 2 motors if i only have one?
[2021-06-07T20:48:51] Artem Bulashev: Second motor is just open port
[2021-06-07T20:50:25] Artem Bulashev: Only phase current matter to the motor load - battery current sets how long that phase current will be available. (At the end, max current that motor will get is set by phase current)
[2021-06-07T20:51:10] Unknown: <video_file>
[2021-06-07T20:51:14] Unknown: Next problem look the duty
[2021-06-07T20:51:49] Artem Bulashev: Looks like this is data from not connected motor
[2021-06-07T20:55:08] Unknown: How to select so i can se data from other motor?
[2021-06-07T20:55:23] Unknown: The Connected one

[2021-06-07T21:31:43] Artem Bulashev: Now set it up properly
[2021-06-07T21:31:58] Artem Bulashev: What’s your motor ? What’s your battery? Contrôler is Ubox?
[2021-06-07T21:59:30] Unknown: Yes its working perfect now :) Changed absolut max current to 100A
[2021-06-07T21:59:51] Artem Bulashev: Absolute set to 180
[2021-06-07T22:00:04] Unknown: Ubox is only for 100Ax2
[2021-06-07T22:00:12] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-06-07T22:00:20] Artem Bulashev: Absolute set 180
[2021-06-07T22:00:29] Artem Bulashev: It is joy doing what you think it does
[2021-06-07T22:00:39] Artem Bulashev: You care about phase current
[2021-06-07T22:00:44] Artem Bulashev: And battery current
[2021-06-07T22:00:53] Artem Bulashev: Phase current is ok to be up to 120amps
[2021-06-07T22:01:01] Artem Bulashev: Battery up to 100
[2021-06-07T22:01:06] Unknown: Can we talk a bit in private?
[2021-06-07T22:01:06] Unknown: :)

[2021-06-07T22:03:30] Artem Bulashev: Can give you 35amps constant
[2021-06-07T22:03:35] Artem Bulashev: And 50 max
[2021-06-07T22:03:41] Artem Bulashev: Single motor ?
[2021-06-07T22:03:51] Unknown: 16s6p
[2021-06-07T22:03:52] Unknown: It is
[2021-06-07T22:03:55] Unknown: Yes
[2021-06-07T22:03:58] Unknown: Single motor
[2021-06-07T22:03:58] Artem Bulashev: No you have 5p
[2021-06-07T22:04:00] Artem Bulashev: Not 6p
[2021-06-07T22:04:14] Unknown: It says 16s6p Li-ion
[2021-06-07T22:04:19] Artem Bulashev: It is 5
[2021-06-07T22:04:28] Happy Giraffe: 5🙈
[2021-06-07T22:04:29] Artem Bulashev: 17.5/5= 3500
[2021-06-07T22:04:35] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-07T22:04:36] Artem Bulashev: Mah
[2021-06-07T22:04:52] Artem Bulashev: It’s ok for 1 motor
[2021-06-07T22:04:54] Unknown: So its 16s5p? xD
[2021-06-07T22:04:57] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-06-07T22:05:08] Unknown: Aha why did he told me 16s6p :/
[2021-06-07T22:05:18] Artem Bulashev: Than he cheated you
[2021-06-07T22:05:24] Unknown: Ye wtf
[2021-06-07T22:05:37] Artem Bulashev: It says 17.25ah capasity
[2021-06-07T22:05:39] Happy Giraffe: Maybe typo, who knows. Hes been good guy
[2021-06-07T22:05:57] Artem Bulashev: / 6 that would be 2.875ah cell
[2021-06-07T22:05:57] Unknown: Okey :)
[2021-06-07T22:06:06] Artem Bulashev: But cell it says 35e Samsung
[2021-06-07T22:06:11] Happy Giraffe: Your battery should have 12AWG cable, not sure about connector
[2021-06-07T22:06:11] Artem Bulashev: Which is 3.5ah
[2021-06-07T22:06:35] Unknown: I get a XT30 for Xiaomi controller, changed it to XT90 now
[2021-06-07T22:07:01] Artem Bulashev: Xt60
[2021-06-07T22:07:05] Artem Bulashev: Would be enough
[2021-06-07T22:07:07] Artem Bulashev: But ok
[2021-06-07T22:07:10] Unknown: So what settings do you think i can use for this setup? :)
[2021-06-07T22:07:23] Artem Bulashev: Phase current 110
[2021-06-07T22:07:26] Unknown: Ubox have xt90
[2021-06-07T22:07:32] Unknown: Thats why
[2021-06-07T22:07:33] Unknown: :)
[2021-06-07T22:07:46] Artem Bulashev: Battery current go for 40 for now
[2021-06-07T22:08:09] Artem Bulashev: You can push it to 50 if battery doesn’t heat up too much
[2021-06-07T22:08:26] Unknown: I have it on 55A xDD
[2021-06-07T22:08:37] Artem Bulashev: Don’t
[2021-06-07T22:08:40] Unknown: Okey :)
[2021-06-07T22:09:12] Happy Giraffe: Im still trying to exactly understand phase vs battery current 😂
[2021-06-07T22:09:22] Artem Bulashev: Your battery can not take more than 50 for extended periods (over few minutes) 50 should be still safe
[2021-06-07T22:09:26] Artem Bulashev: But start from 40
[2021-06-07T22:09:32] Artem Bulashev: And test battery temp
[2021-06-07T22:09:38] Artem Bulashev: Long agressive rides
[2021-06-07T22:09:46] Artem Bulashev: Than increase if battery is ok
[2021-06-07T22:10:13] Unknown: Okey how do you change phase current to 110 in the vesc app?
[2021-06-07T22:12:08] Unknown: But Battery Current is the maximum current that can be drawn from the battery and my battery can give 60A? Or im wrong here?
[2021-06-07T22:12:58] Unknown: Das könnte interessant sein: "Easy Battery Calculator" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bora.easy18650
[2021-06-07T22:13:47] Unknown: I also tested my top speed and it was 46km/h is that good for my setup? I feel like it should be faster 😇
[2021-06-07T22:15:54] Artem Bulashev: Short version: - Phase current is max what your motor will get ever. (110amps for exampel) - Battery amp limit works through Watt = battery amp lim 50amps and your battery level now is 49v = 2450w is available for controller —- in the start motor has low voltage 5v for example so it can use full 110amps, because = 550w output only so all ok —- later on you speed up, rpm is higher which means that voltage on motor is now also higher 30volts for example, 30v*110a= 3300w that’s not possible because your input is only 2450w right? So controller lowers phase current to stay at the available power 30v * 81a =2430w is ok because 2450 is available
[2021-06-07T22:17:36] Artem Bulashev: It can not. It can give reliably 35-40 and max 50 for not too long at once. So set it 40, than put a thermometer there and (may be your BMS has Bluetooth?) if battery is ok increase to 50a but not higher
[2021-06-07T22:19:16] Artem Bulashev: I feel like no one should go faster on a scooter 🤣🤣 You could be going faster
[2021-06-07T22:20:14] Happy Giraffe: Thanks, so having more phase current helps especially low end torque?
[2021-06-07T22:20:14] Unknown: I wanna max it out 😆How could i be going faster?
[2021-06-07T22:20:22] Unknown: Thx for all answers!
[2021-06-07T22:20:32] Artem Bulashev: Yes absolutely
[2021-06-07T22:20:46] Artem Bulashev: And that’s where motor gets the most heat and amps
[2021-06-07T22:20:50] Happy Giraffe: 16s and 10" tires should give 60kmh or something like that
[2021-06-07T22:21:12] Artem Bulashev: In high rpm most set ups don’t get full phase current because of the relation I explained above
[2021-06-07T22:21:22] Happy Giraffe: I have no idea what xiaomi esc does there haha
[2021-06-07T22:21:45] Happy Giraffe: Then riding fast consumes less battery?🤔
[2021-06-07T22:21:54] Happy Giraffe: Apart from wind resistance
[2021-06-07T22:21:59] Artem Bulashev: Consuption is battery current
[2021-06-07T22:22:09] Artem Bulashev: It is max at higher rpm / speed
[2021-06-07T22:22:56] Artem Bulashev: Motor current is lower at high speed because voltage is now not 5-10v any more but 30v so you hit watt limit avaible on input
[2021-06-07T22:23:41] Unknown: So can you help me out with settings? Motor Current Max, Motor Current Max Brake, Absolute Maximum Current, Battery Current Max Regen
[2021-06-07T22:23:52] Artem Bulashev: Go for 50amps battery 125phase 180 absolute
[2021-06-07T22:24:19] Artem Bulashev: If your battery would be bigger you could increase battery current which would increase top speed I suppose
[2021-06-07T22:24:23] Unknown: I whant to still be safe for fire xD
[2021-06-07T22:24:41] Artem Bulashev: You will be rather safe
[2021-06-07T22:24:45] Artem Bulashev: Motor can handle
[2021-06-07T22:24:49] Happy Giraffe: But even 13s on my lov kv motor does 50kmh👀
[2021-06-07T22:24:53] Artem Bulashev: Battery can handle as well
[2021-06-07T22:25:08] Artem Bulashev: It was 10s motor
[2021-06-07T22:25:19] Happy Giraffe: Aah
[2021-06-07T22:25:27] Artem Bulashev: Which you feed more voltage * kv = more rpm
[2021-06-07T22:25:46] Happy Giraffe: So it doesn't benefit it that much
[2021-06-07T22:26:44] Artem Bulashev: Log it and see how it is. I suspect if you go for long Full speed runs battery may be over heating
[2021-06-07T22:27:19] Artem Bulashev: As I said your battery is the bottleneck in your system, can push it but need to control temperature
[2021-06-07T22:27:48] Artem Bulashev: Or get bust battery
[2021-06-07T22:27:54] Unknown: I think i buyed a monster battery xD
[2021-06-07T22:28:30] Artem Bulashev: If you are in EU and you have space for bigger battery you can re build your battery into bigger one with same cells
[2021-06-07T22:28:35] Unknown: I needed to make a new controller chassi aslo for it to fit
[2021-06-07T22:29:24] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_333@07-06-2021_22-29-24.jpg>
[2021-06-07T22:29:24] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_334@07-06-2021_22-29-24.jpg>
[2021-06-07T22:29:46] Happy Giraffe: 40 battery amps with vesc should feel more snappy than 40A on Xiaomi
[2021-06-07T22:30:29] Artem Bulashev: I use 35e as well but pack need to be 8p for it to handle 56a constant
[2021-06-07T22:30:32] Happy Giraffe: Question also is can your tire handle the grip and motor the heat👀
[2021-06-07T22:31:21] Artem Bulashev: My 650w motor is barely hot to touch after crazy ride with 90amps phase
[2021-06-07T22:31:34] Artem Bulashev: So 1000w can def take 120amps phase
[2021-06-07T22:31:47] Unknown: Yeah my motor is no problem :)
[2021-06-07T22:31:51] Artem Bulashev: FOC drives motor much more efficient
[2021-06-07T22:32:10] Artem Bulashev: If it was normal contrôler, new motor would be needed
[2021-06-07T22:32:13] Happy Giraffe: 1000w motor is 10s nominal?👀😂
[2021-06-07T22:32:15] Unknown: People going way faster with same motor
[2021-06-07T22:32:26] Unknown: @francois_schempers have same motor
[2021-06-07T22:32:37] Happy Giraffe: That should not be 10s nominal🤔
[2021-06-07T22:32:38] Artem Bulashev: Dual I think
[2021-06-07T22:32:45] Unknown: Yeah dual
[2021-06-07T22:32:47] Artem Bulashev: Please don’t confuse people
[2021-06-07T22:33:07] Happy Giraffe: 😅
[2021-06-07T22:33:25] Artem Bulashev: His motor is 16s nominal
[2021-06-07T22:33:32] Artem Bulashev: Same as battery 16s
[2021-06-07T22:34:01] Happy Giraffe: Ok haha, I misunderstood something you said previously about 10s motor
[2021-06-07T22:34:09] Artem Bulashev: Dual will have about 20% higher top speed usually
[2021-06-07T22:34:22] Unknown: Aha okey :)
[2021-06-07T22:34:32] Unknown: Maybe i need to make it dual then
[2021-06-07T22:34:55] Artem Bulashev: I was referring to your xiaomi and how you said you get it going 50kmh - I said because your motor is designed with higher kv as target was 10s
[2021-06-07T22:35:09] Happy Giraffe: Nooo, my motor is 500w 48v nominal👀
[2021-06-07T22:35:15] Happy Giraffe: Using 13s batt
[2021-06-07T22:35:35] Artem Bulashev: It depends on motor again
[2021-06-07T22:35:44] Artem Bulashev: All about target speed at target voltage
[2021-06-07T22:35:44] Unknown: <video_file>
[2021-06-07T22:35:49] Unknown: How can his motor spin this fast?
[2021-06-07T22:35:58] Unknown: We have same motor :/
[2021-06-07T22:36:10] Unknown: He have smaller battery i think
[2021-06-07T22:36:16] Happy Giraffe: I remember Francois saying this 1000w motor was faster than my 500w using same battery
[2021-06-07T22:37:13] Artem Bulashev: I have 650w motor single and It can go 45-48kmh on 28a battery current and 90a phase current (original 14s battery for now)
[2021-06-07T22:37:59] Artem Bulashev: But it has a lot of torque
[2021-06-07T22:38:02] Happy Giraffe: Hmm🤔 But its still weird one goes faster on 13s than 16s
[2021-06-07T22:38:05] Artem Bulashev: So fast acceleration
[2021-06-07T22:38:16] Happy Giraffe: 500w also torque oriented, even with shit Xiaomi esc
[2021-06-07T22:38:36] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_335@07-06-2021_22-38-36.jpg>
[2021-06-07T22:39:02] Happy Giraffe: Haha that's cool
[2021-06-07T22:39:06] Artem Bulashev: Point it is motor design that determines the top speed
[2021-06-07T22:39:25] Artem Bulashev: + battery voltage of course
[2021-06-07T22:39:30] Happy Giraffe: But as he said they have same 1000w motor
[2021-06-07T22:39:36] Artem Bulashev: But single
[2021-06-07T22:39:48] Artem Bulashev: Dual will go 20% more aprox
[2021-06-07T22:39:57] Unknown: Yeah but on the video is only 1 motor
[2021-06-07T22:40:02] Happy Giraffe: That's funny
[2021-06-07T22:40:27] Artem Bulashev: Man… you can’t tell how fast it is on video
[2021-06-07T22:40:49] Unknown: But my motor is not close to sound and spin like that xD
[2021-06-07T22:40:58] Unknown: Maybe when i change phase current?
[2021-06-07T22:41:00] Unknown: :)
[2021-06-07T22:41:25] Artem Bulashev: Let’s base our Dialogue on a proper numbers
[2021-06-07T22:41:31] Artem Bulashev: Like km/h or rpm
[2021-06-07T22:41:32] Artem Bulashev: 😁
[2021-06-07T22:41:35] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-07T22:42:36] Artem Bulashev: Don’t mean to be a dick, just to have objectivity
[2021-06-07T22:43:00] Unknown: (Y)
[2021-06-07T22:43:17] Happy Giraffe: Yes, easier to understand numbers than. "No my motor *vroom* harder"
[2021-06-07T22:43:35] Unknown: Hahaha
[2021-06-07T22:43:36] Unknown: xD
[2021-06-07T22:43:39] Unknown: Sorry
[2021-06-07T22:44:00] Unknown: Where do i change phase current in vesc phone app?
[2021-06-07T22:50:16] Happy Giraffe: Is there news about the new Ubox or them fixing the new batch?
[2021-06-07T23:16:05] Unknown: 125 phase = Motor Current?
[2021-06-07T23:32:38] Luis Magalhaes: tab motor cfg then in the second tab it says general choose current
[2021-06-07T23:32:53] Luis Magalhaes: you will see motor
[2021-06-07T23:33:07] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_336@07-06-2021_23-33-07.jpg>
[2021-06-07T23:33:11] Luis Magalhaes: like this
[2021-06-07T23:34:35] Luis Magalhaes: in there you have the motor current , absolute current, and battery current
[2021-06-07T23:37:15] Unknown: Yeah but not phase current
[2021-06-07T23:37:19] Unknown: :)
[2021-06-07T23:38:19] Unknown: So he told me to use 125 phase current, is that Motor Current Max he mean?
[2021-06-07T23:40:23] Luis Magalhaes: Yes
[2021-06-07T23:40:43] Luis Magalhaes: Phase current is motor phase current 😁
[2021-06-07T23:41:39] Luis Magalhaes: @artBula what should he use in brake current? -30A?
[2021-06-07T23:42:23] Unknown: Motor current 125 sounds so high have only have 55-60A
[2021-06-07T23:44:50] Luis Magalhaes: If your motor dont get too hot is ok
[2021-06-07T23:46:11] Luis Magalhaes: I mounted my ubox and ride it for 50km and stop some times to check motor temperature by hand 😂 using 100A motor phase
[2021-06-07T23:46:50] Unknown: 100A motor current max you mean right? :)
[2021-06-07T23:47:34] Luis Magalhaes: It wasn't hot it this foc controllers in my square controllers at 110A they get hot if inpush
[2021-06-07T23:47:44] Luis Magalhaes: Yes
[2021-06-07T23:47:55] Luis Magalhaes: But i have 1200W motor
[2021-06-07T23:48:09] Luis Magalhaes: Im testing now 130A motor
[2021-06-07T23:49:00] Unknown: Why all say phase current? One phase or all 3 phases = Motor
[2021-06-07T23:49:25] Unknown: There is no settings for phase current, its only for motor current max
[2021-06-07T23:49:36] Unknown: Im getting so confused xD
[2021-06-07T23:50:11] Luis Magalhaes: It has 3 phases but you only git the power to one at time 😂
[2021-06-07T23:51:16] Unknown: Okey :D
[2021-06-07T23:56:37] Unknown: <photos/photo_337@07-06-2021_23-56-37.jpg>
[2021-06-07T23:56:38] Unknown: <photos/photo_338@07-06-2021_23-56-38.jpg>
[2021-06-07T23:56:44] Unknown: So this is ok? 😁
[2021-06-08T00:01:04] Luis Magalhaes: if you want to go for the max of 50A in battery yes but try not to burn it lolol
[2021-06-08T00:01:43] Unknown: What should i change to be on the more safe side? :)
[2021-06-08T00:29:39] Luis Magalhaes: battery current max to 40A
[2021-06-08T00:42:39] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, on hot summer days its 30°c warmer than cold autum mornings iex.
[2021-06-08T00:43:01] Happy Giraffe: You might pull the 45-50A on colder days🤔
[2021-06-08T00:43:22] Happy Giraffe: But not too cold again😅 Its crazy how warm weather improves range
[2021-06-08T01:37:37] Artem Bulashev: Motor current = phase current
[2021-06-08T01:42:09] Artem Bulashev: Battery -current should not be more than 0.5 of capasity abslute max. Better lower 17.5*0.4 =7 amps is your battery current max regen.
[2021-06-08T01:43:13] Artem Bulashev: - 15amps motor regen is safe, very. Increase your motor current to 120. It’s safe for your motor.
[2021-06-08T01:45:15] Artem Bulashev: Reduce battery current to 40amps as I said, until you can get temp reading from battery, only than do 50amps on long rides.
[2021-06-08T02:00:23] Unknown: Thx for everything!
[2021-06-08T02:00:38] Unknown: Any more settings i should change?
[2021-06-08T02:01:46] Artem Bulashev: Again guys. Watt nominal of the motor is rather proportionally to the current it can take (650w 1100max, can take 90a motor) Which means 1000w motor can take 130a with about same heat up (120 is safe than)
[2021-06-08T02:01:59] Artem Bulashev: Not really
[2021-06-08T02:02:28] Unknown: Im also going to setup a profile so when i switch of the vesc its starts at 25km/h for the police
[2021-06-08T02:03:01] Artem Bulashev: I will make a video this week about complete process 👌
[2021-06-08T02:03:54] Unknown: Cool! :) I wanna watch it!
[2021-06-08T02:04:03] Artem Bulashev: There is no such mode in vesc, but can be archived with external controller.
[2021-06-08T02:04:50] Unknown: <photos/photo_339@08-06-2021_02-04-50.jpg>
[2021-06-08T02:04:54] Unknown: Here it is
[2021-06-08T02:05:31] Artem Bulashev: Missed it :)

[2021-06-08T02:06:26] Unknown: Np :)
[2021-06-08T02:06:39] Happy Giraffe: But then there should be the thermal solution as motors are built different? 🤔
[2021-06-08T02:06:45] Artem Bulashev: Had not seen this section on pc
[2021-06-08T02:06:52] Happy Giraffe: Stock xiaomi pro motor has poor cooling
[2021-06-08T02:07:12] Artem Bulashev: There is no cooling on any motor
[2021-06-08T02:07:13] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-06-08T02:07:27] Artem Bulashev: Xiaomi actually very good
[2021-06-08T02:07:27] Happy Giraffe: Any metal part nearby lol and wind
[2021-06-08T02:07:35] Artem Bulashev: Can take a lot over load
[2021-06-08T02:07:46] Happy Giraffe: That 300w couldnt handle 1200w😂
[2021-06-08T02:07:57] Happy Giraffe: 10 min ride, almost burned haha
[2021-06-08T02:08:10] Artem Bulashev: 😂 wonder why lol
[2021-06-08T02:08:16] Happy Giraffe: Meanwhile 500w can take 2000w👀
[2021-06-08T02:08:25] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-06-08T02:08:32] Happy Giraffe: Im even overvolting it so it should not do that🙈
[2021-06-08T02:08:52] Artem Bulashev: Voltage doesn’t stress motor
[2021-06-08T02:08:54] Artem Bulashev: Only amps
[2021-06-08T02:09:00] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2021-06-08T02:09:16] Happy Giraffe: As I had more volts it had less amps for 1200w
[2021-06-08T02:09:32] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2021-06-08T02:10:53] Unknown: So what give higher top speed volt or amps?
[2021-06-08T02:11:25] Artem Bulashev: Volts make same motor spin faster
[2021-06-08T02:11:28] Artem Bulashev: In the air
[2021-06-08T02:12:05] Artem Bulashev: More amps help that motor to get closer to that max air speed when you actually drive it (under load)
[2021-06-08T02:12:08] Happy Giraffe: Mine spins same speed than in road😂
[2021-06-08T02:12:20] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi esc🙈
[2021-06-08T02:12:24] Unknown: Okey :)
[2021-06-08T02:12:38] Artem Bulashev: Electronically limited speed may be?
[2021-06-08T02:12:58] Happy Giraffe: I have power control, should be completely free
[2021-06-08T02:13:33] Happy Giraffe: Air tire in front gave me 3-4kmh more speed with the warmer weathers
[2021-06-08T02:14:13] Happy Giraffe: But soon we have some data, Vesc vs Xiaomi

[2021-06-08T02:29:07] Artem Bulashev: Truth to be said I’m not sure there is another plug in play solution for BT controller

[2021-06-08T02:34:12] Artem Bulashev: 12v always has power
[2021-06-08T02:34:22] Artem Bulashev: Connect ground to ground there

[2021-06-08T10:21:45] Artem Bulashev: It is external system
[2021-06-08T10:22:16] Artem Bulashev: Receiver has 2 extra channels that output signal to enable horn and light

[2021-06-10T14:15:18] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 👌
[2021-06-10T14:16:22] Unknown: Yeah😭😂
[2021-06-10T14:19:46] Happy Giraffe: Lol you think you have high temps and dont use thermal paste or pad, then water in module😂
[2021-06-10T14:20:07] Happy Giraffe: Man wants to think his stuff is ok😂
[2021-06-10T14:20:22] Unknown: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2021-06-10T14:20:27] Unknown: Yesss I know
[2021-06-10T14:20:30] Unknown: The water isn't an issue
[2021-06-10T14:20:39] Unknown: That was for my Bluetooth xD and this is a new vesc
[2021-06-10T14:20:42] Unknown: So that's not the problem hehe
[2021-06-10T14:20:45] Unknown: It's the thermal paste
[2021-06-10T14:20:54] Unknown: Temps were amazing with paste befote
[2021-06-10T14:20:59] Unknown: So I know the problem haha
[2021-06-10T14:21:03] Unknown: Need to way for Friday payday
[2021-06-10T14:21:28] Artem Bulashev: What controller?
[2021-06-10T14:21:52] Happy Giraffe: Trampa VESC 6 MKV
[2021-06-10T14:22:00] Artem Bulashev: Interesting
[2021-06-10T14:22:13] Artem Bulashev: What kind of settings?
[2021-06-10T14:22:37] Artem Bulashev: And why do you say that temp are high? Did I miss a log or something ?
[2021-06-10T14:24:03] Unknown: Well first of all temps are pretty high in sense that once I connect power temps were rising slowly by .1°
[2021-06-10T14:24:22] Unknown: Then, during a ride .. only happens once but it'll shut off under long full throttle
[2021-06-10T14:24:33] Unknown: 60A batt/100A phase
[2021-06-10T14:24:58] Unknown: Then when I actually had access to app .. it was 50° under small burst at high current
[2021-06-10T14:25:04] Unknown: So I imagine under a longer ride it rose much more
[2021-06-10T14:25:22] Unknown: To the touch of my controller box, casing whatever, it was hot even tho it's bolted inside
[2021-06-10T14:25:34] Unknown: It's ok I know my issue
[2021-06-10T14:25:44] Unknown: I will order thermal paste and attempt again
[2021-06-10T14:25:53] Unknown: Hopefully I can figure a way to fix my Bluetooth module
[2021-06-10T14:29:24] Artem Bulashev: Strange. That means that that controller is poor design. Ubox doesn’t over heat even with higher rates. Are you sure it is not your power wires or xt60 plug that over heats and causes battery BMS protection ?
[2021-06-10T14:31:37] Unknown: Mm trampa is supposedly best in the game :l I had 0 issues before with thermal paste under 40A/120A so.. I will test and see
[2021-06-10T14:31:43] Unknown: But mmm idk
[2021-06-10T14:31:48] Unknown: Xt90 connector gets warm
[2021-06-10T14:31:59] Unknown: And BMS is 100A xD
[2021-06-10T14:32:10] Unknown: Temps on batts are 28° upon checking
[2021-06-10T14:32:46] Unknown: When I opened my old one, the build is pretty good looks like everything is done pretty well no reason for bad heat
[2021-06-10T14:33:01] Unknown: The actual casing as well is well machined
[2021-06-10T14:35:33] Luis Magalhaes: Mine hit the thermal and reduced the throttle when e pushed it a for some time, but no thermal past yet too here 😅
[2021-06-10T14:36:12] Unknown: Bigger controller so that's why
[2021-06-10T14:36:17] Unknown: I don't even know if it's heat
[2021-06-10T14:36:21] Unknown: Cos I can't access app
[2021-06-10T14:36:27] Unknown: How can I create a log using usb plugin?
[2021-06-10T14:38:42] Luis Magalhaes: Dont know i always use phone just configure in pc inicialy 😅
[2021-06-10T14:39:04] Luis Magalhaes: Bigger but 2 in 1 😂
[2021-06-10T14:39:20] Unknown: Yepp exactly so using one motor will allow heat to dissipate really well I guess
[2021-06-10T14:48:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: backpack, laptop and long usb cable ? 😅😅😅
[2021-06-10T14:51:57] Luis Magalhaes: I use both 😂😂 70A battery and 130A motor 😅
[2021-06-10T14:52:10] Luis Magalhaes: Its a way 😂😂
[2021-06-10T14:52:42] Unknown: Oh damnn😂😂

[2021-06-10T14:52:48] Unknown: DAMN
[2021-06-10T14:52:57] Unknown: How is it dual motor 70A???
[2021-06-10T14:52:58] Unknown: Holy shit
[2021-06-10T14:53:04] Unknown: What battery u got
[2021-06-10T15:19:47] Luis Magalhaes: Im liking it 😂

[2021-06-10T15:20:31] Unknown: What app did u use for the speed tracker thingy
[2021-06-10T15:20:36] Unknown: To know 0-30mph for example
[2021-06-10T15:20:44] Unknown: Pfft nice
[2021-06-10T15:20:54] Unknown: Lot of space inside ?

[2021-06-10T15:22:17] Unknown: Doesn't get in the way
[2021-06-10T15:22:25] Unknown: Maybe I get a broken kaboo and upgrade it
[2021-06-10T15:22:44] Unknown: What motors u got?
[2021-06-10T15:23:07] Luis Magalhaes: Its a good frame i think, to me the downside is the rear suspension but i can live with it
[2021-06-10T15:23:23] Luis Magalhaes: Stock motors 1200W 60mm magnet's
[2021-06-10T15:23:23] Unknown: Why
[2021-06-10T15:23:27] Unknown: XD
[2021-06-10T15:23:28] Unknown: Phat
[2021-06-10T15:23:31] Unknown: 1200 each?
[2021-06-10T15:23:45] Luis Magalhaes: Just some springs no oil dump
[2021-06-10T15:23:53] Unknown: Is it changeable?
[2021-06-10T15:23:55] Unknown: Upgradable?
[2021-06-10T15:23:58] Luis Magalhaes: Each motor yes
[2021-06-10T15:24:04] Unknown: Ouf
[2021-06-10T15:24:06] Unknown: Oufffff
[2021-06-10T15:24:17] Unknown: I am tempted now 😂😂😂😂
[2021-06-10T15:24:19] Luis Magalhaes: Not without moding
[2021-06-10T15:24:22] Unknown: What voltage
[2021-06-10T15:24:29] Luis Magalhaes: 60v 16S
[2021-06-10T15:25:03] Unknown: 16s u get more than 80kmh
[2021-06-10T15:25:04] Unknown: Damn
[2021-06-10T15:26:29] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_352@10-06-2021_15-26-29.jpg>
[2021-06-10T15:26:29] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_343@09-06-2021_14-42-21.jpg>
[2021-06-10T15:27:13] Luis Magalhaes: The one that have time is from a little downhill and the right did not register time is in the same road uphill 😅
[2021-06-10T15:27:52] Unknown: 100kmh
[2021-06-10T15:27:56] Unknown: All u need is 16s
[2021-06-10T15:27:58] Unknown: Ohhhhh shiii
[2021-06-10T15:28:34] Unknown: My new idea is to open my batt and upgrade it😂😂😂
[2021-06-10T15:28:34] Artem Bulashev: Xt90 is ok it is rated 45 nominal and 90 max
[2021-06-10T15:28:46] Unknown: I have 8-20s BMS in it
[2021-06-10T15:29:00] Unknown: If I open it and upgrade... My m365 ooo
[2021-06-10T15:29:05] Unknown: 45 nominal? Really...??
[2021-06-10T15:29:23] Artem Bulashev: Reason is no usual - it is internal resistance of the fets, can’t tell by looking at them :)
[2021-06-10T15:29:44] Unknown: Trampa doesn't use MOSFETs
[2021-06-10T15:30:11] Artem Bulashev: But you are running a lot amps man 130 phase on its own is above its spec
[2021-06-10T15:30:35] Unknown: Who's spec
[2021-06-10T15:30:38] Artem Bulashev: Point is it should not over heat with 100 / 60
[2021-06-10T15:30:49] Unknown: Oh yeah with correct installation probably no
[2021-06-10T15:31:03] Unknown: When I use thermal paste we will see
[2021-06-10T15:32:20] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-06-10T15:33:54] Luis Magalhaes: I know 😂
[2021-06-10T15:35:07] Luis Magalhaes: I can limit it if wanted to ride long, so no heat and less consumption
[2021-06-10T15:35:09] Luis Magalhaes: 😁
[2021-06-10T15:36:17] Unknown: <photos/photo_354@10-06-2021_15-36-17.jpg>
[2021-06-10T15:36:18] Unknown: Hm
[2021-06-10T15:36:25] Unknown: Surely they are 90A no?
[2021-06-10T15:36:34] Unknown: Or does that make xt30 15A nominal?
[2021-06-10T15:39:44] Unknown: Guys if
[2021-06-10T15:40:05] Unknown: I simply opened this, and continued adding cells in series and parallel to the end .. will it be ok?
[2021-06-10T15:40:12] Unknown: Ah but nvm I don't have the same cells and they're out of stock
[2021-06-10T15:40:16] Unknown: My best option is to make extension
[2021-06-10T20:52:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: since @Tudor_VTA sent me a vesc, inprepared 2 special vesc SmartDisplay for him at a special price 😁😁😁
[2021-06-10T20:53:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1 smartdisplay for vesc and EYE
[2021-06-10T20:53:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2021-06-10T20:53:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1 smartdisplay for VESC with 3.5" tft display 😉
[2021-06-10T20:53:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2021-06-10T22:04:56] Tudor: 🛴💨💨💨💨🥳🥳🥳🥳
[2021-06-10T22:06:10] Tudor: Thank you. Much appreciated
[2021-06-10T22:11:19] Happy Giraffe: That screen hella bright
[2021-06-10T22:19:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah. tried at least 5 screens before this one ... fast, reliable, spi, high constrat, not much backlight visible on the side. all good. just expensive (20e) + fpc 50 pins connectors to solder ... an horror 🤣🤣
[2021-06-10T22:20:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh yes .. and special pcb to design & print 🤣
[2021-06-10T22:35:14] Artem Bulashev: 😱😱😱
[2021-06-10T22:35:23] Artem Bulashev: I’m so going for vesc integration
[2021-06-10T22:35:28] Artem Bulashev: With vsett
[2021-06-10T22:35:31] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂
[2021-06-10T22:35:40] Artem Bulashev: They even sound alike :))
[2021-06-10T22:41:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't have any vsett display to make integration/tests 😅
[2021-06-10T22:42:37] Artem Bulashev: Those display are plug and play for zero controllers
[2021-06-10T22:43:02] Artem Bulashev: So messages for breaks and throttle and lights and others should be same
[2021-06-10T22:43:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, i know, but they may have some hidden features on the serial link
[2021-06-10T22:44:20] Artem Bulashev: Basically I think whole controller <-> display communication is same, difference is only on display ability to communicate to RFID - which is implemented all internally in display it self
[2021-06-10T22:44:49] Artem Bulashev: I can send you my display
[2021-06-10T22:44:54] Artem Bulashev: To play around
[2021-06-10T22:44:58] Artem Bulashev: And controller even
[2021-06-10T22:45:13] Artem Bulashev: With return please haha it’s not very cheap lol
[2021-06-10T22:45:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: may be, buy without testing the serial lonk, we'll never know. they may have implemented something 'backward compatible' but with some extension
[2021-06-10T22:46:09] Artem Bulashev: Would you like it? :)
[2021-06-10T22:46:31] Artem Bulashev: I’m in eu so no problem
[2021-06-10T22:47:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: like what ?
[2021-06-10T22:47:13] Artem Bulashev: This
[2021-06-10T22:47:20] Artem Bulashev: And
[2021-06-10T22:48:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: why not ! i could try vesc + vsett display 😁
[2021-06-10T22:48:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and vsett controller + smartdisplay ! yeahhhhh
[2021-06-10T22:55:43] Happy Giraffe: Std:: cout << "Hello world";
[2021-06-10T22:56:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol
[2021-06-10T22:57:20] Happy Giraffe: I wonder what about xiaomi display?🤔 It might be connected to the BLE but its perfect display on its own. Could code voltage to show when you have stopped etc.
[2021-06-10T23:03:59] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌
[2021-06-10T23:23:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: too much difference with xiaomi display. i won't go for it.
[2021-06-10T23:37:40] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌 send me pm with an address details and I will be happy to provide those 👍👍 what ever help to make your smart controller even smarter 🔥🔥
[2021-06-10T23:38:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thanks a lot !!!
[2021-06-10T23:49:05] Happy Giraffe: Understandable 👍
[2021-06-11T20:25:47] Unknown: Hey everyone I have 2 vesc's and thay both give an error message (could not read firmware versions. Make sure that the selected port really belongs to the vesc) I used 2 different laptops and both the same issues. Does someone know what is going on? (I updated the vesc's last time but they worked fine then)
[2021-06-11T20:26:03] Unknown: Omg same

[2021-06-11T20:29:50] Tudor: Why tampa?
[2021-06-11T20:31:45] Unknown: Huh
[2021-06-11T20:32:59] Artem Bulashev: 😅 thanks god I took Spintend 👍😅 ok now let’s try or shoot - if USB C, change cable, change adapter - if over Bluetooth try cable - if over cable try Bluetooth - does port device show up ok same as her it worked well? - have you tried from other operating system, from Mac, android, windows? - re download SW file and Program File
[2021-06-11T20:35:06] Unknown: Thank you
[2021-06-11T21:21:25] Unknown: Lolol i know my issue is to do with the water damaged Bluetooth chip 😂🤷🏽‍♂️ Idk why he has an issue haha
[2021-06-11T21:30:56] Mirono escooters: I'd try another cable. Maybe china cable doesnt allow usb communication
[2021-06-11T21:31:12] Mirono escooters: Clean w isopropyl?
[2021-06-11T21:32:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think you need a USB 2.0 port (not 3.0). I had weird issues with usb 3.0 host port
[2021-06-11T21:49:24] Unknown: I bought a new one just to try it :/
[2021-06-12T02:33:58] Happy Giraffe: Do Ubox ship from china?
[2021-06-12T02:34:37] Artem Bulashev: Yes but mine came declared cleverly and no tax up on arrival to Austria
[2021-06-12T02:34:40] Artem Bulashev: Fast as well
[2021-06-12T02:34:51] Happy Giraffe: Declared how?👀
[2021-06-12T02:34:54] Artem Bulashev: Not like a month but few weeks

[2021-06-12T02:35:41] Happy Giraffe: What do you think about their accessories?
[2021-06-12T02:35:55] Artem Bulashev: I declare it as electric speed controller, less than 30USD. I need to check it tomorrow
[2021-06-12T02:36:05] Artem Bulashev: That’s what they said
[2021-06-12T02:36:09] Unknown: 😂😂😂😂

[2021-06-12T02:37:26] Artem Bulashev: No one opens each package that goes by cheap post
[2021-06-12T02:37:32] Artem Bulashev: Dhl yeah
[2021-06-12T02:37:38] Artem Bulashev: Or FedEx ups
[2021-06-12T02:37:45] Artem Bulashev: Different law for couriers

[2021-06-12T02:44:18] Artem Bulashev: No power
[2021-06-12T02:44:24] Artem Bulashev: Just passive reception
[2021-06-12T02:44:34] Artem Bulashev: Power is only measured for TX
[2021-06-12T02:44:39] Artem Bulashev: 👌

[2021-06-12T02:48:32] Artem Bulashev: Austria
[2021-06-12T02:49:38] Artem Bulashev: And also, sellers usually mark goods to be shipped back if delivery fails - so customs can not just destroy it for fun. Unless seller also made a mistake and marked it “treat as abandonment “
[2021-06-12T02:50:21] Unknown: In germany they can...
[2021-06-12T02:50:45] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_359@12-06-2021_02-50-45.jpg>
[2021-06-12T02:51:19] Unknown: I was happy that I don't have to pay for the destruction
[2021-06-12T02:51:51] Artem Bulashev: Odd never heard of goods being destroyed unless it is illegal - like spy equipment (pen with hidden camera)
[2021-06-12T02:52:03] Artem Bulashev: Did seller refund you?
[2021-06-12T02:52:40] Unknown: Men I'm not a lier, it was a cheap fpv for 70 dollars from Ali
[2021-06-12T02:52:51] Unknown: Nope
[2021-06-12T02:53:05] Unknown: But to be honest I didn't try
[2021-06-12T02:53:42] Artem Bulashev: What I mean is I ship over 200 packages every month all around world from Australia, Egypt, Peru, Columbia and Sauth Africa. In 5 years not single one was destroyed …
[2021-06-12T02:53:53] Artem Bulashev: Never implied that
[2021-06-12T02:53:56] Unknown: Austrians
[2021-06-12T02:54:32] Artem Bulashev: Just meant that this is weird to hear such practice to be legal even

[2021-06-13T02:00:14] Happy Giraffe: Would it doesnt seem to have an axle preinstalled
[2021-06-13T02:00:47] Tudor: Use a harned bolt

[2021-06-13T02:01:06] Happy Giraffe: Whats that?👀 Educate me master

[2021-06-13T02:02:13] Tudor: Just run a long bolt through as axle
[2021-06-13T02:03:00] Tudor: And use spacers between the wheel and the forks somyou can align the wheel to the center
[2021-06-13T02:03:23] Tudor: I had this on my scooter long time ago
[2021-06-13T02:03:46] Happy Giraffe: But bearings?

[2021-06-14T20:12:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I published all schematics here : https://oshwlab.com/Koxx3/smartelec_wiring
[2021-06-14T20:35:21] Luis Magalhaes: 💪
[2021-06-14T20:36:38] Luis Magalhaes: Have to test my wolf again but more then one time in the same situation for an more reliable result, now i can start pulling it from beginning
[2021-06-14T20:51:10] Happy Giraffe: Whats the best way to discharge a 13s li-ion battery?
[2021-06-14T20:51:24] Happy Giraffe: I cant ride the scooter atm
[2021-06-14T20:51:40] Happy Giraffe: Battery is full and I wanna drop it to 60-70%
[2021-06-14T20:53:21] Luis Magalhaes: I don't have nothing to do it in scooters 😅 just riding
[2021-06-14T21:18:29] Artem Bulashev: You have something going on here
[2021-06-14T21:19:05] Artem Bulashev: Buck output going to battery for some reason
[2021-06-14T21:22:14] Artem Bulashev: I see . Left should be Buck Power input. Right should be buck output that will go to the lamp and to relay that will complete the circuit once closed (trigger from MCU is applied to the relay on board so jot shown here)
[2021-06-14T21:35:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol... inverted the names. thanks for the feedback
[2021-06-14T21:35:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sorry, don't understand
[2021-06-14T21:38:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: fixed
[2021-06-14T21:41:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ah ok, YES :D
[2021-06-14T21:45:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: VESC current drain test for the night (in standby)... just checking if the key loop is really needed.f if the drain is so little, I can keep it powered (a charge every 2 weeks would be OK).
[2021-06-14T21:47:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but yes, I thought using the unsed brake relay of the SE board to power on the VESC anti-spark would be a good idea for this configuration (no anti-spark on my VESC, so, can't test that)
[2021-06-14T23:05:16] Artem Bulashev: Good 🍻😁
[2021-06-14T23:07:55] Artem Bulashev: About power up. Nice idea. Could always make it on relay instead of light - not every one will need to use MCU for light operation (can be direct wiring with switch)
[2021-06-14T23:08:19] Artem Bulashev: But you now will have a platform
[2021-06-14T23:09:15] Artem Bulashev: Add can expansion board and have blinker, lights, horn alarm, sim, gps all in there
[2021-06-14T23:09:28] Artem Bulashev: I’m about to buy golden find in my opinion
[2021-06-14T23:10:53] Artem Bulashev: It is smart BMS with built in BT up to 17s and 60-120amps. But cool thing is not that ;-) It has external module that houses not only gps like other brands have, but also SIM 😱
[2021-06-14T23:11:33] Artem Bulashev: As result you have a control and monitor over BMS via 4g network, and BMS = battery = scooter has now a GPS as wel!
[2021-06-14T23:12:03] Artem Bulashev: - no thief will ever find that gps tracker and won’t be able to disable ✌️😁😁
[2021-06-14T23:12:42] Artem Bulashev: - while I can remotely make scooter act like broken or lock it or reduce max amps to like 5amps so it can’t go fast
[2021-06-14T23:21:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly
[2021-06-14T23:22:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ohhh ! good idea !
[2021-06-14T23:22:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i already bought a gps/gprs module, but it fried my sim card 🤣🤣
[2021-06-14T23:32:23] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-06-14T23:32:56] Artem Bulashev: Yeah here what I like is integration with bms and the fact that it will be hidden inside battery 🤓 even has “lock mode” of some sort
[2021-06-14T23:38:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah. i'm still reluctant to open/modify batteries/bms 😅😅
[2021-06-14T23:38:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: too scared...
[2021-06-14T23:38:44] Artem Bulashev: No kidding
[2021-06-14T23:38:53] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I don’t want to buy BMS from china
[2021-06-14T23:39:03] Artem Bulashev: That one is from china but good brand
[2021-06-14T23:39:09] Artem Bulashev: And it is not cheapo
[2021-06-14T23:39:13] Artem Bulashev: 70$
[2021-06-14T23:39:21] Artem Bulashev: And gps + sim module 30$
[2021-06-14T23:39:34] Artem Bulashev: Fair price for 16s full BMS I consider
[2021-06-14T23:39:37] Artem Bulashev: Small too
[2021-06-14T23:39:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah

[2021-06-14T23:40:05] Artem Bulashev: My BMS research collected here
[2021-06-14T23:40:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nice !
[2021-06-14T23:42:55] Mirono escooters: Daly is imo the best Then ant bms (those 2 are close together) Then icgogogo
[2021-06-14T23:43:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i have one on a backup battery i made for my esk8. nice, but not a 'smart' version.

[2021-06-14T23:45:26] Luis Magalhaes: i use a smart bms on my master pack an ANT bms
[2021-06-14T23:45:38] Mirono escooters: I only use Bluetooth
[2021-06-14T23:45:42] Luis Magalhaes: china power lolol i like it 🤣
[2021-06-14T23:45:48] Mirono escooters: So nice. Once ur used to it nothing else can beat it
[2021-06-14T23:51:03] Artem Bulashev: Usual no innovation :) https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001315915241.html cost similar to Daly, but BT is built in and has that cool option for sim and gps for extra 35$ a little bigger though but still ok
[2021-06-14T23:53:29] Artem Bulashev: Also like how it has 3 shunt resistor to measure flow And fet temp is right on them instead of being on the board near by
[2021-06-15T13:11:19] Unknown: Agreed
[2021-06-15T13:11:25] Unknown: I've used icgogo
[2021-06-15T13:11:29] Unknown: And now I'm on daly
[2021-06-15T13:11:32] Unknown: I like both
[2021-06-15T14:05:53] Face de Pin Sucé: those are nice motors
[2021-06-15T14:12:59] Artem Bulashev: How can you tell ? Motor current 138 because?
[2021-06-15T14:13:20] Artem Bulashev: What motor is that ?
[2021-06-15T14:13:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Weped motor 🙈
[2021-06-15T14:14:24] Face de Pin Sucé: I can easily put 300-400A phase in it
[2021-06-15T14:14:39] Face de Pin Sucé: and something around 150A battery
[2021-06-15T14:14:43] Artem Bulashev: What is the nominal
[2021-06-15T14:14:48] Artem Bulashev: Watt on motor ?
[2021-06-15T14:15:11] Face de Pin Sucé: nobody knows since factory don't give those details
[2021-06-15T14:15:11] Artem Bulashev: Weped sst?
[2021-06-15T14:15:20] Face de Pin Sucé: GTS, but same motor as SST
[2021-06-15T14:15:29] Artem Bulashev: 2 15kw peak
[2021-06-15T14:16:38] Artem Bulashev: That this usually means about 5-7.5k watt nominal
[2021-06-15T14:18:10] Artem Bulashev: Considering that 1300w motor can take 130a phase without heating up almost at all yeah I can believe those can take even 500a hase current 😅😅 not sure who abs why would want that 😅😅
[2021-06-15T14:19:12] Face de Pin Sucé: yeah
[2021-06-15T14:19:21] Face de Pin Sucé: not sure why ? because of poweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer
[2021-06-15T14:20:18] Artem Bulashev: I mean you won’t be able to control it without Thanos Infinity Gauntlet
[2021-06-15T14:20:30] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2021-06-15T14:20:49] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm a rock climber, I already have it in my hands 😁
[2021-06-15T14:21:26] Artem Bulashev: Avengers should have you in their team 😂
[2021-06-15T14:21:32] Face de Pin Sucé: More seriously, already have driven 20+kW escooters, it's not so hard to control when you are used to
[2021-06-15T14:21:52] Face de Pin Sucé: I told them but they don't like non american people 😁
[2021-06-15T14:22:23] Artem Bulashev: I hardly can believe that controlling 30k watt two wheel scooter is manageable
[2021-06-15T14:22:38] Artem Bulashev: That they don’t 🤣
[2021-06-15T14:23:05] Artem Bulashev: What kind of controller is used in them ?
[2021-06-15T14:23:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Originally, it's Kelly 7218S
[2021-06-15T14:24:28] Artem Bulashev: 72v only? 😂
[2021-06-15T14:24:31] Artem Bulashev: 80amps?
[2021-06-15T14:24:33] Artem Bulashev: 🤣
[2021-06-15T14:24:42] Artem Bulashev: Dammm
[2021-06-15T14:24:45] Face de Pin Sucé: 200A peak
[2021-06-15T14:24:51] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I see
[2021-06-15T14:24:55] Artem Bulashev: It’s a lot
[2021-06-15T14:25:18] Artem Bulashev: 80amps at 72v (nominal not max) = 5760w per wheel
[2021-06-15T14:25:24] Face de Pin Sucé: (I pulled 270A in dual from a 16S6P of 50E samsung cells, she didnt like it)
[2021-06-15T14:25:36] Artem Bulashev: So my estimation 5-7.5k nominal is about right it seems
[2021-06-15T14:25:55] Artem Bulashev: 50e is not meant for that lol
[2021-06-15T14:26:07] Face de Pin Sucé: -20V during acceleration, had to put smartBMS and remove all protections so it doesnt cut off
[2021-06-15T14:26:10] Artem Bulashev: You need like Samsung 50s / Vapecell t50
[2021-06-15T14:26:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah I know, but that was the point
[2021-06-15T14:26:48] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-06-15T14:26:52] Artem Bulashev: That’s 45a per cell
[2021-06-15T14:27:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah
[2021-06-15T14:27:04] Artem Bulashev: Yeah only few cells can handle that
[2021-06-15T14:27:13] Face de Pin Sucé: I did it from november
[2021-06-15T14:27:13] Artem Bulashev: But why battery so small??
[2021-06-15T14:27:18] Artem Bulashev: 30ah
[2021-06-15T14:27:22] Artem Bulashev: 16s
[2021-06-15T14:27:24] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-06-15T14:27:36] Artem Bulashev: I have same one in my vsett9
[2021-06-15T14:27:41] Artem Bulashev: Lol single motor
[2021-06-15T14:27:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Because of Weped
[2021-06-15T14:28:04] Artem Bulashev: No space?
[2021-06-15T14:28:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Huge space, can put 10P inside
[2021-06-15T14:28:21] Face de Pin Sucé: But I ran an experiment
[2021-06-15T14:28:21] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-06-15T14:28:24] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2021-06-15T14:28:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Ride it to 100 cycles
[2021-06-15T14:28:34] Face de Pin Sucé: (it's about 90 cycles now)
[2021-06-15T14:28:42] Artem Bulashev: So you were trying to kill the battery
[2021-06-15T14:28:43] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-06-15T14:28:49] Face de Pin Sucé: And then Ill put it on tester to see the life of battery
[2021-06-15T14:28:56] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-06-15T14:28:59] Artem Bulashev: DoD?
[2021-06-15T14:29:09] Artem Bulashev: 100-0%? Each time?
[2021-06-15T14:29:13] Face de Pin Sucé: I work with SaveMyBattery in France, they can do all the tests
[2021-06-15T14:29:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Not each time
[2021-06-15T14:29:26] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-06-15T14:29:32] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-06-15T14:29:53] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_372@15-06-2021_14-29-53.jpg>
[2021-06-15T14:30:09] Face de Pin Sucé: When it's 3000Ah it's 100 cycles
[2021-06-15T14:30:21] Artem Bulashev: Because by using it 90-40% you can extended life cycle up to 100%
[2021-06-15T14:30:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Honestly, I charge it everyday and several times, twice a day
[2021-06-15T14:30:55] Artem Bulashev: What rate ?
[2021-06-15T14:30:58] Face de Pin Sucé: Pulling so much amps on so small battery is hard
[2021-06-15T14:31:12] Artem Bulashev: I’m surprised it doesn’t blow up
[2021-06-15T14:31:16] Artem Bulashev: From 45amps
[2021-06-15T14:31:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Surprised too
[2021-06-15T14:31:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Had a lot of temp cutoff
[2021-06-15T14:34:17] Luis Magalhaes: For fun not for transport 😂😂
[2021-06-15T19:33:14] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_373@15-06-2021_19-33-14.jpg>
[2021-06-15T19:33:27] Luis Magalhaes: Multiple tests 😂
[2021-06-15T20:05:24] Luis Magalhaes: its not cutting now but i think its slower then before when i cant push full throttle at start lol
[2021-06-15T20:53:12] Artem Bulashev: 2.5-3sec to 30kmh
[2021-06-15T20:53:15] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2021-06-15T20:53:21] Artem Bulashev: Vesc does payoff i see
[2021-06-15T20:53:42] Artem Bulashev: Considering how small it is vs dual 40amp controllers 😬😅😅😅
[2021-06-15T20:53:52] Artem Bulashev: I would say it’s golden
[2021-06-15T20:54:09] Artem Bulashev: Can’t wait for UBOX Pro to come around
[2021-06-15T20:54:33] Artem Bulashev: 150amps curent at Leary and new shape, suppose smaller. May be higher voltage too
[2021-06-15T20:54:36] Luis Magalhaes: yes its good
[2021-06-15T20:54:55] Artem Bulashev: What is the size of one stock controller?
[2021-06-15T20:54:58] Luis Magalhaes: more phase amps would be great haha
[2021-06-15T20:55:28] Artem Bulashev: Always lol for any motor with more than 1000w nominal
[2021-06-15T20:55:47] Artem Bulashev: I think 1000w would handle 150amps phase without much heat at all in FOC mode
[2021-06-15T20:55:55] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_374@15-06-2021_20-55-55.jpg>

[2021-06-15T20:56:10] Artem Bulashev: Mother of god
[2021-06-15T20:56:12] Luis Magalhaes: the second photo is the burn one but just to see lolol
[2021-06-15T20:56:37] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-06-15T20:56:54] Luis Magalhaes: its thicker and the size of the ubox without case
[2021-06-15T20:56:58] Artem Bulashev: Looks like each is about the size of UBOX
[2021-06-15T20:57:26] Luis Magalhaes: yes they are lolol
[2021-06-15T20:57:55] Artem Bulashev: I would love to see UBOX gain 1cm thickness, while becoming smaller footprint
[2021-06-15T20:58:46] Luis Magalhaes: im experiencing the abs high fault
[2021-06-15T20:58:56] Luis Magalhaes: but only in woods and going up
[2021-06-15T20:59:57] Luis Magalhaes: it loose traction and give the error
[2021-06-15T21:00:07] Artem Bulashev: Those are 40amps ?
[2021-06-15T21:00:16] Artem Bulashev: Or 45amps contorlers?
[2021-06-15T21:01:18] Luis Magalhaes: spintend told me that i should use the 300A firmware to bypass the abs max i have now
[2021-06-15T21:01:26] Luis Magalhaes: but loose warranty
[2021-06-15T21:01:33] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-06-15T21:01:54] Artem Bulashev: Yeah so absolute is total phase current ?
[2021-06-15T21:02:00] Luis Magalhaes: 40A original, they where shunted to 50A
[2021-06-15T21:02:07] Artem Bulashev: Like a sum from both channels?
[2021-06-15T21:02:44] Luis Magalhaes: i think it is but its maximum is 180A
[2021-06-15T21:03:22] Luis Magalhaes: im doing 130 each side
[2021-06-15T21:03:35] Luis Magalhaes: maybe its battery max
[2021-06-15T21:03:54] Luis Magalhaes: im doing 70A each side so 140A
[2021-06-15T21:07:06] Artem Bulashev: Does it appear on slow speed going up hill
[2021-06-15T21:07:17] Artem Bulashev: Or on max speed going any where ?
[2021-06-15T21:07:40] Luis Magalhaes: slow speed
[2021-06-15T21:07:50] Artem Bulashev: Than it is phase current
[2021-06-15T21:08:31] Luis Magalhaes: i thouth about that too because it was when i put 130A i did not do that at 110A
[2021-06-15T21:09:00] Luis Magalhaes: but the value is 180A ABS current max
[2021-06-15T21:09:29] Luis Magalhaes: im not knowing how can i go above that
[2021-06-15T21:09:42] Luis Magalhaes: only if it is each controller
[2021-06-15T21:10:04] Artem Bulashev: Front and rear together
[2021-06-15T21:10:12] Luis Magalhaes: in that case if its configure to 130A and it goes to 180 peack
[2021-06-15T21:10:34] Luis Magalhaes: yes but if i put only one it does the same i think
[2021-06-15T21:11:19] Artem Bulashev: No front phase you mean if you have 130 on rear and 20amps on front it will still through abs error
[2021-06-15T21:11:21] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-06-15T21:12:15] Artem Bulashev: Try 130 rear and 90 front - you said on 110 110 before it didn’t give that error
[2021-06-15T21:14:25] Luis Magalhaes: maybe it works but thats no fun 🤣🤣
[2021-06-15T21:15:32] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2021-06-15T21:15:49] Luis Magalhaes: did some screen capture today
[2021-06-15T21:16:11] Luis Magalhaes: not full battery there, i think it was like 60v
[2021-06-15T21:17:36] Unknown: Dam! What setup you have? :)
[2021-06-15T21:18:46] Luis Magalhaes: 16s16P 160A max discharge 1200W x2 motor's
[2021-06-15T21:19:12] Luis Magalhaes: the rest you can see there 70Abatt 130A motor x2
[2021-06-15T22:14:16] Tudor: Any recommendations for 2x1200w good motors
[2021-06-15T22:14:23] Tudor: From alliexpres ofc
[2021-06-15T22:17:47] Luis Magalhaes: Im using the original ones of wolf warrior but if i change them i should go to some HM motors
[2021-06-15T22:19:37] Happy Giraffe: 1000w not enough?👀😂
[2021-06-15T22:20:16] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-06-15T22:21:08] Luis Magalhaes: Check the windinga of motors if you can, mine are 22x3 low torque but high speed
[2021-06-15T22:21:14] Luis Magalhaes: And not that efficient too
[2021-06-15T22:24:59] Happy Giraffe: Ebike motors are so efficient compared to scooters, I want to build an ebike just because of that🙈
[2021-06-15T22:25:57] Tudor: Wolf ones wont fit on my ninebot max
[2021-06-15T22:28:21] Mirono escooters: I have 1200w alieexpress but they are thicc af won't fit without bending frame lol
[2021-06-15T22:28:48] Luis Magalhaes: Yes they are, single motor too not dual and way bigger
[2021-06-15T22:28:48] Luis Magalhaes: With lots of mods... 😂
[2021-06-15T22:30:15] Tudor: On max?
[2021-06-15T22:32:02] Mirono escooters: Oh no regular m365
[2021-06-15T22:32:04] Mirono escooters: With suspension
[2021-06-17T00:17:19] Luis Magalhaes: any one knows whats the specs of the kelly kls7212

[2021-06-17T00:57:14] Artem Bulashev: battery current can not be higher than Motor Current
[2021-06-17T00:57:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes

[2021-06-17T01:00:27] Artem Bulashev: 20-100% of the peak controller current
[2021-06-17T01:00:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, it means it's not so much power then
[2021-06-17T01:00:33] Artem Bulashev: which is 120
[2021-06-17T01:00:38] Artem Bulashev: nope

[2021-06-17T01:00:52] Artem Bulashev: 125-130 phase
[2021-06-17T01:00:57] Face de Pin Sucé: No 😂
[2021-06-17T01:01:05] Artem Bulashev: 100amps battery
[2021-06-17T01:01:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Trust me Ubox wins nothing
[2021-06-17T01:01:15] Artem Bulashev: its same power output
[2021-06-17T01:01:19] Artem Bulashev: even more on phase
[2021-06-17T01:01:22] Face de Pin Sucé: I've run Ubox on my Weped
[2021-06-17T01:01:33] Artem Bulashev: and
[2021-06-17T01:01:43] Face de Pin Sucé: 2 days and I came back to 7218S
[2021-06-17T01:01:59] Face de Pin Sucé: Then I tried 7212S
[2021-06-17T01:02:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Still better than Ubox
[2021-06-17T01:02:06] Artem Bulashev: lol
[2021-06-17T01:02:13] Artem Bulashev: that one is 200amps phase
[2021-06-17T01:02:18] Artem Bulashev: so ofcoirce
[2021-06-17T01:02:20] Face de Pin Sucé: But came back to 7218S 😁
[2021-06-17T01:02:38] Artem Bulashev: it is almost 2 times more powerful
[2021-06-17T01:02:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, but I tried 7212S
[2021-06-17T01:03:03] Face de Pin Sucé: And it's more power than Ubox
[2021-06-17T01:03:06] Artem Bulashev: than you didn't configure it correctly
[2021-06-17T01:03:11] Artem Bulashev: it is same SW
[2021-06-17T01:03:17] Artem Bulashev: and HW
[2021-06-17T01:03:35] Face de Pin Sucé: I tried Ubox with 300A phase, nice power but overheating in like 1 minute 😂
[2021-06-17T01:04:11] Artem Bulashev: 7218S is configured as 120amps phase and. peak battery and 50 battery long term
[2021-06-17T01:04:19] Artem Bulashev: ubox can do almsot exactly same
[2021-06-17T01:04:32] Artem Bulashev: and they have same SW inside that controlls all
[2021-06-17T01:04:43] Artem Bulashev: so they will be same if configured identical
[2021-06-17T01:05:11] Face de Pin Sucé: You should try 7212S
[2021-06-17T01:05:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Ubox, pulling 8000W from battery and it's overheating
[2021-06-17T01:05:52] Artem Bulashev: beside UBOX is 2 times smaller foot print and 4 times smaller in volume
[2021-06-17T01:06:21] Face de Pin Sucé: 7212S, pulling 10+kW (in 60V, in 72V I pulled 16kW) and it's running fine
[2021-06-17T01:06:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes it's true
[2021-06-17T01:08:12] Artem Bulashev: UBOX in latest revision can not over heeat if placeed on scootere body. - it starts to missbehave due to high AMP noise that gets into system beforee overeheating. - people pushede it over to 150amps phase by shielding Logic board. and thee only temp modes it needed to stay bellow 65c was new betteer thermal pad for feets/case and good thermal past betweeen case/scooteree body
[2021-06-17T01:08:35] Artem Bulashev: also leets not forgete UBOX officially rated 100amps only
[2021-06-17T01:08:54] Artem Bulashev: it is not adveertiseed as 130 or more
[2021-06-17T01:09:17] Face de Pin Sucé: I dont think people use it hardly
[2021-06-17T01:09:30] Face de Pin Sucé: I mean, if you read esk8 people, yes it's okay
[2021-06-17T01:09:45] Artem Bulashev: Ubox pro is comming soon
[2021-06-17T01:10:00] Artem Bulashev: for people with motors over 1.2kw
[2021-06-17T01:10:15] Artem Bulashev: will have more. current in phasee and battery it seems
[2021-06-17T01:10:20] Face de Pin Sucé: But putting it inside a 11" scooter (like Thunder/Ultra/Weped) and going on a full ride is not okay,
[2021-06-17T01:10:28] Artem Bulashev: makes no seence
[2021-06-17T01:10:33] Artem Bulashev: its too week
[2021-06-17T01:10:56] Artem Bulashev: those have 1.5kw -2.5kw nominall motors
[2021-06-17T01:11:08] Face de Pin Sucé: That's what I explain, 7212S is fine with almost twice power
[2021-06-17T01:11:11] Artem Bulashev: that can take 180-250a phase
[2021-06-17T01:11:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Ubox is cool but not for power
[2021-06-17T01:11:46] Happy Giraffe: How soon?
[2021-06-17T01:11:57] Artem Bulashev: 7212S should not have "twice thee power" unless it can be also configured above spec sheeet daat
[2021-06-17T01:12:09] Artem Bulashev: summer
[2021-06-17T01:12:12] Happy Giraffe: I'll buy Ubox in a month
[2021-06-17T01:12:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Running 20S on 7212S give me 16kW
[2021-06-17T01:12:30] Happy Giraffe: Maybe could get the pro🤔
[2021-06-17T01:12:32] Artem Bulashev: that will be needed only if your motor is above 1200w nominal
[2021-06-17T01:12:46] Face de Pin Sucé: And the better I had on Ubox without overheat is 8000W
[2021-06-17T01:12:54] Happy Giraffe: But if its only like 50-70$ more then why not haha
[2021-06-17T01:13:31] Artem Bulashev: sure. Price is to be seen, but company prices so far are flattering so I think it will be very reasonable
[2021-06-17T01:13:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Dont forget components shortages :/
[2021-06-17T01:14:06] Artem Bulashev: I mean current one cost 120euro pwe channel = 240eu
[2021-06-17T01:14:10] Happy Giraffe: Yeah😅

[2021-06-17T19:33:32] Artem Bulashev: btw people. check it out, I got contact for ordering 1000pcs of 50s. looking for shared order guys - price is amazing! 4.71 euro for Samsung 50s 21700. without ebay and paypal would be 15% cheaper almost but safety first most people don't know me , so check it out if you want https://www.ebay.at/itm/174806326693
[2021-06-17T19:38:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yessss 👍 still trying to print the latest version with SLS optimizations
[2021-06-17T19:39:04] Happy Giraffe: 15s4p would be nice in xiaomi but I dont need more amps haha
[2021-06-17T19:42:31] Unknown: I don't like the eye..... display should be in the middle....
[2021-06-17T20:05:50] Artem Bulashev: Whole point is to keep oem look and controls - most people don’t want to / can’t do deep modding - installing custom display, disassembling and re making all wires for new system, and than also solving questions about wiring for breaks and solving questions about new throttle trigger 🤷‍♂️ so this will sell hot for quick Vesc replacement
[2021-06-17T20:12:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i am not a fan too. but it's an alternative solution. the whole display will be really expensive with the working time (cabling, soldering, printing, assembly)... currently : 350-400e (way too much). this solution simply provide a much more affordable solution (100-150e)
[2021-06-17T20:17:40] Unknown: I'm not a fan of finger throttle and display on the sides is dangerous but you are right price is an issue..
[2021-06-17T20:18:03] francois schempers: hi ! ^^
[2021-06-17T20:18:10] Unknown: Heiiiii
[2021-06-17T20:18:28] Unknown: Back from holiday???
[2021-06-17T20:19:09] Unknown: We missed you everywhere.....
[2021-06-17T20:19:46] Luis Magalhaes: I miss cruise control 😂
[2021-06-17T20:19:49] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_379@17-06-2021_20-19-49.jpg>
[2021-06-17T20:20:01] francois schempers: ahah im sure im expandable x)
[2021-06-17T20:20:29] francois schempers: i was actually back last week but forgot to activate notification again xD
[2021-06-17T20:21:55] Unknown: 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
[2021-06-17T20:22:41] Unknown: Shite that's cool...
[2021-06-17T20:23:13] francois schempers: @koxx3 wasnt i supposed to send you 100€ more ? I will do at end of the month ;) where are you with your project ? you receive Vesc from tudor ?
[2021-06-17T20:27:24] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_380@17-06-2021_20-27-24.jpg>
[2021-06-17T20:27:34] Luis Magalhaes: 57v left 😂
[2021-06-17T20:27:49] Mirono escooters: Quite a big cell dkff xd
[2021-06-17T20:28:03] Mirono escooters: Did u accidentally add higher cap to 1 or replaced a rod
[2021-06-17T20:28:06] Mirono escooters: Row
[2021-06-17T20:28:10] Luis Magalhaes: Started at 65v
[2021-06-17T20:28:38] Luis Magalhaes: It was the cells i replaced because of the first ubox fire 😅
[2021-06-17T20:30:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Yes, I received it ;) for the 100€, as you wish, and you're welcome 🤣
[2021-06-17T20:31:30] francois schempers: no problem, I know R&D is expensive
[2021-06-17T20:31:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍😅
[2021-06-17T20:32:14] Unknown: Not big, normal pack, I'm impressed
[2021-06-17T20:35:21] Luis Magalhaes: 54ah if fully charged i cant charge above 65v because of the new cells
[2021-06-17T20:35:49] Unknown: Can I ask how much do you weight???
[2021-06-17T20:36:20] Luis Magalhaes: In comparison with full charge and minimotors setup in minimum power option made 90km and no battery left at average of 38kmh
[2021-06-17T20:36:47] Luis Magalhaes: Im thinking ubox is more conservative in energy 😂
[2021-06-17T20:36:54] Unknown: 54 Ah???
[2021-06-17T20:37:08] Artem Bulashev: That’s not very efficient haha
[2021-06-17T20:37:09] Luis Magalhaes: 70kg +-
[2021-06-17T20:37:55] Artem Bulashev: Vsett 10+ does 77km going 35-55kmh DDM WITH RIDER 75kg
[2021-06-17T20:39:20] Luis Magalhaes: Yes but my motors tend not to be very efficient too 😂
[2021-06-17T20:39:30] Luis Magalhaes: Speed winding 😅
[2021-06-17T20:39:53] Luis Magalhaes: And the minimotors where 50A controllers
[2021-06-17T20:40:06] Luis Magalhaes: Vset is sine or square?
[2021-06-17T22:09:24] Happy Giraffe: Did Spintend give any info about the single vesc?
[2021-06-17T22:09:38] Happy Giraffe: I saw something on Facebook a long time ago
[2021-06-18T00:16:15] Happy Giraffe: Have you tried cheap ebike displays?👀
[2021-06-18T00:16:24] Happy Giraffe: How do they function?
[2021-06-18T02:13:02] Unknown: I will look on my wife's ebike i installed here a while ago a cheap bike kit middle motor geared
[2021-06-18T09:08:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, never
[2021-06-18T09:13:28] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-18T09:14:02] Happy Giraffe: Could those be easy to run on vesc?
[2021-06-18T09:14:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. need serial link translation too
[2021-06-18T09:21:55] Happy Giraffe: Oh damn
[2021-06-18T10:07:48] Artem Bulashev: Trying to get it released by end of month
[2021-06-18T10:09:16] Mirono escooters: Isnt there a limit when adding batteries is waste because weight makes it worse? In electric planes this is a big problem When ur power is doubled Ur weight is tripled Something like that
[2021-06-18T10:10:18] Artem Bulashev: We are not flying
[2021-06-18T10:11:41] Mirono escooters: Fair enough
[2021-06-18T10:11:55] Mirono escooters: Thats why I asked if motorcycles had anything like this too
[2021-06-18T11:03:27] Happy Giraffe: Damn, then I should get that instead
[2021-06-18T11:03:53] Happy Giraffe: Also monorim adds a ton of weight worth like 20-30 cells
[2021-06-18T11:04:04] Happy Giraffe: Bigger tires etc
[2021-06-18T11:04:32] Happy Giraffe: Weight below makes motorcycles more stable so better👀
[2021-06-18T11:04:46] Mirono escooters: Fair enough. Ill just eat a hamburger less
[2021-06-18T11:04:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-18T11:05:27] Happy Giraffe: Francois the mountain havent thought about weight so neither should you😂
[2021-06-18T11:11:25] Mirono escooters: Im only 50 shouldnt worry
[2021-06-18T11:11:34] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2021-06-18T11:11:34] Mirono escooters: My 1200w beast is getting heavy tho lol
[2021-06-18T11:11:46] Mirono escooters: I have a other daily scoot now. So light
[2021-06-18T11:12:00] Mirono escooters: Didnt someone make carbon fiber scoot?
[2021-06-18T11:12:08] Happy Giraffe: Rion
[2021-06-18T11:12:20] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi pro should be under 15kg, mine is about 25kg now
[2021-06-18T11:17:48] Mirono escooters: Old project I bought from friend Dual monorim suspension 500w And loads of other upgrades Without battery this shit is 23kg ._.
[2021-06-18T11:44:27] francois schempers: me plus my scooter we are at 150kilo x)
[2021-06-18T11:45:48] Unknown: German company is 3d printing a full frame with carbon fibers...

[2021-06-18T12:05:25] Luis Magalhaes: 170+ here 😂
[2021-06-18T12:42:21] Unknown: Hmkay .. so guys
[2021-06-18T12:43:11] Unknown: Yesterday I was at work, rained loads had ebike locked up but it was covered, obviously still got wet but anyhow When I finished I got on it and rode, it works perfectly fine but I checked app to see my charge and...
[2021-06-18T12:43:15] Unknown: <photos/photo_381@18-06-2021_12-43-15.jpg>
[2021-06-18T12:43:47] Unknown: So I got home and checked the balance connector with multimeter, all cells are 3.7+-0.04v
[2021-06-18T12:43:51] Unknown: But this is displayed
[2021-06-18T12:44:01] Unknown: When I actually draw power it's ok and it works perfectly fine
[2021-06-18T12:45:17] Luis Magalhaes: Strange, the bms is showing odd values on cell 7 and 6 it should cut on those values
[2021-06-18T12:45:30] Unknown: Exactly
[2021-06-18T12:45:33] Unknown: It was still working
[2021-06-18T12:45:43] Unknown: Like it says discharge is off
[2021-06-18T12:45:47] Unknown: But ... It was working fine
[2021-06-18T12:46:28] Luis Magalhaes: Are you not bypassing it?
[2021-06-18T12:47:24] Luis Magalhaes: I had a similar problem but with charging only it was a cable from battery in wrong side and the bms cuts but wasn't enable to really cut anything 😅
[2021-06-18T12:48:22] Mirono escooters: Bms prob misreading due to water in it
[2021-06-18T12:48:26] Mirono escooters: Had same problem
[2021-06-18T12:48:27] Unknown: Yeah but .. it says no
[2021-06-18T12:48:36] Unknown: It's "waterproof" tho
[2021-06-18T12:48:40] Unknown: And water didn't actually get in
[2021-06-18T12:48:43] Unknown: Just moisture from bag
[2021-06-18T12:48:48] Unknown: I let it dry overnight
[2021-06-18T12:48:58] Mirono escooters: Yheres defenitely atleast water damp in it
[2021-06-18T12:49:07] Unknown: So what u think now
[2021-06-18T12:49:19] Mirono escooters: Open and clean
[2021-06-18T12:49:26] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth so handy. Saved me a battery
[2021-06-18T12:49:30] Unknown: Open battery or bms
[2021-06-18T12:49:36] Mirono escooters: Both
[2021-06-18T12:50:16] Mirono escooters: I now use completely different batt pack methode 2 layers fish tape 5 layers waterproof tape 1 later blue wrap Black silicon on every side/hole
[2021-06-18T12:50:43] Unknown: But BMS isn't openable
[2021-06-18T12:50:44] Unknown: Daly BMS
[2021-06-18T12:51:03] Unknown: U take screws out and all u can do is take off red panel
[2021-06-18T12:51:07] Unknown: U can't acces circuit
[2021-06-18T12:51:28] Mirono escooters: Use a heat gun to dry it
[2021-06-18T12:51:35] Mirono escooters: Theres just water on the bms connection plug thing
[2021-06-18T12:51:36] Unknown: Hairdryer?
[2021-06-18T12:51:38] Mirono escooters: Balance loads
[2021-06-18T12:51:41] Mirono escooters: Yea thats fine
[2021-06-18T12:51:51] Mirono escooters: The sooner the better
[2021-06-18T12:51:53] Unknown: Fuck sake man fuck the UK 😂😂😂
[2021-06-18T12:51:55] Unknown: Yh right now
[2021-06-18T12:52:02] Unknown: Shall I open it fully yh
[2021-06-18T12:52:07] Unknown: Or can I just hairdry it
[2021-06-18T12:52:22] Mirono escooters: Open fully
[2021-06-18T12:52:25] Mirono escooters: Dont risk it
[2021-06-18T12:52:41] Mirono escooters: Consider silicon bags that absord water in ur battery
[2021-06-18T12:52:48] Unknown: Yeah considered
[2021-06-18T12:52:50] Mirono escooters: If u live in a high rain enviroment
[2021-06-18T12:53:00] Mirono escooters: I learned how to protect batteries. Lol
[2021-06-18T12:53:06] Mirono escooters: Killed a few back in the day
[2021-06-18T12:53:12] Unknown: What tape u use?
[2021-06-18T12:53:21] Unknown: Waterproof one
[2021-06-18T12:53:38] Mirono escooters: One time a bms went crippling If I dkdnt check w Bluetooth I would have never seen cells going to 3.1v from 3.7v So close to dying. Lol
[2021-06-18T12:53:41] Mirono escooters: Gorilla tape
[2021-06-18T12:53:49] Mirono escooters: Any waterproof ducktape will do
[2021-06-18T12:55:15] Unknown: At leats Mt cells are ok
[2021-06-18T12:55:22] Unknown: Balanced more or less
[2021-06-18T12:55:32] Mirono escooters: If bms goes crazy it won't for long : p
[2021-06-18T12:55:40] Unknown: Wdym
[2021-06-18T12:56:55] Mirono escooters: If ur bms randomly reads v wrong and balances or even worse the balance resistors turn on due to a short ur pack will slowly discharge
[2021-06-18T12:57:02] Mirono escooters: Changes r low But I would not risk it
[2021-06-18T12:57:54] Unknown: This BMS only balanced during charge
[2021-06-18T12:58:02] Unknown: I kind of prefer the ant BMS xD
[2021-06-18T12:59:43] Mirono escooters: Still if it shorts the balance transistors it will constantly balance.🙈
[2021-06-18T12:59:50] Mirono escooters: Worst case scenario. But ye
[2021-06-18T12:59:58] Unknown: Well hopefully not the case
[2021-06-18T13:00:06] Unknown: BMS is fully sealed , hard for water to get in
[2021-06-18T13:00:10] Unknown: I tried open my old one and omg
[2021-06-18T13:00:14] Unknown: Literally impossible
[2021-06-18T13:00:19] Mirono escooters: On balance leads not so
[2021-06-18T13:00:21] Mirono escooters: I'd just clean it out
[2021-06-18T13:00:30] Unknown: Yeah I'm using a hairdryer on the bms
[2021-06-18T13:00:35] Unknown: U reckon I should on battery too?
[2021-06-18T13:00:49] Mirono escooters: If u see condensation
[2021-06-18T13:00:54] Mirono escooters: Or feel it
[2021-06-18T13:01:12] Unknown: Time to open then
[2021-06-18T13:02:52] Unknown: At least my welds are all still, welded xD
[2021-06-18T13:03:08] Mirono escooters: Thats something 😆
[2021-06-18T13:05:36] Happy Giraffe: Arent heatshrinks enough with that black glue?
[2021-06-18T13:05:58] Happy Giraffe: Should make it waterproof enough to dip in the pool
[2021-06-18T13:07:36] Mirono escooters: It can tear and i prefer multiple layers of protect
[2021-06-18T13:07:51] Mirono escooters: Batteries aren't to mess with and expensive 🙈
[2021-06-18T13:08:20] Unknown: <photos/photo_382@18-06-2021_13-08-20.jpg>
[2021-06-18T13:08:25] Unknown: What should I do
[2021-06-18T13:08:40] Unknown: Hairdryer didn't do nothing
[2021-06-18T13:11:41] Mirono escooters: Think water got inside same behaviour as a m365 bms
[2021-06-18T13:11:46] Mirono escooters: 1 cell high 1 low
[2021-06-18T13:11:57] Mirono escooters: Condensation only takes 1 tiny hole
[2021-06-18T13:12:08] Unknown: G9 isn't even 3.8 lmao
[2021-06-18T13:12:27] Unknown: :|
[2021-06-18T13:12:29] Unknown: So what now
[2021-06-18T13:12:34] Unknown: This Mt second £80 BMS.
[2021-06-18T13:13:54] Mirono escooters: Unplug replug leads? Lol

[2021-06-18T13:18:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: little hole in my stm32 for me. microcontroller dead
[2021-06-18T13:18:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'l' try to replace it
[2021-06-18T13:18:24] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-18T13:18:46] Unknown: It went normal for a second
[2021-06-18T13:18:50] Unknown: Then went back to 5v lol
[2021-06-18T13:19:39] Luis Magalhaes: So its almoust there😂
[2021-06-18T13:20:33] Mirono escooters: Should be replaceble. But what made it go boom?
[2021-06-18T13:20:58] Mirono escooters: Defenitely corrosion or a failing resistor
[2021-06-18T13:24:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I thing it's a little piece of metal from a component leg a cut which went on the PCB. it made a shortcut.
[2021-06-18T13:24:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but leg often 'jump' when you cut them
[2021-06-18T13:38:18] Unknown: What solutions do I have man
[2021-06-18T13:38:30] Unknown: I've had TWO fucking cycles on this

[2021-06-18T13:38:44] Unknown: U can't open them up
[2021-06-18T13:38:45] Unknown: Daly bms
[2021-06-18T13:38:47] Unknown: U can't open it
[2021-06-18T13:38:53] Unknown: Otherwise I would've cleaned ages aho
[2021-06-18T13:39:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you have to be able to open it.
[2021-06-18T13:39:22] Mirono escooters: Sunk it in isopropyl?🤷‍♂️
[2021-06-18T13:39:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: is it glued ?
[2021-06-18T13:39:24] Mirono escooters: Yes defenitely
[2021-06-18T13:39:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hidden screws ?
[2021-06-18T13:39:45] Unknown: Nope it's like

[2021-06-18T13:39:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: worse case : dremel
[2021-06-18T13:39:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and new case
[2021-06-18T13:40:07] Unknown: It's just a black, like epoxy thingy
[2021-06-18T13:40:11] Unknown: It's like dipped in it
[2021-06-18T13:40:14] Unknown: Solid black material
[2021-06-18T13:40:24] Unknown: I tried to cut the old one and everything it was so difficult
[2021-06-18T13:40:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ah ok ! it's "water glued"
[2021-06-18T13:41:00] Unknown: <photos/photo_384@18-06-2021_13-41-00.jpg>
[2021-06-18T13:41:04] Unknown: I used the hairdryer
[2021-06-18T13:41:14] Mirono escooters: Hope it keeps working
[2021-06-18T13:41:15] Unknown: And positioned the connectors facing the sky
[2021-06-18T13:41:21] Unknown: And blew the shit out of it

[2021-06-19T18:39:57] francois schempers: technically, if i change my battery, both my motor with the Ubox Vsec I could do 8500w burst, and 5000w sustained
[2021-06-19T18:40:18] Happy Giraffe: 1000w motor can do that?
[2021-06-19T18:40:56] francois schempers: 8000w is only 4kw per motor, only nominal x4
[2021-06-19T18:41:24] Happy Giraffe: And also foc more efficient
[2021-06-19T18:41:44] Happy Giraffe: On 5-10°c weather we can try to max it out haha
[2021-06-19T18:42:05] francois schempers: yup, I would only ever need that much power on acceleration, sustained speed should only use around 2000w
[2021-06-19T18:47:40] Happy Giraffe: 100A on 13s would be 5500w🤔
[2021-06-19T18:47:59] Happy Giraffe: Two batteries 6+7p should make it😂
[2021-06-19T18:48:31] Happy Giraffe: But even one xt90 might struggle with that

[2021-06-21T23:17:09] Happy Giraffe: How would these HIGO sensors work with vesc?
[2021-06-21T23:18:09] Unknown: Wottt
[2021-06-21T23:18:13] Unknown: These exist???
[2021-06-21T23:18:31] Unknown: 110€ wtf
[2021-06-21T23:18:38] Happy Giraffe: 4 piston😎
[2021-06-21T23:18:40] Unknown: I paid £60 for one magura fuck 110
[2021-06-21T23:22:36] Unknown: Ok I've seen specs...
[2021-06-21T23:22:39] Unknown: Maybe I'm tempted now
[2021-06-21T23:23:12] Unknown: I have magura mt sport rear... Maybe I put that on front and get this 4 piston ebrake on rear 👁️👁️
[2021-06-21T23:23:27] Happy Giraffe: Basically the same brake than in Rion but less fancier handle etc + ebrake
[2021-06-21T23:23:38] Unknown: But question is
[2021-06-21T23:23:47] Unknown: Is the ebrake on/off or do we have incremental values
[2021-06-21T23:24:15] Mirono escooters: My friend bought it So expensive lol
[2021-06-21T23:24:26] Mirono escooters: For the money I'd hope incrememntal
[2021-06-21T23:24:29] Happy Giraffe: Thats what we would need to ask from magura
[2021-06-21T23:24:42] Happy Giraffe: 110€ not so bad
[2021-06-21T23:26:33] Happy Giraffe: And if you dont like the brake, then maybe you could return it lol
[2021-06-21T23:30:04] Unknown: Bro
[2021-06-21T23:30:07] Unknown: It's JUST lever
[2021-06-21T23:30:11] Unknown: 110 just for lever
[2021-06-21T23:30:25] Unknown: No thanks I'll buy transistor and make my own DIY brake with glue wtf
[2021-06-21T23:31:07] Happy Giraffe: Nope👀
[2021-06-21T23:31:23] Happy Giraffe: Why would they then say the specs of the caliper etc
[2021-06-21T23:31:25] Luis Magalhaes: On off on that i think
[2021-06-21T23:31:46] Luis Magalhaes: No just switch 😂
[2021-06-21T23:32:00] Luis Magalhaes: No just switch
[2021-06-21T23:32:20] Mirono escooters: :(
[2021-06-21T23:32:38] Luis Magalhaes: I need to replace the front brake
[2021-06-21T23:33:33] Luis Magalhaes: The lever has a leak on the cilinder and i think the cable on the conection to the caliper has one too 😅
[2021-06-21T23:34:07] Happy Giraffe: I asked them and if its on/off only, would they make a linear for regen brake
[2021-06-21T23:34:14] Luis Magalhaes: Have zoom brakes would love to get some better ones and if they where progressive and not switch too
[2021-06-21T23:34:46] Luis Magalhaes: Im not even using electric brake in the ubox 😂
[2021-06-21T23:35:25] Happy Giraffe: Im never going to buy anything from Zoom again
[2021-06-21T23:35:45] Happy Giraffe: Xtech was a huge dissapointment as they rust and corrode/leak
[2021-06-21T23:35:51] Happy Giraffe: 3 calipers all gone
[2021-06-21T23:36:28] Luis Magalhaes: Its cheap and when its not leaking it.. brakes 😂
[2021-06-21T23:37:20] Happy Giraffe: Its same price than a magura tbh, I would need to buy 4 xtech to survive a year
[2021-06-21T23:37:56] Luis Magalhaes: The rear one have no problem but the front one has,but for the price i think i would buy a new one before a lost time repairing
[2021-06-21T23:38:45] Luis Magalhaes: Mine done more then 6000km before leaking 😅
[2021-06-21T23:39:07] Luis Magalhaes: Só for 25€ i think they are paid 😂
[2021-06-21T23:39:22] Luis Magalhaes: But they came with the scooter
[2021-06-21T23:39:55] Luis Magalhaes: The magura ones are not just bolt on in my scooter
[2021-06-21T23:40:05] Luis Magalhaes: They have to do some mods 😅
[2021-06-21T23:40:46] Luis Magalhaes: The Hope ones ar very good brakes too i think better then magura but not cheaper
[2021-06-21T23:41:13] Luis Magalhaes: I think rion will come with hope brakes in the next model
[2021-06-21T23:43:10] Happy Giraffe: Damn lucky
[2021-06-21T23:46:16] Unknown: In my opinion magura e brake is waste of momey
[2021-06-21T23:46:20] Unknown: 110-130 for s lever..
[2021-06-21T23:46:41] Happy Giraffe: Well thats 30€ extra
[2021-06-21T23:46:51] Happy Giraffe: But problem is lever seems to be on off
[2021-06-21T23:47:20] Happy Giraffe: It has this small button inside
[2021-06-21T23:47:31] Happy Giraffe: Maybe motor cutoff
[2021-06-21T23:47:44] Unknown: Yeah exactly
[2021-06-21T23:47:46] Unknown: No incremental
[2021-06-21T23:47:52] Unknown: I'd buy it for incremental
[2021-06-21T23:47:55] Unknown: But not for on off lol
[2021-06-21T23:48:02] Happy Giraffe: I asked them about making one lmao
[2021-06-21T23:48:04] Unknown: I'd rather get a brake throttle and slap it on my bars 😂😂😂😂😂
[2021-06-21T23:48:06] Artem Bulashev: Leveller should be 30€
[2021-06-21T23:48:22] Unknown: 130 u could get rear + front hydro system
[2021-06-21T23:48:25] Unknown: Good quality too
[2021-06-21T23:48:30] Unknown: Lever for 130 umm idk
[2021-06-21T23:48:40] Artem Bulashev: Yeap from good brand
[2021-06-21T23:48:53] Artem Bulashev: With dual piston callipers
[2021-06-21T23:49:01] Artem Bulashev: But without electric switch
[2021-06-21T23:49:11] Unknown: Ueah that's the thing lol
[2021-06-21T23:49:16] Happy Giraffe: Are there any good brakes with linear sensor?
[2021-06-21T23:49:17] Unknown: New tech = expensive
[2021-06-21T23:49:26] Unknown: This is the thing I want to do
[2021-06-21T23:49:50] Artem Bulashev: Shimano Deore m6100
[2021-06-21T23:49:58] Happy Giraffe: I will measure the Wheelway levers but they are cable😔
[2021-06-21T23:50:04] Artem Bulashev: Front and rear with tubes and all 150€ all up
[2021-06-21T23:50:05] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-21T23:50:49] Artem Bulashev: Amazing breaks, in every single test they perform up to 300€ breaks or close enough to not pay 2x more
[2021-06-21T23:51:01] Happy Giraffe: Hmmmm
[2021-06-21T23:51:15] Unknown: I can't find only cranks... Link?
[2021-06-21T23:52:45] Unknown: All these companies implementing sensor within lever. Wonder if anyone's thought of it within caliper 👁️👁️
[2021-06-21T23:52:56] Artem Bulashev: BR-M6100 single calliper
[2021-06-21T23:53:03] Artem Bulashev: BR-M6120 dual calliper
[2021-06-21T23:53:09] Artem Bulashev: Search for kit / set
[2021-06-21T23:54:14] Artem Bulashev: Single is 2 piston (dual side ) Dual is 4 piston (2 on dual side)
[2021-06-21T23:54:57] Artem Bulashev: https://www.bike24.com/p2379981.html
[2021-06-21T23:56:06] Artem Bulashev: https://www.bike24.de/p1379977.html 124€
[2021-06-21T23:56:13] Artem Bulashev: Single (dual side)
[2021-06-21T23:57:39] Unknown: Hm I wanna find some test vids
[2021-06-21T23:57:49] Unknown: Ebrake would be nice
[2021-06-21T23:57:53] Unknown: Recharge some batt haha
[2021-06-21T23:58:38] Artem Bulashev: DIY seems the only way until those big brands release something as good as for mtb but with potentiometer 🙃
[2021-06-21T23:59:24] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_414@21-06-2021_23-59-24.jpg>
[2021-06-21T23:59:54] Artem Bulashev: Glue an easy springing pot there ? Weld it? Or epoxy
[2021-06-22T00:00:26] Artem Bulashev: There is epoxy for metal called cold welding - may be very easy mod
[2021-06-22T00:01:44] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-06-22T00:02:10] Unknown: Yeah seems best way
[2021-06-22T00:02:27] Artem Bulashev: Or something with a small clock arrow
[2021-06-22T00:03:34] Happy Giraffe: I got that lol
[2021-06-22T00:04:53] Unknown: Explain this
[2021-06-22T00:04:55] Unknown: This too
[2021-06-22T00:04:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i've looked for hours for a simple system to add progressive electric brake on hydro brakes. i found none 😭😭
[2021-06-22T00:04:59] Unknown: I'm curious
[2021-06-22T00:05:12] Unknown: Like u said , sensor and magnet
[2021-06-22T00:05:27] Unknown: But that's why I think implementation within the caliper would be nice
[2021-06-22T00:06:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly. a system simple enought for anybody (no drilling on a >100€ lever 😅)
[2021-06-22T00:07:05] Unknown: Or potentially something within brake cable
[2021-06-22T00:07:27] Unknown: As u pull lever hydro fluid moves , moves a ball for example and that can give reading
[2021-06-22T00:07:35] Unknown: More complicated
[2021-06-22T00:07:40] Unknown: But would be cool
[2021-06-22T00:07:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is some analog pressure sensor to put on brake cables. but it's not working on full hydro
[2021-06-22T00:12:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://funkieo.blogspot.com/2020/01/brake-and-cut-off-power-signal-sensor.html?m=1
[2021-06-22T00:17:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: bit stupid on/off signal 😓
[2021-06-22T00:18:32] Artem Bulashev: This whole kit is 124€ and 170€ Handle is like 25-33€ I think
[2021-06-22T00:19:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_416@22-06-2021_00-19-09.jpg>
[2021-06-22T00:19:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_417@22-06-2021_00-19-09.jpg>
[2021-06-22T00:19:22] Artem Bulashev: The one I posted above - for 2 levellers - 2 callipers - hoses and it is pre bleeded even
[2021-06-22T00:19:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what do you call callipers ?
[2021-06-22T00:20:38] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_418@22-06-2021_00-20-38.jpg>
[2021-06-22T00:20:48] Artem Bulashev: Those
[2021-06-22T00:20:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok
[2021-06-22T00:21:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but levers doesn't have sensors, right ?
[2021-06-22T00:21:13] Artem Bulashev: No so need to make something
[2021-06-22T00:21:28] Artem Bulashev: But I’m ok with trying on 25-33€ lever
[2021-06-22T00:28:00] Artem Bulashev: Let's shop together on AliExpress with new user coupons Your US $2.00 in coupons are here! https://a.aliexpress.com/_AsOGKd
[2021-06-22T00:28:29] Happy Giraffe: Mechanical brakes😔
[2021-06-22T00:28:45] Artem Bulashev: This seems 14x15mm Hall effect pot
[2021-06-22T00:29:07] Artem Bulashev: Can be easy to implement, should rotate without drag unlike most pots
[2021-06-22T00:48:49] Artem Bulashev: oh
[2021-06-22T00:49:14] Artem Bulashev: goggle "position sensor" there is whole bunch of ideas
[2021-06-22T00:52:00] Luis Magalhaes: 207€ for the pair, magura 227€ for the pair but 4 pistons in front and 2 in rear caliper
[2021-06-22T00:52:31] Luis Magalhaes: better price 🤣👌
[2021-06-22T00:53:15] Luis Magalhaes: https://www.probikeshop.pt/par-de-travoes-shimano-deore-m6aa2-4-embolos-j-kit-sem-disco-2-2aa/201819.html

[2021-06-22T01:02:16] Artem Bulashev: but easiest seems to be a hall effect - tiny magnet on the break moving part + sensor
[2021-06-22T01:02:29] Artem Bulashev: example
[2021-06-22T01:03:33] Happy Giraffe: Some people duct taped two levers together, one had hydro and one was mechanical with sensor lmao
[2021-06-22T01:04:48] Artem Bulashev: no thank you, I believe in my brain more than that 😄😄😄
[2021-06-22T01:04:57] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-22T01:05:47] Happy Giraffe: If 2 hydro could be with one lever
[2021-06-22T01:06:18] Happy Giraffe: Then also two ebrake on over lever, but then no ability to change front and back balance
[2021-06-22T01:06:50] Artem Bulashev: VESC has one break input
[2021-06-22T01:07:32] Happy Giraffe: But the 10€ adc board
[2021-06-22T01:07:42] Artem Bulashev: yeah
[2021-06-22T01:07:51] Artem Bulashev: or smart dispay / controller
[2021-06-22T01:19:24] Artem Bulashev: interesting
[2021-06-22T01:19:32] Artem Bulashev: hall sensor is very easy to control

[2021-06-22T01:20:32] Artem Bulashev: resistance on ground will set where throttele starts so to speak adn resistance on positive will set max output voltage at full change
[2021-06-22T01:34:54] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_420@22-06-2021_01-34-54.jpg>
[2021-06-22T01:35:06] Artem Bulashev: Potentiometer looks hell a lot smoother
[2021-06-22T01:38:53] Happy Giraffe: What does Xiaomi lever use?
[2021-06-22T01:49:19] Artem Bulashev: button
[2021-06-22T01:49:22] Artem Bulashev: on off
[2021-06-22T01:49:25] Artem Bulashev: i think
[2021-06-22T01:53:15] Happy Giraffe: It has some range function tho
[2021-06-22T01:53:26] Happy Giraffe: Maybe 3 zone or something
[2021-06-22T03:25:36] francois schempers: nah Xiaomi is a range lever
[2021-06-22T03:26:57] Happy Giraffe: But poorly accurate in esc and cfw
[2021-06-22T03:27:05] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-22T03:34:11] francois schempers: when tested with Vesc calibration, i get a smooth value from mini to max voltage
[2021-06-22T03:40:22] Happy Giraffe: Seems I might need to keep xiaomi lever...even if its plastic. Need to measure wheelway ones tho
[2021-06-22T03:58:24] francois schempers: and the spinted one ?
[2021-06-22T03:59:26] Happy Giraffe: I think I dont get those
[2021-06-22T03:59:59] Happy Giraffe: If wheelway has linear then I keep those
[2021-06-22T08:59:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hall sensor with linear progressivity

[2021-06-22T13:17:51] Mirono escooters: Takes half of batteries space in mkfixit scoot
[2021-06-22T13:18:04] Mirono escooters: Guess ill stick with xiaomi
[2021-06-22T13:30:54] Happy Giraffe: How do I measure brake lever sensor?
[2021-06-22T13:31:23] Happy Giraffe: I tried all voltage settings on multimeter but doesnt show anything when pressef
[2021-06-22T13:31:39] Mirono escooters: U need 5v on it
[2021-06-22T13:31:44] Mirono escooters: And measure gnd and signal wire
[2021-06-22T13:32:05] Happy Giraffe: You got a Bayblade😂😂😂
[2021-06-22T13:32:19] Happy Giraffe: Yes there's only two wires haha
[2021-06-22T13:32:26] Happy Giraffe: I tried 9v and 3v
[2021-06-22T13:32:38] Mirono escooters: On wich ?
[2021-06-22T13:32:45] Happy Giraffe: Nothing
[2021-06-22T13:32:58] Happy Giraffe: Batt and DC
[2021-06-22T13:40:54] Happy Giraffe: Cant get any voltage reading at DC 2 volt setting ( one digit voltage)
[2021-06-22T14:06:25] francois schempers: so much waisted space, any wheel that isn't a motor is useless in my mind 🤣🤣
[2021-06-22T14:07:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-06-22T14:07:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: to be debated 😉
[2021-06-22T14:07:21] Happy Giraffe: Bruh😂
[2021-06-22T14:07:32] francois schempers: xD
[2021-06-22T15:08:15] Happy Giraffe: Did the 10mm axle fit on xiaomi rear fork?
[2021-06-22T15:08:42] Happy Giraffe: If not, do I need some other mods rather than drilling the hole bigger?👀
[2021-06-22T18:49:21] Luis Magalhaes: Well i was trying to configure a switch (brake) on adc2 with the 3.3v i used -15A motor and -5A battery and test it on air
[2021-06-22T18:49:37] Luis Magalhaes: It break the first time
[2021-06-22T18:49:47] Luis Magalhaes: The second it turned off the vesc
[2021-06-22T18:49:52] Luis Magalhaes: All shut down
[2021-06-22T18:50:51] Luis Magalhaes: Now it won't turn on on switch
[2021-06-22T18:51:15] Luis Magalhaes: I disconnected from battery and had to go out
[2021-06-22T18:51:47] Luis Magalhaes: Im afraid of conecting it bo battery again and it burst on fire like the other time
[2021-06-22T18:51:55] Luis Magalhaes: 🙈
[2021-06-22T18:57:29] Mirono escooters: Maybe it died due to regen spike. Happend to me too in air
[2021-06-22T18:58:08] Luis Magalhaes: Fuck
[2021-06-22T18:58:22] Luis Magalhaes: Even with only -20A?!
[2021-06-22T18:58:30] Mirono escooters: Voltage spike yes
[2021-06-22T18:58:45] Mirono escooters: The spike has almost nothing to do with A setting
[2021-06-22T18:59:13] Mirono escooters: Is urs the same as @koxx3 ? His one died due to it too? Wasnt it something about not enough filtering
[2021-06-22T18:59:17] Luis Magalhaes: Dam.. should not turn that shit on
[2021-06-22T18:59:20] francois schempers: the spike depends on how well your battery can handle A
[2021-06-22T18:59:28] Mirono escooters: Also
[2021-06-22T18:59:30] Mirono escooters: And capacitors
[2021-06-22T18:59:55] Luis Magalhaes: Its a 16P battery 😅
[2021-06-22T19:00:24] Luis Magalhaes: Is any way to test it before conecting to battery?
[2021-06-22T19:00:35] francois schempers: if you have a big battery that have fast charge, you could handle some braking power because you have something to mitigate backEmf, it's maybe 16p but what's the max charge of your bms before cutoff ?
[2021-06-22T19:00:37] Mirono escooters: Heres a possibility Bms shutted off Esc died Same can happen in xiaomi controller . Hence y ebrake w 100% batt isnt working anymore after update
[2021-06-22T19:00:43] Luis Magalhaes: Dont need to burn another battery...
[2021-06-22T19:00:56] Mirono escooters: I dont suspect battery
[2021-06-22T19:01:36] Luis Magalhaes: But that should be the ubox cut first i was using 5A
[2021-06-22T19:01:38] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2021-06-22T19:02:08] Luis Magalhaes: It was not 100% bat too
[2021-06-22T19:02:46] Luis Magalhaes: I will test if the bms is shut off first then but dont think 😅
[2021-06-22T19:03:10] Luis Magalhaes: Just don't want it to burst on fire again dam
[2021-06-22T19:03:32] Luis Magalhaes: The first time it was a similar issue
[2021-06-22T19:03:59] Luis Magalhaes: Then when i disconnected and connected the battery again it burst on fire
[2021-06-22T19:04:04] francois schempers: the problem with backEmf, is that you can't just cut of when you don't want it anymore, the harder you cut it off, the higher the Vspike, that's why it's a complicated thing to manage
[2021-06-22T19:04:43] Luis Magalhaes: Dam.. why the fuck i turn that shit on..
[2021-06-22T19:05:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1000
[2021-06-22T19:05:53] Luis Magalhaes: Had sent an email to spintend, maybe they have an idea to what i can do yo test if won't burn
[2021-06-22T19:06:03] Luis Magalhaes: 😭
[2021-06-22T19:06:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we made some tests with @Foujiwara ... first we burned his power supply with a burst
[2021-06-22T19:06:24] Mirono escooters: I need ebrake Tho. My only way of stopping lol
[2021-06-22T19:06:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: then we burned a esc.
[2021-06-22T19:06:36] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi controllers handles it good with 3 additionele caps. Lol
[2021-06-22T19:07:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we mesured the backemf, it was twice the voltage we injected !
[2021-06-22T19:07:49] Artem Bulashev: Up on what?
[2021-06-22T19:07:54] Luis Magalhaes: Dam.. we'll i think i did good not putting the 300A firmware loosing warranty 😅 lets see if this shit if cover by it or not
[2021-06-22T19:07:57] Artem Bulashev: What caused such spike?
[2021-06-22T19:08:11] Luis Magalhaes: If its not i wont by another ubox this time
[2021-06-22T19:08:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: xiaomi mod for 100v
[2021-06-22T19:08:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: braking
[2021-06-22T19:08:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: gné
[2021-06-22T19:08:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: te voila toi 😁😁
[2021-06-22T19:09:09] Artem Bulashev: Oh haha
[2021-06-22T19:09:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i explained how we burned your power supply with xiaomi esc tests and braking voltage spikes 😁
[2021-06-22T19:09:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Ben tu m'identifie
[2021-06-22T19:09:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: XD
[2021-06-22T19:09:27] Artem Bulashev: Battery breaking should be set to Ah of battery at most
[2021-06-22T19:09:46] Artem Bulashev: Breaking of controller that value + 15amps
[2021-06-22T19:10:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: braking current is not really the issue if i understood the problem
[2021-06-22T19:10:22] Artem Bulashev: But bmw cutting out
[2021-06-22T19:10:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-06-22T19:10:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that have no link
[2021-06-22T19:10:42] Artem Bulashev: Due to voltage spike you suspect ?
[2021-06-22T19:11:21] Happy Giraffe: How can we then limit back emf? With really small current like -5A?
[2021-06-22T19:11:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: voltage drop because a laboratory power supply has no resistance
[2021-06-22T19:12:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: stoping the current flow in 'motor' mode (throttle engaged) transform the motor to a generator. and this generator can generate high voltage. i'm sorry, i don't know why, but we clearly measured much higher back voltage than injected voltage
[2021-06-22T19:12:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @Foujiwara , can you explain it better than me ?
[2021-06-22T19:13:15] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: explain what?
[2021-06-22T19:13:19] Luis Magalhaes: I used 5A to battery should i use the battery amps?!
[2021-06-22T19:13:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: why we were able to observe such high voltage (higher than injected voltage)
[2021-06-22T19:13:57] Luis Magalhaes: I was trying to go slow not to burn something
[2021-06-22T19:14:01] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's requiert have électricité notion
[2021-06-22T19:14:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: well, laplace force, what else ?
[2021-06-22T19:15:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 1A,10,100A don't have link, if the power supply have not résistance, when you will brake or kers, immediately the voltage will drop
[2021-06-22T19:15:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: the different with 1A or 100A it's the speed when the voltage will drop
[2021-06-22T19:16:16] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 1ms or 500ms...
[2021-06-22T19:17:15] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: on our timescale it's instantaneous
[2021-06-22T19:17:36] francois schempers: shorting backemf, I have some video explaining it, let me search for them
[2021-06-22T19:17:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: what's the topic @koxx3
[2021-06-22T19:18:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: suspected burned vesc with electric braking on battery
[2021-06-22T19:19:04] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you?
[2021-06-22T19:19:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no 😅
[2021-06-22T19:19:32] francois schempers: https://youtu.be/yO9xIVv8ryc
[2021-06-22T19:19:44] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: if the battery have reverse current protection it's possible
[2021-06-22T19:19:59] francois schempers: not exactly the same motor, but electrical principle are explained
[2021-06-22T19:23:08] Luis Magalhaes: Me 😭
[2021-06-22T19:23:57] francois schempers: @koxx3 @artBula watch the video at around 4:30 he explain everything
[2021-06-22T19:24:08] Luis Magalhaes: @Foujiwara it shut off and no signal when i push the button to turn it on..
[2021-06-22T19:30:05] francois schempers: at 8:30 it explain the backemf on shutdown
[2021-06-22T19:57:53] Luis Magalhaes: It should shutdown before burn 😂😂
[2021-06-22T19:58:15] Luis Magalhaes: I think o will wait for spintend response before i plug in the vesc agai..
[2021-06-22T19:58:22] Luis Magalhaes: Again😅
[2021-06-22T19:58:47] francois schempers: what we are explaining is it can't, shutting down would means huge surges
[2021-06-22T19:59:03] francois schempers: watch the video, it explain it
[2021-06-22T20:07:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i know the guy, but never seen this video. interesting !
[2021-06-22T20:08:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but with a controller the motor stop is controlled and the mosfet diodes should avoid the spikes. i.don't understand why we still have those spikes
[2021-06-22T20:09:54] francois schempers: continue watching, those avoid the negative spike, but not the one created by an unsuited drain aka the power supply or the battery
[2021-06-22T20:10:16] Luis Magalhaes: Yes im understanding 😅 bms did not shut down its still on
[2021-06-22T20:10:47] Luis Magalhaes: But maybe because it was limited to 5A battery could cause bigger emf?!
[2021-06-22T20:11:59] Luis Magalhaes: Mesure the voltage in ubox xt60 it had 1.5v residual and its going down as i measure
[2021-06-22T20:12:14] Luis Magalhaes: Should be the condenser's?
[2021-06-22T20:17:17] Luis Magalhaes: One more thing diferent about the first ubox that burned, after it turned down it was warmer at the case this was cold
[2021-06-22T20:17:36] Luis Magalhaes: It could have died any way 😂
[2021-06-22T20:18:04] Luis Magalhaes: Just want to test in a way that nothing got on fire 😅
[2021-06-22T20:28:58] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2021-06-22T20:29:09] Luis Magalhaes: Is it normal to measure this resistance in ubox input?
[2021-06-22T20:29:33] Luis Magalhaes: Stoped at 19.86kohm
[2021-06-22T20:29:42] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_429@22-06-2021_20-29-42.jpg>
[2021-06-22T20:31:01] Luis Magalhaes: Do you guys think its safe to plug in battery?
[2021-06-22T20:36:41] Luis Magalhaes: And one more thing maybe you guys can help, i tried to turn in the smart bms the discharge mosfet on while pluged on vesc and it gives me a error precharge failed, had to turn it on first and then plug it to ubox is any way to correct this?
[2021-06-22T21:11:42] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2021-06-22T21:11:48] Luis Magalhaes: Its on with 8v but blinking red in led 1 and 4
[2021-06-22T21:11:58] Luis Magalhaes: Undervoltage is the error i saw
[2021-06-22T21:12:09] Luis Magalhaes: Conected by the phone
[2021-06-22T21:16:31] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2021-06-22T21:16:34] Luis Magalhaes: 15v
[2021-06-22T21:17:11] Mirono escooters: Wich battery?
[2021-06-22T21:26:20] Luis Magalhaes: Lipo 4s
[2021-06-22T21:26:31] Luis Magalhaes: Now with 35ah 16S is on
[2021-06-22T21:26:38] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_430@22-06-2021_21-26-38.jpg>
[2021-06-22T21:26:48] Luis Magalhaes: Had to adjust the pre charge to 40A
[2021-06-22T21:26:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-06-22T21:26:54] Luis Magalhaes: So it can pass the test
[2021-06-22T21:27:14] Luis Magalhaes: Well no its on but don't know if its ok 😅
[2021-06-22T21:30:36] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_431@22-06-2021_21-30-36.jpg>
[2021-06-22T21:30:51] Luis Magalhaes: The aluminium plates i used from the minimotors
[2021-06-22T21:31:14] Luis Magalhaes: Those 2 long bolts had the ubox secure 😁
[2021-06-22T21:32:55] Luis Magalhaes: Will do the foam mod 😅its out so why not..
[2021-06-22T21:40:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I watched all the video, and we don't talking about it, we talking about another think not explained here
[2021-06-22T21:44:48] Luis Magalhaes: So about the regen brake what specs should i use? But i think i will not use it any more 😂
[2021-06-22T22:05:29] Artem Bulashev: I have said above - battery regen = battery mah - controller reverb = battery Mah + 15amps This way 50ah battery will be charged at 1c (50a) at most and controller will take 15amps at most from both channel to spread as heat above what battery can manage The less the safer
[2021-06-22T22:26:35] Luis Magalhaes: So let me see if i understand, should use 15A or less in each motor?
[2021-06-22T22:26:57] Luis Magalhaes: And 25A max in battery regen for each controller?
[2021-06-22T22:27:06] Luis Magalhaes: For a battery os 50ah
[2021-06-22T22:27:14] Artem Bulashev: Total
[2021-06-22T22:27:33] Artem Bulashev: Well I think fets on each side can take 10amps safely for sure
[2021-06-22T22:27:42] Artem Bulashev: Start with 25 battery on each
[2021-06-22T22:27:52] Artem Bulashev: And 35 controller breaking on each
[2021-06-22T22:28:04] Artem Bulashev: See how it feels and how is the fet temp
[2021-06-22T22:30:19] Luis Magalhaes: Well i think i will not test for now 😅
[2021-06-22T22:30:44] Luis Magalhaes: Qill do the mod and test the controller to see if its working ok first
[2021-06-22T22:30:57] francois schempers: oh okey, i though it was sayed a some point, long time since i watched through the video, but I like the channel, it's a good vulgarisation channel
[2021-06-22T22:31:13] Luis Magalhaes: I wanted a soft ebrake because i was using just a dum switch
[2021-06-22T22:31:22] Luis Magalhaes: And it will be all or nothing 😅
[2021-06-23T00:21:15] Artem Bulashev: I just realized that new Pro version will be - dual - 100v awesome for that back emf voltage stability - 5 12v outputs! Perfect number 1. Turn signal L 2. Turn signal R 3. Break light 4. Front light 5. Horn - I know for fact it will do 150amps phase at least, maybe more - all st about same size 🤓
[2021-06-23T00:23:36] Happy Giraffe: Oh shit, thats cool. I realized I only have about 8x8cm space for single vesc🙈
[2021-06-23T00:27:32] Artem Bulashev: Would any one prefer to have external (extended usb), rather than on board USB port ? My reasons - can place it to convenient place - can have it outside while testing even with deck closed and vesc inside - after configuring usb is not needed almost ever - allow for smaller design because usb pointing up, take a lot of hight
[2021-06-23T00:27:59] Artem Bulashev: Oh man 😂 go for two layers of singe 100v version
[2021-06-23T00:28:29] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_433@23-06-2021_00-28-29.jpg>
[2021-06-23T00:38:16] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 https://t.me/vsett_eu_us_ENGLISH_mods_hacks People are looking into your things with excitement 🙃👌
[2021-06-23T00:40:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Those are shit brakes discs :/
[2021-06-23T00:41:00] Artem Bulashev: Cheap Chinese , but they are okeyish
[2021-06-23T00:41:21] Artem Bulashev: Unless I missed something
[2021-06-23T00:41:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Basic Shimano brakes discs are even better
[2021-06-23T00:41:33] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-06-23T00:41:43] Happy Giraffe: I got only one motor👀
[2021-06-23T00:42:09] Artem Bulashev: Than nothing to worry about perfect one will be out by end of month it seems
[2021-06-23T00:42:25] Artem Bulashev: 100v single I mean from Spintend
[2021-06-23T00:43:04] Happy Giraffe: Fits in 8x8cm?
[2021-06-23T00:43:11] Artem Bulashev: Sort of
[2021-06-23T00:43:23] Artem Bulashev: 85 x 54
[2021-06-23T00:43:29] Artem Bulashev: Is what they said
[2021-06-23T00:43:31] Happy Giraffe: Lets hope so, I put tires today in 1000w motor already etc.👀
[2021-06-23T00:43:45] Artem Bulashev: I think that’s with mounts
[2021-06-23T00:43:58] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_434@23-06-2021_00-43-58.jpg>
[2021-06-23T00:45:32] Happy Giraffe: Should fit, I can drill a hole to closer in frame also it seems
[2021-06-23T00:46:40] Happy Giraffe: Here the plastic part will be metal casing in ready product?
[2021-06-23T01:14:52] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_435@23-06-2021_01-14-52.jpg>

[2021-06-23T01:14:53] Face de Pin Sucé: Shit
[2021-06-23T01:14:58] Face de Pin Sucé: Was going to test
[2021-06-23T01:15:14] Face de Pin Sucé: But I forgot my deck at my friend's house yesterday :'(
[2021-06-23T01:15:18] Artem Bulashev: Yes of course it is prototype
[2021-06-23T01:15:28] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2021-06-23T01:15:44] Artem Bulashev: Stand on metal frame 👌
[2021-06-23T01:16:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Not okay, I tried, but it's Dualtron Spider, shittiest frame ever
[2021-06-23T01:16:14] Face de Pin Sucé: It moves under my feet when I stand on it
[2021-06-23T01:16:21] Artem Bulashev: Holly shit
[2021-06-23T01:16:26] Artem Bulashev: For real???
[2021-06-23T01:16:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah
[2021-06-23T01:16:36] Face de Pin Sucé: It needs deck to be rigid
[2021-06-23T01:16:37] Artem Bulashev: 😂
[2021-06-23T01:16:59] Artem Bulashev: Man I’m happy I went vsett
[2021-06-23T01:17:23] Artem Bulashev: Ain’t perfect but they didn’t compromise a dime where it matters the most
[2021-06-23T01:18:31] Face de Pin Sucé: I'd never buy a Dualtron Spider honestly, I bought this one because it is limited, so 60V24Ah, 220km, owner burnt both motors and controllers in a hill 😂 he bought a new one and sold me this one for 300€
[2021-06-23T01:18:39] Face de Pin Sucé: That's not even the cost of the battery
[2021-06-23T01:19:29] Face de Pin Sucé: So I putted my 3500W motors on it, high kV and going to reach, maybe 80-85kmh in 10", we'll know soon
[2021-06-23T01:19:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Then I sell it 😁
[2021-06-23T01:20:13] Artem Bulashev: Nice that’s what vsett10+ reaches as well 82kmh For that price it’s a steal 👌👌
[2021-06-23T01:20:39] Face de Pin Sucé: 82Kmh vsett 10+ ? That's good !
[2021-06-23T01:25:24] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-06-23T01:25:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Do you have one ?
[2021-06-23T01:25:44] Artem Bulashev: In turbo mode for 2 min. Than cool down timer for 5min
[2021-06-23T01:25:55] Artem Bulashev: Without it goes 77kmh
[2021-06-23T02:18:30] Happy Giraffe: How do you guys measure e-lever voltage? Setting single digits dc voltages should do it right?
[2021-06-23T08:16:16] Luis Magalhaes: Great deal 😅
[2021-06-23T08:59:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nice !
[2021-06-23T09:01:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeaahhhh :D
[2021-06-23T12:37:12] Unknown: Where :p
[2021-06-23T13:10:37] Face de Pin Sucé: 5 min of Uox ride
[2021-06-23T13:11:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Too many people on road, can't have a long straight line :/
[2021-06-23T13:11:08] Face de Pin Sucé: (video uploading)
[2021-06-23T13:13:31] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2021-06-23T14:25:30] Luis Magalhaes: 💪💪
[2021-06-23T14:26:03] Luis Magalhaes: What are you using as setting's to motor and battery?
[2021-06-23T16:13:46] Mirono escooters: On the traces
[2021-06-23T16:30:31] Artem Bulashev: Wow
[2021-06-23T16:30:41] Artem Bulashev: That’s some crazy récupération current!!
[2021-06-23T16:30:49] Artem Bulashev: What are your settings??
[2021-06-23T16:31:59] Artem Bulashev: And your battery sag is insane 😂😂 what battery you have ??
[2021-06-23T16:32:26] Artem Bulashev: According to what you showed you are about to blow up either controller or battery or BMS
[2021-06-23T18:31:33] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2021-06-23T18:32:05] Luis Magalhaes: Working again, no electronic brake its off 😅😂
[2021-06-23T18:36:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i love battery going from 60% to 10% when current is at 200A 🤣
[2021-06-23T18:36:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 260A ! nice !!
[2021-06-23T18:43:07] Luis Magalhaes: It doesn't like the ebrake 😂
[2021-06-23T18:45:44] Happy Giraffe: Do you know if these "brake line" is usually an ebrake or just a cutoff?
[2021-06-23T18:46:06] Happy Giraffe: And yes, I try this shit until VESC😂🙈
[2021-06-23T18:51:18] Luis Magalhaes: It depends, some have brake but most chinese have cut off 😂
[2021-06-23T18:52:02] Happy Giraffe: Basically cutoff not needed if I just take throttle off🙈
[2021-06-23T18:52:14] Happy Giraffe: As its not a pedal sensor ebike
[2021-06-23T18:53:06] Happy Giraffe: I just need a simple 20-25kmh ride until vesc
[2021-06-23T19:10:12] Luis Magalhaes: Test it 😁
[2021-06-23T19:11:18] Happy Giraffe: Will do, need to fight to reverse the Monorim fork first😂
[2021-06-23T19:48:11] Face de Pin Sucé: 150A phase per channel 35A battery per channel
[2021-06-23T19:48:26] Face de Pin Sucé: A shitty original battery from Dualtron Spider
[2021-06-23T19:48:50] Face de Pin Sucé: It's phase current :)
[2021-06-23T19:49:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i know 😉
[2021-06-23T19:49:48] Face de Pin Sucé: 100A per motor for regen and 15A battery for regen
[2021-06-23T19:56:53] Luis Magalhaes: 150A ? Are you using the 300A firmware?
[2021-06-23T20:00:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Sorry I said shit, I putted 135A motor
[2021-06-23T20:01:03] Luis Magalhaes: Ok 😂
[2021-06-23T20:01:15] Luis Magalhaes: Im using 130A
[2021-06-23T20:02:32] Luis Magalhaes: It was hitting the absolute current limit, had to tweak the pid control but now if i try the 135A it goes again to the abs limit
[2021-06-23T20:12:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Okay, good to know, It didn't hit abs over current, I putted 180A
[2021-06-23T20:21:52] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i use 180A too
[2021-06-23T21:53:34] Artem Bulashev: Are you nuts? 😄😄😄
[2021-06-23T21:54:04] Artem Bulashev: Because your battery doesn’t allow
[2021-06-23T21:55:44] Artem Bulashev: This basically = to 170amps of regen that need to be dispersed via fets in form of heat! 😂😂
[2021-06-23T21:56:07] Artem Bulashev: I’m not sure it is very good use of fets
[2021-06-23T22:14:54] Luis Magalhaes: Its handling better then mine had 😂😂
[2021-06-23T23:25:49] Face de Pin Sucé: it's working fine haha
[2021-06-23T23:25:58] Face de Pin Sucé: just need some airflow
[2021-06-25T01:14:28] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 man - addressable led
[2021-06-25T01:14:31] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_438@25-06-2021_01-14-31.jpg>
[2021-06-25T01:15:26] Artem Bulashev: I will run a strip of addressable leds all around the deck = one output of esp can control (front, break lights, turn signal, and even party mode)
[2021-06-25T01:15:32] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁
[2021-06-25T01:16:10] Artem Bulashev: It is coded as led #1 color brightness
[2021-06-25T01:16:22] Artem Bulashev: So you control each led individually 🙂👍
[2021-06-25T09:18:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i know those leds.😁
[2021-06-25T21:37:30] Happy Giraffe: My motor suddenly started to do these pulses when riding. Acceleration is not smooth anymore, do you think its the hall sensor wire maybe loose?👀
[2021-06-25T21:37:44] Happy Giraffe: Freeride is smooth
[2021-06-25T21:37:55] Mirono escooters: Is speed reading correct?
[2021-06-25T21:38:12] Happy Giraffe: Somewhat correct, I saw a little weird things there
[2021-06-25T21:38:29] Happy Giraffe: Like jumped once from 25 to 18kmh at stable speed🤔
[2021-06-25T21:38:57] Happy Giraffe: After that it showed ok but pulsing continued
[2021-06-25T21:39:07] Mirono escooters: My friends motor 😬
[2021-06-25T21:39:09] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2021-06-25T21:39:17] Mirono escooters: No idea how this happend. All 3 loose at same time
[2021-06-25T21:39:27] Mirono escooters: So thats defo a hall sensor
[2021-06-25T21:39:35] Mirono escooters: Same kinda behaviour
[2021-06-25T21:39:36] Happy Giraffe: I hope it's the cable
[2021-06-25T21:40:04] Happy Giraffe: Because they use these chinese plastic connectors
[2021-06-25T21:40:18] Mirono escooters: Oh lol
[2021-06-25T21:40:19] Mirono escooters: Shitty
[2021-06-25T21:40:31] Happy Giraffe: I solder them now...
[2021-06-25T21:41:05] Happy Giraffe: Thanks for the input
[2021-06-25T21:41:31] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_439@25-06-2021_21-41-31.jpg>
[2021-06-25T21:41:47] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-25T21:42:07] Happy Giraffe: Will open the scooter and solder. Then we will see if it goes away
[2021-06-25T21:42:08] Mirono escooters: Oh haha those. I solder all my connections
[2021-06-25T21:42:27] Unknown: This extender looks nasty
[2021-06-25T21:42:31] Happy Giraffe: I tried to be lazy as they needed to work only for one week
[2021-06-25T21:42:53] Happy Giraffe: It works fine haha, will make a new one now
[2021-06-25T21:43:29] Happy Giraffe: First time for me to solder these small shitty parallel wires
[2021-06-25T23:52:08] Tudor: Happens a lot with 350motoe
[2021-06-26T03:25:16] Happy Giraffe: Wasnt hall
[2021-06-26T03:25:21] Happy Giraffe: Its the damn throttle
[2021-06-26T03:25:39] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_440@26-06-2021_03-25-39.jpg>
[2021-06-26T03:26:03] Happy Giraffe: These will work, but how in the hell a throttle goes kaboom? Display works fine etc
[2021-06-26T06:00:49] francois schempers: lmao x) isn't it just the crappy esc ?
[2021-06-26T06:03:44] Happy Giraffe: Its a cute 22A esc, pls dont hurt its feelings
[2021-06-26T06:04:07] Happy Giraffe: I will defo buy spintend throttle, Im done with these Zero shits
[2021-06-26T08:36:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Morning ride
[2021-06-26T08:40:34] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2021-06-26T09:17:28] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know if Spintend make any throttles :)
[2021-06-26T09:22:15] francois schempers: they do
[2021-06-26T17:32:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hello guys !
[2021-06-26T17:33:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I finally mounted the VESC in my DT mini with a key loop
[2021-06-26T17:33:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: when motor is in free spinning (chair), eveything is fine
[2021-06-26T17:33:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: as soon a the tires touch the ground, almost no torque
[2021-06-26T17:33:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: here are my settings :
[2021-06-26T17:33:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_441@26-06-2021_17-33-42.jpg>
[2021-06-26T17:33:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_442@26-06-2021_17-33-55.jpg>
[2021-06-26T17:34:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_443@26-06-2021_17-34-15.jpg>
[2021-06-26T17:34:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_444@26-06-2021_17-34-26.jpg>
[2021-06-26T17:34:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_445@26-06-2021_17-34-47.jpg>
[2021-06-26T17:34:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_446@26-06-2021_17-34-57.jpg>
[2021-06-26T17:35:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 3 things :
[2021-06-26T17:35:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1/ yes, my current is low, but I don't think it's the issue because the torque is "hashed" (I'll try to make a video)
[2021-06-26T17:35:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 2/ yes use BLDC, but I try FOC with the same result
[2021-06-26T17:36:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 3/ I run it sensoless (DT mini motor doesn't have sensor). I can feel the struggle to start (without push), but it should be an issue once the wheel is spinning
[2021-06-26T17:36:59] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂
[2021-06-26T17:37:04] Artem Bulashev: Motor current 40a
[2021-06-26T17:37:06] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-06-26T17:37:18] Artem Bulashev: What is your wheel nominal power
[2021-06-26T17:37:20] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-06-26T17:37:34] Artem Bulashev: What vesc is that?
[2021-06-26T17:37:47] Face de Pin Sucé: 40A is not enough, but did you do the BLDC detection ?
[2021-06-26T17:38:06] Artem Bulashev: BLDC detection doesn’t give correct values
[2021-06-26T17:38:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, I did the motor detection
[2021-06-26T17:38:30] Face de Pin Sucé: It does, what do you mean ?
[2021-06-26T17:38:39] Artem Bulashev: For amps
[2021-06-26T17:38:43] Artem Bulashev: Limits
[2021-06-26T17:38:49] Artem Bulashev: It is not made for that
[2021-06-26T17:39:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-06-26T17:39:08] Artem Bulashev: It is made for detecting phases and flux and so on
[2021-06-26T17:39:10] Artem Bulashev: So
[2021-06-26T17:39:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2021-06-26T17:39:25] Artem Bulashev: What nominal power on motor?
[2021-06-26T17:39:30] Artem Bulashev: What vesc you use ?
[2021-06-26T17:39:43] Artem Bulashev: What battery specs and what cells ?
[2021-06-26T17:39:55] Artem Bulashev: Than I can give you best your system can manage
[2021-06-26T17:40:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nominal power : don't remember, but I pushed 40A battery with the DT mini controller
[2021-06-26T17:40:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: flipsky 7550
[2021-06-26T17:40:25] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2021-06-26T17:40:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 14s
[2021-06-26T17:40:27] Face de Pin Sucé: I think you should increase phase amps to 60A at least
[2021-06-26T17:40:30] Artem Bulashev: That’s too small for you
[2021-06-26T17:40:33] Artem Bulashev: 7550
[2021-06-26T17:40:54] Artem Bulashev: My 650w motors can take 90amps phase
[2021-06-26T17:41:01] Artem Bulashev: With 30amps battery
[2021-06-26T17:41:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you heared the sound ? it's like it strongly limit something
[2021-06-26T17:41:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, I'll push the phase amps
[2021-06-26T17:41:39] Face de Pin Sucé: BLDC from VESC gives very bad noise everytime I use it
[2021-06-26T17:41:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: since I don't have BLE on this VESC, it's boring to plug USB...
[2021-06-26T17:42:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, I'll switch to FOC
[2021-06-26T17:42:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes or try to tweak switching frequency
[2021-06-26T17:42:47] Artem Bulashev: Do that
[2021-06-26T17:42:53] Artem Bulashev: Set phase current 90
[2021-06-26T17:42:56] Artem Bulashev: Minimum
[2021-06-26T17:43:00] Artem Bulashev: Battery 40
[2021-06-26T17:43:08] Artem Bulashev: Absolute 150
[2021-06-26T17:43:52] Face de Pin Sucé: I think he tries to recreate the original power of Dualtron Mini
[2021-06-26T17:44:35] Artem Bulashev: This controller too weak
[2021-06-26T17:44:56] Artem Bulashev: You need about 110amps phase to re create 750w nominal motors
[2021-06-26T17:45:24] Artem Bulashev: Controller is 50amps nominal 160 instantaneous
[2021-06-26T17:45:37] Artem Bulashev: So 90amps phase it should handle
[2021-06-26T17:45:49] Artem Bulashev: But I would not push more
[2021-06-26T17:46:04] Artem Bulashev: Specially because that vesc us known to fail in a matter of days
[2021-06-26T17:47:02] Artem Bulashev: Also esc really doesn’t like sensorless generaly speaking
[2021-06-26T17:47:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2021-06-26T17:47:48] Artem Bulashev: Hope it works out better than for me (I tried senserless in my sensors wheel, it was not great at all)
[2021-06-26T17:47:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_447@26-06-2021_17-47-55.jpg>
[2021-06-26T17:48:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is definetly something wrong
[2021-06-26T17:48:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: like if one phase was missing
[2021-06-26T17:48:46] Artem Bulashev: Try get above 10kmh slowly very
[2021-06-26T17:48:58] Artem Bulashev: Than you will be able to accelerate to full without that noise
[2021-06-26T17:49:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's much better if Islightly increase the speed
[2021-06-26T17:49:14] Artem Bulashev: It is controller unable to detect phase correctly to sync
[2021-06-26T17:49:38] Artem Bulashev: Yes because senored only used 0-12kmh aprox
[2021-06-26T17:49:48] Artem Bulashev: After that vesc goes sensorless any way
[2021-06-26T17:50:06] Artem Bulashev: Because emf is clear enough to read on its own
[2021-06-26T17:50:18] Artem Bulashev: So no sensors needed any longer
[2021-06-26T17:50:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so much ???
[2021-06-26T17:50:24] Artem Bulashev: I think so
[2021-06-26T17:50:26] Artem Bulashev: May be 7
[2021-06-26T17:50:31] Artem Bulashev: I don’t remember
[2021-06-26T17:50:37] Artem Bulashev: Also depends on wheel dia
[2021-06-26T17:50:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: open loop switch is at 300 erpm
[2021-06-26T17:51:03] Artem Bulashev: There we go
[2021-06-26T17:51:22] Artem Bulashev: Try to play with other motor settings
[2021-06-26T17:52:14] Artem Bulashev: 90/40/150amps are good for your controller / motors. Not sure about battery. What battery you have ?
[2021-06-26T17:52:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I thing I should try a factory reset first
[2021-06-26T17:52:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I've been playing with this configuration for tool long
[2021-06-26T17:53:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: how can I clear all the settings ?
[2021-06-26T17:53:43] Artem Bulashev: Yes re doing motor detection after re set May give a lot better result once motor is warmed up
[2021-06-26T17:54:12] Artem Bulashev: Just run motor guide again
[2021-06-26T17:54:18] Artem Bulashev: It will over ride
[2021-06-26T17:55:16] Artem Bulashev: But do expect to have to Kick start with a good kick 🦵😉
[2021-06-26T17:55:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, I like kick start, but pushing up to 12 km/h will clearly be an issue 😂😂
[2021-06-26T17:56:51] Artem Bulashev: 300rpm
[2021-06-26T17:56:56] Artem Bulashev: On 254mm wheel
[2021-06-26T17:57:02] Artem Bulashev: 14.36kmh
[2021-06-26T17:57:08] Artem Bulashev: So I was right
[2021-06-26T17:57:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ~200 mm wheel for me (8.5 inches)
[2021-06-26T17:57:40] Artem Bulashev: 11.3 kmh
[2021-06-26T18:00:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2021-06-26T18:00:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_448@26-06-2021_18-00-32.jpg>
[2021-06-26T18:06:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it seems good, but the cracking noise at the end of the acceleration test is weird
[2021-06-26T18:22:45] Artem Bulashev: That is known as desync
[2021-06-26T18:23:04] Artem Bulashev: I dot. Think there is any way without it on sensorless foc
[2021-06-26T22:39:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I seriously think there a power stage issue. as soon as current is required, it's like if a transistor wasn't able to give power to one of the phases. or a fucked up shunt/current sensor... I see some weird things in phases current real-time datas.
[2021-06-26T22:39:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I also tried HFI, same issue
[2021-06-26T22:39:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: even during detection, there is some weird noises
[2021-06-26T22:40:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: like at 7 sec in this video
[2021-06-26T22:40:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: tomorrow, I'll try to use the power stage of the other 7550... we'll see ...
[2021-06-26T22:59:11] Artem Bulashev: What you mean?
[2021-06-26T22:59:48] Artem Bulashev: Have you come up with anything with Spintend to mutually benefit ?
[2021-06-26T23:00:00] Luis Magalhaes: im using sensorless in mine
[2021-06-26T23:00:08] Artem Bulashev: Cool didn’t know
[2021-06-26T23:00:20] Artem Bulashev: But Ubox not flipsky?
[2021-06-26T23:00:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i have this 7550 acting weird, and another with the logic board dead. i'll mix the 2 to get one working... i hope
[2021-06-26T23:02:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: haven't tried. i'm not sure to want 'selling' my project to a company. and the spinted is not adapted for my dt mini. it's too big and won't easily fit. i would need their next single core vesc.
[2021-06-26T23:03:01] Luis Magalhaes: i just "kick start" for my setup without halls
[2021-06-26T23:03:09] Luis Magalhaes: yes ubox
[2021-06-26T23:03:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i do too. but even after, no torque, really weird noise.
[2021-06-26T23:04:05] Luis Magalhaes: strange there should be something wrong mayve
[2021-06-26T23:04:07] Luis Magalhaes: maybe
[2021-06-26T23:04:12] Artem Bulashev: No not to sell but May be they could offer you some discount in exchange for YouTube review and you mentioning them in all your developing process of your board
[2021-06-26T23:04:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. i'll see tomorrow. too pissed off today
[2021-06-26T23:04:41] Artem Bulashev: Flip
[2021-06-26T23:04:48] Artem Bulashev: Sky
[2021-06-26T23:04:54] Artem Bulashev: Welcome
[2021-06-26T23:04:59] Artem Bulashev: To hell
[2021-06-26T23:05:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: why not. i'll contact them during my holidays. i has been crazy working last weeks
[2021-06-26T23:05:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-06-26T23:05:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i never thought a product could be so shitty 🤪
[2021-06-26T23:06:28] Luis Magalhaes: 😅 bad luck mate, dont like those flipsky ones
[2021-06-26T23:07:24] Happy Giraffe: Why flipsky is so bad?😅
[2021-06-26T23:08:06] Happy Giraffe: Pirate praising it to heavens in his videos lol
[2021-06-26T23:08:23] Happy Giraffe: 💰💰💰
[2021-06-26T23:08:38] Luis Magalhaes: does it not do that to every thing in is channel ?lolol
[2021-06-26T23:08:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah surely. and testing on a table is not testing in real life...
[2021-06-26T23:09:19] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-06-26T23:09:23] Happy Giraffe: 🔥🔥🔥
[2021-06-26T23:23:22] Artem Bulashev: Statistics don’t lie usually. Flipsky are not very good in engineering
[2021-06-26T23:24:21] Artem Bulashev: What he describes look similar to what ubox would have on 135amp phase and 100amps battery - ac noise getting into logic board
[2021-06-26T23:24:29] Artem Bulashev: Unstable readings
[2021-06-26T23:24:36] Artem Bulashev: Sort of glitches
[2021-06-26T23:24:44] Artem Bulashev: Sudden death of controller logic
[2021-06-26T23:25:09] Artem Bulashev: And even co troller stopping to respond for a bit
[2021-06-26T23:25:53] Artem Bulashev: Remember ubox was rated 100a 100a, but it can do 130 100a without issues
[2021-06-26T23:26:16] Artem Bulashev: But this crappy one is known to die regardless
[2021-06-26T23:27:51] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-26T23:28:34] Happy Giraffe: I like spintend customer service really much, hope we can support them and get extra support for them in return
[2021-06-26T23:29:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i hope they'll make a good single core vesc... and not at 200€...
[2021-06-26T23:30:21] Artem Bulashev: Well while single esc development started from us chatting about it. I showed them huge Ninebot and Xiaomi mod groups and other scooter groups where people are looking for better single and dual controllers
[2021-06-26T23:30:24] Luis Magalhaes: really like them too
[2021-06-26T23:30:41] Artem Bulashev: And they really were surprised to see it. Next day I got message we will develop single
[2021-06-26T23:30:49] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-26T23:30:49] Artem Bulashev: That was February
[2021-06-26T23:31:02] Happy Giraffe: And now Im buying it😂
[2021-06-26T23:31:03] Artem Bulashev: Now we have it done before end of month
[2021-06-26T23:31:19] Artem Bulashev: Or very early July if there is some push back
[2021-06-26T23:31:36] Happy Giraffe: Then I will take pictures of it and send in Denises group and screenshot for Spintend
[2021-06-26T23:31:45] Happy Giraffe: So they know we want them🌚
[2021-06-26T23:31:51] Artem Bulashev: 🙂👌👌
[2021-06-26T23:32:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😱♥️
[2021-06-26T23:32:11] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-06-26T23:32:17] Artem Bulashev: Price wise I’m not sure
[2021-06-26T23:32:28] Artem Bulashev: I think we were discussing sub 180
[2021-06-26T23:32:44] Artem Bulashev: But with all that prices changes I hope they maintain it
[2021-06-26T23:32:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2021-06-26T23:33:19] Artem Bulashev: It will be stripped down Ubox Pro without extra futures like 2.4ghz
[2021-06-26T23:33:36] Artem Bulashev: 100v if I’m not mistaken
[2021-06-26T23:33:56] Happy Giraffe: So it could have some design improvements also compared to Old Dual?
[2021-06-26T23:34:06] Artem Bulashev: Yes absolutely
[2021-06-26T23:34:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: separated logic/power boards ?
[2021-06-26T23:34:25] Artem Bulashev: Even though old one already does more than spec sheet
[2021-06-26T23:34:28] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-06-26T23:34:35] Artem Bulashev: Separated
[2021-06-26T23:34:40] Artem Bulashev: Can’t have it any other way
[2021-06-26T23:34:46] Artem Bulashev: With such currents
[2021-06-26T23:35:05] Artem Bulashev: I’m not sure what will be the target current though
[2021-06-26T23:35:49] Happy Giraffe: Interesting to see
[2021-06-26T23:36:03] Happy Giraffe: Maybe they update their accessories aswell
[2021-06-26T23:36:15] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_449@26-06-2021_23-36-15.jpg>
[2021-06-26T23:36:33] Artem Bulashev: 75v 100a
[2021-06-26T23:37:00] Happy Giraffe: In 3 weeks I order that baby
[2021-06-26T23:37:11] Artem Bulashev: Will have built in IMU - so new logic board for sure
[2021-06-26T23:37:29] Happy Giraffe: Did they talk about thermal design?
[2021-06-26T23:37:33] Artem Bulashev: And dual boards not soldered - so no fail like with current Ubox
[2021-06-26T23:38:12] Artem Bulashev: It’s 96% efficiency so not much issues (case + deck will be plenty)
[2021-06-26T23:38:27] Artem Bulashev: Even current Ubox basically never over heats, specially if you replace thermal pad with better one
[2021-06-26T23:39:08] Artem Bulashev: What I like also - spare parts!
[2021-06-26T23:39:25] Artem Bulashev: You can get logic board and power board replacements 😀
[2021-06-26T23:40:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i Hope it won't be plastic case in the final design
[2021-06-26T23:40:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but nice
[2021-06-26T23:41:01] Happy Giraffe: Damn, I wonder if Xiaomi esc is like 80%😂
[2021-06-26T23:41:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Told you
[2021-06-27T02:28:46] Artem Bulashev: 🤣 come on
[2021-06-27T02:29:09] Happy Giraffe: You never know chinese👀
[2021-06-27T02:29:15] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-27T02:29:31] Artem Bulashev: 👌 it won’t be haha
[2021-06-27T02:29:51] Artem Bulashev: Unless it is 99% efficiency and has 0 heat lol
[2021-06-27T02:36:04] Happy Giraffe: You know, xiaomi uses kapton tape on fets😂
[2021-06-27T02:36:17] Happy Giraffe: So plastic case wouldnt be a surprise😂
[2021-06-27T12:25:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Hello guys
[2021-06-27T12:25:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: first, I replaced the power board
[2021-06-27T12:26:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's seems a little better
[2021-06-27T12:26:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: then, I read about current saturation ... decrease the current to 43A (max given by detection).
[2021-06-27T12:26:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: much better
[2021-06-27T12:27:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: switch to BLDC. still weird noise, but more torque (weird)
[2021-06-27T12:27:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_450@27-06-2021_12-27-07.jpg>
[2021-06-27T12:28:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's "driveable", but a serious lack of power
[2021-06-27T12:53:54] Face de Pin Sucé: BLDC always more torque from low speed
[2021-06-27T12:59:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: BLDC at 80A phase "working"
[2021-06-27T12:59:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I missed the BLDC detection panel ...
[2021-06-27T12:59:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: still loud noise ... but it will do the job for a first ride ... once rain stops 😭😭
[2021-06-27T12:59:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha
[2021-06-27T13:00:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Try to tweak switching frequency
[2021-06-27T13:00:18] Face de Pin Sucé: It will change the noise
[2021-06-27T13:00:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also, the "apply" button doesn't really work after the detection. I had to enter settings manually
[2021-06-27T13:00:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: already done ;)
[2021-06-27T13:00:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Weird
[2021-06-27T13:01:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: holly shit !
[2021-06-27T13:01:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I pushed the min freq a 20kHz, lot of torque !
[2021-06-27T13:02:42] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-06-27T13:21:34] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-06-27T13:23:50] Luis Magalhaes: On bldc?
[2021-06-27T13:24:05] Luis Magalhaes: In foc i think im using 25khz
[2021-06-27T13:24:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, on bldc
[2021-06-27T13:24:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 20k min / 35k max
[2021-06-27T13:26:15] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-06-27T13:26:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Foc I use 35 at least
[2021-06-27T13:26:41] Artem Bulashev: What is that parameter
[2021-06-27T13:26:42] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-06-27T13:27:04] Artem Bulashev: FETs operating switching frequency ?
[2021-06-27T13:27:21] Luis Magalhaes: Hum ok
[2021-06-27T13:27:26] Artem Bulashev: I though that would be constant
[2021-06-27T13:27:43] Artem Bulashev: I didn’t even mess with that parameter
[2021-06-27T13:27:52] Artem Bulashev: Who can explain it
[2021-06-27T13:27:56] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-06-27T13:27:57] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i think its that
[2021-06-27T13:28:10] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-06-27T13:28:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-06-27T13:28:15] Artem Bulashev: Interesting
[2021-06-27T13:28:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_451@27-06-2021_13-28-28.jpg>
[2021-06-27T13:28:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_452@27-06-2021_13-28-40.jpg>
[2021-06-27T13:28:45] Luis Magalhaes: Did not mess with it but had seen people talking that increases the frequency and it works better
[2021-06-27T13:28:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_453@27-06-2021_13-28-51.jpg>
[2021-06-27T13:29:48] Luis Magalhaes: Your now at 16khz?
[2021-06-27T13:29:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-06-27T13:30:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also tweaked some settnigs according to this page
[2021-06-27T13:30:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: http://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/
[2021-06-27T13:30:16] Luis Magalhaes: And how's thr torque?
[2021-06-27T13:30:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not bad !
[2021-06-27T13:32:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but I've compared it to my 35A shunted DT mini, and it has a lower torque. I would say 60-70% of the shunted DT mini
[2021-06-27T13:32:25] Artem Bulashev: Never mind
[2021-06-27T13:32:38] Artem Bulashev: If it is like esc on quadcopters
[2021-06-27T13:33:01] Artem Bulashev: That will be communication to motor frequency
[2021-06-27T13:33:13] Artem Bulashev: That will change many things indeed
[2021-06-27T13:33:30] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know why I didn’t make analogy before
[2021-06-27T13:34:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_454@27-06-2021_13-34-31.jpg>
[2021-06-27T13:34:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what do they mean by "continuous current " ? normal phase current ? or battery current ?
[2021-06-27T13:35:07] Artem Bulashev: Higher frequency = less torque on bottom - beneficial for excessively powerful set ups - higher frequency better efficiency - depending on motor design different frequency May work better (less desync)
[2021-06-27T13:35:26] Artem Bulashev: Both usually for vesc (battery and phase same value )
[2021-06-27T13:36:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I shouldn't put more than 50A on "motor current max" ???
[2021-06-27T13:36:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_455@27-06-2021_13-36-48.jpg>
[2021-06-27T13:36:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-06-27T13:38:00] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i had same problem compared yo my minimotors shunted to 50A
[2021-06-27T13:38:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and what did you do ?
[2021-06-27T13:38:42] Luis Magalhaes: It should be battery i think
[2021-06-27T13:38:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think so
[2021-06-27T13:39:09] Luis Magalhaes: Put 70A battery and 130A phase 😂
[2021-06-27T13:39:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol... I'd like to make at least ONE ride with it before it burns 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2021-06-27T13:39:40] Luis Magalhaes: I think sine wave have to have more power to have same torque
[2021-06-27T13:39:50] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂
[2021-06-27T13:40:08] Artem Bulashev: Battery limit doesn’t come into equation at all up till about 25kmh
[2021-06-27T13:40:27] Luis Magalhaes: Its a lot different from the square controller, in this one the torque rises with speed i think
[2021-06-27T13:40:37] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-06-27T13:40:49] Luis Magalhaes: I can feel it going faster and pushing gradually
[2021-06-27T13:41:03] Artem Bulashev: That’s because voltage on motor grow
[2021-06-27T13:41:11] Luis Magalhaes: With the square it gives all in the beginning
[2021-06-27T13:41:17] Artem Bulashev: And phase current * voltage on motor = watts
[2021-06-27T13:41:33] Artem Bulashev: As result increases watts on motor also increases
[2021-06-27T13:41:38] Luis Magalhaes: But voltage on square grows too or I'm wrong?
[2021-06-27T13:41:47] Artem Bulashev: Correct
[2021-06-27T13:42:12] Artem Bulashev: Difference is that square wave does not LIMIT motor current (phase current) at all - it is unlimited
[2021-06-27T13:42:28] Artem Bulashev: So you get 180a spike easy on 50amp controller
[2021-06-27T13:42:50] Artem Bulashev: On square wave for a split second - there is no control no limit
[2021-06-27T13:42:51] Luis Magalhaes: But if i mesure the amps in a square i hit throtlle and i can see all amps battery and in this i see it growing
[2021-06-27T13:43:20] Luis Magalhaes: I did see 108A in mine 😂
[2021-06-27T13:43:35] Artem Bulashev: Yes same reason
[2021-06-27T13:43:37] Luis Magalhaes: Maybe had no time to see it
[2021-06-27T13:43:52] Artem Bulashev: You contrôler doesn’t limit phase, but it still has mechanical limit
[2021-06-27T13:44:05] Luis Magalhaes: Yes minimotors are dumb and gives all it can gives 😂😂
[2021-06-27T13:44:06] Artem Bulashev: So you have 1v * 180amp spike = 180w
[2021-06-27T13:44:11] Artem Bulashev: When you start from 0
[2021-06-27T13:44:56] Artem Bulashev: That converts to 180w / battery voltage = battery current draw
[2021-06-27T13:45:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i measure only battery current with my app, and it's a 5 metter start
[2021-06-27T13:45:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_456@27-06-2021_13-45-24.jpg>
[2021-06-27T13:47:33] Artem Bulashev: Than you go 20kmh, for example 25v on motor * and more stable 150amps phase = 3750w That would be 3750w / battery voltage 62v for example 60amps battery, this means at this point controller would be limited by battery limit
[2021-06-27T13:55:10] Luis Magalhaes: Yesterday i tested 130A phase and 50A battery and it drives like 70 at low speeds
[2021-06-27T13:55:31] Luis Magalhaes: Only if i get higher it is limited to 50😂
[2021-06-27T13:56:14] Luis Magalhaes: So if the flipsky can handle 100a phase just do it 😂
[2021-06-27T14:17:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: done...
[2021-06-27T14:17:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_457@27-06-2021_14-17-06.jpg>
[2021-06-27T14:17:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: starting to get somewhere...
[2021-06-27T14:17:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_458@27-06-2021_14-17-55.jpg>
[2021-06-27T14:17:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅😅
[2021-06-27T14:23:02] Luis Magalhaes: 💪💪
[2021-06-27T14:23:30] Luis Magalhaes: All good with fet temperature? 😁
[2021-06-27T14:24:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but on a 3s start, not really representative
[2021-06-27T14:24:53] Luis Magalhaes: Yes you have to ride it more 😅
[2021-06-27T14:25:07] Luis Magalhaes: Is not like the minimotors controllers 😁
[2021-06-27T14:25:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes... damn rainy weather
[2021-06-27T14:29:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_459@27-06-2021_14-29-14.jpg>
[2021-06-27T14:29:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😡
[2021-06-27T14:34:48] Artem Bulashev: I would keep it at 90a phase
[2021-06-27T14:35:01] Artem Bulashev: Your controller is not strong one
[2021-06-27T14:35:24] Artem Bulashev: And 90amps dual motor gives very good acceleration
[2021-06-27T14:35:46] Artem Bulashev: Even single it’s like 7sec to 40kmh
[2021-06-27T14:36:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah, but I'm in single :D I went to VESC for more torque. doesn't seems to be easy. with this config, I'd say I am at 80/90% of the shunted 35A cntrl
[2021-06-27T14:37:07] Artem Bulashev: 6.6sec actually on average 5.4sec best to 40kmh gps
[2021-06-27T14:37:14] Artem Bulashev: On single wheel
[2021-06-27T14:37:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-06-27T14:38:19] Artem Bulashev: That’s acceleration of 10x dual 😄
[2021-06-27T14:39:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what app do you use to get those infos ?
[2021-06-27T14:49:54] Luis Magalhaes: I use drag racer 😂
[2021-06-27T14:50:49] Luis Magalhaes: If you have android
[2021-06-27T14:53:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I used it a long time ago, it wasn't accurate 😅😅
[2021-06-27T14:58:16] Luis Magalhaes: Mine to work has to have a sunny day so it won't even work 😂
[2021-06-27T14:58:29] Luis Magalhaes: And you can see the accuracy of gps
[2021-06-27T14:59:39] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_460@27-06-2021_14-59-39.jpg>
[2021-06-27T14:59:57] Luis Magalhaes: This was the last one with multiple rides to give a more accurate result
[2021-06-27T15:00:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-06-27T15:01:12] Luis Magalhaes: But yes it has to have some error in there 😂😂
[2021-06-27T15:01:32] Luis Magalhaes: But just to have an idea of times vesc vs minimotors
[2021-06-27T15:01:36] Luis Magalhaes: On same app
[2021-06-27T15:02:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly
[2021-06-27T15:24:46] Artem Bulashev: 😂better use android phone… I have iPhone
[2021-06-27T15:25:03] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_461@27-06-2021_15-25-03.jpg>
[2021-06-27T15:25:21] Artem Bulashev: Beautiful app
[2021-06-27T15:35:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: available for android too
[2021-06-27T15:35:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_462@27-06-2021_15-35-47.jpg>
[2021-06-27T15:35:55] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-06-27T15:36:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'll try both
[2021-06-27T16:16:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: drag racer : complete fail
[2021-06-27T16:18:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_464@27-06-2021_16-18-12.jpg>
[2021-06-27T16:18:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_465@27-06-2021_16-18-18.jpg>
[2021-06-27T16:18:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 44A battery. 64°C max.
[2021-06-27T16:18:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and still poor acceleration. vesc tweaking is clearly not for me...
[2021-06-27T16:19:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the run 4 is false i think. it's more 8-9s
[2021-06-27T16:19:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ... to 40 km/h
[2021-06-27T16:20:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: motor is hot, but deck is just a bit warm
[2021-06-27T16:21:17] Luis Magalhaes: Not sunny day there 😂😂😂
[2021-06-27T16:22:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it lock the gps, but as soon i reach 10km/h, gps is lost. lol.
[2021-06-27T16:22:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: let see the bright side... i didn't burn the vesc 🤣🤣
[2021-06-27T16:23:26] Luis Magalhaes: 😂 yes if its not working at first just not a good a day 😂😂
[2021-06-27T16:23:37] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂
[2021-06-27T16:35:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Thursday I'll let you test my Spider with VESC :p
[2021-06-27T16:36:07] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't know if you remember my 72V Etwow
[2021-06-27T16:36:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeahhh. but you cheated with alternative motos 😁
[2021-06-27T16:36:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope 😁
[2021-06-27T16:37:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Those motors are poor torque haha
[2021-06-27T16:38:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Sadness
[2021-06-27T17:15:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @artBula , email sent to Spintend !
[2021-06-27T17:36:22] Artem Bulashev: 😄👌
[2021-06-27T17:40:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and i talked about you 🤣🤣
[2021-06-27T18:08:13] Artem Bulashev: In BLDC mode?
[2021-06-27T18:10:37] Artem Bulashev: 😁
[2021-06-27T18:17:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-06-27T20:44:22] Happy Giraffe: We should ask Spintend support to make Telegram account and join in our groups😂
[2021-06-27T20:47:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: that's completly true. what vesc needs is good support a d documentation. so much params.
[2021-06-27T20:48:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: at least some config examples and how to adjust them
[2021-06-27T20:48:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think the params are shitty for escooter
[2021-06-27T20:58:57] Happy Giraffe: Too much skateboard stuff
[2021-06-27T22:59:08] Happy Giraffe: How come Shimano not having a single e-bike lever with on/off switch?
[2021-06-27T22:59:43] Happy Giraffe: Seems like Magura caliper and Shimano lever would be most optimal setup as Magura levers are plastic trash
[2021-06-27T23:00:41] Happy Giraffe: The parts are named EV but not after electric vehicle😂
[2021-06-27T23:03:04] Happy Giraffe: Shimano patented a technology for linear lever sensor👀
[2021-06-27T23:12:01] Unknown: 😳
[2021-06-27T23:59:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ?? where did you find that ? any product in préparation ?
[2021-06-28T00:05:36] Happy Giraffe: https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/27/patent-patrol-shimano-wires-up-electric-bicycle-brakes-but-why/
[2021-06-28T00:08:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: excellent !
[2021-06-28T00:09:06] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-28T00:55:26] Happy Giraffe: But...for now we would have to use sensorless levers
[2021-06-28T00:57:02] Happy Giraffe: Found out basic metal Shimano hydro lever and Magura MT5 caliper is the best bang for buck. We might need some fittings on those to put the hose and olive. Not sure if its just plug and play🤔 I will go and ask my local bike store
[2021-06-28T02:48:25] Happy Giraffe: https://www.bike-components.de/en/Magura/CMe5-Disc-Brake-p74060/
[2021-06-28T02:49:06] Happy Giraffe: Found one Magura 4-piston Hydro that has alu lever and alu reservoir👀
[2021-06-28T02:49:34] Happy Giraffe: It should be able to be used withtout Bosch ABS stuff
[2021-06-28T03:08:47] Happy Giraffe: https://www.bike-components.de/en/Shimano/SLX-BL-M7100-Brake-Lever-p72219/
[2021-06-28T03:11:20] Happy Giraffe: These Shimano levers would fit Magura caliper with the Magura hose + inserts/olive but then we dont have the on/off sensor🤔 Luckily in future, a lever with sensor from Shimano should be compatible with the Magura caliper👍
[2021-06-28T09:41:37] francois schempers: with Vesc you could just glue the hall sensor and the magnet, since you can configure the range and power of what comes back of the hall
[2021-06-28T09:48:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: result 10 to 16 with shunted dt mini
[2021-06-28T09:48:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: median at ~7.5 - 8s
[2021-06-28T09:49:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sure, i could. but : 1/ lazzy 2/ not easy for me 3/ not easy for any other user
[2021-06-28T10:01:59] francois schempers: ahh you guys are talking masse production, okey my bad ^
[2021-06-28T10:51:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahaha. no, but something accessible to anyone 😅
[2021-06-28T10:57:30] Artem Bulashev: 7.5-8sec not too fast either but not bad 👌I expected more to be honest
[2021-06-28T10:58:21] Artem Bulashev: Vesc 90amp phase and 30amp battery will be faster on sensored single wheel 650w (1100max) 😁
[2021-06-28T10:58:53] Artem Bulashev: That’s what I have and average time 0-40 6.66sec
[2021-06-28T10:59:50] Artem Bulashev: But motor is warmer than I would like. Still passes finger test 👍
[2021-06-28T11:00:13] Artem Bulashev: Key is sensored wheel
[2021-06-28T11:25:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😭😭
[2021-06-28T11:46:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: found the post about the single core spintend !
[2021-06-28T11:46:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://forum.esk8.news/t/spintend-single-75v100a-beta-comes/54188/15
[2021-06-28T11:46:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seems nice !
[2021-06-28T13:57:31] Luis Magalhaes: So small diference to vesc?
[2021-06-28T13:57:52] Mirono escooters: Cooling fan yay
[2021-06-28T13:57:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, as i thought ~10-20% performance less for vesc
[2021-06-28T13:58:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if we can extract.the air, yes 🤪
[2021-06-28T14:01:26] Luis Magalhaes: Like i said in my experience, had to use 130A phase and 70A battery to have similar time as 50A battery and ~108A phase minimotors
[2021-06-28T15:03:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍😅
[2021-06-28T15:20:36] Artem Bulashev: I think you would get about same with 130a phase and 50a battery to be honest, have you tried how it would change ?
[2021-06-28T15:21:29] Artem Bulashev: In theory acceleration 0-30 should be same. 30-70kmh would decrease (but I’m not sure if it would by significant amount or not
[2021-06-28T15:34:51] Luis Magalhaes: Minimotors where very fast till 70 or 80
[2021-06-28T15:34:55] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_467@28-06-2021_15-34-55.jpg>
[2021-06-28T15:35:17] Luis Magalhaes: Here is an example, this was minimotors going a slight up hill 😅
[2021-06-28T15:36:51] Luis Magalhaes: Had done more speed in same uphill with less battery but with 70A battery and 130A phase
[2021-06-28T15:37:21] Luis Magalhaes: If i had more phase amps it would be quicker 😂
[2021-06-28T16:21:48] Artem Bulashev: More battery current allows 130amps to be available up to higher rpm (speed) so initial acceleration would last longer. Also top speed would increase with high battery current, because at max speed motor has max voltage on it * phase amp = input watts Input watts = battery voltage at the moment * batter amp limit value
[2021-06-28T17:23:28] Luis Magalhaes: yes, but to increase inicial aceleration i think if i had more phase amps will do the job, would have more torque and better start time
[2021-06-28T17:24:12] Luis Magalhaes: im on the limit of what i can push from my battery too, and the voltage sag had increase 🤣
[2021-06-28T17:28:33] Happy Giraffe: So its a beta test...
[2021-06-28T19:23:08] Artem Bulashev: Battery amps yes correct inital acceleration is phase current
[2021-06-28T19:23:50] Artem Bulashev: Go back to 50amps and it will be same than
[2021-06-28T21:56:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: YEAAAHHHHHHHHH !
[2021-06-28T21:56:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i managed to add a 'transparent mode' for ble/vesc. my smart can be seen/used as a usb dongle for android vesc tools 😁
[2021-06-28T21:57:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_469@28-06-2021_21-57-02.jpg>
[2021-06-28T22:59:16] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2021-06-28T23:00:08] Artem Bulashev: Basically you don’t require can line than
[2021-06-28T23:00:12] Artem Bulashev: As an idea
[2021-06-28T23:01:21] Artem Bulashev: Sort of install display and give it 12v and connect everything into display (throttle and breaks. You can have ble connected extension board than in the deck for lights and horn
[2021-06-28T23:01:31] Artem Bulashev: Loo just brain storming possibilities
[2021-06-28T23:03:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I'd like to avoid BLE when not really needed. it's too sensitive to interferences. I can already see that during my ride with my anti-theft device. sometime, it loose track of the BLE device even if it's a 1m.
[2021-06-28T23:32:30] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-06-28T23:32:34] Artem Bulashev: Ok cool info
[2021-06-28T23:32:43] Artem Bulashev: Well
[2021-06-28T23:33:32] Luis Magalhaes: Will test it 😁
[2021-06-28T23:33:40] Artem Bulashev: ☺️
[2021-06-28T23:34:32] Artem Bulashev: You said you mesurer Phase current on acceleration of 50amp controller (rear motor or front ?) il asking because if you measured front than i would expect less amps on it, grip slips just so slightly reducing load
[2021-06-28T23:36:55] Luis Magalhaes: I did measure the front and the rear
[2021-06-28T23:37:05] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-06-28T23:37:28] Luis Magalhaes: A friend mesure the dualtron X controller and had seen ~130A
[2021-06-28T23:37:52] Artem Bulashev: Interesting I would expect to see 150amps on 50amp contrôler
[2021-06-28T23:37:54] Luis Magalhaes: Mine was less but was a shunted 40A 😁
[2021-06-28T23:38:00] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-06-28T23:38:49] Luis Magalhaes: Normaly no one mesure phase 😂 always think os battery amps in square controller
[2021-06-28T23:39:16] Luis Magalhaes: Did learn lots of things going to ubox and talking with you guys 😁👌👌
[2021-06-28T23:40:56] Happy Giraffe: They said Ubox single will have beta test next month🌚
[2021-06-29T00:07:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I know :) which “marketing” 50 amps can and are so different :) take 23amps controllers they all have drastically different acceleration. I guess that’s due to the phase amps limit variance
[2021-06-29T00:26:00] Happy Giraffe: 100,000w Rion🌚
[2021-06-29T00:33:05] Unknown: Rion that's my summon word.....
[2021-06-29T02:15:03] Artem Bulashev: 5000w xiaomi m365 wheel is my stop word 😂
[2021-06-29T02:29:11] Happy Giraffe: Thats coming soon😂
[2021-06-29T02:30:56] Unknown: I don't need that shite i drive delta.....
[2021-06-29T02:31:37] Mirono escooters: Delta didnt work for me. But I guess u have no xiaomi controllers
[2021-06-29T02:33:00] Happy Giraffe: Tooorque 80Batt amps baby
[2021-06-29T02:33:35] Artem Bulashev: Battery doesn’t define torque 0-35kmh aprox
[2021-06-29T02:33:57] Artem Bulashev: It defines how long that level of acceleration can last on scale 0kmh - max kmh
[2021-06-29T02:34:12] Happy Giraffe: 100A phase sensored foc then 👀
[2021-06-29T02:34:15] Artem Bulashev: Motor amp (phase current) defines torque
[2021-06-29T02:34:24] Artem Bulashev: Yeap that will be fast
[2021-06-29T02:34:26] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-06-29T02:34:41] Artem Bulashev: I have 90a phase 28a battery on my single week 0-40kmh 6.6sec (rear wheel)
[2021-06-29T02:34:55] Happy Giraffe: *Grip FWD has entered the chat*
[2021-06-29T02:35:33] Artem Bulashev: Front wheel can’t handle more than 80a phase usually 😅
[2021-06-29T02:35:41] Artem Bulashev: Without spinning out
[2021-06-29T02:36:02] Happy Giraffe: I wonder how they calculate exactly the Batt vs phase
[2021-06-29T02:36:20] Artem Bulashev: I covered it many times before
[2021-06-29T02:36:24] Artem Bulashev: Look
[2021-06-29T02:36:34] Happy Giraffe: Slow spinning wheel lets say 5v
[2021-06-29T02:36:40] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-06-29T02:36:45] Happy Giraffe: 2000w limit on 13s roughly 40A batt
[2021-06-29T02:36:49] Artem Bulashev: So full phase current can go
[2021-06-29T02:37:11] Artem Bulashev: It depends on voltage of your battery at every moment * battery limit setting yes
[2021-06-29T02:37:14] Happy Giraffe: Theoretical 400A😅
[2021-06-29T02:37:36] Artem Bulashev: So as you battery discharges watts available also goes down
[2021-06-29T02:37:59] Artem Bulashev: Now the motor has 5v when you go 10kmh * 100amps phase = 1000w all ok
[2021-06-29T02:38:38] Artem Bulashev: Than you go 15kmh and motor has 19v on it * 100a = 1900w all ok
[2021-06-29T02:38:41] Happy Giraffe: And 40 kmh 20v it reaches max 2000w with 100Aphase
[2021-06-29T02:38:58] Happy Giraffe: If it would be linear
[2021-06-29T02:39:18] Artem Bulashev: doesen't matter
[2021-06-29T02:39:27] Artem Bulashev: point is
[2021-06-29T02:39:43] Happy Giraffe: Batt amps more like the headroom for amps
[2021-06-29T02:39:51] Happy Giraffe: And power
[2021-06-29T02:39:56] Artem Bulashev: lets say your batetry is now at 4v per cell *13= 52v
[2021-06-29T02:40:07] Artem Bulashev: and setting is 40a
[2021-06-29T02:40:23] Artem Bulashev: 2080w available at that moment
[2021-06-29T02:40:38] Artem Bulashev: this means that
[2021-06-29T02:40:56] Artem Bulashev: once voltage on motor goes above 20.8v
[2021-06-29T02:41:07] Artem Bulashev: phase currenet of 100a will need to be reduced
[2021-06-29T02:41:16] Happy Giraffe: Oh I see
[2021-06-29T02:41:20] Artem Bulashev: if you increase battery lim setting
[2021-06-29T02:41:38] Artem Bulashev: than 100a phase will last up until highere speed (RPM)
[2021-06-29T02:41:47] Artem Bulashev: up till higher voltage on motor
[2021-06-29T02:42:01] Happy Giraffe: Now I understood it all👍 Thanks
[2021-06-29T02:42:26] Happy Giraffe: Will be helpful when setting up the config
[2021-06-29T02:42:39] Artem Bulashev: so your 100a acceleration will continiu for longer and acceleration 0kmh-60km will also be faster with that
[2021-06-29T02:43:15] Artem Bulashev: as well as top speed will slightly increasse becuase higher phase amps will be available at motor max voltage
[2021-06-29T02:43:24] Happy Giraffe: But that will draw a heck lot of current from start to finish
[2021-06-29T02:44:54] Artem Bulashev: as you can see when you drive 10km full acceletration is only about 5v*100a=500w / battery voltage 52v = 9.6a from battery
[2021-06-29T02:45:23] Artem Bulashev: but yes once you get the batetry current limit (or rathere watt lim as we discussed before) you will be drawing 40amps from battery from that point up till max speed
[2021-06-29T02:46:13] Happy Giraffe: Oh okay so it gets converted on low rpm, thats cool
[2021-06-29T02:46:33] Happy Giraffe: Just being work the motor does
[2021-06-29T02:46:42] Artem Bulashev: low rpm
[2021-06-29T02:46:45] Artem Bulashev: low voltage
[2021-06-29T02:47:17] Artem Bulashev: voltage on motor* phase amps is less watts than battery voltage * battery current limit = so all phase amps availbale
[2021-06-29T02:47:33] Artem Bulashev: you cant spend more watts than your input can provide
[2021-06-29T02:47:53] Happy Giraffe: Oh I see, then only handful of volts wont allow more work done even when amps maxed
[2021-06-29T02:47:54] Artem Bulashev: so it reduces phase amps once voltage is high enough
[2021-06-29T02:48:26] Happy Giraffe: Explains slow 0-20kmh, fast 20-30, slow 30-40kmh on xiaomi
[2021-06-29T02:48:47] Happy Giraffe: Full batt amps after 20kmh
[2021-06-29T02:49:08] Artem Bulashev: could be yes if your phase current and batetry current both are too high
[2021-06-29T02:49:11] Happy Giraffe: Then wattage and batt amps limit it again at 30
[2021-06-29T02:49:19] Artem Bulashev: this is your critical point than
[2021-06-29T02:49:44] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi doesnt do it linear, batt amps get doubled at 20kmh
[2021-06-29T02:49:45] Artem Bulashev: where motor voltage is high enough to limit phase current by amount of power available on input
[2021-06-29T02:49:47] Happy Giraffe: Measured it
[2021-06-29T02:50:24] Happy Giraffe: Atleast on Xiaogen with power limit off
[2021-06-29T02:50:26] Artem Bulashev: 👍allows phase current to stay high up to higher speeds
[2021-06-29T02:51:25] Happy Giraffe: Will be really interesting to experience a smooth acceleration after a 125cc 2-stroke powerspike like Xiaomi😂
[2021-06-29T02:52:19] Artem Bulashev: well as I said you can get about zero 10x acceleration from vesc with phase current 90 and battery 30a
[2021-06-29T02:52:30] Artem Bulashev: alot faster than xiaomi
[2021-06-29T02:52:31] Artem Bulashev: 🙂
[2021-06-29T02:52:35] Artem Bulashev: 58kmh max
[2021-06-29T02:52:41] Happy Giraffe: And uses less juice👀
[2021-06-29T02:52:49] Artem Bulashev: well
[2021-06-29T02:53:00] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi would gladly pull 40A to hold those speeds
[2021-06-29T02:53:01] Artem Bulashev: yeah quite amazing for 30amp batetry lol
[2021-06-29T02:53:12] Artem Bulashev: but I'm not sure if 500w wheel will handle it
[2021-06-29T02:53:20] Happy Giraffe: 1000w I got
[2021-06-29T02:53:24] Artem Bulashev: perfect
[2021-06-29T02:53:30] Artem Bulashev: go for 120amps phase than
[2021-06-29T02:53:31] Artem Bulashev: but
[2021-06-29T02:53:36] Artem Bulashev: brace your self
[2021-06-29T02:53:38] Artem Bulashev: haha
[2021-06-29T02:54:12] Happy Giraffe: Grip will be rather interesting, got 2.5" cst but yeah...maybe full gas uphill to prevent spin lol
[2021-06-29T02:54:13] Artem Bulashev: make sure your batetry can provide what you ask from it
[2021-06-29T02:54:38] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, 35E 13s6p. Got additional 13s7p possibility to tandem with it
[2021-06-29T02:54:43] Artem Bulashev: I woudl advicee at least 40a batetry for 120a phase
[2021-06-29T02:54:59] Artem Bulashev: 35e can do well 7amps
[2021-06-29T02:55:02] Happy Giraffe: I would love to do 40A batt
[2021-06-29T02:55:14] Happy Giraffe: So then its 40A batt xiaomi vs 40A batt vesc
[2021-06-29T02:55:15] Artem Bulashev: 7*6= 42a so you are good
[2021-06-29T02:55:47] Artem Bulashev: it can do 10amps but preferable not for long
[2021-06-29T02:56:03] Happy Giraffe: And phase amps, if I understood correctly they will be sort of automatically limited by battery amps afterall
[2021-06-29T02:57:12] Artem Bulashev: there is no Boost option - may be with @koxx3 smart controller it will have such option, like increase battery limit by 40% for 2min and than cool down timer for 5 min
[2021-06-29T02:58:13] Artem Bulashev: yes, once motor voltage gets high enough for total watts output to about to exeed input available watts (defined by battery voltage * battery current limiti setting), since phase current is the only controllable variable - controller will lower it to match watt available on input in real time
[2021-06-29T02:58:39] Happy Giraffe: So basically if one would set 13s 40A batt and 300A phase
[2021-06-29T02:58:47] Happy Giraffe: This phase current would never happen
[2021-06-29T02:59:14] Artem Bulashev: it would
[2021-06-29T02:59:18] Artem Bulashev: at very begining
[2021-06-29T02:59:25] Artem Bulashev: because 0kmh = 0v
[2021-06-29T02:59:27] Artem Bulashev: on motr
[2021-06-29T02:59:59] Artem Bulashev: than you go 5kmh = 5v *300a = 1500w still in limit of 52v battery * 40 = 2080w
[2021-06-29T03:00:16] Artem Bulashev: but yes it would get limited quite early 🙂
[2021-06-29T03:00:18] Happy Giraffe: But that would do bad things for battery😅
[2021-06-29T03:00:26] Artem Bulashev: no
[2021-06-29T03:00:50] Artem Bulashev: battery would simply start to output 40amps earlier and thus be at 40amps for longer time
[2021-06-29T03:00:52] Artem Bulashev: but
[2021-06-29T03:00:57] Artem Bulashev: controller would blow up haha
[2021-06-29T03:01:18] Artem Bulashev: amps = noise
[2021-06-29T03:01:26] Artem Bulashev: more amps more EMI noise
[2021-06-29T03:01:55] Artem Bulashev: this noise will be so "loud" at 130a phase that it will infect logic board of UBOX
[2021-06-29T03:02:01] Happy Giraffe: 5v rpm and 300A phase, and battery would supply all this with only 30A batt current?
[2021-06-29T03:02:04] Artem Bulashev: and cause controller to missbehave
[2021-06-29T03:02:30] Artem Bulashev: physics 5v *300a = 1500w only
[2021-06-29T03:02:46] Artem Bulashev: 1500w / 52v battery = 28.84a draw from battery
[2021-06-29T03:03:24] Artem Bulashev: thats why higher Voltage battery needs less amps to produce same watts output
[2021-06-29T03:03:28] Happy Giraffe: Now I know my settings then, 40A batt 60A phase to start with
[2021-06-29T03:03:40] Artem Bulashev: amps = noise and = heat
[2021-06-29T03:03:47] Artem Bulashev: 1000w wheel?
[2021-06-29T03:03:50] Happy Giraffe: If I dont fear of dying, then can increase phase to 60 ,80 and 100
[2021-06-29T03:03:53] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2021-06-29T03:04:16] Artem Bulashev: your setting to start should be 90amps phase and 30 battery
[2021-06-29T03:04:24] Artem Bulashev: get used to it
[2021-06-29T03:04:36] Happy Giraffe: Maybe even 60A phase
[2021-06-29T03:04:38] Artem Bulashev: and increase it to 110a phase and 40 batetry
[2021-06-29T03:04:43] Artem Bulashev: too low
[2021-06-29T03:05:10] Happy Giraffe: Ahh ofcourse at low rpm, 10v 60phase only 600w
[2021-06-29T03:05:15] Artem Bulashev: 60a phse is like 500w motor and 20amp controller
[2021-06-29T03:05:17] Artem Bulashev: yeah
[2021-06-29T03:05:23] Artem Bulashev: go 90
[2021-06-29T03:05:25] Artem Bulashev: it is safe
[2021-06-29T03:05:31] Artem Bulashev: and fast eenough for most
[2021-06-29T03:05:45] Artem Bulashev: but your motor will be able to do 120amps phase no problem
[2021-06-29T03:05:56] Artem Bulashev: I did 110 amps on minee 650w motr haah
[2021-06-29T03:06:06] Artem Bulashev: that was fuuuun
[2021-06-29T03:06:16] Artem Bulashev: but too hot
[2021-06-29T03:06:32] Happy Giraffe: Maybe can do that on 10°c ambient
[2021-06-29T03:06:46] Artem Bulashev: 1000w motor can do 120a any day
[2021-06-29T03:06:56] Happy Giraffe: Lets hope so😅
[2021-06-29T03:07:04] Artem Bulashev: its math 🙂
[2021-06-29T03:07:10] Artem Bulashev: no hope needed 🙂
[2021-06-29T03:08:00] Happy Giraffe: I will order the single vesc in 3 weeks if its ready and set it all up, them gotta diy the brake mount aswell based on the Monorim front adapter👀
[2021-06-29T03:08:22] Artem Bulashev: saw that one 🙂
[2021-06-29T03:08:26] Happy Giraffe: In Finland we talk about wattage in speakers (the non-rms) as HattWatts
[2021-06-29T03:08:45] Happy Giraffe: Basically Moomin characters, so lets hope its all real W sold to me😂
[2021-06-29T03:09:52] Artem Bulashev: careful, don't set braking current (regen) more than 1.5c of the battery + 15amps = battery 16ah than set battery regen lim 16*1.5 = 24a and controller regeen 24+15=39a at most
[2021-06-29T03:10:14] Happy Giraffe: I think I wont set it at all
[2021-06-29T03:10:16] Artem Bulashev: make sure it is not to much becusae it will be braking with front wheel, so test drive it
[2021-06-29T03:10:31] Artem Bulashev: sure
[2021-06-29T03:10:33] Happy Giraffe: Maybe just cutoff if its possible
[2021-06-29T03:10:52] Artem Bulashev: that will simplify wiring as well - only throttle to connect
[2021-06-29T03:11:12] Happy Giraffe: I will use front hydro, no sensor
[2021-06-29T03:11:20] Happy Giraffe: Rear mechanical with on/off sensor
[2021-06-29T03:11:31] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-06-29T03:12:22] Happy Giraffe: Waiting for Magura to answer my e-mail. Seems only option to have alu on every part is to buy the Bosch abs version🙈
[2021-06-29T03:12:34] Happy Giraffe: No plastic in my brakes, I dont want to die
[2021-06-29T03:13:04] Artem Bulashev: topic forr another day haha gona go sleep
[2021-06-29T03:13:06] Artem Bulashev: 🙂
[2021-06-29T03:13:32] Happy Giraffe: Спокойной ночи
[2021-06-29T03:13:43] Happy Giraffe: Or something🤪
[2021-06-29T03:15:02] Artem Bulashev: spopt on haha
[2021-06-29T03:15:05] Artem Bulashev: cheers
[2021-06-29T03:15:07] Artem Bulashev: good night
[2021-06-29T07:56:29] Happy Giraffe: For your information, the MT5e is the only brake system that is equipped as standard with an electric switch contact (cut-off) and the cable with the HIGO plug at the lever blades. Available with part-number 2700985 as opener/normally closed (NC) and with part-number 2700984 as closer/normally open (NO) version.
[2021-06-29T07:58:16] Happy Giraffe: Some info from Magura customer support, so does Ubox/their 10€ adc board accept the Normally Closed or Open lever sensor?
[2021-06-29T10:02:14] francois schempers: yes you have a little switch on the adapter board to switch to on/off to gradual
[2021-06-29T10:03:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: first rain test 🤪
[2021-06-29T10:04:05] francois schempers: nice !
[2021-06-29T10:04:24] francois schempers: i would put silicone on those câble though x)
[2021-06-29T10:04:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i will. but most of the water is on the top since there is an angle
[2021-06-29T10:05:09] francois schempers: <photos/photo_471@29-06-2021_10-05-09.jpg>
[2021-06-29T10:05:09] francois schempers: <photos/photo_472@29-06-2021_10-05-09.jpg>
[2021-06-29T10:05:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-06-29T10:05:33] francois schempers: yes but so it doesn't go into the stem either
[2021-06-29T15:26:10] Happy Giraffe: But the type is important, Bafang sets iex. wont work with the other type so thats why I asked about Vesc.
[2021-06-29T15:26:31] Happy Giraffe: We can mod the lever ourselves but that would make it a bit less reliable
[2021-06-29T16:32:44] Unknown: Still on the side but it looks freaking cool
[2021-06-29T16:36:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😁😁
[2021-06-29T20:19:15] Luis Magalhaes: centered in handle bar would be top 🤣
[2021-06-29T20:19:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: guys, if you have 3D design skills, create a nice support which can be placed at the center ;)
[2021-06-29T20:20:46] Luis Magalhaes: would have to have a display too 🤣🤣
[2021-06-29T20:21:41] Luis Magalhaes: had been using the android phone, but it drains more battery then it can charge with the display on 😂
[2021-06-29T20:23:54] Artem Bulashev: Looking good agree
[2021-06-29T20:23:56] Artem Bulashev: Can do it
[2021-06-29T20:24:30] Artem Bulashev: Can you give me your files so that I mode the for stem cap mount ?
[2021-06-29T20:40:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: same files I already sent you ;)
[2021-06-29T20:45:48] Artem Bulashev: Oh right stp
[2021-06-29T20:46:04] Artem Bulashev: Stl is hard to edit correctly
[2021-06-29T20:46:12] Artem Bulashev: Btw sorry insane week
[2021-06-29T20:46:16] Artem Bulashev: I go tomorrow
[2021-06-29T20:46:27] Artem Bulashev: I did find some one else with SLA printer
[2021-06-29T20:46:35] Artem Bulashev: So I have few places to get it done now
[2021-06-29T21:25:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍❤️
[2021-06-29T21:26:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_473@29-06-2021_21-26-11.jpg>
[2021-06-29T21:26:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: VESC transparent mode works great now
[2021-06-29T21:26:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: usefull for VESC without integrated bluetooth
[2021-06-29T21:26:59] Unknown: I have sla so @koxx3 if you need something...
[2021-06-29T21:27:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ooooohhhhhh ❤️❤️❤️
[2021-06-29T21:27:28] Artem Bulashev: Are you in eu?
[2021-06-29T21:27:35] Artem Bulashev: 😍😍
[2021-06-29T21:28:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I would really like to try SLS or Multijet printing for my plastic parts. SLA, I don't know the process. I'll have a look :D
[2021-06-29T21:28:14] Artem Bulashev: Btw have a question. How would it integrate with dual esc ?
[2021-06-29T21:28:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: CAN should puch information from the slave to the master, then master communication in serial/ble
[2021-06-29T21:28:57] Artem Bulashev: Same as SLS but instead of laser tracing out each layer it prints via showing layer outline all at once in LCD panel
[2021-06-29T21:29:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ohhhh ! seems nice !
[2021-06-29T21:29:46] Unknown: Yes fantastic quality
[2021-06-29T21:29:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: could you print my 3D parts for the case to compare with SLS artem will print and FDM I've printed ?
[2021-06-29T21:29:59] Artem Bulashev: I mean for things like police mode for example we would need rear motor be set to 500w max and front motor have phase current 0a and phase breaking -50a for example (act as brake only)
[2021-06-29T21:30:14] Artem Bulashev: Faster with still enough resolution
[2021-06-29T21:30:34] Unknown: Yes
[2021-06-29T21:30:52] Artem Bulashev: Sls and SLa have vertically same result
[2021-06-29T21:30:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: same, but in reverse normally. but I am not sure, that's why @SibClimb will give me a spintend for some weeks to make tests
[2021-06-29T21:31:04] Unknown: Send me the files when I'm factory I can print it
[2021-06-29T21:31:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😊❤️ I'll send you the STL in private ;)
[2021-06-29T21:31:23] Artem Bulashev: Difference is only visible on parts with details smaller than 0.2mm
[2021-06-29T21:31:56] Artem Bulashev: There is no point to print SLA and SLS
[2021-06-29T21:31:59] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-06-29T21:32:17] Unknown: No problem I have clear and red resin..right now but if we go in small production thy are a lot of good materials out
[2021-06-29T21:32:51] Artem Bulashev: Check also what’s the time and cost of material 👌
[2021-06-29T21:32:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we'll see ;) I am a bit afraid of the color in SLS since it's colored atfer if I understood correctly
[2021-06-29T21:33:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍👍
[2021-06-29T21:33:16] Artem Bulashev: Cost of material is same as SLS but time is significantly faster on SLA

[2021-06-29T21:34:47] Artem Bulashev: It’s not as I remembered
[2021-06-29T21:35:20] Artem Bulashev: Our printer is SLA as well in the hobbylab
[2021-06-29T21:35:31] Unknown: Lol
[2021-06-29T21:36:18] Artem Bulashev: SLS is powered based and activated via laser
[2021-06-29T21:37:03] Artem Bulashev: Laser and lcd are both SLA just different ways to accomplish it
[2021-06-29T21:39:10] Unknown: I'm printing since 2010 and have 7 printers.... If you need prints summon me up...
[2021-06-29T21:39:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳
[2021-06-29T21:39:37] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-06-29T21:39:45] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-06-29T21:40:09] Artem Bulashev: I have fdm that I use once a month 😅😅
[2021-06-29T21:40:23] Unknown: Lol
[2021-06-29T21:40:56] Artem Bulashev: In this case I’m gonna ship you vsett contorller + display to play around 👌
[2021-06-29T21:41:10] Artem Bulashev: Pm me your shipping details please
[2021-06-29T21:41:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️
[2021-06-29T21:52:51] Happy Giraffe: Anybody know which sensor type Ubox takes?
[2021-06-29T21:52:51] Happy Giraffe: Does Ubox/their 10€ adc board accept the Normally Closed or Open lever sensor?
[2021-06-29T21:53:34] Artem Bulashev: Not sure
[2021-06-29T21:53:36] Artem Bulashev: Moment
[2021-06-29T21:55:20] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_474@29-06-2021_21-55-20.jpg>
[2021-06-29T21:55:37] Artem Bulashev: So I see 2 switches and pot
[2021-06-29T21:56:05] Artem Bulashev: <files/ADC adapter user manual 2020.12.10.pdf>
[2021-06-29T21:57:04] Artem Bulashev: One controls if brake is a switch type or pot/Hall effect Another if it is 5v or 3.3v logic type
[2021-06-29T21:57:34] Happy Giraffe: Magura lever is for S-pedelec ebikes
[2021-06-29T21:57:35] Artem Bulashev: I’m not too sure what pot does to the switch type 🙂
[2021-06-29T21:58:26] Happy Giraffe: Then we should maybe ask spintend what their mechanical lever has🤔
[2021-06-29T21:59:06] Happy Giraffe: Normally closed would be most logical for my mind but then afterall Im a musician and not an engineer🙈
[2021-06-29T21:59:31] Artem Bulashev: Normally open
[2021-06-29T21:59:37] Artem Bulashev: For break
[2021-06-29T21:59:48] Artem Bulashev: This means there is flow one you press on breaks
[2021-06-29T21:59:55] Artem Bulashev: This is normal type
[2021-06-29T22:00:15] Artem Bulashev: This way current doesn’t flow all the time, only when you press break
[2021-06-29T22:00:28] Artem Bulashev: It says in manual
[2021-06-29T22:00:46] Happy Giraffe: Then Im Stevie Wonder
[2021-06-29T22:01:06] Happy Giraffe: For your information, the MT5e is the only brake system that is equipped as standard with an electric switch contact (cut-off) and the cable with the HIGO plug at the lever blades. Available with part-number 2700985 as opener/normally closed (NC) and with part-number 2700984 as closer/normally open (NO) version.
[2021-06-29T22:01:24] Happy Giraffe: Then we gotta take the part number ending in 4
[2021-06-29T22:01:38] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-06-29T22:01:43] Artem Bulashev: “Next , hold the brake handle(to make the brake signal connected), use a screw driver to tune the Brake strength adjust in ADC Adapter, the CH2 data will change accordingly。”
[2021-06-29T22:01:54] Artem Bulashev: Press = signal connected
[2021-06-29T22:02:10] Artem Bulashev: So normally open is expected
[2021-06-29T22:02:38] Happy Giraffe: Thanks for lending your brain
[2021-06-29T22:03:02] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-06-29T22:03:08] Artem Bulashev: No probs happy to help
[2021-06-29T22:03:28] Happy Giraffe: I think I wont be the only one needing this haha
[2021-06-29T22:03:43] Artem Bulashev: Absolutely 😅
[2021-06-29T22:05:10] Happy Giraffe: And then we need to solder some connectors, are there those cylinder 2-pin female ones sold anywhere?
[2021-06-29T22:05:27] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-06-29T22:05:30] Artem Bulashev: What
[2021-06-29T22:06:50] Happy Giraffe: The connector on the brake sensor cable
[2021-06-29T22:07:34] Artem Bulashev: Oh right it’s not same as board has
[2021-06-29T22:09:07] Happy Giraffe: "Higo Closer" means normally open?
[2021-06-29T22:09:34] Happy Giraffe: Thats the model ending in 4
[2021-06-29T22:11:58] Happy Giraffe: https://www.dualtron.gr/en-gb/Accessories/magura-mt5e-pro-brake-lever-and-caliper-set
[2021-06-29T22:12:27] Happy Giraffe: Seems the brake is sold out in many places, seems like a good product. Aluminium lever is a must.

[2021-06-29T22:30:13] Happy Giraffe: Yes🔥
[2021-06-29T22:30:17] Happy Giraffe: Higo NO
[2021-06-29T22:31:54] Happy Giraffe: But the serial number on second doesnt line up🤔
[2021-06-29T22:32:48] Happy Giraffe: Shouldn't matter tho as long as its an alu lever with HIGO Closer/NO Normally Open lever sensor
[2021-06-29T23:12:35] Unknown: Ok
[2021-06-30T11:06:34] Artem Bulashev: If any one missed

[2021-06-30T11:08:30] Happy Giraffe: But it's beta😅 luckily not EA games beta
[2021-06-30T11:20:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i've just bought a Boosted Rev to make test in dual motor 🙈🤣
[2021-06-30T12:01:38] Happy Giraffe: Its sad EU made everything to have VAT now, will be ton of mess in customs during the first month
[2021-06-30T12:01:56] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-30T12:02:07] Mirono escooters: Alie will use ioss
[2021-06-30T12:02:59] Happy Giraffe: Are you sure?👀
[2021-06-30T12:03:06] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-06-30T12:03:10] Mirono escooters: Look at their faq
[2021-06-30T12:03:27] Mirono escooters: Alie says everything before 1 july has no vat Eu says otherwise Ill just wait few days
[2021-06-30T12:03:54] Mirono escooters: Will be nice. Customs will let it pass without additional administration costs (24€ bpost fuck u) and we get it soon
[2021-06-30T12:04:03] Mirono escooters: Just 21%. Its something but still better then local
[2021-06-30T12:05:40] Happy Giraffe: Oh happy news
[2021-06-30T12:06:01] Happy Giraffe: So it will actually make it better, but have to pay 24%
[2021-06-30T12:24:39] Artem Bulashev: 10€ in Austria post

[2021-06-30T16:26:14] Artem Bulashev: Petition in support of idea for Spintend to make BMS
[2021-06-30T16:26:40] Artem Bulashev: If you can comment consecutive number
[2021-06-30T16:33:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1 !!!
[2021-06-30T17:15:59] Mirono escooters: +2
[2021-06-30T17:17:52] francois schempers: +3
[2021-06-30T22:32:48] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_476@30-06-2021_22-32-48.jpg>
[2021-06-30T22:33:00] Artem Bulashev: Here is what happens if you only change battery current limit: Battery consumption won’t change up till same rpm(speed) because phase current is the limit. Fast = full phase amp acceleration will continue up till higher rpm. Max power will be higher because - example, at previous max speed 60kmh voltage was 45v and phase current was limited by battery limit obviously. So by increasing battery limit we now have more room for phase amps at those same 45v (60kmh) meaning we can get to higher max speed
[2021-06-30T22:34:22] Artem Bulashev: Guys made this for another group but May be some one here can benefit 2 charts. Second one has only one change - higher battery current limit. If you examine it carefully you will see full relation ship between phase and battery current limits
[2021-06-30T22:36:22] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2021-06-30T22:36:45] Happy Giraffe: Cant wait to experience it myself while wearing diapers
[2021-06-30T22:37:26] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-06-30T22:37:33] Happy Giraffe: I got the second 13s so 80 bat amps is possible😅
[2021-06-30T22:37:54] Happy Giraffe: Wearing it in a shoulder bag I call jihad
[2021-06-30T22:39:11] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-06-30T22:40:58] Artem Bulashev: Remember that max motor temp = to max phase amp - so power red line in this second image
[2021-06-30T22:41:26] Artem Bulashev: But increasing voltage of the battery gives same result without motor temp increase
[2021-06-30T22:45:12] Happy Giraffe: But in this case it would just maintain phase amps longer as total watts limit goes to 4000w?😅
[2021-06-30T22:46:09] Happy Giraffe: So 40A batt 100A phase vs 80A bat 100 phase
[2021-06-30T22:49:14] Happy Giraffe: So in the end I got 80A phase with 50v in motor
[2021-06-30T22:49:49] Happy Giraffe: Instead of the 40A phase
[2021-06-30T22:52:00] Artem Bulashev: What ever you put your equation is basic and can have either input power is higher than output or equal
[2021-06-30T22:52:14] Artem Bulashev: And it looks like this:
[2021-06-30T22:52:44] Artem Bulashev: Battery voltage at the moment * battery amp limit = Motor voltage * phase amps
[2021-06-30T22:53:06] Artem Bulashev: Controller can only control phase amps
[2021-06-30T22:53:15] Artem Bulashev: Battery voltage is on its own
[2021-06-30T22:53:24] Artem Bulashev: Battery amp limit you set in stone
[2021-06-30T22:53:42] Happy Giraffe: Yep, there I would keep phase amps twice as long
[2021-06-30T22:53:48] Artem Bulashev: Motor voltage is function of KV vs RPM you going at
[2021-06-30T22:54:00] Happy Giraffe: As wattage and bat amp doubles
[2021-06-30T22:54:26] Artem Bulashev: Yeah sort of (May be not twice as long but you got idea correctly - it may not be linear relation)
[2021-06-30T22:55:11] Artem Bulashev: Don’t forget losses increase as amps go up so it won’t be exactly double but idea is correct
[2021-06-30T22:55:18] Happy Giraffe: Should be a wicked acceleration when you have most of your phase amps at voltage limit😅
[2021-06-30T22:55:46] Happy Giraffe: Yep
[2021-06-30T22:56:30] Artem Bulashev: Yeah so acceleration at first will remain same as you already had that max phase amp on motor, but after the rpm range where before phase current got reduced, now you will continue with same acceleration till higher speed indeed
[2021-06-30T22:57:19] Happy Giraffe: If Ali makes the change to ioss I will be happy
[2021-06-30T22:59:25] Happy Giraffe: I would rather pay the 24% to Spintend but EU goes:
[2021-06-30T22:59:37] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_478@30-06-2021_22-59-37.jpg>
[2021-06-30T23:00:05] Artem Bulashev: That’s what vat is :)
[2021-06-30T23:00:27] Artem Bulashev: Time to start selling it on EU market Banggood
[2021-06-30T23:01:22] Happy Giraffe: Does the "beta test" have some drawbacks as the price was a bit lower afaik?
[2021-06-30T23:02:01] Happy Giraffe: Like limited warranty or some other shit
[2021-06-30T23:13:33] Artem Bulashev: It is not even released to Beta Test if you are speaking about Spintend single vesc
[2021-06-30T23:14:15] Artem Bulashev: Once it is sure they will explicitly say the conditions - warranty should be same, if not easier than tested and final product.
[2021-06-30T23:15:07] Artem Bulashev: Considering how well Spintend acts and always acted I don’t think there will be any warranty problems
[2021-06-30T23:15:32] Artem Bulashev: Or price, or quality problems 😊👌
[2021-06-30T23:15:50] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-06-30T23:42:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very good graphic !
[2021-06-30T23:43:20] Artem Bulashev: I tried to account all aspect of what would change and what would remain same. If any one has any questions let me know will answer 👌
[2021-06-30T23:43:31] Artem Bulashev: Thanks 😊

[2021-07-04T14:39:44] Rowan Ross: 👋
[2021-07-04T14:40:05] Rowan Ross: Got two spintends on my board, going 4wd
[2021-07-04T14:40:16] Luis Magalhaes: 💪
[2021-07-04T14:41:41] Rowan Ross: Had a quick question.
[2021-07-04T14:42:25] Rowan Ross: For a 4wd switch, all I need is to pull down the switch wire from the slave esc to ground right?
[2021-07-04T14:42:51] Rowan Ross: And can I take 12v directly from the horn/light port without having the custom remote?
[2021-07-04T19:57:48] Unknown: kenn ich dich kenny bist du plauschi kenny???
[2021-07-04T20:32:59] Unknown: Nein haha
[2021-07-04T20:44:44] Artem Bulashev: Hi ma you said you will need controller smaller than 70mm ENNOID Starting the testing of those freshly designed 100V|75A ESC this week with my EBMS. Should be good for up to 20S in a 70mm x 75mm x 16mm package.
[2021-07-04T20:45:26] Artem Bulashev: This may be what you need, but those guys prices are really high for BMS so not sure about vesc pricing strategy they will have
[2021-07-04T20:45:46] Artem Bulashev: 75a is battery current 👌
[2021-07-04T20:46:22] Artem Bulashev: https://www.ennoid.me/esc

[2021-07-04T21:14:13] Happy Giraffe: I think Ubox single could be more reliable🤔 Should just fit in but I wait for the final dimentions
[2021-07-05T19:06:18] rosheee: Only 2 pole on mt5e Connect different because u have signal in and a connection cut in the lever itself Signal in - cut in brake which doesn't allow to control the brake power on the motor itself
[2021-07-05T19:06:23] rosheee: Only to cut signal
[2021-07-05T19:32:41] rosheee: That is what primary importer of magura switzerland said
[2021-07-05T19:34:26] rosheee: Thx not living in EU 😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2021-07-05T19:37:19] Happy Giraffe: There are two versions of Magura lever sensors, normally closed and normally open.
[2021-07-05T19:37:31] rosheee: Yep
[2021-07-05T19:38:05] Happy Giraffe: Vesc (Ubox) takes normally open what Ive heard
[2021-07-05T19:38:33] rosheee: Try it I just use brake that's it. No e brake
[2021-07-05T19:38:58] rosheee: I have 2 pairs brake lever from spintend to sell Should arrive this week
[2021-07-05T19:39:00] Happy Giraffe: Btw nice Forza driving😂
[2021-07-05T19:39:23] rosheee: Long time not playd
[2021-07-05T19:39:52] rosheee: But still top 5% I think
[2021-07-05T19:39:59] rosheee: But doesn't matter
[2021-07-05T19:40:03] Happy Giraffe: Me neither, wheel in Finland and PC in Denmark😭
[2021-07-05T19:48:18] rosheee: But try the mt5e
[2021-07-05T19:48:30] rosheee: I stick to bigger one and shimano discs
[2021-07-05T19:48:43] rosheee: Magura discs arrived today for other scooter
[2021-07-05T19:55:24] Happy Giraffe: Or the CMe5
[2021-07-05T19:55:38] Happy Giraffe: More metal construction

[2021-07-08T11:49:25] Happy Giraffe: In 120kmh scooter?!
[2021-07-08T11:49:57] Tudor: Its matters?
[2021-07-08T11:50:07] Happy Giraffe: Very much
[2021-07-08T11:50:10] Mirono escooters: I got 160 on my 50kmh m365 lol
[2021-07-08T11:50:37] Tudor: It doesnt matter
[2021-07-08T11:50:38] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-07-08T11:50:40] Tudor: This isnt a car
[2021-07-08T11:50:52] Tudor: As long as the brakes lock the wheel
[2021-07-08T11:51:12] Tudor: You can achieve that woth 120, 140 160 and so on
[2021-07-08T11:51:12] Happy Giraffe: Brake fade with rion gonna be fun😂
[2021-07-08T11:51:33] Tudor: If you look at the working surface on all this discs is the same
[2021-07-08T11:52:00] Tudor: @Mirono_escooters Even if you have 160 working surface is the same
[2021-07-08T11:52:08] Face de Pin Sucé: of course it matters
[2021-07-08T11:52:09] Mirono escooters: I know
[2021-07-08T11:52:12] Happy Giraffe: There are differences, like the 135mm alu disc is a toy
[2021-07-08T11:52:13] Mirono escooters: I got bigger brake in mail
[2021-07-08T11:52:26] Face de Pin Sucé: bigger brakes = less heat
[2021-07-08T11:52:27] Happy Giraffe: 140mm steel one much better, 160mm Magura best
[2021-07-08T11:52:29] Mirono escooters: 160mm has more surface area to get rid of heat tho
[2021-07-08T11:52:30] Tudor: I have 140 and 160 on my maxes both lock the wheels
[2021-07-08T11:52:32] Happy Giraffe: +1 IQ
[2021-07-08T11:52:44] Face de Pin Sucé: if it heats too much, then you lose brakes
[2021-07-08T11:52:57] Tudor: This isn't a car mate
[2021-07-08T11:53:02] Face de Pin Sucé: And I can tell, it happened to me
[2021-07-08T11:53:10] Tudor: Matter also what kind of discs you have
[2021-07-08T11:53:23] Tudor: Of they are vented properly
[2021-07-08T11:53:24] Happy Giraffe: 120kmh is 125cc motorcycle speeds haha
[2021-07-08T11:53:38] Face de Pin Sucé: 110-0 Kmh with 160 mm MDR-C Magura and it became red
[2021-07-08T11:53:48] Face de Pin Sucé: after that no brakes for couple of seconds
[2021-07-08T11:53:49] Happy Giraffe: Oh damn
[2021-07-08T11:53:50] Mirono escooters: 160mm look cooler too
[2021-07-08T11:53:58] Mirono escooters: Drum brakes suck. Cant see shit and maintenance sucks aswell
[2021-07-08T11:54:08] Face de Pin Sucé: and if you do that few times quickly, you can't brake anymore while cornering
[2021-07-08T11:54:09] Tudor: That on happen if you use all 4 brakes
[2021-07-08T11:54:21] Tudor: E brakes and both mechanical

[2021-07-08T12:01:55] Mirono escooters: Dies
[2021-07-08T12:03:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i spent 2 hours on VESC forum this morning. very interesting talks there. not the first i read their forum, but since i better understand now, it's becoming more and more interesting
[2021-07-08T12:04:06] Mirono escooters: Vesc is very interesting
[2021-07-08T12:04:11] Mirono escooters: What did you read about?
[2021-07-08T12:05:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and one definitive conclusion, flipsky 7550 is pure crap, i won't even continue working with that, it's an unfinished clone of A200s vesc with a looooot of missing fixes. almost impossible to make it work in this current state, and too hard to modify.
[2021-07-08T12:05:36] Mirono escooters: Fak
[2021-07-08T12:05:38] Mirono escooters: Expensive shit

[2021-07-08T12:06:14] Face de Pin Sucé: this is beautiful
[2021-07-08T12:06:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a200s story, uart/dual, settings with dead time and commutation time (often not set correctly) and other things
[2021-07-08T12:06:51] Mirono escooters: Sounds.. fun😅
[2021-07-08T12:07:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😁😁
[2021-07-08T12:07:02] Mirono escooters: Im more hardware. Wish i could program and stuff
[2021-07-08T12:07:46] Mirono escooters: Did you fix yours with new stm ps?
[2021-07-08T12:07:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on escooter, the only thing which 'scare' me is battery.
[2021-07-08T12:08:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the removed bursted stm32 ?
[2021-07-08T12:08:23] Mirono escooters: If u handle it good it wont do anything
[2021-07-08T12:08:26] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2021-07-08T12:08:46] Mirono escooters: Im constantly surrounded by batteries. Its safe if not mishandled
[2021-07-08T12:08:56] Mirono escooters: I got 2000 or so in my workroom. all stacked good
[2021-07-08T12:09:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, and after reading the a200s story, i won't. i have 1 'working' 7550, but in fact, it can't really work with decent specs. the other 7550 is dead
[2021-07-08T12:09:29] Mirono escooters: Takes so long
[2021-07-08T12:09:40] Mirono escooters: Pft. Shit
[2021-07-08T12:09:48] Mirono escooters: Cant u mod it to death?
[2021-07-08T12:09:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: now, i'll try the spintend on my boosted rev and the etwow... will be much more interesting
[2021-07-08T12:10:13] Mirono escooters: Sounds good!

[2021-07-08T12:11:12] Face de Pin Sucé: I'll pm you :D
[2021-07-08T12:11:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thanks, will remember. i'll try a bit, but if i can't manage, i'll give some money to make it.
[2021-07-08T12:11:45] Mirono escooters: If its for someone who makes open source stuff, i dont mind working for free (just pay stuff)
[2021-07-08T12:11:54] Mirono escooters: Or trade me a vesc display : D
[2021-07-08T12:12:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for the boosted rev, the biggest issue is the really weird form of the needed pack
[2021-07-08T12:12:11] Mirono escooters: 3d print custom holders?
[2021-07-08T12:12:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: that, we should be able to do 🤣🤣
[2021-07-08T12:12:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope
[2021-07-08T12:12:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 2s
[2021-07-08T12:12:45] Mirono escooters: I rlly want a vesc display :) only thing i miss
[2021-07-08T12:12:55] Mirono escooters: Flipsky one is 45€ and decent

[2021-07-08T12:13:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: note the elevated part at the front
[2021-07-08T12:13:12] Mirono escooters: But not even 2 uart things or whqtever for throttle and brake :=
[2021-07-08T12:13:52] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 hah :)) should not come as a surprised. I have never heard for one to work for extended time ever :)
[2021-07-08T12:14:18] Happy Giraffe: How isnt their warranty full?
[2021-07-08T12:14:29] Artem Bulashev: What’s the point
[2021-07-08T12:14:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahaha. i knew it had issues, but i didn't think it was sich shitty clone
[2021-07-08T12:14:37] Artem Bulashev: Replacement is going to die same way
[2021-07-08T12:14:51] Happy Giraffe: Should not be profitable
[2021-07-08T12:14:58] Artem Bulashev: It’s like buying broken eggs 😵‍💫
[2021-07-08T12:15:38] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_513@08-07-2021_12-15-38.jpg>
[2021-07-08T12:15:40] Artem Bulashev: Fact is they probably can dismiss most cases - oh you opened it, oh you cut wire wrong, oh that and that
[2021-07-08T12:15:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and bottom of the boosted wew battery :

[2021-07-14T14:11:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_554@14-07-2021_14-11-33.jpg>

[2021-07-14T14:12:47] Artem Bulashev: Not sure that you mean :) this on photo is 6P There is never high current flow between cells in Parallel Current flows though series. In between parallel cell only if one cell voltage goes lower than other, than current will try to equalize
[2021-07-14T14:12:51] Unknown: My home printer she have a bigger sister in the factory
[2021-07-14T14:17:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_555@14-07-2021_14-17-57.jpg>

[2021-07-14T14:49:30] Unknown: Make the Nickelstrip longer on the sides you need to bend
[2021-07-14T14:49:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok 👍
[2021-07-14T15:04:57] francois schempers: thats my future pack, with 150A bms :3

[2021-07-14T15:06:16] Unknown: Welcome to jihaddd club ..
[2021-07-14T15:06:18] Happy Giraffe: He splits the batt
[2021-07-14T15:06:41] Unknown: Still we're to put??
[2021-07-14T15:06:54] Happy Giraffe: Great way to have more space in body
[2021-07-14T15:07:04] Happy Giraffe: Body and two bags maybe
[2021-07-14T15:07:28] Happy Giraffe: I prefer jihad
[2021-07-14T15:07:45] Unknown: Only with bag
[2021-07-14T15:08:12] Happy Giraffe: Now with rita jihad is safer as external batt connection isnt online due to diodes👀

[2021-07-14T15:11:01] Unknown: And I thought my pack will be crazy...
[2021-07-14T15:11:13] francois schempers: and since vtc6 can handle those easily, I can put crazy Ebrakes because backemf can mitigated entirely in the battery
[2021-07-14T15:15:19] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-07-14T15:15:32] Happy Giraffe: If you have front disc you might not need them much
[2021-07-14T15:15:44] Artem Bulashev: Over all seems good design. I would do few things - 2 long layers and one short layer (that would result in shorter wiring to bms from far side. - use 25mm nickel strip and weld it together (it’s easier to work with than many individual strips, it has more area so can conduct more, heat up less, reduce voltage sag)
[2021-07-14T15:16:35] francois schempers: if I have 30A battery charge current, I can put something like 60A brakes, so that the fets have some work too, I think it will be enough ^^'
[2021-07-14T15:17:09] francois schempers: and o boy, I must find a 20A 15s charger 😂😂
[2021-07-14T15:17:26] Happy Giraffe: Lol, 2x ebrakes and front + rear hydros will stop you like a wall

[2021-07-14T15:23:41] Mirono escooters: I got dual brake+ ebrakr Works well
[2021-07-14T15:43:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thanks for your intel. do you have a link for 25mm stripes ? for the long/short, i didn't understand 😅
[2021-07-14T15:45:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: something like that ?
[2021-07-14T15:45:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: € 4,04 30%de réduction | Bande de Nickel pur pour soudage par points de batterie, 100cm 25mm x 0.15mm, Li 18650 https://a.aliexpress.com/_uWmJF7

[2021-07-14T15:46:27] Tudor: 😅😅😅
[2021-07-14T15:47:03] Tudor: <video_file>
[2021-07-14T15:47:16] Artem Bulashev: Than you just set a 2s6p, weld it both, flip and weld 6p more, flip and weld 6p more. Than fold them 👌
[2021-07-14T15:47:25] Artem Bulashev: Fast and easy to work
[2021-07-14T15:48:14] Artem Bulashev: Don’t mean to be THAT guy, but VESC group ;-)
[2021-07-14T15:50:19] francois schempers: BOY !!!
[2021-07-14T15:50:38] Tudor: Yeah i know ....

[2021-07-14T16:02:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Old vs new
[2021-07-14T16:04:10] francois schempers: oof x)
[2021-07-14T16:23:40] Happy Giraffe: Not for PC😔
[2021-07-14T18:14:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I looked at this video to learn how to build battery packs. First video I see explaining all steps very clearly ... si I share ;)
[2021-07-14T18:14:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QjO90LG67g
[2021-07-14T20:06:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I also found my battery design ;) well, almost since it's 12s and not 13s
[2021-07-14T20:41:21] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-07-14T20:41:57] Artem Bulashev: Using folding 25mm strip rather than that will give lower overall pack resistance and reduce sag alittle bit
[2021-07-14T20:42:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah
[2021-07-14T20:42:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's just an example found on a website ;)
[2021-07-14T22:45:21] Unknown: Samsung t40 or molicel p42a? Molicel has been put of stock for a while now.. not sure if i wanna wait weeks for them 😬
[2021-07-14T22:46:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 30q. can't fit 3 layers of 21700 in the boosted rev
[2021-07-14T22:46:25] francois schempers: sony murata vtc6 are a good 18650 alternative to samsung 40t
[2021-07-14T22:48:51] Unknown: I want 21700's for sure lol, i was planning to mut them vertical anyway. Using a bottom extender
[2021-07-14T22:59:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1 for vtc6
[2021-07-14T23:00:03] Artem Bulashev: It’s not ultimate
[2021-07-14T23:00:23] Artem Bulashev: It has less WH than 35e on loads up to 1-7amps
[2021-07-14T23:00:27] francois schempers: 18650 allow for higher wh density
[2021-07-14T23:00:40] Unknown: Really?
[2021-07-14T23:01:18] Artem Bulashev: You really need to first identify what your typical current will be
[2021-07-14T23:01:58] francois schempers: imagine a bol, fill it with beads, lots of air between them, fill it with sand, lot less air, more dense. in the end, the smaller the diameter, the more you can fit with less air space wasted
[2021-07-14T23:02:44] Unknown: Hmmm that's interesting
[2021-07-14T23:02:52] francois schempers: vtc6 have triple the current ability than 35e, which is gold in our scenario, lot less Vdrop
[2021-07-14T23:02:57] Artem Bulashev: Yes correct 18650 is more power dens
[2021-07-14T23:03:06] Unknown: So 18650 is good if u have loads of space , 21700 for less
[2021-07-14T23:03:11] Artem Bulashev: Correct but not every application will need that
[2021-07-14T23:03:21] francois schempers: inverse that
[2021-07-14T23:03:26] Unknown: Just more expensive in the end game with 18650
[2021-07-14T23:03:28] Unknown: Oh yeah
[2021-07-14T23:03:30] Unknown: My bad lolol
[2021-07-14T23:03:55] francois schempers: well my 15s10p off murata will cost around 1k€ x)
[2021-07-14T23:04:10] Unknown: My 12s9p of 50E was like £600 total :p
[2021-07-14T23:04:20] Unknown: Hm that's interesting tho
[2021-07-14T23:04:26] Unknown: I thought it was the other way
[2021-07-14T23:04:30] Artem Bulashev: For example 80% of my use will be 0-60amps and rarely 80amps My vtc6 would make no sense in 8p package because I would loose a lot of Wh and gain only lower battery temp
[2021-07-14T23:04:48] francois schempers: and less Vdrop
[2021-07-14T23:04:55] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-07-14T23:05:08] Unknown: How does that work btw
[2021-07-14T23:05:10] francois schempers: a 12s of vtc would perform as well as 13s of 35e
[2021-07-14T23:05:13] Artem Bulashev: Wh accounts for that
[2021-07-14T23:05:13] Unknown: This
[2021-07-14T23:05:22] Artem Bulashev: So vtc6 would not be better
[2021-07-14T23:05:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2021-07-14T23:05:43] Artem Bulashev: 3500mah cell
[2021-07-14T23:05:47] Artem Bulashev: 35e
[2021-07-14T23:05:52] Unknown: Ohh ok
[2021-07-14T23:05:54] Unknown: I see
[2021-07-14T23:05:57] Unknown: I was assuming same capacity
[2021-07-14T23:06:01] Artem Bulashev: But less max amp it can give
[2021-07-14T23:06:15] Unknown: Didnt read which cell oop
[2021-07-14T23:06:27] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-07-14T23:06:30] Unknown: Hm then I'm glad I went with my 50E only 10A per cell for my ebike
[2021-07-14T23:06:42] Artem Bulashev: Good choice
[2021-07-14T23:06:50] Artem Bulashev: Best cell for 10amp would be g50 it has most wh at 10amps laod
[2021-07-14T23:06:55] francois schempers: 12s of vtc perfom as well as 13s of 35e, so it does perform better, we just don't agree on whats important, I prefer torque and top speed, you prefer range
[2021-07-14T23:07:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: beside discharge current, what matters is Wh/litter if you want compact battery 😉
[2021-07-14T23:07:43] Unknown: I was gonna go for higher current for less vdrop but vdrop is amazing at 60A so I'm happy
[2021-07-14T23:07:51] Unknown: Temps are better on 21700 right or wrong?
[2021-07-14T23:08:24] francois schempers: 21700 usually have higher A discharge roof, so less heat
[2021-07-14T23:08:38] francois schempers: but all depends on witch cell you want
[2021-07-14T23:08:48] Unknown: Discharge roof?
[2021-07-14T23:08:50] Unknown: Ohh the tabs
[2021-07-14T23:08:51] Unknown: Terminals
[2021-07-14T23:08:52] Mirono escooters: Energy density is usually better too
[2021-07-14T23:09:08] francois schempers: max current
[2021-07-14T23:09:45] francois schempers: discharging 5A on a cell that have a max current of 10 will make it heat up more than a cell with a 30A max current
[2021-07-14T23:09:47] Artem Bulashev: Of the cell yes, of the pack not necessarily at all. It more depends on the dimensions of the space you have
[2021-07-14T23:10:48] Artem Bulashev: Average voltage is higher, so they have more Wh even with same Ah discharge Temp per C discharge really depend on specific cell model
[2021-07-14T23:10:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: max for 21700 is 40t with 35A, right ?
[2021-07-14T23:11:07] Artem Bulashev: Yeap agree
[2021-07-14T23:11:07] Mirono escooters: Cell
[2021-07-14T23:11:19] Artem Bulashev: Yes that is like 3.5c
[2021-07-14T23:11:48] francois schempers: oh we are fancy now we talkin in coulon ? 🤣🤣
[2021-07-14T23:14:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and max for 18650 is vtc6 with 30A. not such a difference considering the volume of 21700
[2021-07-14T23:14:42] francois schempers: yeah but 40t have more Ah no ?
[2021-07-14T23:14:53] Artem Bulashev: Yeas
[2021-07-14T23:15:27] Artem Bulashev: So we have 30a / 3a = 10c And 35a / 4a = 8.75C discharge
[2021-07-14T23:15:38] francois schempers: but cant the difference in Ah be mitigated with the added cells 18650 would allow in the same space ?
[2021-07-14T23:15:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, 4000ma
[2021-07-14T23:15:47] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-07-14T23:15:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly
[2021-07-14T23:16:08] francois schempers: so vtc6 is better then ^^
[2021-07-14T23:16:11] francois schempers: just more expensive
[2021-07-14T23:16:29] Artem Bulashev: 6p 21700 = 7p 18650
[2021-07-14T23:16:42] Artem Bulashev: 18 vs 21
[2021-07-14T23:16:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we made the calculation, in the same volume, we can put less Ah in the same volume with 21700 than 18650
[2021-07-14T23:17:09] Artem Bulashev: Same
[2021-07-14T23:17:20] Artem Bulashev: But always look at Wh
[2021-07-14T23:17:22] Artem Bulashev: Not Ah
[2021-07-14T23:17:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with the same discharge current
[2021-07-14T23:17:30] francois schempers: so we all agree that vtc6 are superior ? 😂😂
[2021-07-14T23:17:35] Unknown: No
[2021-07-14T23:17:36] Artem Bulashev: 21700 would probably have more Wh than 18650
[2021-07-14T23:17:42] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-07-14T23:17:44] francois schempers: xD
[2021-07-14T23:17:47] Unknown: Lol
[2021-07-14T23:17:48] Artem Bulashev: 😂
[2021-07-14T23:17:58] Unknown: I always disagree
[2021-07-14T23:18:05] francois schempers: ofc ;)
[2021-07-14T23:18:21] Artem Bulashev: Man this subject, hard to deliver it all at once so that very one would get that there is no best
[2021-07-14T23:18:27] francois schempers: <sticker>
[2021-07-14T23:18:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no need to talk, compute 😁😁
[2021-07-14T23:18:46] Artem Bulashev: It 18650 or 21700 dépend only on proportions of your space for battery
[2021-07-14T23:18:53] Unknown: But i hate this battery discussions go to Lygne watch the curves and decide easy
[2021-07-14T23:19:17] Unknown: Artem i thought that
[2021-07-14T23:19:21] Artem Bulashev: Agree. But always ALWAY LOOK at wh not Ah
[2021-07-14T23:19:28] Unknown: You eat Wikipedia men
[2021-07-14T23:20:15] Unknown: I think you are data from star trek
[2021-07-14T23:21:10] francois schempers: what's the charge rate of 40t compared to vtc6 ?
[2021-07-14T23:21:19] Artem Bulashev: https://lygte-info.dk/info/batteryIndex.html Go here And set it as - 21700 or 18650 depending what you want to see - discharge rate you most care about (typical) + max you will ever have - 3.0v (this will show wh in discharge 4.2v -> 3.0v) - mWh
[2021-07-14T23:21:50] Unknown: https://www.ksr-moto.com/de/amperestunden-oder-wattstunden/
[2021-07-14T23:22:25] Artem Bulashev: All li ion is same 0.35-0.5c recommended depending on model, not size Fast change 0.5c-1c depending on model, not size I would advice stay at 0.25 or bellow for long life
[2021-07-14T23:22:34] Unknown: Only for you my mountain German...
[2021-07-14T23:23:14] francois schempers: some of them are fast charge capable ;)
[2021-07-14T23:23:19] Unknown: We call the austrians mountain Germans...lol
[2021-07-14T23:23:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol. battery fight tonight 😁
[2021-07-14T23:23:34] Unknown: Yes.... I'm in mood
[2021-07-14T23:23:40] Artem Bulashev: Some Models, not specifically 21700 or 18650 ;-)
[2021-07-14T23:23:51] Unknown: I had this discussions for over an year
[2021-07-14T23:24:05] Unknown: My ex partner was a battery nazi
[2021-07-14T23:24:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: does sony make 21700.?
[2021-07-14T23:24:56] Unknown: Lot of Talking not much welding...
[2021-07-14T23:24:58] Unknown: Lol
[2021-07-14T23:25:09] Artem Bulashev: Great point, but in terms of Wh capasity of individual cell slightly different point :) Nominal voltage will be same, but voltage sag on good 21700 is typically less which means they get more Wh per Ah of discharge
[2021-07-14T23:25:22] francois schempers: <animation>
[2021-07-14T23:25:38] Unknown: I thought that..... That you will discuss...
[2021-07-14T23:25:43] Artem Bulashev: Did he only buy new and perfect cells, and returned all the cheapos?
[2021-07-14T23:26:07] Artem Bulashev: 😄
[2021-07-14T23:26:23] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2021-07-14T23:26:26] Unknown: I only do new ones to customers... Refurbished only for inside testing
[2021-07-14T23:26:45] Artem Bulashev: Agree 👌
[2021-07-14T23:26:48] Unknown: I had some bad apples in new ones
[2021-07-14T23:26:54] Unknown: But only a few
[2021-07-14T23:27:29] Artem Bulashev: I can’t see how 200€ saving would justify house burning down or you your self burning alive
[2021-07-14T23:27:49] Unknown: Because of you guys I'm making 13s 15s and 16s
[2021-07-14T23:27:50] Artem Bulashev: In power wall it may be different story
[2021-07-14T23:27:59] Unknown: My hole system runs on 10s
[2021-07-14T23:28:11] Unknown: With 10s i got 55 KmH
[2021-07-14T23:28:20] Unknown: That's enough for every day
[2021-07-14T23:28:35] Unknown: My solar charging runs on 10s
[2021-07-14T23:28:50] Unknown: My planned powerwall will run on 10s
[2021-07-14T23:29:06] Artem Bulashev: Agree I would not want to have my scooter go above 48-52kmh
[2021-07-14T23:29:09] Unknown: The ebike of my wife runs on 10s
[2021-07-14T23:29:27] Unknown: For race i will make a 20s
[2021-07-14T23:29:46] Unknown: To fuck RS and other guys ...
[2021-07-14T23:29:51] Artem Bulashev: But it would take many amps and heat to get to 55kmh on 10s
[2021-07-14T23:29:59] Unknown: Nooooo
[2021-07-14T23:30:03] Unknown: It's bullshit
[2021-07-14T23:30:09] Artem Bulashev: Well yeah
[2021-07-14T23:30:10] francois schempers: he is doing delta shit x)
[2021-07-14T23:30:11] Artem Bulashev: Kv
[2021-07-14T23:30:12] Unknown: You don't understand delta
[2021-07-14T23:30:32] Unknown: Delta will be game changing
[2021-07-14T23:30:42] Unknown: No more volt race
[2021-07-14T23:30:47] Unknown: And pack race
[2021-07-14T23:30:48] Artem Bulashev: You said your self, that you had 50 amps continuous and it found spike to like 100a
[2021-07-14T23:31:01] Unknown: I will show the values
[2021-07-14T23:31:24] Unknown: Wait my little friend
[2021-07-14T23:31:54] Artem Bulashev: I can do 50kmh on 28a vesc single motor at 14s and no heat :)
[2021-07-14T23:32:06] Artem Bulashev: That’s half the amps to get nearly same speed
[2021-07-14T23:32:20] Artem Bulashev: 16s would do 57kmh on same 28amps
[2021-07-14T23:32:39] francois schempers: Vesc is much more expensive to the end consumer ^^
[2021-07-14T23:32:41] Unknown: Me too I have an efficient cfw that will kill your dreams
[2021-07-14T23:33:27] Unknown: I'm experimenting on the higher end but young people want speed and torque
[2021-07-14T23:33:38] Unknown: Not efficiency
[2021-07-14T23:33:48] Unknown: That's the barrier
[2021-07-14T23:33:52] Artem Bulashev: 240€ for dual Channel? I can live with that :)
[2021-07-14T23:34:00] Unknown: And no plug and play product out

[2021-07-14T23:39:54] Unknown: I've got cf filament too
[2021-07-14T23:40:07] Artem Bulashev: Like the texture of those
[2021-07-14T23:40:07] francois schempers: start from sheets metal, much cheaper to masse produce
[2021-07-14T23:40:11] francois schempers: https://youtu.be/8cNeAOpR-Ws

[2021-07-14T23:43:09] Unknown: Scooters on the roof
[2021-07-14T23:43:09] francois schempers: anyway, a case made this way would be much more strong and have a truly metal finish (and cheap)
[2021-07-14T23:43:59] Unknown: Maybe for us in metal and for consumers in abs or some fiber Glass shite..
[2021-07-14T23:45:21] francois schempers: I means, even for consumer, you could do several while a printer is only starting, some welding and grinding and polishing later, you end up with I high quality product
[2021-07-14T23:45:34] francois schempers: @koxx3 maybe something to think on
[2021-07-14T23:45:36] Unknown: Yes of course

[2021-07-14T23:48:58] Unknown: Of course it's bs but what to expect for 6000 euro
[2021-07-14T23:49:36] Unknown: I will make it drive 150 kmh
[2021-07-14T23:50:24] francois schempers: buy it for 3000 without battery, and make 10k investment to make a race car out of it xD
[2021-07-14T23:50:25] Unknown: The ticket to my factory cost me 220 euro per month

[2021-07-14T23:51:14] Unknown: But sometimes it's rainy
[2021-07-14T23:51:24] Happy Giraffe: I just wanted to show some love😘
[2021-07-14T23:52:08] Unknown: I haven't a car now for the years..
[2021-07-14T23:52:13] Happy Giraffe: Afterall I think I use max 40batt amps with vesc as I try to use rita with it😂
[2021-07-14T23:52:31] Unknown: And will not drive or have a combustion car anymore
[2021-07-14T23:52:45] Unknown: Nutty boy
[2021-07-14T23:52:50] francois schempers: this will be plenty enough, you can still put 100A on phase for startup torque
[2021-07-14T23:53:10] Happy Giraffe: Yep😉
[2021-07-14T23:53:44] Happy Giraffe: FOC vesc is gonna be multiple times the torque of xiaomi lol
[2021-07-14T23:54:00] Happy Giraffe: I will dyno it lol
[2021-07-14T23:54:11] francois schempers: it is already ^^ I can tell you that x)
[2021-07-14T23:54:34] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-07-14T23:54:42] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-07-14T23:55:05] Artem Bulashev: If you get proper motor and not stock :)
[2021-07-14T23:55:06] Happy Giraffe: I wanna have the time to blink somewhere when accelerating
[2021-07-14T23:55:12] Artem Bulashev: And I know you will get 1000w
[2021-07-14T23:55:44] Unknown: And @Tudor_VTA I'm a big fan of god of war but i play stadia, i don't think we can cross play. Are you missing RS ?
[2021-07-14T23:55:45] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_563@14-07-2021_23-55-45.jpg>
[2021-07-14T23:55:50] Happy Giraffe: Already waiting for some love
[2021-07-14T23:56:23] Unknown: You will get a delta kit, i wanna save you...
[2021-07-14T23:56:33] Happy Giraffe: Naah, I go vesc
[2021-07-14T23:56:50] Unknown: With delta🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
[2021-07-14T23:57:15] francois schempers: deltaing a 1000w motor would be a fun experiment ^^
[2021-07-14T23:57:19] Happy Giraffe: I want efficiency👀
[2021-07-14T23:57:25] Happy Giraffe: Yes...
[2021-07-14T23:57:37] Unknown: Crazy experiment
[2021-07-14T23:57:48] Unknown: Only for us maybe
[2021-07-14T23:58:13] Unknown: I want to give away 4 kits
[2021-07-14T23:58:18] Mirono escooters: I'd be interested in that delta mod :) With graphs and torque vs speed before and afger
[2021-07-14T23:58:22] Mirono escooters: Generous
[2021-07-14T23:58:23] francois schempers: https://youtu.be/sda0Z9j2SbI
[2021-07-14T23:58:28] Mirono escooters: I'd pay for the kit
[2021-07-14T23:59:08] Unknown: Now it's handmade and pretty expensive
[2021-07-14T23:59:25] Unknown: But 13s and 15s batts too
[2021-07-14T23:59:46] Unknown: Controller shite modification
[2021-07-15T00:00:26] Unknown: The delta frees me from 13s 16s and controller problems....
[2021-07-15T00:00:57] Happy Giraffe: There has to be cop mode for disabling delta that also does locked vesc profile with same remote
[2021-07-15T00:01:37] Happy Giraffe: But yeah, we need some graphs delta vs star 👀
[2021-07-15T00:01:57] Happy Giraffe: Test results with consumption etc
[2021-07-15T00:02:57] Unknown: My new worker did 91 KmH on delta 16s
[2021-07-15T00:03:01] Unknown: Gps
[2021-07-15T00:03:16] Unknown: But he burned the controller...
[2021-07-15T00:03:37] Unknown: So g30 controller only safe until 15s
[2021-07-15T00:03:43] Mirono escooters: Isn't delta less efficient
[2021-07-15T00:03:52] Mirono escooters: Or mod it hard
[2021-07-15T00:03:54] francois schempers: hum, I'm not too impressed, 16s with Vesc could make 80 I think
[2021-07-15T00:03:58] Unknown: On higher speeds no
[2021-07-15T00:04:04] Unknown: I think star is good for low speed torque and then
[2021-07-15T00:04:05] Unknown: Yeah
[2021-07-15T00:04:08] Unknown: Answered
[2021-07-15T00:04:10] Mirono escooters: My ffiend got my g30 controller 84v 20s hitted 78
[2021-07-15T00:04:22] Mirono escooters: Not delta tho
[2021-07-15T00:04:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: holy sh*t ! 😳 very impressive !!! first time i see that
[2021-07-15T00:04:25] Unknown: Right
[2021-07-15T00:05:22] Unknown: Welcome into my world
[2021-07-15T00:32:13] Unknown: And koxx for your first packs use https://www.repackr.com/
[2021-07-15T00:32:49] Unknown: Repackr gives you a sense to cells..
[2021-07-15T00:34:38] Unknown: Hmmkkayy guys so I wanna finally revive my scooter Since my external got stolen I haven't used my scooter just ebike All I have is my 12s5p sanyo GA I want 15s, what is best to do: Make 3s10p extension for one bag then another 12s5p Or strip my 12s5p, use cells for another project and then get new cells for scooter and make what I want?
[2021-07-15T00:34:58] Unknown: Or even 20s I'm thinking lololol
[2021-07-15T00:35:19] Unknown: Please don't do the 3s mod
[2021-07-15T00:35:29] Unknown: Oh no I mean
[2021-07-15T00:35:42] Unknown: Connect 12s5p+12s5p+3s10p
[2021-07-15T00:35:46] Unknown: Not trace cut
[2021-07-15T00:35:50] Unknown: Connect battery in series
[2021-07-15T00:35:59] Unknown: Or just.. no
[2021-07-15T00:36:05] Unknown: Im against it
[2021-07-15T00:36:25] Unknown: Probably cheaper , easier to just strip and create new 15s pack and connect parallel
[2021-07-15T00:36:30] Unknown: Less problem too
[2021-07-15T00:36:46] Unknown: Do it properly...
[2021-07-15T00:36:48] Unknown: Cos sanyo GA is super expensive now I won't buy more for packs for scooter
[2021-07-15T00:36:58] Unknown: I'll use my 50 cells for another project
[2021-07-15T00:37:09] Unknown: I want to make big power bank 😂 and few other projects
[2021-07-15T00:37:18] Unknown: I know i paid 18 euro for two
[2021-07-15T00:37:22] Unknown: But sanyo GA is too good for that
[2021-07-15T00:37:29] Unknown: Just to finish the pack
[2021-07-15T00:37:30] Unknown: Wtf I thought 4£ was bad
[2021-07-15T00:37:43] Unknown: Now they're not even In stock.. anywhere
[2021-07-15T00:38:00] Unknown: Is it even worth keep spending money on Xiaomi
[2021-07-15T00:38:06] Unknown: I know I'm in a cell depression
[2021-07-15T00:38:09] Unknown: Yes who am I kidding shit is fun
[2021-07-15T00:38:22] Unknown: Hmm 15s or 20s
[2021-07-15T00:38:36] Unknown: Cell money better then bitcoins
[2021-07-15T00:39:10] Artem Bulashev: Yes in 85 on average kv MW, take higher KV and you will do 100kmh but will loose torque. Benefit of delta is that it has more torque and residency - if one phase breaks it can continue working one just 2 phases.
[2021-07-15T00:39:14] Unknown: I don't want to build with refurbished or Chinese shite
[2021-07-15T00:39:40] Unknown: Same I don't like the idea of refurbished cells I want new
[2021-07-15T00:39:49] Unknown: But maybe there is little other ways for now...
[2021-07-15T00:40:03] Unknown: For customers i only use new
[2021-07-15T00:40:24] Unknown: For myself or company i don't care
[2021-07-15T00:40:27] Unknown: Guys is it worth going 15s/20s on xiaomi or should I revive scooter, and sell? Get bigger one
[2021-07-15T00:40:37] Unknown: Testpacks
[2021-07-15T00:40:42] Mirono escooters: 15s is great
[2021-07-15T00:40:45] Mirono escooters: 20s is beast
[2021-07-15T00:40:59] Unknown: Depends on your speed
[2021-07-15T00:41:05] Unknown: 20s vesc will be so expensive maybe I just go 15s
[2021-07-15T00:41:09] Unknown: Hmm I'll be happy with like
[2021-07-15T00:41:11] Unknown: Xiaomi frame is limited
[2021-07-15T00:41:12] Artem Bulashev: They have same Wh capacity as 35e on loads up to 7amps. but cost 20% more, so Ga worth it only if you plan to draw over 7amps per cell and max out out is your key, not efficiency. If you plan to be 5-10amps per cell, than ga and 35e will be same and will actually heat up similarly at 10amps load
[2021-07-15T00:41:14] Unknown: 50.......?
[2021-07-15T00:41:37] Unknown: Wikipedia Artem again
[2021-07-15T00:41:38] Unknown: Interesting
[2021-07-15T00:41:41] Unknown: 😂😂😂😂😂
[2021-07-15T00:41:49] Unknown: Well I have 50 cells to my disposal so
[2021-07-15T00:42:07] Unknown: Maybe I can make a high power power bank
[2021-07-15T00:42:17] Unknown: Shit you have knowledge Oreos at morning
[2021-07-15T00:42:20] Artem Bulashev: S count is basically your top speed + slight improvement in acceleration 10kmh-max speed
[2021-07-15T00:42:39] Unknown: Ofc :p
[2021-07-15T00:42:44] Unknown: 20s on vesc what speed ?
[2021-07-15T00:42:47] Unknown: Average
[2021-07-15T00:42:50] Unknown: Compared to 15s
[2021-07-15T00:43:32] Unknown: Only need 2s with Stepdown for phone charger right ?
[2021-07-15T00:43:41] Unknown: Shite @artBula you're a Wikipedia ak47
[2021-07-15T00:44:22] Artem Bulashev: Lol I basically memorised wh discharge curves for most top cells 18650 and 21700 🤣🤣 35e and Ga are top 18650 for loads up to 10amps, so them I know well. VTC for higher loads have no competitors in this size. So really one 3-4 cells to study closely.
[2021-07-15T00:44:52] Artem Bulashev: LG mh1 and mj1 also budget alternatives that are not bad 5-7amps per cell and cost effective
[2021-07-15T00:44:59] Unknown: If I do something like 2s10p that's 35Ah 🤪
[2021-07-15T00:45:07] Unknown: Hmmmm
[2021-07-15T00:45:08] Artem Bulashev: 21700 I don’t remember that well beside few
[2021-07-15T00:45:16] Unknown: Very informative
[2021-07-15T00:45:17] Unknown: Very nice
[2021-07-15T00:45:48] Unknown: Whats the speed difference between 15s and 20s
[2021-07-15T00:45:57] Unknown: A lot
[2021-07-15T00:46:00] Unknown: Cos maybe I just buy a broken body of a good scooter
[2021-07-15T00:46:04] Artem Bulashev: Funny part is that cheaper loader capacity mh1 actually can handle more amps discharge at less heat up than higher capasity and price mj1
[2021-07-15T00:46:09] Unknown: And work on it
[2021-07-15T00:46:25] Unknown: Funny Indeed
[2021-07-15T00:46:29] Unknown: I have 60 mh1
[2021-07-15T00:46:48] Artem Bulashev: Try Vsett group Vsett 10+ 25.6ah uses mh1 28ah version uses mj1 Both are 16s8p

[2021-07-15T00:47:34] Unknown: Thermo sprayed
[2021-07-15T00:47:40] Artem Bulashev: 😄 I’m thinking 18s set up
[2021-07-15T00:48:00] Unknown: Men i have so many packs
[2021-07-15T00:48:08] Unknown: 8kw
[2021-07-15T00:48:24] Artem Bulashev: Benefit of higher S count is that same 600w motor (legal appearance) will actually produce more power You know it, but for general public
[2021-07-15T00:48:25] Unknown: Or more
[2021-07-15T00:48:31] Artem Bulashev: Dam

A 4 year apprenticeship programme with Amazon in mechatronics r&d Opportunity to open a bike / ebike / escooter repair shop in partnership with a friend Opportunity to be part of founding team of a new upcoming PLEV company with loads of investments and potential What would u do and why?
[2021-07-15T12:22:23] Unknown: I've been scratching my head for months and leaning to one idea, then the other, then the other then loop again...
[2021-07-15T12:29:36] Unknown: Are you getting money in the plev company, ??? Will you learn something there. Im always inclined to say do a proper education..and mechatronics and r&d is pretty cool.
[2021-07-15T12:29:40] Unknown: But I'm sure you experienced guys could help me
[2021-07-15T12:30:47] Unknown: If you open a repair shop you will get nuts and you will need money..do a lot of shitty stuff how are your skills with burocracy???

[2021-07-15T12:33:55] Unknown: I cannot go to my factory.. no train driving....
[2021-07-15T12:34:28] Unknown: Fucking climate change..
[2021-07-15T12:34:49] Mirono escooters: Belgium aswell

[2021-07-15T12:37:02] Mirono escooters: Oh :/
[2021-07-15T12:48:32] Unknown: My end end goal is to one day have a brand/shop/shops which is focused around sustainable methods of transport and things like powerwalls, gadgets, RC toys etc
[2021-07-15T12:48:37] Unknown: Fuck
[2021-07-15T12:48:39] Unknown: :0
[2021-07-15T12:48:41] Unknown: Hope all is well
[2021-07-15T12:48:58] Unknown: Pfft the fact I had to Google the word shows it all, not too familiar
[2021-07-15T12:49:05] Unknown: I'm only 18
[2021-07-15T12:51:38] Unknown: Pros of Amazon is the qualification, money and knowledge Con is I'll be 4 years behind with the PLEV stuff when I finish
[2021-07-15T13:06:41] Unknown: I'm doing the same ...
[2021-07-15T13:09:15] Unknown: th-e-factory is not focussed only on batteries and emotors.. micromobility and overall solutions
[2021-07-15T13:14:10] Unknown: Yes that's what I want in future
[2021-07-15T13:14:20] Unknown: But I am just finding so hard to weigh up the odds and decide
[2021-07-15T13:51:45] Artem Bulashev: Amazon and open a shop on side
[2021-07-15T13:52:04] Unknown: Pfft shop would require 6 days a week dedication
[2021-07-15T13:52:13] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2021-07-15T13:52:17] Unknown: Since I'd be the only guy who can do the electric stuff my friend would do all mechanical stuff
[2021-07-15T13:52:22] Unknown: Ofc I've considered that
[2021-07-15T13:52:22] Unknown: Pkus
[2021-07-15T13:52:33] Unknown: Amazon is 1st year residential on campus 5 days a week
[2021-07-15T13:52:35] Artem Bulashev: Than evaluate what will have more long term benefits
[2021-07-15T13:52:45] Artem Bulashev: 1st or 3rd option
[2021-07-15T13:52:48] Unknown: It's hard because Amazon is guaranteed, the shop isn't
[2021-07-15T13:53:07] Unknown: Working as part of founding team will be for another brand
[2021-07-15T13:53:10] Unknown: Not my own
[2021-07-15T13:53:13] Artem Bulashev: Amazon is a system
[2021-07-15T13:53:28] Artem Bulashev: In big system it’s easier and faster to grow
[2021-07-15T13:53:59] Artem Bulashev: So consider where you will be financially with Amazon in 5 years and where you would be with other options
[2021-07-15T13:54:07] Unknown: Yeah just means working for someone else and not chasing my own brand for a few years
[2021-07-15T13:54:21] Unknown: I'm just scared that doing 4 years at Amazon will set me 4 years back with my knowledge and ability in PLEV
[2021-07-15T13:54:38] Artem Bulashev: Take as from self employed chasing my one brand person
[2021-07-15T13:54:45] Artem Bulashev: I work 20h a day
[2021-07-15T13:54:54] Unknown: Well in my theory the shop would make more money long term ... But that's a hope
[2021-07-15T13:55:18] Artem Bulashev: And my wife wishes I would just work for some one properly and not be stressed and pressed every day by my self
[2021-07-15T13:56:19] Artem Bulashev: Can option 2 and 3 co exist?
[2021-07-15T13:56:46] Unknown: 😭😂
[2021-07-15T13:56:46] Unknown: I'm dedicated when I have a goal
[2021-07-15T13:56:46] Unknown: Like when I was building by batteries
[2021-07-15T13:56:46] Unknown: I'd wake up 8am, build until 8am and sleep how much I need , and repeat
[2021-07-15T14:06:16] Artem Bulashev: Well to decide you would have to look at the numbers Amazon has specific Carear development plan where it will be possible to see what it will be like working there for 5 years and where you would end up Your business plan also should be created for 3-5 years and thus you should be able to compare Start up you spoke about I can’t say anything as I know nothing about it but they should have business plan with 5y predictions as well
[2021-07-15T14:06:43] Unknown: The start up have very well setout plan
[2021-07-15T14:06:46] Artem Bulashev: So May be start there, with objective and semi objective data that you have / can get
[2021-07-15T14:07:06] Unknown: 10 shops by 2025, they opened 7 weeks ago Called Soho scooters They are already opening a second shop
[2021-07-15T14:07:15] Unknown: My business plan... 😭
[2021-07-15T14:07:27] Unknown: I haven't drawn it out yet because I haven't thought in enough detail
[2021-07-15T14:07:42] Unknown: Sigh
[2021-07-15T14:07:56] Unknown: I think it's more realistic to go with Amazon and learn for another 4 years
[2021-07-15T14:09:18] Artem Bulashev: Than if you need job now this is out of scope, you can be working on that plan while you are working for Amazon or start up. May be even open a shop for that start up ;-)
[2021-07-15T14:09:56] Unknown: They want to build their own brand scooter and stuff and they offered me to be part of the founding team, if they sell business or I give ideas I profit
[2021-07-15T14:10:10] Unknown: It sounds nice on paper but money wise Amazon will be better
[2021-07-15T14:15:05] Unknown: Hm I start the job as scooter mechanic next wrek
[2021-07-15T14:15:06] Unknown: I'll see how it is
[2021-07-15T14:15:18] Unknown: Mid August I'll talk to the founder
[2021-07-15T14:15:22] Unknown: And see what they can offer me
[2021-07-15T14:15:36] Unknown: Cos they didn't want to take me only for two months in case I leave in September for Amazon
[2021-07-15T14:15:47] Unknown: But I have my way with words so they thought ok let's try
[2021-07-15T14:16:01] Unknown: So I'll see what they can offer
[2021-07-15T14:16:09] Unknown: After a month of working there they'll see my work ethic
[2021-07-15T14:16:28] Unknown: And if they offer well then I'll stay with them whilst I draw my business plan
[2021-07-15T14:16:38] Unknown: Amazon just has good opportunities and approved certificates
[2021-07-15T14:19:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ohhh crap 😓

[2021-07-15T16:21:54] Artem Bulashev: How much co2 in transportation

[2021-07-15T16:51:18] Happy Giraffe: If transporting one person
[2021-07-15T16:58:56] Unknown: True possibly but to make 1 tesla greener then a new diesel it takes it 700.000 km
[2021-07-15T17:04:33] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, next gen solid state batts/cells should help this
[2021-07-15T19:37:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, we have to hope for more efficient batterie to make it really 'greener' (it wilk never been green, such energy doesn't exist for human as far i know, a transformation isnalways required)
[2021-07-15T20:30:46] Happy Giraffe: Bike made of wood, you can throw it in the forest when you are done👀

[2021-07-16T06:16:55] Artem Bulashev: That makes no sense
[2021-07-16T06:16:59] Artem Bulashev: Why would it
[2021-07-16T06:17:15] Rowan Ross: Honestly most likely my fault, but I didn't do anything differently from what I normally would do to an esc and I haven't blown anything else up
[2021-07-16T06:17:24] Rowan Ross: Including other 4wd setups
[2021-07-16T06:18:06] Artem Bulashev: I’m trying to understand how could the flow of current blow up can on your set up
[2021-07-16T06:18:15] Rowan Ross: Me too
[2021-07-16T06:18:25] Artem Bulashev: But I don’t see such scenario…
[2021-07-16T06:18:33] Rowan Ross: Only canh and canl connected
[2021-07-16T06:19:32] Artem Bulashev: For this to happen you would need to have ground or + to be connected on one vesc and power or + to be connected on other
[2021-07-16T06:20:08] Artem Bulashev: So that circuite would complete it self only by going though interconnection between vesc (can line)
[2021-07-16T06:21:34] Rowan Ross: Yeah I understand
[2021-07-16T06:21:36] Artem Bulashev: Almost sounds like as if one was plugged and off And than you tried to plugged in other one in reverse polarity.
[2021-07-16T06:21:56] Rowan Ross: Nope, both are correct
[2021-07-16T06:22:12] Rowan Ross: Because both work still. Just parts died
[2021-07-16T06:22:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that’s expected in this case
[2021-07-16T06:22:30] Rowan Ross: Internal can bus on one, but external cable still works
[2021-07-16T06:22:55] Rowan Ross: And the power switch on the other, but still works and runs when you hold the switch in.
[2021-07-16T06:23:24] Rowan Ross: Going to send it back for repairs most likely
[2021-07-16T06:26:22] Artem Bulashev: Reverse polarity would not kill vesc because it is protected against it, but vesc turn off/on circuite interrupts one one side (gnd or vbat), so if you would have two Vesc connected by CAN, one vesc plugged in and off (meaning ground is interrupted but vbat is not), than you were to plug in other vesc in reverse polarity for a split second battery gnd would be on uninterrupted vbat input = current flow through can line
[2021-07-16T06:26:38] Artem Bulashev: That’s about the only way I can imagine that to happen
[2021-07-16T06:27:18] Artem Bulashev: But no way to tell, I don’t know Spintend pcb that well. Keep us posted what Spintend says
[2021-07-16T06:40:04] Rowan Ross: Can should be isolated though
[2021-07-16T06:40:10] Rowan Ross: I only had l and h connection
[2021-07-16T06:40:17] Rowan Ross: Will do!
[2021-07-16T06:40:25] Rowan Ross: Thanks for the brainstorming

[2021-07-19T23:48:15] Unknown: (Temp wired) just for the setup. And waiting for molicel p42a
[2021-07-19T23:48:30] Artem Bulashev: Ok 👌

[2021-07-19T23:48:39] Artem Bulashev: I ask my supplier
[2021-07-19T23:48:42] Artem Bulashev: How many?
[2021-07-19T23:48:43] Unknown: Going for 12s 80a
[2021-07-19T23:48:45] Unknown: 60
[2021-07-19T23:49:45] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-07-19T23:49:57] Artem Bulashev: Will request
[2021-07-19T23:50:49] Artem Bulashev: Last time I was offered vtc6 6euro from eu stock
[2021-07-19T23:51:33] Artem Bulashev: New
[2021-07-19T23:52:01] Unknown: I want to go 21700, since its relative cheap for 45a max amp, if i go 5p 80 a peak is nothing
[2021-07-19T23:52:53] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I went for 55a nominal 80 peak
[2021-07-19T23:53:09] Artem Bulashev: With 8p 18650 35e
[2021-07-19T23:54:08] Artem Bulashev: They can do full continuous 10amps so peak is easy for them :-) 55-60amps continuous that I will have is easy for them 21700 don’t fit well into my set up :(
[2021-07-19T23:54:13] Unknown: Idd, i want 2 batteery 21700 both 80amp bms common port. And 4a charger but i was thinking maybe samsung 40t3
[2021-07-19T23:54:35] Unknown: Since molicel has been out of stock for weeks
[2021-07-19T23:54:39] Artem Bulashev: Depends on your load
[2021-07-19T23:54:45] Artem Bulashev: Moment i run numbers
[2021-07-19T23:54:57] Artem Bulashev: What’s your max continues amp draw?
[2021-07-19T23:58:01] Unknown: It is not complete yet, i need my cells. My friend have a 3d printer and will print bottom extender, i want to place 21700 vertical 12s 5p, battery max amp with molicel is 235 and with samsung is 175. Both are 4000mah
[2021-07-19T23:58:22] Unknown: Molicel is 45a max samsung 35a max
[2021-07-19T23:59:32] Unknown: Setup will be wheelway 1000w (with hall sensor) 12s 5p, after a while 2 battery's 12s 5p to have 10, both 80a bms
[2021-07-19T23:59:53] Unknown: I hope to reach 65 max speed
[2021-07-20T00:03:49] Happy Giraffe: Im hoping 60 with 13s haha
[2021-07-20T00:04:13] Happy Giraffe: Lets see who gets the first tests done🤪
[2021-07-20T00:05:10] Artem Bulashev: 48x would deliver more wh
[2021-07-20T00:05:40] Artem Bulashev: With up to 15amps per cell discharge rate = 75amp total
[2021-07-20T00:06:11] Artem Bulashev: They can peak to 20amps per cell = 100a total with no issue even continuous
[2021-07-20T00:07:52] Artem Bulashev: 50g even more
[2021-07-20T00:09:33] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_586@20-07-2021_00-09-33.jpg>
[2021-07-20T00:10:43] Unknown: But the mw on molicel is higher on 20a?
[2021-07-20T00:11:14] Artem Bulashev: 50g at 10amps = 50a total would result at 2000mwh gain * 12*5= 120Wh more
[2021-07-20T00:11:21] Unknown: I have to measure still if 12s 5p will fit vertical with 21700
[2021-07-20T00:11:51] Artem Bulashev: You won’t get to 20a discharge ever if your peak 80a / 5p= 16a per cell
[2021-07-20T00:12:06] Unknown: Might end up 12s 4p, and i do not want to overload the battery to max amp continuous
[2021-07-20T00:12:52] Happy Giraffe: 12s5p 21700 will fit on M365 pro frame with spacer
[2021-07-20T00:14:01] Happy Giraffe: They might have been vertical but I'm not 100% sure of the layout. Tudor, Albert or Francois will know
[2021-07-20T00:14:17] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_587@20-07-2021_00-14-17.jpg>
[2021-07-20T00:15:17] Artem Bulashev: In that case choose 48x as well if your will be at 60amps = 15amps per cell 80% of the time
[2021-07-20T00:15:59] Artem Bulashev: Or p42a, slightly less range but if you will be often at 80amps discharge than will pay off
[2021-07-20T00:16:03] Artem Bulashev: 🙂🤟
[2021-07-20T00:16:15] Unknown: So if i can fit 5p go for samsung 48x?
[2021-07-20T00:16:41] Artem Bulashev: I would go for 50g or 48x for sure
[2021-07-20T00:17:23] Artem Bulashev: Both can do full discharge cycle without over heat at 15amps
[2021-07-20T00:17:28] Unknown: 48x since they go above 15a for sure, fire safety in all matters
[2021-07-20T00:17:28] Artem Bulashev: = 75a total
[2021-07-20T00:17:45] Artem Bulashev: Sure 👌
[2021-07-20T00:18:24] Artem Bulashev: If you won’t be at 80amps for over few minutes than nothing to worry about even with 50g
[2021-07-20T00:19:10] Unknown: Yes but sometimes i do haha
[2021-07-20T00:19:20] Artem Bulashev: 50g heat up same as 48x at 10a discharge
[2021-07-20T00:19:37] Artem Bulashev: And almost same on 15amps discharge
[2021-07-20T00:19:55] Artem Bulashev: Look
[2021-07-20T00:19:58] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_588@20-07-2021_00-19-58.jpg>
[2021-07-20T00:20:01] Artem Bulashev: 50g
[2021-07-20T00:20:05] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_589@20-07-2021_00-20-05.jpg>
[2021-07-20T00:20:09] Artem Bulashev: 48x
[2021-07-20T00:20:36] Artem Bulashev: I would go for 50g if available as heat up profile is very similar and 50g deliver more Wh
[2021-07-20T00:22:22] Unknown: I only find 50e
[2021-07-20T00:22:31] Artem Bulashev: If range is a priority. If range with p42a would still suffise and they are available I would go for them. These days we would be lucky to find any of those lol
[2021-07-20T00:22:53] Unknown: And those 48x cost 3x molicel or 40t (40t3) price
[2021-07-20T00:23:22] Unknown: Range is not prior i do 40km drives
[2021-07-20T00:23:31] Unknown: Top
[2021-07-20T00:24:16] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-07-20T00:24:19] Unknown: Why are p42a so hard to fjnd
[2021-07-20T00:24:23] Unknown: Find*
[2021-07-20T00:24:30] Artem Bulashev: Stay away from 50e
[2021-07-20T00:24:42] Artem Bulashev: Not good for above 10-12amps
[2021-07-20T00:25:23] Artem Bulashev: They heat at at 10a discharge same as those above at 15amps. And they fail at 15amps going to over heat cut off
[2021-07-20T00:26:46] Unknown: Ok
[2021-07-20T00:28:20] Artem Bulashev: I asked about all 3 of those will see if stock
[2021-07-20T00:28:27] Artem Bulashev: 50g 48x p42a
[2021-07-20T00:28:53] Happy Giraffe: Kenny you will use single motor?
[2021-07-20T00:29:47] Unknown: I will have to get 40t (t1) otherwise ( i have read they are better) and yes, single motor wheelway 1000w. But my esc could not pull it. Overhezted instantly
[2021-07-20T00:30:24] Happy Giraffe: 1000w motor not compatible with xiaomi esc
[2021-07-20T00:32:20] Happy Giraffe: I will try to use rita with mine, meaning 40A (60A peak) from batt max. Interesting if you plan to use 60-80A continuous
[2021-07-20T00:34:28] Artem Bulashev: You would loose about 0.8wh more on any load than p42a (-48wh or -168wh compare to 50g) Those values btw are given with discharge down to 3v - so exactly what you will experience in real life use. So that would be my last choice
[2021-07-20T00:37:18] Luis Magalhaes: nice trampa 😁

[2021-07-20T00:45:01] Luis Magalhaes: they should be good 👌👌
[2021-07-20T00:45:31] Unknown: That's why i want to go 40t or p42a ish, they cost 5.50- 6 for 4000 (up to 4200) mah
[2021-07-20T00:46:21] Unknown: Indeed, needed vesc so i tought.. why not go top of the line and buy from vedder himself
[2021-07-20T00:51:33] Happy Giraffe: Did you have Xiomi pro or? Have you measured your space of vesc?😅
[2021-07-20T00:51:54] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌

[2021-07-20T01:06:52] Unknown: I need to measure tomorrow anyway haha
[2021-07-20T10:00:40] Gregor: how do 30Q (6.95€) cost more than 40T (5.55€) wtf
[2021-07-20T10:01:46] Tudor: Why would you buy them instead of 21700 40t or p42a

[2021-07-20T11:32:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and 21700 doesn't fit well in the boosted rev
[2021-07-20T11:40:12] Unknown: Does discharge work the same as charge on batts? For exampla 5p batts with 10a discharge each cell would have max 50a in a 5p pack, does this also add up for charging?
[2021-07-20T11:56:55] Happy Giraffe: Charging is another parameter, depending on the exact cell. Slower charging gives longer battery health so you might wanna have a slower and a faster charger
[2021-07-20T12:08:49] Unknown: I know, but can't find a 12s 3a charger, i wanted to take the golden way, not too fast. Not too slow
[2021-07-20T12:12:53] Tudor: Until we get out hands on them yeats will pass
[2021-07-20T12:13:14] Tudor: Si 21700 are the to go cells at the moment

[2021-07-20T12:16:51] Happy Giraffe: I use shity 3A that gives real 2.4A and then 5A😂
[2021-07-20T12:16:54] Tudor: And mesaage them and say you want 3 A
[2021-07-20T12:18:05] francois schempers: they are starting with small appliance, like smartwatches etc, but the specs are insanely good, more power dense, more Amps, more safe, more lifespan (no degradation with charge/discharge) so technically lifespan is as long as you don't damage it. once they figure out how to make bigger ones, the ev market is going to explode
[2021-07-20T12:18:20] Happy Giraffe: € 24,35 | Rohs CE Smart 50.4V 3A Lithium Battery Charger for Electric Tool Robot Electric Car Li-on Battery 44.4V with Built-in Fan https://a.aliexpress.com/_mKgtosX
[2021-07-20T12:19:07] Tudor: Nice but as i said years will pass
[2021-07-20T12:19:31] Happy Giraffe: I would also get a 5-6A or something if you need faster charge, just make sure your charge connector and wire can handle it
[2021-07-20T13:11:35] Unknown: But this is only 1.5-2a? :p
[2021-07-20T13:11:50] Unknown: Ooh ok thank you
[2021-07-20T16:49:23] Tudor: Slowly slowly

[2021-07-20T17:36:27] Mirono escooters: Nice build
[2021-07-20T19:49:35] Tudor: Thanks
[2021-07-20T20:19:09] Artem Bulashev: Reason why I use 4mm or dual 3mm Single (solid) core wire to connect battery further end to bms 😁 instead add of usual stranded wire 🥰 see the difference
[2021-07-20T20:24:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i find this table completly crazy
[2021-07-20T20:25:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we all use 12/10/8 AWG with MANY MANY cores for high current motors ... and it's not heating
[2021-07-20T20:26:30] Artem Bulashev: Length
[2021-07-20T20:26:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ??
[2021-07-20T20:27:08] Artem Bulashev: Resistance of the wire is crosssection vs material vs material density vs length
[2021-07-20T20:27:16] Artem Bulashev: Single core has higher density
[2021-07-20T20:27:44] Artem Bulashev: And what you said is probably because length is much less than in this calculation
[2021-07-20T20:28:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for example, my current 12 AWG cable : 680 cores
[2021-07-20T20:28:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if I follow your table, it should be 10A max... it's crazy
[2021-07-20T20:28:53] Artem Bulashev: Fair point
[2021-07-20T20:28:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: in such cable, we can put 50 .. 80 amps for phase motors
[2021-07-20T20:29:30] Artem Bulashev: Though it was really meant to show how vast the difference is between single core vs multicore
[2021-07-20T20:29:43] Artem Bulashev: I think they measure it per 1km
[2021-07-20T20:29:46] Artem Bulashev: May be
[2021-07-20T20:29:57] Artem Bulashev: I see no other refenrece
[2021-07-20T20:30:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and what piss me off, is : each table you find on internet says different things (I know your table is the 'official' one)
[2021-07-20T20:30:07] Artem Bulashev: True
[2021-07-20T20:30:24] Artem Bulashev: This one just too see single vs multicore ;-)
[2021-07-20T20:30:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: anyway ... started a new project 😂😂😂

[2021-07-20T20:31:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 4G + GPS module for anti-theft & tracking
[2021-07-20T20:31:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: don't mess with my IMEI 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-07-20T22:02:29] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-07-20T22:19:01] Tudor: Copper in just to cut it on series shape

[2021-07-20T22:19:09] Tudor: One more paer to print
[2021-07-20T22:19:12] Tudor: Part
[2021-07-20T22:49:03] Mirono escooters: Copper 🥰
[2021-07-20T22:52:50] Tudor: 120A bms so copper i need
[2021-07-20T22:54:47] Happy Giraffe: So when I check motor hall sensor I will have black probe on the controller black sensor pin and then test every hall cable from motor with red probe?👀
[2021-07-20T23:51:09] Artem Bulashev: Nice 👍
[2021-07-20T23:51:16] Artem Bulashev: 0.1 or 0.15?
[2021-07-20T23:51:40] Artem Bulashev: 0.1 should be enough considering how you arranged
[2021-07-21T00:32:04] Tudor: Its 0.1
[2021-07-21T00:57:26] Artem Bulashev: Nice 👍
[2021-07-21T00:57:43] Artem Bulashev: Pure nickel sandwich ?
[2021-07-21T01:25:25] Unknown: Would this be a good setup for 12sp?
[2021-07-21T01:25:30] Unknown: <photos/photo_600@21-07-2021_01-25-30.jpg>
[2021-07-21T01:47:47] Artem Bulashev: Man that looks like 5s 12p… I think meant to make it the other way around
[2021-07-21T01:49:11] Artem Bulashev: :-)
[2021-07-21T02:21:56] Unknown: Oh snap my bad,
[2021-07-21T11:29:13] Artem Bulashev: 😜
[2021-07-21T16:26:52] Tudor: Hehhee this is my scooter also
[2021-07-21T16:30:37] Unknown: Is it? Hahahaha well yes i saw it on facebook and asked if it was 21700 cells
[2021-07-21T16:30:51] Unknown: Is it a pro or regular m365 body?
[2021-07-21T20:24:42] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 goes your way
[2021-07-21T20:25:39] Artem Bulashev: Plug you can figure I guess right? Taking oem cable would be a pain in the ass
[2021-07-21T20:25:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ?? you want to add nfc to stock eye ? not sure it's possible
[2021-07-21T20:25:53] Artem Bulashev: This is how this controller comes in
[2021-07-21T20:26:08] Artem Bulashev: It’s same as zero
[2021-07-21T20:26:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it depend the i/o style of the nfc module
[2021-07-21T20:26:23] Artem Bulashev: But with added UART to rfid
[2021-07-21T20:26:37] Artem Bulashev: It is soldered into Screen throttle
[2021-07-21T20:27:08] Artem Bulashev: The only setting added is p18 - key add and delete.
[2021-07-21T20:27:33] Artem Bulashev: This screen/rfid works plug and play on zero controllers
[2021-07-21T20:27:50] Artem Bulashev: Nothing to adjust beside of voltage is different 👌
[2021-07-21T20:28:32] Artem Bulashev: Will through in vsett controller and one rfid tag just to let you have fun if you want to
[2021-07-21T20:43:42] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_603@21-07-2021_20-43-42.jpg>
[2021-07-21T20:43:52] Artem Bulashev: See you soon man 😜
[2021-07-21T21:09:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: let's test my recyclee 30Q !
[2021-07-21T21:09:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_604@21-07-2021_21-09-22.jpg>
[2021-07-21T21:20:27] Artem Bulashev: 😊
[2021-07-21T21:50:15] Tudor: Pro
[2021-07-22T00:17:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: is littokala resistance measurements accurate ? it gives me 55-80 ohms for my 30q. seems very high
[2021-07-22T03:20:03] Artem Bulashev: That’s the thing about questionable tools🥴
[2021-07-22T03:20:17] Artem Bulashev: Unlikely that it is that high. It would be dead cell basically
[2021-07-22T03:55:29] Unknown: Ok
[2021-07-22T03:55:58] Unknown: Is there body dimension any different from a regular m365?
[2021-07-22T04:56:39] Artem Bulashev: Super short motor wires for the motor with high load 👌 vesc controller instead of vsett9 controller - makes so much more sense to place it near the motor at the back 😜
[2021-07-22T05:17:00] Unknown: Nice, i did'nt get out of the choice yet fwd or rwd.. need a monorim rear for sure to have rwd anyway, but i guess it could make more torque that way
[2021-07-22T05:33:04] Artem Bulashev: Front wheel can’t take more than 80amps phase current without spinning out people say. 80amps phase is about 500w motor limits So if your motor will be over 500w and it will be the only motor, than better place it on rear axle
[2021-07-22T11:06:31] Unknown: Guys I bought XLR charger for an ebike, it's too big tho! What other sizes are tbere
[2021-07-22T16:04:23] Sébastien Michon: Hi, so i Ask my questions. Actually i have a AWD with 2 x 350W, a 12s4p in deck in // with a 12s2p. I put 33A in each motors with xiaogen. I want more power, Not necessarily more speed. 50-55 is enough for me. I'm wondering about adding a 3s in series with my 2//, but also why not change motors, 500w or 1000w like François, or others. And also a vesc. I'm looking for advice, opinions... Which motors? Which vesc? Flipsky, Kelly, others ?? Which dashboard?
[2021-07-22T16:04:35] Sébastien Michon: Thanks at all
[2021-07-22T16:32:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hello, i can't advise flipsky (shitty design). kelly aren't 'vesc'.
[2021-07-22T16:33:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: markerx, trampa, spintend, focbox/unity.
[2021-07-22T16:33:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and for dashboard... no choice : mine 🤣🤣
[2021-07-22T16:34:38] Happy Giraffe: Or phone🌚
[2021-07-22T16:34:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: right !
[2021-07-22T16:35:16] Happy Giraffe: But Im eager to wait for some display solutions
[2021-07-22T16:43:25] francois schempers: my advice, Ubox from spintend, not too expensive, reliable, 16s able, 200A total. and if you wait a bit, there is soon a pro version coming out. battery wise, sell your 12s's and buy 15-16s instead, you'll have more torque and less heat than with 12s battery motor wise, yes my 1000w is a good choice, but maybe @Tudor_VTA can advise you a bit more, if I'm not mistaken he tested a bunch of differente solutions
[2021-07-22T16:48:51] Happy Giraffe: Fitting 15-16s and dual controller in xiaomi pro would be almost impossible I think😅
[2021-07-22T16:49:42] Happy Giraffe: Your fancy split bms setup might pull it out lol
[2021-07-22T20:03:59] Tudor: Ubox can do 18s
[2021-07-22T20:04:05] Tudor: But needs cooling
[2021-07-22T20:04:11] Tudor: Becomes a bit hot
[2021-07-22T20:05:21] Tudor: This is the way
[2021-07-22T20:05:24] Tudor: 😂😂😂😂
[2021-07-22T20:06:35] Tudor: Ront bother with 12 s and 18650 just ho 21700 range samsung 50E/E or less range but more power Samsung 40T or molicel P42A
[2021-07-22T20:06:57] Tudor: 50E/G
[2021-07-22T20:09:16] Unknown: I agree lol my 12s9p of sanyo compared to my 50E is .... Incomparable
[2021-07-22T20:18:04] Artem Bulashev: Lol should expect about 50% more Ah under load 😅 and probabaly even more range because voltage is higher on 21700 over all so more wh 😅
[2021-07-22T20:19:58] Unknown: Yup, and because voltage drops so slowly my top speed is high a lot
[2021-07-22T20:20:12] Artem Bulashev: Edited
[2021-07-22T20:22:45] Artem Bulashev: 50e delivers 4.45ah at 7amps load down to 3v Vs 18650ga deliver 2.9ah down to 3v
[2021-07-22T20:23:34] Tudor: 50G is a bit better
[2021-07-22T20:23:41] Tudor: Same specs as 50E
[2021-07-22T20:23:48] Artem Bulashev: Over 53% gain
[2021-07-22T20:23:49] Tudor: But a bit better
[2021-07-22T20:24:09] Artem Bulashev: Ah before sagging bellow 3v
[2021-07-22T20:24:14] Tudor: I hope to get the 50S but nowhere to be found
[2021-07-22T20:24:20] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-07-22T20:26:32] Artem Bulashev: 50g is basically identical
[2021-07-22T20:26:41] Artem Bulashev: At load like that 0-10amps
[2021-07-22T20:28:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you forget the lost space due to 21700 bigger diameter
[2021-07-22T20:29:29] Artem Bulashev: Speaking purely in terms of actual Ah / wh gain
[2021-07-22T20:30:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: take a real example in a 200x 80 x 700 space (or any other PLEV size). you'll see it's not that wonderful.
[2021-07-22T20:31:47] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_607@22-07-2021_20-31-47.jpg>

[2021-07-22T20:32:31] Tudor: Nop
[2021-07-22T20:32:36] Tudor: 50g beyter
[2021-07-22T20:32:45] Tudor: For comparison, the Samsung 50E delivered 10.3Wh of energy at 10A, the Molicel M50A delivered 11.3Wh, and the Samsung 50G delivered 12.2Wh
[2021-07-22T20:33:19] Tudor: https://budgetlightforum.com/node/74759
[2021-07-22T20:33:22] Artem Bulashev: 16.54 +53% = 25.3 (over 4.37% more energy dense on its own)
[2021-07-22T20:34:39] Artem Bulashev: This is discharging to way bellow 3v which we do not on scooters
[2021-07-22T20:38:56] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_609@22-07-2021_20-38-56.jpg>
[2021-07-22T20:39:37] Artem Bulashev: Wh down to 3v for all 21700 (sorted by highest to lowest wh down to 3v at 10amp)
[2021-07-22T20:40:57] Artem Bulashev: Difference to Samsung 50s (T50) from g50 is about 2.5% increase
[2021-07-22T20:42:25] Artem Bulashev: 386mwh/15371mwh = 2.5 %
[2021-07-22T20:43:37] Artem Bulashev: 50s is better only when use case needs high capasity at loads 15-20amps per cell. 👌
[2021-07-22T20:45:02] Artem Bulashev: I agree 21700 are less dense when calculated in enclosure - which is why I got 35e 18650 and not 21700 or other 18650
[2021-07-22T20:46:03] Artem Bulashev: I had a choice of 8p 18650 or 5p 21700
[2021-07-22T21:35:22] Unknown: I pre orderd 60 molicel p42a's for a 80amp (peak) build they expect to ship on august 18th 😔
[2021-07-22T21:36:41] Unknown: Will do 12s 5p internall, 12s5p externall after a month or 2.. 42.000 mah battery 1000w motor on vesc6
[2021-07-22T21:51:38] francois schempers: cant do regen thought, 18s leave no space for Vspikes, if you exceed 80v, kaput
[2021-07-22T21:52:01] Happy Giraffe: They say safe for 16s
[2021-07-22T21:52:29] Tudor: There is a guy in USA using it with 18s without a problem .
[2021-07-22T21:53:02] Tudor: Thata what they say but have a chat more private and you will see
[2021-07-22T21:53:12] Tudor: I aint going 18s but 17 s
[2021-07-22T21:53:22] Tudor: Will be more than enough for me
[2021-07-22T21:53:29] Tudor: O think a bit to much
[2021-07-22T21:53:42] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-07-22T21:53:43] Tudor: I missing just the bms
[2021-07-22T21:53:56] Happy Giraffe: I shit bricks with 13s
[2021-07-22T21:54:07] Happy Giraffe: Poor xiaomi frame
[2021-07-22T21:54:43] Tudor: I had 13 s and got used with it
[2021-07-22T21:54:50] Tudor: Now I go retard to see
[2021-07-22T21:54:56] Tudor: Hope i wont die
[2021-07-22T21:55:06] Happy Giraffe: Leave that to RS😂
[2021-07-22T21:55:13] Happy Giraffe: We need you alive here 😅
[2021-07-22T21:55:14] Tudor: 😂😂😂
[2021-07-22T21:55:21] Tudor: Hea doing the same
[2021-07-22T21:55:23] Tudor: Hes
[2021-07-22T21:55:38] Happy Giraffe: Kinda guessed it...😂
[2021-07-22T21:55:38] Tudor: I am building him the battery
[2021-07-22T21:55:52] Tudor: Exactly the same set-up
[2021-07-22T21:56:02] Tudor: Maybe hes going 3000w motors
[2021-07-22T21:56:14] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-07-22T21:57:24] Tudor: I am doing 2 scooters one for range and one for drag
[2021-07-22T21:57:49] Tudor: One with 40t and one with 50G/E
[2021-07-22T21:58:45] Tudor: Ehhh i spent money on this scooter i could buy a nice car ....😅😅😅
[2021-07-22T21:59:01] Tudor: *Scooters
[2021-07-22T21:59:20] Happy Giraffe: Next one make 12" scooter
[2021-07-22T21:59:32] Happy Giraffe: Spintend sells some beefy motors
[2021-07-22T21:59:35] Tudor: No more
[2021-07-22T21:59:38] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-07-22T21:59:39] Tudor: Enough
[2021-07-22T21:59:52] Tudor: Even this ones i might use them from time to time
[2021-07-22T22:00:20] Happy Giraffe: Maybe ebike then🤔
[2021-07-22T22:00:37] Happy Giraffe: Bigger magnets
[2021-07-22T22:00:39] Tudor: Maybe next summer
[2021-07-22T22:00:43] Tudor: Who knows
[2021-07-22T22:01:02] Tudor: I had in ming to to a quad 4x4 with vescs
[2021-07-22T22:01:24] Tudor: We will see
[2021-07-22T22:01:38] Happy Giraffe: Haha, that would be fun
[2021-07-22T22:02:08] Tudor: I was looking also at the ninebot cart pro
[2021-07-22T22:02:14] Tudor: Kart

[2021-07-22T22:18:01] Luis Magalhaes: Good to know 🤔😂
[2021-07-22T22:23:08] Luis Magalhaes: I think the speed i can get at 16S is enough but would like to see it at 18S 😂😂
[2021-07-22T22:49:08] Sébastien Michon: Hi Foxx, i read your works on other Channel...ok so no flipsky and no Kelly 😉
[2021-07-22T22:50:39] Sébastien Michon: Ok but if to begin i can just put a serial, it's better for me ... To buy motors and ubox or other.
[2021-07-22T22:51:05] Sébastien Michon: @Tudor_VTA do you have a opinion for motors)
[2021-07-22T22:51:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: kelly are good controllers, but not as configurable as vesc 😉
[2021-07-22T22:52:47] Sébastien Michon: Ok so vesc are better... but what do you use for better Price, configuration ....ubox as François or other ?
[2021-07-22T22:53:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i triied 2 different kind of flisky : bad
[2021-07-22T22:54:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: now, i have a spintend. not trsted yet (lot of battery work before), but i tried a dualtron spider with spintend, it was really good.
[2021-07-22T22:54:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so... i'd say spintend 🤪
[2021-07-22T23:02:18] Sébastien Michon: 🙏🏻🤘🏻ok so if you say and other ... So it's spinted. Where do you buy it ?
[2021-07-22T23:41:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: official website, aliexpress (but same price now)...
[2021-07-22T23:49:47] Artem Bulashev: Man Ubox has like second breath at about 15kmh 🤣
[2021-07-22T23:50:17] Artem Bulashev: It accelerates like a steamboat 0 to about 15, and than it starts to pull like Tesla 😄😄
[2021-07-22T23:51:21] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2021-07-22T23:51:38] Artem Bulashev: Almost lost grip because didn’t expect it 😂
[2021-07-23T06:52:08] Happy Giraffe: What values you used for currents?
[2021-07-23T08:26:51] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂
[2021-07-23T08:27:59] Luis Magalhaes: In my first ride i was expecting some wheel spin at start and then i discover that it spins more later 😂😂
[2021-07-23T08:52:34] Sébastien Michon: Ok thanks. Ubox are ok just for 16s ? Or 15s are ok ?
[2021-07-23T08:55:50] Luis Magalhaes: Its safe up to 16S
[2021-07-23T08:56:05] Luis Magalhaes: Above that its all ok
[2021-07-23T10:39:30] Gregor: that's their remote doing it though no? seems like it should be controllable with vesc settings
[2021-07-23T11:35:45] Sébastien Michon: Do you buy ADC adaptator with your ubox?
[2021-07-23T11:42:39] Happy Giraffe: Must be bought or most throttles and brakes won't work
[2021-07-23T11:49:22] Sébastien Michon: Ok thanks. Is possible to use the Xiaomi brake and throttles ? I understand actually there are no dashboard. But there are a bluetooth connexion on it ? And uart ? It's not possible to something like m365dash or other ? Sorry for "stupid"question 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2021-07-23T11:51:13] Unknown: Yeah possible to use almost any throttle or brake as far as I'm concerned
[2021-07-23T11:51:30] Unknown: Yeah vesc got Bluetooth and stuff but you need to buy the module
[2021-07-23T11:51:52] Unknown: And nah not possible u need vesc app
[2021-07-23T11:58:44] Sébastien Michon: Cool 🤘🏻
[2021-07-23T11:59:22] Sébastien Michon: Ok so, buy ubox, ADC and bluetooth module...
[2021-07-23T12:00:36] Sébastien Michon: Shit....or put a old phone on scooter 😁 for a dash.... What is the purpose of the uart link ??
[2021-07-23T12:01:12] Unknown: Mr @koxx3 is working on a vesc compatible dash 😜😏
[2021-07-23T12:01:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: first rain test 🤪
[2021-07-23T12:02:06] francois schempers: ubox have bluetooth included
[2021-07-23T12:02:29] Unknown: You should try and provide options to customise the layout of the display? 👁️👁️ That would be so cool and something people like me would enjoy
[2021-07-23T12:03:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: VERY difficult without recompiling. running short of memory (RAM & flash) too.
[2021-07-23T12:03:28] Happy Giraffe: Police likes seeing 70v there😂
[2021-07-23T12:03:30] Unknown: Ohh okay I understand
[2021-07-23T12:03:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-07-23T12:04:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is already some option to adjust the "displayed" speed (speed factor correction) ... without compromising the distance calculation ;)
[2021-07-23T12:05:25] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-07-23T12:05:57] Happy Giraffe: Make it emulate to 42v🌚
[2021-07-23T12:06:27] Happy Giraffe: 42v= 54.6v and 30v = 39v😂
[2021-07-23T12:06:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: french police can do some stupid tests like rising the wheels in the air and look at the displayed speed 🤣🤣🤣 (not valid in court of course ... but you'll have to defend yourself in court if you want to prove that)
[2021-07-23T12:08:01] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-07-23T12:12:04] Sébastien Michon: 😍😍😍😍 yeah !! I love it !!!
[2021-07-23T12:27:30] Luis Magalhaes: I dont use the remote but dont have hall sensors 😂
[2021-07-23T12:28:57] Luis Magalhaes: Ubox has Bluetooth connectivity on board
[2021-07-23T12:29:24] Luis Magalhaes: Just use an android phone as dash 😂
[2021-07-23T12:41:23] Unknown: Eyy same how does sensorless run on scooter?
[2021-07-23T12:49:16] francois schempers: bldc
[2021-07-23T12:52:33] Sébastien Michon: Yes it's a good idea...
[2021-07-23T12:52:36] Sébastien Michon: 😂
[2021-07-23T12:57:18] Luis Magalhaes: Runs ok, just have to give a little push start, but with the minimotors where the same
[2021-07-23T17:43:31] Sébastien Michon: Ok . Si just buy ubox and ADC
[2021-07-23T17:49:07] Artem Bulashev: I did but don’t use it
[2021-07-23T17:49:08] Artem Bulashev: Bt is built in
[2021-07-23T17:49:08] Artem Bulashev: In UBOX but other vesc are not as advance and may not have it
[2021-07-23T17:49:08] Artem Bulashev: With adc adapter yes any break and any throttle
[2021-07-23T17:49:08] Artem Bulashev: As long as it is 3 wire version or brake can be 2 wire or 3 wire versions
[2021-07-23T17:49:50] Sébastien Michon: Thanks
[2021-07-23T18:51:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: quick question ... when you solder a battery pack. You do it : 1/ cells fully charged 2/ cells half charged 3/ cells fully discharged
[2021-07-23T19:09:02] francois schempers: I would say half charged is the safest, so in case of accidental short, your not overcharging/discharging
[2021-07-23T21:58:54] Artem Bulashev: Nominal yes 3.7 give it take
[2021-07-23T21:58:59] Artem Bulashev: Most important is not that
[2021-07-23T21:59:08] Artem Bulashev: But cells to be matched
[2021-07-23T21:59:15] Artem Bulashev: With new cells that’s not an issue
[2021-07-23T23:05:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i am testing all cells, i'll eject bad cells and i'll use repack to make a correct pack 😉
[2021-07-24T19:24:27] Happy Giraffe: What if they made single vesc Pro?😂
[2021-07-24T19:24:46] Happy Giraffe: Would buy in a heartbeat
[2021-07-24T19:24:55] Tudor: Whats the difference ?
[2021-07-24T19:24:58] Tudor: Pro?
[2021-07-24T19:25:07] Happy Giraffe: Its posted in vsett group
[2021-07-24T19:25:13] Happy Giraffe: From @artBula... I just realized that new Pro version will be - dual - 100v awesome for that back emf voltage stability - 5 12v outputs! Perfect number 1. Turn signal L 2. Turn signal R 3. Break light 4. Front light 5. Horn - I know for fact it will do 150amps phase at least, maybe more - all st about same size 🤓
[2021-07-24T19:25:23] Happy Giraffe: Signals etc
[2021-07-24T19:25:48] Happy Giraffe: I would try to slap license place for it (50cc)
[2021-07-24T19:27:03] Tudor: Its available?
[2021-07-24T19:28:58] Happy Giraffe: Nothing new yet
[2021-07-24T19:29:14] Happy Giraffe: Single vesc should have already come out
[2021-07-24T21:48:14] Luis Magalhaes: Nice
[2021-07-25T13:11:55] Sébastien Michon: It's a raspberry 🤔 ? Or Arduino ?
[2021-07-25T13:15:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ESP32 with arduino framework
[2021-07-25T13:18:35] Sébastien Michon: Another question : I saw that some people were making series 3s batteries, but without BMS. They explain this by the fact that if the other battery is in series, it protects the whole thing and in case of a problem, in any case it cuts. The only constraint is for the charge, for the balancing, but they use a balance charger. What do you think about that 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2021-07-25T13:19:01] Sébastien Michon: Nice and for screen it's a 3,5" ?
[2021-07-25T13:23:42] Unknown: I'm building the 3s mod with 21700 and 100A BMS..
[2021-07-25T13:23:58] Unknown: It's stupid but people asked me ...
[2021-07-25T13:24:22] Unknown: I did 3 3s Packs 2 internal for g30
[2021-07-25T13:24:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, special 3.5" VA for high contrast and brightness
[2021-07-25T13:24:30] Unknown: And one external
[2021-07-25T13:24:51] Happy Giraffe: Damn nice🦒
[2021-07-25T13:24:59] Unknown: With 18650 and 60A i had really problems
[2021-07-25T13:25:18] Unknown: @koxx is rocking it....
[2021-07-25T13:25:37] Unknown: I call it the stupid mod....
[2021-07-25T13:26:08] Happy Giraffe: VA good for outdoor scooter, not so much for high refresh rate gaming😂
[2021-07-25T13:26:34] Unknown: I decided I will go for the dual ubox
[2021-07-25T13:26:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: does anyone have a table for max continuous and alternative current for all connectors ? often, people put huge connectors for motors phases, but they base this on the continuous current.... and it's not. it should require a lower section
[2021-07-25T13:26:43] Unknown: No more trampaboard
[2021-07-25T13:27:19] Unknown: Ohhhhh look on Google i don't know where I put my list...
[2021-07-25T13:27:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for example, the spintend/ubox is provided with 4mm bullet for 100A for phases ... and such connector a 70A max from memory
[2021-07-25T13:27:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i tried 😅😅
[2021-07-25T13:27:52] Happy Giraffe: Those are so confusing with the AWG wires aswell. So many different charts and opinions🤪
[2021-07-25T13:28:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: totally 🙈🙈🙈
[2021-07-25T13:28:06] Unknown: Ok then you have to wait i have a pdf laying around maybe i find it...
[2021-07-25T13:28:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: awesome !
[2021-07-25T13:28:16] Unknown: True
[2021-07-25T13:28:18] Sébastien Michon: 100A 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
[2021-07-25T13:28:40] Unknown: Yes 100A BMS because I drive delta
[2021-07-25T13:28:53] Sébastien Michon: Why do you have problem ?
[2021-07-25T13:29:00] Unknown: And if it works for delta i should work for normal
[2021-07-25T13:29:09] Unknown: Mosfets burned
[2021-07-25T13:29:17] Unknown: Overheating
[2021-07-25T13:29:27] Unknown: Charging is a problem
[2021-07-25T13:30:00] Unknown: Too much risks involved, a poor boys choice
[2021-07-25T13:30:35] Unknown: They don't have the money for a big and proper 13s but they want more speed
[2021-07-25T13:31:06] Unknown: The easiest way plug a 3s to the 10s and you're done
[2021-07-25T13:31:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳
[2021-07-25T13:32:12] Unknown: But i will test it with the Samsung 21700 and 100A BMS 12 awg wire and test it, electrical and thermic side...
[2021-07-25T13:32:33] Unknown: Stupids motherfuckers build stuff without testing proper
[2021-07-25T13:32:41] Unknown: Data is all
[2021-07-25T13:33:22] Happy Giraffe: But XT60 should handle 180A for 8-9sec and burn in 10-11sec😂
[2021-07-25T13:33:41] Unknown: Lol

[2021-07-25T13:35:16] Happy Giraffe: I think I end up using 40A peak and then whatever 15-20Amps sustained
[2021-07-25T13:35:22] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-07-25T13:50:13] Sébastien Michon: @Mister_Lithium actually i have a 12s4p in the deck and a 12s2p in // . I have on each Daly bms 60A. So if i put a 3s5p with Samsung 50e, i put the same bms ?
[2021-07-25T14:33:40] Unknown: What batts do you use in your 12s 2p? 60a for 2p seems pretty much
[2021-07-25T14:41:12] Sébastien Michon: LG mj1. I put 60A because i have these 2 bms un stock 😂
[2021-07-25T14:47:14] Unknown: I hope you dont pull over 20 amp too long 😂
[2021-07-25T14:49:56] Sébastien Michon: 😂 actually i put 35A per motor on xiaogen cfw... So very safe 😆😆😆
[2021-07-25T14:50:25] Unknown: 💥🔥
[2021-07-25T14:54:45] Sébastien Michon: Stupid because risky ? Isn't it ?
[2021-07-25T15:00:54] Unknown: <animation>
[2021-07-25T15:01:19] Unknown: Darwin award mod
[2021-07-25T15:02:49] Unknown: Buy you really big batteries, this serial mod is not Good for battery life it's dangerous etcc
[2021-07-25T15:03:17] Unknown: I will do it to test and show the problems..
[2021-07-25T15:22:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: inside spintend

[2021-07-25T16:06:35] Sébastien Michon: 😂
[2021-07-25T16:13:23] Unknown: They do bypass they do no BMS people are stupid
[2021-07-25T16:21:26] francois schempers: here what could happen with no bms ^^
[2021-07-25T16:21:26] francois schempers: <video_file>
[2021-07-25T16:24:02] Sébastien Michon: No they do a 3s, without bms. In series with a 10s, 12s or other with BMS.
[2021-07-25T16:24:20] Sébastien Michon: 😂 exactly !!
[2021-07-25T16:25:31] Sébastien Michon: I never seen or doing battery without bms ... So risky. A bms cost 20€ ....🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
[2021-07-25T16:35:51] Dennis: yeah always use a (good) bms..

[2021-07-25T21:05:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: trying traction control
[2021-07-25T21:06:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but need to recharge first 🤣🤣
[2021-07-25T21:07:40] francois schempers: not bad not bad, and temps wise ? under control ? you put thermal past under the case ?
[2021-07-26T00:40:00] Luis Magalhaes: Whats specs there? 💪

[2021-07-26T00:50:58] Luis Magalhaes: @koxx3 is that the dt mini?
[2021-07-26T08:38:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for now, no monitoring. i'll configure the ble today.
[2021-07-26T08:39:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, boosted rev 😉
[2021-07-26T08:45:07] Happy Giraffe: Did the rev have a good throttle?
[2021-07-26T08:45:29] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3
[2021-07-26T08:54:30] Luis Magalhaes: Nice it was not looking like a dt mini to me 😂😂👍
[2021-07-26T08:59:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: excellent one. best I ever tried.
[2021-07-26T08:59:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the throttle does acceleration AND brake
[2021-07-26T09:01:27] Happy Giraffe: Wow
[2021-07-26T09:01:43] Happy Giraffe: Would that work on VESC?
[2021-07-26T09:02:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahaha. yes, it's directly cabled on it !
[2021-07-26T09:04:00] Happy Giraffe: Its 3.3v? Also is the brake e-brake? So linear e-brake?👀
[2021-07-26T09:04:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: electrical braking is so powerful that I didn't have to use mecanical brake once on my last traject 🤣🤣
[2021-07-26T09:04:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: signal is : full brake : 1.6V center : 2.54V full throttle : 3.3V
[2021-07-26T09:05:09] Happy Giraffe: Damn nice👀 do you have a close picture of it?
[2021-07-26T09:05:36] Happy Giraffe: I definitely would want to have control of ebrakes aswell, iex. with full batt I could use mechanical only etc

[2021-07-26T09:09:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not found. out of stock everywhere 🙈🙈
[2021-07-26T09:09:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Rion has a similar throttle, but never tried
[2021-07-26T09:10:08] Happy Giraffe: Rion throttle might have no ebrake🤔 and maybe costs 200€😂🙈
[2021-07-26T09:10:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: talking about xiaomi, my frien @Foujiwara took 70 km/h with his moded ESC and 20S battery 🤣🤣 the damned thing is insane. burn at every start. incredible.
[2021-07-26T09:10:58] Dennis: <video_file>
[2021-07-26T09:11:57] Happy Giraffe: Hahaha
[2021-07-26T09:12:25] Happy Giraffe: I went 50kmh and called it a day, on bike 50kmh is nothing but on scooter a bit scary
[2021-07-26T09:12:34] Dennis: Ninebot Max G30(D) 48v star / delta mod, 72km/h dashboard/ 67.7km/h GPS, (Gen1, Stock ESC)
[2021-07-26T09:12:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: especially with the narrow handle bar of the xiaomi.
[2021-07-26T09:12:59] Dennis: 50kmh and more on ninebot max feels very good 😂
[2021-07-26T09:13:43] Happy Giraffe: We have some wide bike paths in Denmark, there I will test out the new maxspeed once they make the damn controller😂
[2021-07-26T09:15:44] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_567@15-07-2021_00-54-53.jpg>
[2021-07-26T09:15:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah....
[2021-07-26T09:16:41] Happy Giraffe: If I post this everyday maybe they do it lol, 13s6p batt and Ubox dual doent fit in xiaomi pro
[2021-07-26T09:17:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-07-26T09:24:23] Sébastien Michon: what battery do you have ? 15s, 16s ?
[2021-07-26T09:29:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a 10S (2 or 3P, I don't remember) with P42 molicel 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2021-07-26T09:29:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I am building a 14S6P with Samsung 30Q
[2021-07-26T09:40:28] Face de Pin Sucé: 10S3P molicel P42A :p
[2021-07-26T09:42:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍🥰
[2021-07-26T09:50:03] Sébastien Michon: 🤣...
[2021-07-26T09:53:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah, but 3x45A, it starts to talk nice 🥰
[2021-07-26T09:53:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: only the vmax is quickly limited (40km/h). not so bad for 10s, but not enought
[2021-07-26T10:01:56] Sébastien Michon: Effectively...not bad. At first, I will surely put the ubox and leave my 12s6p with MJ1. Then I'll see about putting a 3s6p in series, if I want to go up a bit...
[2021-07-26T10:03:19] Sébastien Michon: later we will see to make a complete battery
[2021-07-26T10:03:29] Happy Giraffe: I bet the vesc low speed (high motor current) torque feels amazing
[2021-07-26T10:31:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_616@26-07-2021_10-31-10.jpg>

[2021-07-26T10:31:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: comming single core spintend !
[2021-07-26T10:32:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: fan will be needed if you go upper than 30-50A depending of the conditions (dissipation, weather...)
[2021-07-26T10:32:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's not the final color (anodization soon)
[2021-07-26T10:32:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it will be silver
[2021-07-26T10:32:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_619@26-07-2021_10-32-54.jpg>
[2021-07-26T10:33:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it will go up to 100A with the fan
[2021-07-26T11:21:47] Happy Giraffe: 100A motor current?
[2021-07-26T11:23:41] Happy Giraffe: I plan 40A batt 100A motor so then I would need it🤔
[2021-07-26T11:30:58] Sébastien Michon: A little question, these screen aren't compatible with ubox ?
[2021-07-26T11:30:59] Sébastien Michon: https://flipsky.net/collections/new-arrival/products/tft-screen-ver2-module-based-on-vesc?variant=33929312174215
[2021-07-26T12:26:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: "continous current", so, i think battery current
[2021-07-26T12:26:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, they are. but ugly and not adapted foe escooter mount
[2021-07-26T12:29:11] Sébastien Michon: yeah ... but with a 3d printer, it's easy to do something ... but i'm ok with you
[2021-07-26T12:34:14] Happy Giraffe: That's impressive
[2021-07-26T12:52:18] Artem Bulashev: Damm that’s small. Only double size of xt90 🤩
[2021-07-26T12:53:15] Artem Bulashev: I bet with good thermal paste between case and scooter chassis it will be perfectly ok without fan even. Ubox also was rated 100a only ;-)
[2021-07-26T12:55:07] Happy Giraffe: 40A batt sure requires nothing lol
[2021-07-26T12:55:13] Artem Bulashev: Lol yeah
[2021-07-26T12:57:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: stock esc? 😱
[2021-07-26T12:59:03] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ah but 48v only ? it's moteur modify to delta wiring? crazy
[2021-07-26T13:14:52] Dennis: yes only with 48v and star / delta mod (gen1)
[2021-07-26T13:23:44] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but you change the motor wire? because it's too small if you change star to delta
[2021-07-26T13:24:16] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you have to increase (x2) the current phase for the same motor torque
[2021-07-26T13:25:17] Unknown: Do you need to upgrade phase wires for using a vesc with 1000w motor? Idk, the wires seem a bit thin
[2021-07-26T13:34:15] francois schempers: phase Amps are not continuous, you can't compare it to a continuous rating, what do you have right now?
[2021-07-26T13:35:44] Happy Giraffe: Thats what he said
[2021-07-26T13:36:59] Happy Giraffe: But lets see what final specs say...
[2021-07-26T14:35:38] Artem Bulashev: Damm that would melt the stock motor 😅😅😅
[2021-07-26T14:36:41] Artem Bulashev: Looks like very small travel
[2021-07-26T14:37:21] Artem Bulashev: What parameters you set for regen controlelr and regen battery?
[2021-07-26T14:38:57] Artem Bulashev: That’s really good pull should have :) and easy for ubox

[2021-07-26T15:30:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for brakes
[2021-07-26T15:31:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the inside of boosted throttle 😉😉
[2021-07-26T17:30:57] Luis Magalhaes: Nice, need one fan like that on mine 😂
[2021-07-26T17:31:56] Happy Giraffe: However I might swap it for Noctua industrial line👀
[2021-07-26T20:38:37] Luis Magalhaes: @koxx3

[2021-07-27T11:36:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: incredible how motors/mosfets heat with the regen braking !
[2021-07-27T11:36:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: (all dashed lines are with the right axis)
[2021-07-27T11:38:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: better view of the battery SAG
[2021-07-27T11:39:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @artBula , I received the vsett kit this morning ! thanks a lot !!! do you have the wiring description for the main controller-lcd cable ?
[2021-07-27T11:40:09] Artem Bulashev: 40a?
[2021-07-27T11:40:09] Artem Bulashev: From battery single motor or dual = 80a from battery?
[2021-07-27T11:40:21] Artem Bulashev: Mosfets are colder than a stone in central eu
[2021-07-27T11:40:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, setup at 40A battery per controller cntr rear : 100A phase max cntr front : 60A phase max
[2021-07-27T11:42:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes ! no issue at all from this side. we'll see with the 14S6P what can be done. I can optimize a bit on this battery, but with the 2P P42A, not sure I can do much better considering the voltage SAG
[2021-07-27T11:43:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also, I enabled "traction control" ... no more front tire burn, less fun, but much more control ;)
[2021-07-27T11:45:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also....
[2021-07-27T11:45:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_623@27-07-2021_11-45-57.jpg>

[2021-07-27T11:54:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 20 boards
[2021-07-27T11:54:23] Happy Giraffe: Was there a full feature sets listed for your display anywhere?
[2021-07-27T11:54:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://github.com/Koxx3/SmartController_SmartDisplay_ESP32
[2021-07-27T11:57:56] Happy Giraffe: Thanks! Thats really cool but outside of my knowledge😂
[2021-07-27T11:58:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahaa
[2021-07-27T11:58:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: wiring this isn't hard ;)
[2021-07-27T12:00:01] Happy Giraffe: Yep, and this is just the display? The controller is for other projects?
[2021-07-27T12:02:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: same project, one with a display, one without the display to place inside the deck and use your smartphone for the display
[2021-07-27T12:03:02] Happy Giraffe: Aah, now I understand👀
[2021-07-27T12:03:29] Happy Giraffe: Maybe then the smartphone would be more stealthy
[2021-07-27T12:22:45] Artem Bulashev: Haha I would not need screws 😘😅😅

[2021-07-27T15:03:01] Unknown: Hahahaha, i pre orderd 60. Then i can make 1 battery already haha
[2021-07-27T16:20:32] Tudor: Why would it burn?
[2021-07-27T16:26:32] Happy Giraffe: Twin towers burned before😅
[2021-07-27T16:26:57] Happy Giraffe: Atleast dont fit the twin tower batteries in a jihad bag, bad combination👀
[2021-07-27T16:32:58] Tudor: Yeahh
[2021-07-27T16:33:00] Tudor: 😅😅😅

[2021-07-28T13:18:49] Tudor: Hmmm i will buy a resin printer to see how it goes
[2021-07-28T13:18:56] Tudor: I am happy with my enders also
[2021-07-28T15:16:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ouch. weird aspects
[2021-07-28T15:16:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah..front part for the display and internal parts for the display
[2021-07-28T15:17:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it makes me think about aliens parts 🤣🤣
[2021-07-28T15:18:07] Unknown: I'm using a new slicer and the new printer is 4 times quicker

[2021-07-28T15:18:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳
[2021-07-28T15:18:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeahhhhhhh !
[2021-07-28T15:18:41] Unknown: Anyway I have to paint it
[2021-07-28T15:18:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i am not a fan of transparent look 😅
[2021-07-28T15:19:06] Unknown: Uv light deterioraters the material
[2021-07-28T15:19:43] Unknown: This resin is not fully clear but i love the clear look
[2021-07-28T15:19:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ohhhh crapppp.

[2021-07-28T15:46:18] Mirono escooters: Anyone tried clear wrap? I dont wanna hide my battery
[2021-07-28T15:46:27] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-07-28T15:46:44] Mirono escooters: Really clear or meh
[2021-07-28T15:47:25] Artem Bulashev: This is my order
[2021-07-28T15:47:52] Mirono escooters: Oe gps module
[2021-07-28T15:48:05] Artem Bulashev: Lear wrap 160mm wide fish paper = 8p pack is about 144mm wide
[2021-07-28T15:48:15] Mirono escooters: I will buikd my batt first then see wich size needed
[2021-07-28T15:48:21] Artem Bulashev: BMS with SIM card and Gps for remote access and tracking - also has can and other protocols so I will be able to to interface with esp32 Btw basically it is gps tracker inside battery - so no thief will find it even if they open scooter
[2021-07-28T15:48:25] Mirono escooters: Also Its L+B +10mm?
[2021-07-28T15:48:30] Mirono escooters: Oh jezus
[2021-07-28T15:48:31] Mirono escooters: Badass

[2021-07-28T15:49:59] Artem Bulashev: 17s capable btw 60amps continuous and 100amps short term discharge this BMS 😊👌
[2021-07-28T15:50:05] Mirono escooters: 😍
[2021-07-28T15:50:13] Artem Bulashev: Pretty small too
[2021-07-28T15:50:19] Artem Bulashev: 10cm 8cm 1.7cm
[2021-07-28T15:50:23] Artem Bulashev: Approx
[2021-07-28T15:50:41] Artem Bulashev: Usually smart BMS are bigger than this
[2021-07-28T15:52:22] Tudor: What bms is that?
[2021-07-28T15:53:23] Mirono escooters: Wow thats smol
[2021-07-28T15:54:16] Artem Bulashev: I will send link tonight
[2021-07-28T15:55:57] Artem Bulashev: Jkbms it’s called
[2021-07-28T15:56:03] Artem Bulashev: https://www.jkbms.com/products/active-balancer-bms/
[2021-07-28T15:56:28] Artem Bulashev: It’s also active balancing - 600ma one cell at once
[2021-07-28T15:58:00] Artem Bulashev: They have more powerful version in larger size
[2021-07-28T16:00:40] Mirono escooters: Hot
[2021-07-28T22:25:40] Sébastien Michon: Hi, Small question to the provesc spinted ...is it possible to put this type of screen? And to manage several modes like Eco with x ampers, D with other and S again other ?
[2021-07-28T22:25:46] Sébastien Michon: <photos/photo_630@28-07-2021_22-25-46.jpg>
[2021-07-28T22:29:51] francois schempers: you have as many profiles as you want, you can set them up as you want, and can switch between them from a button press
[2021-07-28T22:30:41] francois schempers: those are my two for example
[2021-07-28T22:30:45] francois schempers: <photos/photo_631@28-07-2021_22-30-45.jpg>
[2021-07-28T22:32:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: to be clear, VESC profiles exists only on the smartphone. they store config on the smartphone, and when you apply it, it writes the motor & app config to all vescs. the profiles aren't stored in the VESC. It keeps only 1 config at a given time inside the VESC (2 in fact, one in flash, the other in memory).
[2021-07-28T22:39:06] francois schempers: https://github.com/basti30/VescUartControl
[2021-07-28T22:40:16] francois schempers: you can use a small arduino in uart to relay the new profil to the controller with the click of a button
[2021-07-28T22:40:41] francois schempers: change and only made in ram, so a power down would restore original config
[2021-07-28T22:41:04] Happy Giraffe: Two Francois talking about vescs:

[2021-07-28T22:41:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: looooool
[2021-07-28T22:41:50] francois schempers: 😘

[2021-07-28T22:42:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I am working on the VESC since 4h to make it work with the Boosted throttle and the remote power on/off of the Spintend ;)

[2021-07-28T22:43:16] francois schempers: thanks for your contribution 😁
[2021-07-28T22:44:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: next step will be dual VESC ... more difficult. but enough for today
[2021-07-28T22:44:46] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-07-28T22:44:58] francois schempers: over can bus or just config both with same fw at the same time ?
[2021-07-28T22:45:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: UART => VESC 1 + UART => VESC1 as gateway => CAN bus => VESC2
[2021-07-28T22:46:03] francois schempers: <sticker>
[2021-07-28T22:46:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but the library VescUart (I use this lib too) doesn't process dual VESC. I found some pieces of code, I'll have to merge the whole thing
[2021-07-28T22:47:24] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and for the torque control (throttle) by UART you find it?
[2021-07-28T22:50:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. and there is another issue for that : the refresh rate. It is strongly advised to use UART at low speed due to high perturbation of FOC & phase current spikes (if you see what I mean 🤣🤣). So, sending the current orders like that, pretty sure it won't work. even at 115200, it's not ideal considering the frame sizes.
[2021-07-28T22:51:11] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 😪
[2021-07-28T22:51:37] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: exactly why I'm not convinced by vesc...
[2021-07-28T22:52:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: we have most option but all options have problem 😏
[2021-07-28T22:52:11] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: adc is shit, UART is shit.. '
[2021-07-28T22:52:13] francois schempers: what about a faraday grill around uart ? less perturbation
[2021-07-28T22:52:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but it was my first tests a lonnnnng time ago. May be I missed something ;) we'll again together is you want
[2021-07-28T22:52:42] Luis Magalhaes: and cruise control on spintend...
[2021-07-28T22:52:45] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2021-07-28T22:52:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and in same time I can have close to 4kw in fox with my M365 esc and the data in one wire have no problem and without blinding 😪
[2021-07-28T22:53:23] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: at the price it costs they could have provided filtering or something
[2021-07-28T22:53:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, we'll prepare a shielded cable. even the ADC is highly perturbated on my Boosted with current spikes. It makes the "constant" speed/cruise jerky.
[2021-07-28T22:54:18] francois schempers: wouldn't it be easier to isolate phases leaks ?
[2021-07-28T22:54:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes but I don't have my oscilloscope now 🙁
[2021-07-28T22:54:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i've read FOC create more perturbations... may be it's the cause. I don't know.
[2021-07-28T22:54:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: WHAT ????
[2021-07-28T22:54:55] francois schempers: instead of shielding everything else, let's shield the source
[2021-07-28T22:55:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes my oscilloscope is in Spain
[2021-07-28T22:55:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not sure how to do that.
[2021-07-28T22:55:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: crap. I come with mine tomorrow ?
[2021-07-28T22:55:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ah, I didn't read anything about it, it surprises me because the peaks are less abrupt precisely in FOC, which gives better efficiency
[2021-07-28T22:56:16] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes you can
[2021-07-28T22:58:06] francois schempers: I saw a silicon based shielding the other time, I'll see if I can find it, I could submerge the board in it, but be unrepairable afterwards though :/
[2021-07-28T22:58:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🙈😅
[2021-07-28T22:59:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: the card is already in a faraday cage
[2021-07-28T22:59:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: card ?
[2021-07-28T22:59:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: vesc
[2021-07-28T22:59:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think phase cables are the most problematic
[2021-07-28T23:00:25] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Hum..
[2021-07-28T23:00:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: for me we are not looking for the problem in the right place, I have never seen an isolated phase cable
[2021-07-28T23:01:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I even use the example of m365 everything is open nothing is isolated and this does not pose any problem despite the full duplex and half duplex data
[2021-07-28T23:01:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: also for minimotors
[2021-07-28T23:02:04] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: so yes the data speed on minimotors is not fast
[2021-07-28T23:02:53] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: another example that the shit but powerful esc with analog trigger we also have no problem of interference when absolutely nothing is isolated
[2021-07-28T23:03:32] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I think we have to find what the others have that the vesc does not have and add it, but it is obviously not shielded cables
[2021-07-28T23:04:18] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you can add ferrites for the hf, low pass filter for the adc
[2021-07-28T23:13:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, surely. needs testing
[2021-07-28T23:14:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_633@28-07-2021_23-14-08.jpg>
[2021-07-28T23:14:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: adding a new settings section for vesc 😅

[2021-07-29T08:25:49] Sébastien Michon: 👍
[2021-07-29T13:59:57] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3 Did your smart controller have additional sensors for temperature?👀
[2021-07-29T14:00:42] Happy Giraffe: Maybe one could connect it to battery if vesc has its own sensors👀
[2021-07-29T14:01:13] Happy Giraffe: And how is the remote thingy?
[2021-07-29T14:03:26] Sébastien Michon: Hello, François just told me that the spinted might not fit in my classic deck...it's boring. In this case, what do you recommend as another VESC that would also take 15-16s?
[2021-07-29T14:03:58] Happy Giraffe: Single vesc
[2021-07-29T14:04:13] Happy Giraffe: But fitting 15-16s inside xiaomi with vesc gonna be nightmare
[2021-07-29T14:04:33] Happy Giraffe: My 13s+single vesc fit barely I think
[2021-07-29T15:50:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. expansion board for temperature, humidity, i/o, current
[2021-07-29T16:19:21] Artem Bulashev: So Few things I saw: Yes fets and than phase wires are the biggest noise source. - square wave has higher noise level emission because of sharp switching with even higher ripples. - foc may operate at higher pwm frequencies more often (higher pwm frequency may fall into resonance with some of micro controllers operating frequency)
[2021-07-29T16:20:34] Artem Bulashev: Noise suppression is more effective in design. There is some modifications that one can do to the Ubox to make it handle 150amps phase (standard it can’t do above 130a without misbehaving due to noise getting to the logic side)
[2021-07-29T16:20:51] Artem Bulashev: Pro version will have that done by default
[2021-07-29T16:22:05] Artem Bulashev: - removing mounting holes makes it a lot smaller 👌 May be it can help fitment into some frames. - Pro will have different shape / dimensions so may be it will be more suitable
[2021-07-29T16:22:49] Artem Bulashev: Can line is differential - a lot more résiliant to noise.
[2021-07-29T16:23:34] Artem Bulashev: Which is why other interactive devices like BMS and some screens for esk8 use Can as communication
[2021-07-29T16:23:47] Artem Bulashev: 😘 amazing mate!
[2021-07-29T16:25:07] Artem Bulashev: Also via can it will be easy to address second Chanel as communication uses simple target via id numbers on the bus
[2021-07-29T16:28:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i've just tried putting 120A phase for front motor, it induce a terrible noise on the adc throttle line... it makes the ride very dangerous with random accel/brakes. i'll reduce the power until i solve this with shielded cables. the most anoying this is making the cable with shield wired to gnd.
[2021-07-29T16:34:12] Happy Giraffe: I haven't seen the final product but might be possible to drill hole in the case 👀
[2021-07-29T16:35:40] Happy Giraffe: Btw...I forgot this
[2021-07-29T16:35:46] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_567@15-07-2021_00-54-53.jpg>
[2021-07-29T16:45:34] Happy Giraffe: Problem is I have to bike until I get the vesc🙈
[2021-07-29T16:57:15] Sébastien Michon: No i have a dual actually with 12s4p in deck in // with 12s2p and a 3s6p in series. My 2 ESC are in the deck
[2021-07-29T17:02:31] Happy Giraffe: Hmm maybe the single vesc is same size as one xiaomi esc so you might need to get two of those if Ubox doesnt fit
[2021-07-29T17:09:48] Happy Giraffe: Early bird Ubox price was 179$🌚 Damn shortages (+them selling at production cost at start)
[2021-07-29T18:05:11] Artem Bulashev: Motor wires and adc needs to run without running along side of each other
[2021-07-29T18:05:57] Artem Bulashev: Internally UBOX said to handle up to 130a without noise issues.
[2021-07-29T18:10:04] Artem Bulashev: Had this idea too - use corner top plate screws and drill them through the bottom. But I did easier. Paste on bottom holds it well + rather hard foam on top so that foot plate presses it down 👌
[2021-07-29T18:10:46] Happy Giraffe: I wouldnt trust xiaomi plastic bottom to hold lol
[2021-07-29T18:11:22] Happy Giraffe: Metal epoxy and some m4 thread on it😂
[2021-07-29T18:11:39] Happy Giraffe: Would be real diy spirit
[2021-07-29T18:12:07] Artem Bulashev: Yeah works for me because access it byremoving foot plate - UBOX is set down on metal frame, no real need for screwing it down
[2021-07-29T18:34:14] Sébastien Michon: Yes it's a solution 😁😁...a hope. Because i can fit them one above the other. Do you have some specs of it ?
[2021-07-29T18:34:35] Sébastien Michon: If ubox doesn't fit....
[2021-07-29T18:34:54] Happy Giraffe: You can measure ubox yourself
[2021-07-29T18:35:08] Happy Giraffe: They have listed the dimensions
[2021-07-29T18:35:32] Happy Giraffe: But for single I think not fully official, maybe Artem knows
[2021-07-29T18:39:39] Sébastien Michon: For ubox i have the size. It's for single....
[2021-07-29T18:57:37] Sébastien Michon: I take the size if my deck this week and check if ubox can fit in. If not, i found the size for single : 85x54x25mm. Si i can put it one above the other ...🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻😍
[2021-07-29T18:58:26] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I think for not that many amps you wont need to put it against frame
[2021-07-29T19:06:17] Sébastien Michon: With 54mm I can put them on the edge glued to the frame too. It's another solution 😉
[2021-07-29T19:06:41] Happy Giraffe: You could just use bolts haha
[2021-07-29T19:07:02] Happy Giraffe: Tiny ones are enough to not compromise frame too much

[2021-07-29T22:23:38] sombre_enfant: U can keep the lock if u drilled it right so u can open the latch with a button or an arduino with your Phone
[2021-07-29T22:25:03] Mirono escooters: That would be super
[2021-07-29T22:25:19] Mirono escooters: Guess everything needs to be wagerproof good, as it isnt super waterproof
[2021-07-29T22:25:29] Mirono escooters: Can you wire it to vesc?
[2021-07-29T22:32:33] sombre_enfant: The lock is basically a motor or servomotor... U hook 5v and it turn, if theres a 5v bec u can do it
[2021-07-29T22:33:10] sombre_enfant: I didnt make it for mine since its a fished rental it was all rusted i hard drilled in....
[2021-07-29T22:33:36] Mirono escooters: Sounds gud
[2021-07-29T22:33:51] sombre_enfant: Or u can open and close it manually if u drill it at the right point
[2021-07-29T22:37:25] Mirono escooters: servo as far as i could see
[2021-07-29T22:37:31] Mirono escooters: Maybe ill just silicon it tight

[2021-07-29T23:16:22] Tudor: Aaa yeah
[2021-07-29T23:16:26] Tudor: Forgot that
[2021-07-29T23:16:36] Mirono escooters: I have to prob dremel frame abit where bms will sit, uug
[2021-07-29T23:16:38] Mirono escooters: Uuf
[2021-07-29T23:24:24] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-07-29T23:25:41] Mirono escooters: Or lay it flat next to it, but that wont be Sturdy
[2021-07-29T23:27:56] sombre_enfant: U can cut this edge
[2021-07-29T23:42:24] Mirono escooters: Yea my plan
[2021-07-29T23:42:28] Mirono escooters: I hope its easy lol
[2021-07-29T23:44:01] Mirono escooters: U did before?
[2021-07-30T00:32:11] Tudor: I have done that also
[2021-07-30T00:32:15] Tudor: Gives more space
[2021-07-30T00:33:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: loooooool
[2021-07-30T00:33:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it works !!!
[2021-07-30T00:33:28] Tudor: ???
[2021-07-30T00:33:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: wait for it 😉
[2021-07-30T00:33:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vidéo uploading
[2021-07-30T00:34:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: hey how him control the deck opening???
[2021-07-30T00:34:49] Mirono escooters: How hard isit and where do i file?

[2021-07-30T00:37:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: uploaded 😁😁
[2021-07-30T00:38:25] Mirono escooters: jolan de drone het is mogelijk
[2021-07-30T00:39:14] Tudor: You mean the light?
[2021-07-30T00:39:36] Tudor: I cant listen
[2021-07-30T00:40:26] Tudor: You need grinder
[2021-07-30T00:40:48] Mirono escooters: Dremel ok?
[2021-07-30T00:41:17] Tudor: If you have time then ok
[2021-07-30T00:41:31] Tudor: I didnt so grinder and cut the shit out of it
[2021-07-30T00:41:39] Tudor: 😂😂
[2021-07-30T00:41:58] Mirono escooters: I will do it careful lol
[2021-07-30T00:42:02] Mirono escooters: Prpblably not
[2021-07-30T00:58:38] sombre_enfant: The original lock is a servo motor, his remote is just a relay to feed the motor with 5v so it can open/close
[2021-07-30T01:06:49] Mirono escooters: I need that lol
[2021-07-30T01:07:12] Mirono escooters: Ill prob silicone mine anyways
[2021-07-30T01:07:21] Mirono escooters: I prefer waterproofness then that
[2021-07-30T01:07:34] Mirono escooters: As with lock mechanism it isnt waterproof at qll
[2021-07-30T01:07:39] Mirono escooters: And takes space
[2021-07-30T02:51:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: in my memory have 3 wires ? i thing +-5v and Data no ?
[2021-07-30T02:53:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Otherwise the Boosted rev works really well, with the Smart Display it's wonderful
[2021-07-30T02:54:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: It's my plan too, cut this and do batterie 20S9P with 18650, that fit just just but normally that fit
[2021-07-30T02:56:08] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: my fist plan on this scooter is Do 20S9P with dual motor and dual ESC M365 modify for 20S insered in the frame in front

[2021-07-30T16:41:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: whhhhooooo ! cool ! and 150$ finally ! they made it !
[2021-07-30T16:41:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if it's as good as twin 75x100, it's really nice !
[2021-07-30T16:41:58] Mirono escooters: Beta, ill walt
[2021-07-30T16:42:00] Mirono escooters: Wait
[2021-07-30T16:43:00] sombre_enfant: But its cheaper rn and ig theres warranty
[2021-07-30T16:43:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: rn ? ig ?
[2021-07-30T16:43:48] Mirono escooters: Right now I guess
[2021-07-30T16:43:58] Happy Giraffe: Built in antispark👀
[2021-07-30T16:44:03] Mirono escooters: 150$ + taxe uuf
[2021-07-30T16:44:09] Mirono escooters: Yea thats cool
[2021-07-30T16:44:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh shit ... english SMS style 😅😅
[2021-07-30T16:44:14] Happy Giraffe: Aka 180-190$😂
[2021-07-30T16:46:55] Happy Giraffe: Anybody here know the thickness of xiaomi frame where controller is mounted? I wanna put tiny threads there and would like to know the thickness first😂
[2021-07-30T16:48:16] sombre_enfant: Its too tin to make thread u need to comb the dissipator of the case then drill and thread, or more easy u can use some nuts
[2021-07-30T16:48:36] Mirono escooters: I saw someone with copper pipes lol
[2021-07-30T16:48:54] sombre_enfant: Ricardo😂
[2021-07-30T16:49:14] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, maybe I just metal epoxy the (m4?) rods to the deck then lol
[2021-07-30T16:49:44] Tudor: Its double with sace between the inside and exterior deck
[2021-07-30T16:49:49] Tudor: Space
[2021-07-30T16:50:02] Tudor: You can drill and make tread
[2021-07-30T16:50:06] Tudor: I did
[2021-07-30T16:50:10] Happy Giraffe: Then I could drill through one of the walls👀
[2021-07-30T16:50:17] sombre_enfant: Make an heatsink ebike style and screw it to the frame would be more efficient...
[2021-07-30T16:50:29] Tudor: Thats for the deck not side walls
[2021-07-30T16:50:47] Happy Giraffe: Thx Tudor😘
[2021-07-30T16:51:27] Happy Giraffe: I wont need any of those, usually heatsinks are only good with fresh cool air intake
[2021-07-30T16:51:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: as-tu modifié la gâche de coffre pour fonctionner comme ça ?
[2021-07-30T16:51:51] Happy Giraffe: I can put the Noctua 3000rpm fan there also but not needed at 40A batt
[2021-07-30T16:52:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2021-07-30T16:52:25] sombre_enfant: C'est pas moi, la mienne est vide, batterie 20s4p, contro g30 retail, moteur a disque bird 2
[2021-07-30T16:53:16] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: comment ta fixé le moteur bird two ?

[2021-07-30T16:53:37] Happy Giraffe: 187m3 per hour😂
[2021-07-30T16:54:06] Happy Giraffe: Gotta find dc version tho
[2021-07-30T16:54:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ils sont trop bien les moteurs bird two, mais pour les adapté avec la fixation par mâchoire c'est pas évident
[2021-07-30T16:55:16] sombre_enfant: Changement d'axe avec moteur es300 et tout refaire, mais partage pas trop après sa va voler dans les pays ou il y en a toujours
[2021-07-30T16:56:08] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 😂😂, j'avais comme projet de carrément tourner moi même des nouveaux axes en effet mais bon c'est quoi un es300 ?

[2021-07-30T17:09:18] Mirono escooters: Haha rental g30 gang
[2021-07-30T18:10:23] Happy Giraffe: How would you guys wire the brake levers and the ADC adapter to a scooter handlebar as their included cables are so short, any good place to buy longer JST cables or do I just take some thin speaker wire and solder?😅
[2021-07-30T18:12:45] Sébastien Michon: Very thin !! If the dual doesn't work m'y classic, I could put 2 like this
[2021-07-30T18:13:56] Happy Giraffe: Yep and as you use two motors you wont need much current per wheel so might need little to no cooling
[2021-07-30T18:27:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's the first vesc with correct price for what you have
[2021-07-30T18:28:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but I regret the limit at 75v :(
[2021-07-30T18:28:57] sombre_enfant: Theres no way to mod it to make it work on 20s?
[2021-07-30T18:29:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no
[2021-07-30T18:29:14] sombre_enfant: Its due to the mosfet spec or something else ?
[2021-07-30T18:29:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: something else
[2021-07-30T18:30:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's really more complex than g30/m365 esc
[2021-07-30T18:30:40] sombre_enfant: And u cant fucked-up a board at this price😂
[2021-07-30T18:31:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: FYI, with the ADC & UART wired to a shielded cable (using shield as GND), 2 consequences : 1/ not more ADC noise and jerky cruise 2/ UART can work at 115200 bauds with 120A phases
[2021-07-30T18:31:33] sombre_enfant: Ik rosheee was using the dual version at 18s...
[2021-07-30T18:33:23] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but definitely you can't mod it without make different pcb
[2021-07-30T18:34:54] sombre_enfant: Sad, rev 4.xx 6.xx was a current issue due to the drv chip right ? So no way too to go at more than 12s?
[2021-07-30T18:35:06] Happy Giraffe: Interesting 🤔
[2021-07-30T18:36:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but now the problem is Shunt amplifier x3, and maybe the latch circuit
[2021-07-30T18:37:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and of course the mosfets
[2021-07-30T18:37:36] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: the main regulator is probably 100v, have to check it, but the rest of problem is not solvable easily
[2021-07-30T18:39:25] sombre_enfant: U cant remove a part then do another with the right component and hook it ?
[2021-07-30T18:40:13] sombre_enfant: Or remove the power side from the logic, like a trace cut but a whole other board
[2021-07-30T18:40:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: find the shunt amplifier with the same gain, same case, same pinout but accept 100v
[2021-07-30T18:41:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no you can't do that because shunt amplifier xD
[2021-07-30T18:41:41] sombre_enfant: Why they couldnt do 100v board from the start...
[2021-07-30T18:42:24] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Because the schematic available is for 75/300 made by Benji
[2021-07-30T18:43:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: get a 'little focer' vesc, 20s 😁 why bother

[2021-07-30T18:48:35] sombre_enfant: Rion scoot are based on vesc ?
[2021-07-30T18:48:49] sombre_enfant: They mad expensive
[2021-07-30T18:51:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Rion will sell it 600€/unit lol

[2021-07-30T20:43:18] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but you go yo low speed and max power at 50% of max speed
[2021-07-30T20:43:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but you can change the wiring motor for Delta, you do X2 for the kv, but at the same current its /2 for the torque
[2021-07-30T20:44:01] Mirono escooters: Yea i considered it
[2021-07-30T20:44:09] Mirono escooters: Can always mod later if i am not happy

[2021-07-30T20:51:29] sombre_enfant: No speed=no fun for me

[2021-07-30T20:51:53] Happy Giraffe: No speed = No ded
[2021-07-30T20:52:16] sombre_enfant: I recently got hit by a car not my fault tho
[2021-07-30T20:52:20] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's not only that, with 20S you can have the same max good speed all the discharge if you limit the speed
[2021-07-30T20:52:36] Mirono escooters: No one has ever died from speed Its suddenly stopping that gets you
[2021-07-30T20:52:45] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 13S charged you like the speed and power but discharged you will think hum its slowly
[2021-07-30T20:53:06] Mirono escooters: Yea i hitted a car, he was wrong but i was way to fast (60kmh) sooo. Yea
[2021-07-30T20:53:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: lack of margin
[2021-07-30T20:53:11] Mirono escooters: I was lucky
[2021-07-30T20:53:21] Happy Giraffe: More G's with faster speeds 👀😅
[2021-07-30T20:53:42] sombre_enfant: Even discharged on 20s i can get 45kph while its the top speed on 13s fully charged...
[2021-07-30T20:54:09] Happy Giraffe: I should get 40kmh always on my 13s
[2021-07-30T20:54:22] Happy Giraffe: Will see, should be plenty
[2021-07-30T20:56:02] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: dépend of motor of course

[2021-07-31T10:49:49] Mirono escooters: Hear me out If we go vesc, cant we make a small, simple display that fits in xiaomi place? As m365dash did, it cqn be nice qnd give a lot of info, while being inexpensive
[2021-07-31T10:58:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I don't understand, you want small display like xiaomi but work with vesc?
[2021-07-31T10:59:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes ;) a smartdisplay, but that fit inside the dash frame of the xiaomi
[2021-07-31T10:59:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes oki
[2021-07-31T10:59:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: everything is possible... with time & energy
[2021-07-31T10:59:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes it's that
[2021-07-31T11:00:06] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you can buy xiaomi display 15€ and make new firmware
[2021-07-31T11:00:20] Mirono escooters: Doesnt even need to be lcd, just those leds are nice in xiaomi
[2021-07-31T11:00:30] Mirono escooters: Ultimate sleek
[2021-07-31T11:00:36] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but the problem is the display is in UART half duplex and vesc full duplex
[2021-07-31T11:00:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not exactly. remember the half-duplex ;)
[2021-07-31T11:00:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-07-31T11:00:55] Mirono escooters: (Ofcourse a oled or lcd would b super, but just thinkibg price)

[2021-07-31T11:01:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: haha you late, but except that in theory it's possible
[2021-07-31T11:01:33] Mirono escooters: If anyone would do this and needs sponsoring, id build ya a batt lol
[2021-07-31T11:01:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: price isn't really in the electronic hardware. The electronic would cost something like 15-20€ with the screen
[2021-07-31T11:14:37] sombre_enfant: Put a phone holder and put it on the scoot with vesc Bluetooth telemetry...
[2021-07-31T11:15:12] Mirono escooters: Oehh

[2021-07-31T11:16:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: same for me. I tried the phone, VERY annoying to have to place the phone every day to check the voltage or the speed.
[2021-07-31T11:16:55] Mirono escooters: I got the daly smart display, so thats nice
[2021-07-31T11:17:03] sombre_enfant: It dont take a tremendous amount of time😂
[2021-07-31T11:17:20] Mirono escooters: And gps+vesc wont work

[2021-07-31T12:39:44] Artem Bulashev: Nice so it was ambient EMI? Can you show your layout? Just wonder how your Motor wires lay
[2021-07-31T12:44:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, i think it was. it's a bit special on the boosted rev, you have a separated space to pass cables on each side of the frame. I'll take pictures next time I'll open it
[2021-07-31T13:01:18] Artem Bulashev: 2000w / 13/3.8v = 40a?
[2021-07-31T13:39:47] Mirono escooters: No idea

[2021-07-31T15:28:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i plugged the usb cable from smart to computer to test dual vesc uart. it didn't like it... at all.
[2021-07-31T15:29:02] Luis Magalhaes: Dam 🙈
[2021-07-31T15:29:09] Happy Giraffe: How is it possible that a small USB cable would blow up everything?👀
[2021-07-31T15:29:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i thing it's a ground issue. but not sure of course
[2021-07-31T15:31:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it blows only the logic part. on the vesc : 12v is ok, 5v is ok, but 3.3v is dead. if it's only that....
[2021-07-31T15:31:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: stm may be dead too

[2021-07-31T15:33:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this one, i can't find the reference
[2021-07-31T15:34:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lm5116 is main step down
[2021-07-31T15:35:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this one seems to be a lm27313 step-up, bit not sure... and why a stepup ?
[2021-07-31T15:40:27] Mirono escooters: Good question
[2021-07-31T15:56:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, LM5116 is clearly the main step down. now, I arrive on the STC 05C. can anyone identify this chip ???
[2021-07-31T16:01:51] Tudor: Wtf this is ubox?
[2021-07-31T16:02:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-07-31T16:02:11] Tudor: Even my grandmother with one blind eye can solder better and nicer
[2021-07-31T16:02:14] Tudor: Wtf wtf
[2021-07-31T16:02:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. poor soldering 😢
[2021-07-31T16:02:50] Tudor: For the money omg
[2021-07-31T16:02:58] Tudor: I didn't open mine yet
[2021-07-31T16:03:07] Tudor: But if its the same i will complain
[2021-07-31T16:03:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this one have only few months
[2021-07-31T16:11:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on. LM5116 is for vbat->12V then unknown SCT is for 12->5V then i don't know what should provide 3.3V
[2021-07-31T16:13:26] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2021-07-31T16:21:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't forget, for what it is, it's really not expansive
[2021-07-31T16:45:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: look at this track for example 😁
[2021-07-31T17:27:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: up
[2021-07-31T17:33:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that look not burned just make like that, weird 😂
[2021-07-31T17:34:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hey... really weird
[2021-07-31T17:34:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: have no black track
[2021-07-31T17:35:09] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's the same in other side?
[2021-07-31T17:35:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, but I found 3.3V has 0.4 ohm with GND .... so something is clearly wrong : 3.3v power, STM or something else
[2021-07-31T17:36:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 0.7 ohm on the other side
[2021-07-31T17:36:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but still didn't find what component generate the 3.3V
[2021-07-31T22:07:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: SmartDisplay repaired ... but for the VESC, nothing 😭
[2021-07-31T23:46:09] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-07-31T23:58:17] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_672@31-07-2021_23-58-17.jpg>
[2021-08-01T00:05:42] sombre_enfant: This pic gave me an headache
[2021-08-01T10:33:28] francois schempers: did you ask them ? maybe they could provide some insight
[2021-08-01T10:55:19] Happy Giraffe: Saw this one sold for 300€. E-motorbike 500w, sadly its only rated for 75kg rider but we could mount a massive battery with vesc there👀
[2021-08-01T11:03:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, I send an email to spintend
[2021-08-01T17:28:37] Artem Bulashev: Usually a small di for like 0.5a 5v->3.3v
[2021-08-01T17:32:05] Artem Bulashev: Looks like one of LDOs is 3.3v
[2021-08-01T17:32:13] Artem Bulashev: What happened?
[2021-08-01T17:32:21] Artem Bulashev: Ubox died?
[2021-08-01T17:35:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: already explained earlier with usb port on smart. i tink it's related to ground. but one thing is sure, i'll NEVER plug usb on smart while connecter to vesc. I'll debug with wifi or ble. harder/longer, but much safer.
[2021-08-01T17:36:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes ubox is dead. can even access stm with swd port and stlink.
[2021-08-01T17:36:29] Artem Bulashev: This was just mask remain kept without cleaning up - that’s how PCB design software works 🤷‍♂️ not really quality control issue. But soldering looks manual assembly. I did go through my ubox, was pretty clean
[2021-08-01T17:37:26] Artem Bulashev: Odd
[2021-08-01T17:38:35] Artem Bulashev: I don’t see reason why
[2021-08-01T17:40:54] Artem Bulashev: If your ubox and ESP died that sound like vbat came through
[2021-08-01T17:41:02] Artem Bulashev: Question is why
[2021-08-01T17:42:26] Artem Bulashev: May be it would be safe to plug in USB to Esp32 only if Ubox is powered on - vbat loop is complete and stm is woken up in correct sequence already.
[2021-08-01T17:43:10] Artem Bulashev: I saw stm die when vbat ground looped due to wrong design, and when 5v where applied to 3.3 rail
[2021-08-01T17:43:17] Artem Bulashev: Hmm
[2021-08-02T08:25:06] Mirono escooters: Lol i want
[2021-08-02T10:03:35] Happy Giraffe: Single vesc ordered🌚
[2021-08-02T10:04:25] Happy Giraffe: They didnt let me pay taxes beforehand so do you think they will smuggle it from another country? Or do I get fucked by customs😂
[2021-08-02T10:06:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ordered my dual vesc replacement... and i'll try to send the current one to repair
[2021-08-02T10:06:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: same.
[2021-08-02T10:07:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it depends where you live and what shipping method you choose. ems, low chance for taxes. fedex/ups, you'll certainly pay at reception.
[2021-08-02T10:07:40] Happy Giraffe: Oh no, I picked fedex
[2021-08-02T10:08:35] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I message them and ask for chinese mail
[2021-08-02T10:08:41] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_675@02-08-2021_10-08-41.jpg>
[2021-08-02T10:08:58] Mirono escooters: Fucked Not every site has joined ioss yet
[2021-08-02T10:09:16] Happy Giraffe: Lets hope...
[2021-08-02T10:09:36] Mirono escooters: Fedex will tax u
[2021-08-02T10:09:55] Happy Giraffe: Ems maybe not then? 🤔
[2021-08-02T10:10:11] Mirono escooters: Both
[2021-08-02T10:10:36] Mirono escooters: Courier doesnt matter, it all passes through ur country cuStoms
[2021-08-02T10:10:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: never been taxed from ems in france. ems use the standard low cost and local carrier.
[2021-08-02T10:10:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no infrastructure to let people pay ... in france
[2021-08-02T10:11:01] Happy Giraffe: Thx guys for all the info👀
[2021-08-02T10:11:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a very low pourcentage of parcels are inspected at customs.
[2021-08-02T10:12:20] Mirono escooters: A official site Wont lie about the cost of parcel
[2021-08-02T10:12:30] Mirono escooters: So yes, it will get picked out
[2021-08-02T10:12:46] Mirono escooters: Alie and shit can lie, its chinese. They wont get problems
[2021-08-02T10:13:03] Artem Bulashev: Not-since july 1
[2021-08-02T10:13:16] Artem Bulashev: All packages even 1$ will get taxed now
[2021-08-02T10:13:19] Artem Bulashev: In all Eu
[2021-08-02T10:13:30] Mirono escooters: Inderd
[2021-08-02T10:13:48] Mirono escooters: In other words We are fucked
[2021-08-02T10:13:48] Artem Bulashev: That’s why now AliExpress sells all goods under 150€ with Eu tax pre-paid
[2021-08-02T10:13:59] Mirono escooters: Wich is cool Ioss
[2021-08-02T10:14:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but at sale time because it's mandatory to declare at sale time, not at customs.
[2021-08-02T10:14:13] Artem Bulashev: This way you don’t get processing customs fee of 10-15€ for each 2$ package. Which would happen if AliExpress just shipped it without Eu customs pre payment
[2021-08-02T10:14:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: obviously spinted didn't declare to UE since no vat has been applied.
[2021-08-02T10:15:15] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-08-02T10:15:23] Artem Bulashev: Hope it goes through ok
[2021-08-02T10:15:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. i'll let you know 😅
[2021-08-02T10:24:52] Happy Giraffe: Fedex will fuck me Im afraid👀
[2021-08-02T10:27:27] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_676@02-08-2021_10-27-27.jpg>
[2021-08-02T10:38:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: never seen a big carrier like ups/fedex miss VAT 😅😅 especially because they add their fees too to collect it 😱
[2021-08-02T10:50:19] Happy Giraffe: I contact Spintend to change it then
[2021-08-02T10:51:18] Artem Bulashev: Yeap same
[2021-08-02T10:51:38] Artem Bulashev: Also fee for processing is higher
[2021-08-02T10:51:43] Artem Bulashev: On couriers
[2021-08-02T10:51:58] Artem Bulashev: Vs post (ems is operated via Post)
[2021-08-02T10:54:40] sombre_enfant: Always take chinese shipping methods, but now u can still get taxe if they look at your package
[2021-08-02T10:56:05] Artem Bulashev: They now look at Every pacakge - before it was only above 40€ or something around it
[2021-08-02T11:00:19] sombre_enfant: Hmm right with new tva law, not on ali since its pre-paid but idk how they process to look at every package...
[2021-08-02T11:41:57] Artem Bulashev: They always did, just didn’t process packages with value lower than some value incl shipping cost, but declaration was always checked on every pacakge
[2021-08-02T11:55:06] Tudor: Whats your opinions on this cells from nkon

[2021-08-02T11:56:36] francois schempers: they are sold as refurbished ? because they look like it
[2021-08-02T11:56:43] Tudor: New
[2021-08-02T11:56:54] francois schempers: what are the resistance and the measured Mah ?
[2021-08-02T11:57:05] Tudor: <photos/photo_687@02-08-2021_11-57-05.jpg>
[2021-08-02T11:57:36] Tudor: Just got them
[2021-08-02T11:58:28] francois schempers: maybe they are new, but they run out of flat top and took some with U solder tag and untaged them
[2021-08-02T12:02:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳🤪
[2021-08-02T12:16:46] sombre_enfant: New but the solder tab look funny....
[2021-08-02T12:18:24] francois schempers: one easy way to find out, mesure mah and resistance
[2021-08-02T12:19:06] Happy Giraffe: If this is new I have a unicorn in my ass
[2021-08-02T12:20:06] Tudor: They say sometimes they come with tape on top to protect them
[2021-08-02T12:20:13] Tudor: Thats glue residue from tape
[2021-08-02T12:20:34] Artem Bulashev: What the fuck
[2021-08-02T12:20:43] Artem Bulashev: That looks like used and def not new
[2021-08-02T12:20:49] Tudor: Thats what i said
[2021-08-02T12:21:07] Artem Bulashev: That’s what new look 👀
[2021-08-02T12:21:23] Tudor: Yeah
[2021-08-02T12:22:14] Artem Bulashev: also… I would open claim for sure and request 50% refund or replacement
[2021-08-02T12:24:08] Tudor: I dodnt pay them
[2021-08-02T12:24:11] Tudor: Yet
[2021-08-02T12:24:15] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-02T12:24:24] Tudor: Because this was a "lost" package
[2021-08-02T12:24:31] Tudor: And arrived after 30days
[2021-08-02T12:24:32] Happy Giraffe: And so it stays...
[2021-08-02T12:24:45] Tudor: They sent me replacement for them
[2021-08-02T12:24:55] Tudor: And i was supposed yo pay them when i het them
[2021-08-02T12:25:13] Happy Giraffe: But you didnt get them😉
[2021-08-02T12:25:31] Tudor: I dont like to mess around but i wouldn't pay for this
[2021-08-02T12:25:45] Tudor: Maybe i send them back
[2021-08-02T12:26:05] Tudor: I am honest so well see
[2021-08-02T12:26:30] Happy Giraffe: To my eyes they all look dirty and weird
[2021-08-02T12:26:39] Tudor: Same in my eyes
[2021-08-02T12:26:50] Tudor: Thats why i asked opinion
[2021-08-02T12:27:38] sombre_enfant: Test IR
[2021-08-02T12:28:00] Tudor: Reccomend a good cell tester
[2021-08-02T12:28:08] Tudor: Charge and discharge
[2021-08-02T12:28:54] sombre_enfant: I use littokala but its not that much accurate
[2021-08-02T13:16:31] francois schempers: I have this one, it is perfect
[2021-08-02T13:16:42] francois schempers: https://a.aliexpress.com/_vNxkhF
[2021-08-02T13:17:04] Tudor: Does it discharge?
[2021-08-02T13:17:56] francois schempers: it do a cycle to measure mah, full charge -> full discharge -> then full charge again
[2021-08-02T13:18:35] francois schempers: it's,automatic leave it over night and you get 8 cells at 4.2 with their precise mah
[2021-08-02T13:18:56] Tudor: How you discharge
[2021-08-02T13:21:48] Artem Bulashev: I would never buy from this company anything 😁 buying measuring device that you can’t trust is sort of pointless 🤷‍♂️
[2021-08-02T13:22:27] Tudor: Yeah i dont like littokala
[2021-08-02T13:22:34] Tudor: Never bought from them

[2021-08-02T13:27:51] Tudor: I have 6x vc8
[2021-08-02T13:28:26] Tudor: 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
[2021-08-02T13:32:40] Artem Bulashev: I was offered good 21700 cells o new from china yesterday
[2021-08-02T14:10:50] Happy Giraffe: Can magura mt5e lever be mounted to left of right? I can't find any info online Edit: yes
[2021-08-02T14:23:07] Mirono escooters: Shipping+taxes fuck u
[2021-08-02T15:55:30] Happy Giraffe: 225€ for magura brakes, pads and a rotor...better be good...
[2021-08-02T15:59:11] Tudor: Nut are as good and cheaper
[2021-08-02T15:59:27] Happy Giraffe: I want best🌚
[2021-08-02T15:59:32] Happy Giraffe: Better than Rion
[2021-08-02T20:16:25] Happy Giraffe: @artBula Did spintend address the compatible fan width for the case?
[2021-08-02T21:57:35] Luis Magalhaes: Well now its my time to have problems lol
[2021-08-02T21:57:50] Luis Magalhaes: Was riding to work today and it suddenly turned off
[2021-08-02T21:58:15] Luis Magalhaes: Checked the smart bms and it shows short-circuit error
[2021-08-02T21:58:50] Luis Magalhaes: I was riding at 60 70kmh i was a bit late lol
[2021-08-02T22:03:11] sombre_enfant: Shorted mosfet
[2021-08-02T22:06:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what controller ?
[2021-08-02T22:09:30] Unknown: I just shorted my batt, while placing a new connector on it 🤦🏻‍♂️😂 shocked the f*ck out of me, but ut's all good no explosions, no broken parts etc...
[2021-08-02T22:10:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thank the bms 😅
[2021-08-02T22:12:28] Tudor: Shock?
[2021-08-02T22:12:30] Tudor: Wtf
[2021-08-02T22:13:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Nutt are as good as Magura ? 😂
[2021-08-02T22:16:31] Luis Magalhaes: Ubox
[2021-08-02T22:16:56] Luis Magalhaes: Hope not
[2021-08-02T22:17:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: crap. did you investigate ? wiring issue ?
[2021-08-02T22:18:30] Luis Magalhaes: Checking now
[2021-08-02T22:19:21] Luis Magalhaes: If it was the mosfets the xt90 to ubox should show condutivity from + to - wright?
[2021-08-02T22:22:47] Luis Magalhaes: Its alive
[2021-08-02T22:23:04] Luis Magalhaes: Had the short-circuit value still on 115A 😅
[2021-08-02T22:23:22] Luis Magalhaes: Forget about it last time i had a problem maby it was that
[2021-08-02T22:26:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 115A bms is detected as a short ? what is the configured bms max output ? what are the vesc battery max input config ?
[2021-08-02T22:27:25] Luis Magalhaes: Im using 2 battery's
[2021-08-02T22:27:51] Luis Magalhaes: The original with the smart is a 10P os mj1 so 100A capable
[2021-08-02T22:28:10] Luis Magalhaes: And use a 6P mh1 so 60A capable
[2021-08-02T22:28:24] Unknown: The connections where way too close to my fi´gers haha and yea thank god for my bms @koxx3
[2021-08-02T22:28:32] Luis Magalhaes: It had to be a spike because it was at same time a give it a litlle more throttle
[2021-08-02T22:39:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's already complicated to fully undersrand with a single battery... with 2, i can't event imagine. different bms, internal resistance, capacity, reverse charge... i would trust that even a little 😅😅😅
[2021-08-02T23:06:07] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-08-02T23:06:41] Luis Magalhaes: Its the only way i can have more Ah, i cant fit a better one in that small deck
[2021-08-02T23:07:04] Luis Magalhaes: If you see the wolf king has 28Ah to have a 20S battery 😅
[2021-08-02T23:24:29] Luis Magalhaes: Tomorrow at 7Am i will test it going home 😂
[2021-08-03T00:55:42] Artem Bulashev: Not sure
[2021-08-03T15:40:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: crap ... china EMS send through DHL global ...
[2021-08-03T15:43:14] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-03T15:43:35] Happy Giraffe: I try fedex then, fingers crossed
[2021-08-03T15:49:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: FEDEX, you're dead for sure. May China EMS use DHL only for internationnal transport and rely on local post office for local distribution. I had the case with DHL eco & JLCPCB.
[2021-08-03T15:52:06] Happy Giraffe: There seems to be no way to evade them lol, I would have prefferred to pay tax beforehand. Now the fukers delay my packet🌚
[2021-08-03T17:08:08] Artem Bulashev: Just use AliExpress standard shipping
[2021-08-03T17:08:39] Artem Bulashev: But
[2021-08-03T17:08:55] Artem Bulashev: All packages above 150€ will be shipped without vat incl
[2021-08-03T17:09:00] Artem Bulashev: Unlike small things
[2021-08-03T17:09:44] Artem Bulashev: Which is great way - no customs 10-20€ fee on each 2$ package
[2021-08-03T17:09:54] Happy Giraffe: I ordered from spintend
[2021-08-03T17:18:02] Tudor: @koxx3 os the trigger throttle working strait on vesc? From eye?
[2021-08-03T17:18:08] Tudor: Has same 3 wires?
[2021-08-03T17:18:33] Tudor: <photos/photo_689@03-08-2021_17-18-33.jpg>
[2021-08-03T17:18:45] Tudor: So i can use that
[2021-08-03T17:22:05] Happy Giraffe: Depends if 5v I guess
[2021-08-03T17:22:15] Tudor: 3.3
[2021-08-03T17:22:21] Tudor: As ussual
[2021-08-03T17:23:02] Happy Giraffe: Should work then😉
[2021-08-03T17:23:15] Happy Giraffe: Based on this: https://spintend.com/collections/frontpage/products/e-wheel-adapter-for-safely-applying-vesc-in-ebike-electric-scooter-in-adc-mode
[2021-08-03T17:23:51] Tudor: Ok
[2021-08-03T17:23:55] Happy Giraffe: 5v ebikes, 3.3vesc
[2021-08-03T17:24:30] Tudor: Ok
[2021-08-03T17:24:45] Tudor: Because eye has already a throttle i would use that
[2021-08-03T17:24:55] Tudor: Instead of adding another
[2021-08-03T17:25:19] Happy Giraffe: I rode with this type of throttle, I prefer xiaomi style 100%
[2021-08-03T17:25:46] Tudor: Trigger ?
[2021-08-03T17:25:55] Happy Giraffe: Yep
[2021-08-03T17:26:00] Tudor: I am ok with it
[2021-08-03T17:26:12] Tudor: On my scooters ussualy inuse a fast response one
[2021-08-03T17:26:15] Tudor: Like this

[2021-08-03T17:26:58] Happy Giraffe: That looks great on the below photo
[2021-08-03T17:30:14] Tudor: This throttles are the ones i always use
[2021-08-03T17:31:51] Happy Giraffe: How does it compare to xiaomi in terms of range of movement etc ?
[2021-08-03T17:32:12] Tudor: Has a longer working area
[2021-08-03T17:32:25] Tudor: Its bigger
[2021-08-03T17:32:40] Tudor: So opens wider than normal xiaomi throttle
[2021-08-03T17:35:06] Happy Giraffe: Thats cool, maybe easier to cruise
[2021-08-03T17:35:18] Tudor: Try it
[2021-08-03T17:35:27] Tudor: See how you get along
[2021-08-03T17:36:09] Luis Magalhaes: I liked more the xiaomi style
[2021-08-03T17:36:15] Luis Magalhaes: Have tried that on too
[2021-08-03T17:37:12] Luis Magalhaes: But in any of them if you go long time with finger in throtlle its no use they all get your hand tired 😂
[2021-08-03T17:37:40] Luis Magalhaes: I miss the cruise controll of my minimotors 😭
[2021-08-03T17:55:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you need to adapt EYE output signal from 0.8-4.1V to something below 3.3V max. if not, you fry the VESC STM32. but yes, all triggers use hall sensors, so, 3 wires (VCC 5V, GND and output signal).
[2021-08-03T18:32:33] Tudor: I saw eye with attached sepparate throttle
[2021-08-03T18:32:40] Tudor: Same as the ones i use

[2021-08-03T19:07:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: anyway way, i was REALLY impressed by the spintend. did think VESC could deliver such torque. now, i'll have to wait for the replacement 😭😭
[2021-08-03T19:08:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the only issue with VESC are the real lack of protections. any mistake and it's fried. i've a lot of bullsiht with other controllers, none fried. nothing is protected. 😅😅😅
[2021-08-03T19:09:46] Tudor: Heheh then dont do mistakes
[2021-08-03T19:09:55] Happy Giraffe: Next step is to make the person buying your display to not fk up😂
[2021-08-03T19:10:13] Tudor: Because with vesc mistakes arent cheap
[2021-08-03T19:10:44] francois schempers: yes Vesc is not user friendly, you must know what your doing
[2021-08-03T19:10:57] Tudor: Uep

[2021-08-04T14:52:12] Happy Giraffe: Single vesc 150$ might be cheaper to use for developing🤔
[2021-08-04T14:53:17] Artem Bulashev: Fair point but it’s beta, so if it fails you will not be sure if it’s just beta being beta or your made a mistake
[2021-08-04T14:53:45] Happy Giraffe: My 150$ beta better work...
[2021-08-04T14:54:12] Happy Giraffe: Atm Im waiting for a xiaomi esc hall cable to safely test the motor, my chinese esc didnt supply 5v

[2021-08-04T16:08:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes ! and the esp32 is ready for Can/twai bus. but you need an additionnal component (transceiver, so... more cost and bigger board) and coding CAN bus frames exchanges is very annoying 😅😅
[2021-08-04T16:09:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also, it would work only for vesc 😅😅

[2021-08-05T16:42:46] Artem Bulashev: Guys this is not xiaomi group

[2021-08-05T22:39:09] Mirono escooters: Oki
[2021-08-05T22:39:13] Mirono escooters: 400w seems low tho
[2021-08-05T22:39:16] sombre_enfant: Im french bru
[2021-08-05T22:41:13] Mirono escooters: Cant find adptpr on alie
[2021-08-05T22:41:20] sombre_enfant: Whatever its what it rated on paper i can push 3000w on it without major problem.... 1000w François got is 40mm so... Watt rated dont really make sense u need to know the turn thiccness of copper magnet size and number of magnet not watt on paper
[2021-08-05T22:41:27] sombre_enfant: I got u sir
[2021-08-05T22:42:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: all resoldered
[2021-08-05T22:42:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_699@05-08-2021_22-42-31.jpg>
[2021-08-05T22:43:21] sombre_enfant: https://a.aliexpress.com/_vs6C0C Dt2/spider model https://a.aliexpress.com/_vphapw and this between but we need @Tudor_VTA tell us wich size/model
[2021-08-05T22:43:40] Mirono escooters: I love u
[2021-08-05T22:43:52] Mirono escooters: Ill wait for tudor
[2021-08-05T22:43:59] sombre_enfant: Me 2
[2021-08-05T22:44:28] sombre_enfant: Good job king ! Do it actually work ?
[2021-08-05T22:47:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: verdict !
[2021-08-05T22:47:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: IT'S A FAIL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

[2021-08-05T22:50:31] Tudor: But i have different adapters
[2021-08-05T22:50:43] Mirono escooters: For back please
[2021-08-05T22:50:44] Tudor: One max has something the other has a different one
[2021-08-05T22:50:48] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2021-08-05T22:50:54] Mirono escooters: Wich would fit without suspension?
[2021-08-05T22:51:00] Tudor: This is back
[2021-08-05T22:51:04] Mirono escooters: Im still wondering if the max suspension is worth it
[2021-08-05T22:51:07] Mirono escooters: Alie
[2021-08-05T22:51:07] Tudor: For the one with suspension on back
[2021-08-05T22:51:24] Tudor: This one
[2021-08-05T22:51:32] Tudor: Is this
[2021-08-05T22:51:57] Tudor: The first max I've done on the rear I have a custom made one
[2021-08-05T22:52:54] Tudor: <photos/photo_703@05-08-2021_22-52-54.jpg>

[2021-08-05T22:53:05] Tudor: This is the rear for first max I've done
[2021-08-05T23:04:37] sombre_enfant: Also how do u screw it like this theres no bolt head or nut ?
[2021-08-05T23:05:48] sombre_enfant: Same for front ?
[2021-08-05T23:13:42] sombre_enfant: Could u draw a template of this 🤌🏾
[2021-08-05T23:15:20] Tudor: You make them
[2021-08-05T23:15:31] Tudor: There is one and you make another one
[2021-08-05T23:15:38] Tudor: No
[2021-08-05T23:15:45] Tudor: This is front
[2021-08-05T23:21:10] sombre_enfant: No but wich adapter like this on front ?
[2021-08-05T23:22:01] sombre_enfant: Theres a thread on the dt2 adapter and u drilled a second hole in monorim fork ? ?
[2021-08-05T23:22:05] Mirono escooters: And ig monorim front?
[2021-08-05T23:22:10] sombre_enfant: Yup
[2021-08-05T23:22:38] sombre_enfant: Dont work with 2.3 frame but 2.0 and 2.2
[2021-08-05T23:58:53] Mirono escooters: Interesting My rental has front brake with suspension anyways, just looked for back suspension but i think ill pass (for now)
[2021-08-06T00:00:10] sombre_enfant: Yes frame is different on direction not the same angle and size
[2021-08-08T19:35:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hello guys ! what's up with VESCs ?
[2021-08-08T19:35:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i tried to repair mine, but without schematics, it's hard 😅😅
[2021-08-08T19:36:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: directfets are aweful to solder... but i managed to resolder a stm32 (proud 😅🤣)
[2021-08-08T19:36:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_708@08-08-2021_19-36-28.jpg>
[2021-08-08T19:36:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_709@08-08-2021_19-36-28.jpg>
[2021-08-08T19:36:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_710@08-08-2021_19-36-28.jpg>
[2021-08-08T19:36:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but still not working 😑
[2021-08-08T20:31:23] Artem Bulashev: Correct stm orientation? Have you reprogrammed stm?
[2021-08-08T20:32:03] Artem Bulashev: Need reflow station for fets
[2021-08-08T20:32:10] Artem Bulashev: I guess you have it though :-)
[2021-08-08T20:33:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, stm is working fine. comm is ok. no error in vesc tools. but i keep frying mosfets. replaced them 3 times. even with hotgun at 450° they are very difficilt to resolder... and impossible to see if you resoldered correctly.... a nightmare.
[2021-08-08T20:34:08] Artem Bulashev: Idea is to heat up board to 100c
[2021-08-08T20:34:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and there is components on the other side of the pcb. so, difficult for hot plate or hoven
[2021-08-08T20:34:32] Artem Bulashev: Pre heating that it will be a lot easier
[2021-08-08T20:35:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i did, hot gun at 450° + soldering iron at 400°
[2021-08-08T20:35:01] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2021-08-08T20:35:09] Artem Bulashev: Ouch
[2021-08-08T20:35:11] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁
[2021-08-08T20:35:21] Artem Bulashev: Btw lowest air speed
[2021-08-08T20:35:30] Artem Bulashev: Works a lot better than any other
[2021-08-08T20:35:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: even like that, it difficult to unsolder (and i used flux too)
[2021-08-08T20:35:44] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-08-08T20:35:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: done, speed at 4/10
[2021-08-08T20:35:53] Artem Bulashev: I set it 1
[2021-08-08T20:36:10] Artem Bulashev: Don’t know why but it works best on my station every time
[2021-08-08T20:36:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with directfets ?
[2021-08-08T20:36:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for the stm, it was mucccchhhh easier
[2021-08-08T20:37:23] Artem Bulashev: Yeah That pacakge type is slot easier and stronger
[2021-08-08T20:37:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: except components very close which tends to move (even at low air flow), and connectors (even protected with kapton) which tends to melt 😅😅
[2021-08-08T20:37:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: second time, i unsoldered the connector first. much safer
[2021-08-08T20:43:23] Mirono escooters: Maybe stm destroys mosfets? I read paolo say stm about a driver or smth keeping gate constantly open or whatever
[2021-08-08T20:56:49] Artem Bulashev: Could be driver before fets yes
[2021-08-08T21:20:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is the mosfet driver between 😉
[2021-08-08T21:20:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2021-08-08T21:41:14] Mirono escooters: That thing
[2021-08-09T00:02:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: anyone knows what are those parameters for ?
[2021-08-09T00:02:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-08-09_00-02-30.png>
[2021-08-09T00:02:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I'd like to add "eco" modes by limiting current without touching the limits (just a ratio).
[2021-08-09T11:06:17] Artem Bulashev: Creat value Bat Amps = value - 40%
[2021-08-09T11:08:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'd like to avoid that. if the software fail any computing, it fry the vesc. esk8 guys told the scale will do exactly what i want. so, let's code !
[2021-08-09T11:08:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: shame not being able to test 😭😭
[2021-08-09T11:09:48] Artem Bulashev: Scale is throttle
[2021-08-09T11:09:55] Artem Bulashev: Throttle is current based
[2021-08-09T11:09:59] Artem Bulashev: So I think so
[2021-08-09T11:13:57] Artem Bulashev: So you are worried that Board may fail and set battery max current 99999 and than it may fry something 😁
[2021-08-09T11:16:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1/ working on percent needs to be 100% sure of the original value. if the software restart for any reason, it will read thebwrong value inside the vesc. the idea is to keep all the original values set from vesc tool when possible. 2/ a bug is never excluded, so, yes, i prefer avoiding all sources of escooter crash / vesc failure
[2021-08-09T11:19:37] Artem Bulashev: But vesc stores values
[2021-08-09T11:19:59] Artem Bulashev: Job of the board is to only send new change values
[2021-08-09T11:20:15] Artem Bulashev: So board should not be sending data all the time
[2021-08-09T11:20:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not exactly, for some values, you can work on memory (and not flash)
[2021-08-09T11:20:20] Artem Bulashev: Only receiving data
[2021-08-09T11:20:29] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-08-09T11:20:35] Artem Bulashev: Interesting
[2021-08-09T11:21:12] Artem Bulashev: Since vesc works now without your board I would imagine it would work ok even if your board restarted
[2021-08-09T11:21:23] Artem Bulashev: Only power on stage is under question
[2021-08-09T11:22:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, i want it safe what ever the start/restart orders
[2021-08-09T13:35:16] Mirono escooters: Experts Every rim i wanna buy doesnt come w axle How hard isit to transfer xiaomi axle to one?
[2021-08-09T13:43:23] Tudor: You dont transfer
[2021-08-09T13:43:33] Tudor: You need a kit 😉
[2021-08-09T13:43:42] Mirono escooters: Kit?
[2021-08-09T13:43:48] Tudor: Like the one i sell
[2021-08-09T13:43:56] Mirono escooters: I rather build my own xd
[2021-08-09T13:44:38] Tudor: Ok. Best of luck
[2021-08-09T13:44:45] Mirono escooters: Guess i need it
[2021-08-09T13:45:10] Mirono escooters: Guess ill order 1 and figure out, lol
[2021-08-09T23:22:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hi @davis ! already a vesc user ?
[2021-08-09T23:45:06] francois schempers: hi, welcome here ;)
[2021-08-10T00:10:45] Unknown: not yet a user, but i consider using it for a custom e-mtb project. so, my target is to buy a mtb with full suspension and convert it into an pedal assisted bike/motorcycle hybrid basically. g30 is nice and all and i have 130km range on it, but it's only good for paved roads, also at my place there is basically a government assisted BOSCH ebike monopoly and im unwilling to pay inflated prices for heavily dongled bike parts.
[2021-08-10T00:10:48] Unknown: so my idea was to use VESC, hub motor, and my own microcontroller that gets throttle position, speed, etc. to implement 25kph legal speed limit. THEN there is some secret functionality to unlock full speed for forest paths on "private property". AFAIK VESC does not support multiple riding profiles like xiaomi/ninebot scooters do, but i need to have something akin to "german maneuver".
[2021-08-10T00:13:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Of course VESC supports multiple riding profile
[2021-08-10T00:14:09] francois schempers: with Vesc you dont need a separate controller for throttle etc, you can setup from measurement, min max voltage on the go. compatible with most throttle. as for profiles, you can have as many as you want, mine have a 25km/h profile on startup, and I can switch too max power with the phone, if I get controlled, I just have to power off, since it power on in 25km/h mode
[2021-08-10T00:16:01] Unknown: that makes things easier of course! ;) Ideally, profile switch is protected somehow, so a competent cop can't casually install the app and change profiles
[2021-08-10T00:17:22] francois schempers: you can pair your instances, so that when your phone is connected, no other one can
[2021-08-10T00:18:13] Face de Pin Sucé: He won't be able to because profiles are stored inside your VESC app so if he wants to change the profiles, he'll have to create one and it's not legal because he can't prove that you have a unlocked profile
[2021-08-10T00:18:26] Face de Pin Sucé: When he powers up the VESC it's locked at 25kmh
[2021-08-10T00:19:13] francois schempers: there is only one profil at time on the Vesc, the rest are on yout phone
[2021-08-10T00:21:03] Unknown: and still you can make the vesc boot up in the locked mode after shutdown? Just like the xiaomi/ninebot controllers?
[2021-08-10T00:21:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-08-10T00:22:15] francois schempers: <photos/photo_711@10-08-2021_00-22-15.jpg>
[2021-08-10T00:22:51] francois schempers: you set the 25km/h to permanently, and you can temporarily use a profil until a reboot, but the one that is stored is the permanent one
[2021-08-10T00:26:05] Unknown: one more thing, in legal mode i need to use a torque sensor for throttle, while in unlocked mode i want to use a thumb throttle instead. is this possible with profiles as well?
[2021-08-10T00:27:08] francois schempers: can't you just put both with an or gate ?
[2021-08-10T00:27:50] Unknown: no, because thumb throttle legal limit is 6kph while torque throttle ist 25kph. weird laws...
[2021-08-10T00:29:28] francois schempers: hum, don't think you can do that with Vesc profiles, but spinted had an adc adapter maybe you can wire it some way to do that
[2021-08-10T00:29:52] francois schempers: https://spintend.com/products/e-wheel-adapter-for-safely-applying-vesc-in-ebike-electric-scooter-in-adc-mode?pr_prod_strat=copurchase&pr_rec_pid=6135257071768&pr_ref_pid=5540421468312&pr_seq=uniform
[2021-08-10T00:30:44] francois schempers: something like that but for throttle
[2021-08-10T00:30:58] francois schempers: <photos/photo_712@10-08-2021_00-30-58.jpg>
[2021-08-10T00:44:14] Unknown: not quite sure if i'll really use the profile functionality of vesc. if a patrol really hates me they could seize my bike and then try to prove it can in fact go faster. if they manage to reprogram it, i may be in danger. ideally my bike is a literal black box that they cannot understand, like when i do a second controller that only i know how it works. or maybe, since vesc is open source, i can modify the code to my needs and then enable the controller's readout protection... or am i just paranoid?
[2021-08-10T00:44:50] Unknown: anyways, seems like it's time to buy one and play around
[2021-08-10T01:05:02] francois schempers: Vesc have only space for 1 profil in rom and 1 in ram
[2021-08-10T01:12:07] Happy Giraffe: Was there brake lever trick for vesc speed limit?
[2021-08-10T01:40:23] sombre_enfant: Why would u want a brake trick when u got a whole phone in your pocket 😐
[2021-08-10T02:00:38] Happy Giraffe: Time?
[2021-08-10T02:01:05] Happy Giraffe: Opening app etc etc police takes you from your neck
[2021-08-10T06:06:12] Artem Bulashev: It stores only one “default settings”. Than max power profile is over layed but not stored in memory - so only lives till reboot
[2021-08-10T06:11:19] Artem Bulashev: Yeah you could scale the 6kmh throttle voltage output down to this value (with resistor or adjustable pot) and install a select switch between two throttles Another idea is to use both throttles (adc1 and adc3) and have them scaled at 24% for adc3 - 6km (adc1 remains 100% scale - 25kmh) That setting would remain between profiles so with max power profile you would also be able to switch to lower scale throttle and have 0-10kmh throttle and 0-40kmh throttle (for example )
[2021-08-10T06:12:43] Artem Bulashev: No there is non because there is only one profile in VESC it self. But use legal profile as default after reboot 👌 (police won’t be able to switch out from it)
[2021-08-10T08:09:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: adc3 pin is cabled on the vesc but currently not used by the firmware or vesctools. you'll have to modify both of you want to use it.
[2021-08-10T08:14:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think cops will never dig so far. only in case of crash, an insurrance expert could bring your device to shop for inspection (at least this is how it work in france, i know some insurrance sellers and expert). the shop will not understand how it works, but will says it's a custom device. if modifications are not allowed (mostly the case), insurance will not cover you in case of crash against somebody/something.
[2021-08-10T09:19:23] Tudor: Anyone that needs a spintend controller i have codes
[2021-08-10T09:19:25] Tudor: https://spintend.com/?ref=8quslzlbmf
[2021-08-10T09:25:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: codes = coupons for reduced price ?
[2021-08-10T09:25:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: CRAPPPPP they delayed again the shipping !!!! august 18 now 😭😭😭😭
[2021-08-10T09:26:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Damn
[2021-08-10T11:01:38] Tudor: Yes its 10$
[2021-08-10T11:14:45] Mirono escooters: https://spintend.com/collections/diy-electric-scooter-parts/products/75v-100a-single-esc-single-ubox-based-on-vesc
[2021-08-10T11:17:15] sombre_enfant: Buy it bro
[2021-08-10T11:17:37] Mirono escooters: Imma go 13s first lol maybe later, spended enough already
[2021-08-10T11:17:44] Mirono escooters: Out of cells anyways
[2021-08-10T12:59:03] Artem Bulashev: Than will need to use adc2 if he wants to implement it and sacrifice electric break I think that’s the only easy way without external computers
[2021-08-10T14:02:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-08-10T15:42:08] Happy Giraffe: Oh perfect, then I can just switch from phone to high power one. Then again after shutting off it would go into legal onw
[2021-08-10T15:47:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes 😉
[2021-08-10T18:41:22] Tudor: Anyone knows how much is a vsett 10+ new battery?
[2021-08-10T18:41:40] Tudor: Also how much would the controllers be and the thrttole system cablong etc?
[2021-08-10T18:41:52] Tudor: Throttle, cabling
[2021-08-10T20:04:54] Artem Bulashev: Battery 60v 28ah is on mj1 in vsett 10+, nee about 1k euro Building it would cost about that much from good builder (200€ for the job and 800€ in parts) May be about 50-100€ cheaper, depends WLOT on supplier of cells, because new cells are pain to get now
[2021-08-10T20:06:31] Artem Bulashev: Controller is very good but not cheap see AliExpress
[2021-08-10T20:06:53] Mirono escooters: Think we can do cheaper in cells 🤔
[2021-08-10T20:07:03] Artem Bulashev: Sound like you should ask in vsett group to buy that
[2021-08-10T20:07:10] Mirono escooters: But indeed, supply is low now
[2021-08-10T20:07:30] Artem Bulashev: Cells about 650€ if lucky
[2021-08-10T20:07:59] Mirono escooters: My 13s 25ah w 21700 was 300€ in cells 😅
[2021-08-10T20:09:10] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah it's normal price for someone who doesn't order much
[2021-08-10T20:09:56] Mirono escooters: All depends on supply and cells of choice ofc
[2021-08-10T20:10:07] Mirono escooters: But thats only cells Not the rest
[2021-08-10T20:15:22] Tudor: You have a link?
[2021-08-10T20:16:16] sombre_enfant: Controller with the print ?
[2021-08-10T20:16:20] Tudor: Ok so if i sell it 700€ then is ok
[2021-08-10T20:16:23] sombre_enfant: And nfc ?
[2021-08-10T20:56:16] Artem Bulashev: Sorry wrong chat
[2021-08-10T20:56:51] Artem Bulashev: It was my chart for what probably would happen if we lowered Phase current only but by significant amount, but above Battery current
[2021-08-10T20:57:59] Artem Bulashev: 21700 cost same per cell as 18650 these days, thus more cost efficient
[2021-08-10T20:58:12] Mirono escooters: Indeed, their price is getting close
[2021-08-10T20:58:16] Mirono escooters: I ❤️ 21700
[2021-08-10T20:59:01] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that’s about same 5Euro per cell = 325€ for 65cells. 16s8p is in vsett10+ = 128 cells 640€
[2021-08-10T20:59:37] Mirono escooters: Thats 18650, lower ah
[2021-08-10T20:59:54] Artem Bulashev: Yeap thus more needed

[2021-08-12T20:37:58] sombre_enfant: Cid popped👍🏾
[2021-08-12T20:38:08] Mirono escooters: Nvm lol, didnt see the weird v
[2021-08-12T20:38:09] Unknown: What?
[2021-08-12T20:38:12] Tudor: Change the battery settings rita
[2021-08-12T20:38:34] Unknown: Well, my externall batt is disconnected
[2021-08-12T20:38:48] Unknown: So i dont get it haha it's really overvolted
[2021-08-12T20:39:47] Unknown: I'm around 4.55v, mostly use the externall batt, but always charge both 🤔 last time i used internall to drive is like 2-3 weeks ago
[2021-08-12T20:40:19] Mirono escooters: Check w multimeter If its really so high, boom Still 0,000v diff seems unlikely
[2021-08-12T20:40:26] Unknown: Always charge them seperate using the original for internall 😂 something must have gone wrong, never had problems
[2021-08-12T20:41:14] sombre_enfant: Discharge it till u can
[2021-08-12T20:41:46] Unknown: I'm gonna just drive it slowly, if it blows. It blows, untill it's empty haha.. i got a vesc 6 ready with a new motor and new batt incoming, i'll clean the chassis or get a new one idc haha
[2021-08-12T20:42:06] sombre_enfant: Without load first dont play dumb
[2021-08-12T20:42:14] Mirono escooters: If li ion catch fire u wont have a lot of scoot left..
[2021-08-12T20:42:32] Mirono escooters: I seriously hope u have a misreading
[2021-08-12T20:42:59] Unknown: No clue we'll see soon hehe
[2021-08-12T20:44:45] Unknown: Just slowly walking it giving some throttle and making it use a little watts
[2021-08-12T21:01:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2021-08-12T21:03:14] Artem Bulashev: Li ion can catch fire from excessive load on a defective cell (high internal resistance) but it’s very unlikely. Lipo chem has a lot higher chance
[2021-08-12T21:03:33] Mirono escooters: Overcharge tho
[2021-08-12T21:03:43] Artem Bulashev: That yes
[2021-08-12T21:04:04] Artem Bulashev: But that would happen at like 5v
[2021-08-12T21:04:31] Artem Bulashev: Or if rate is too high - but that’s usually not an issue with current chargers
[2021-08-12T21:04:36] Artem Bulashev: Too weak to do 4-5c charge
[2021-08-12T21:08:09] Artem Bulashev: Over charging even to 4.8 usually doesn’t result in anything beside like 60c above ambient temperature and cell chem death
[2021-08-12T21:10:39] sombre_enfant: Cid can pop at 4.4
[2021-08-12T21:15:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: example on Samsung 30q... 5v max before self protection
[2021-08-12T21:15:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_714@12-08-2021_21-15-31.jpg>
[2021-08-12T21:23:34] Mirono escooters: Wow
[2021-08-12T21:34:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Samsung never catches fire, I charged my 40T near 6V and it leaked gas with protection
[2021-08-12T21:35:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-08-12T21:41:12] francois schempers: maybe they learned from their galaxy note series xD
[2021-08-12T21:41:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <sticker>
[2021-08-12T21:56:19] sombre_enfant: At this point it was all your fault 😂 how did u let it get to 6v
[2021-08-12T23:00:02] Face de Pin Sucé: It's a loooong story with a 24S 😁
[2021-08-13T10:08:16] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-08-13T10:08:41] Artem Bulashev: I do too when I’m overwhelmed 😂
[2021-08-13T12:06:45] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_715@13-08-2021_12-06-45.jpg>
[2021-08-13T12:06:50] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-13T12:12:16] Tudor: Looks small
[2021-08-13T12:12:34] Tudor: But os it works then i would use 2 x of this ones
[2021-08-13T12:12:39] Happy Giraffe: Yep, it is
[2021-08-13T12:13:07] Happy Giraffe: Just fits with 13s battery inside
[2021-08-13T12:13:08] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_717@13-08-2021_12-13-08.jpg>
[2021-08-13T12:14:13] Mirono escooters: Would a big capacitor bank make sense w vesc ? I have spare place and spare caps
[2021-08-13T12:16:42] Tudor: Put it on the side
[2021-08-13T12:17:40] Tudor: Or cut the legs of vesc case and flip it
[2021-08-13T12:22:13] Happy Giraffe: I have a 3D printed spacer
[2021-08-13T12:22:40] Happy Giraffe: Should work ok this way
[2021-08-13T12:22:57] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3 no tax on fedex😅
[2021-08-13T12:33:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ohhhh !!! excellent !! 👍👍👍👍👍👍
[2021-08-13T17:05:24] Artem Bulashev: It will come later with a letter in about a week ;-)
[2021-08-13T17:36:03] Unknown: Ok so hear me out, if i discharge my 13s lower then a 12s batt. And then only charge it up to 50.4v, still being 13s, would i dare setting up my vesc with this? Temporair, untill my cells are in
[2021-08-13T17:51:36] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-13T17:55:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: completly true. it can 😓
[2021-08-13T18:19:15] Happy Giraffe: Im not paying shit 😂 just like the TV payment 😂
[2021-08-13T18:37:15] francois schempers: you must set a low voltage limit to not overdischarge the 13s if your controller thinks it's 12s
[2021-08-13T18:40:37] Unknown: What do you mean? I would charge it using a 12s charger then
[2021-08-13T18:41:25] Unknown: The thing is, trampa only allows up to 12s, voltage spikes may not go above 60v for it
[2021-08-13T18:42:33] francois schempers: yes, if you charge to only 12s level that's fine, but 12s discharge to a lover voltage too, you me set a low voltage limit on the Vesc so it doesn't try to discharge the 13s at 12s level
[2021-08-13T18:43:06] Unknown: Oooh like that i get it hehe, yes i would put the cutoff at 39v
[2021-08-13T18:43:29] francois schempers: 13s lowest safe voltage is 39v and 12s is 36v
[2021-08-13T18:43:39] francois schempers: perfect
[2021-08-13T18:44:40] Unknown: Well all for nothing then, got to know wich batt will take me the furthest, original batt on controller with cfw. Or vesc with 1000w motor on a "12s" 😂
[2021-08-13T18:46:23] francois schempers: 1000w is an hungry bitch, you need to feed it to have torque ^^
[2021-08-13T18:46:54] francois schempers: plus your undervolting it since it's 13s nominal
[2021-08-13T18:49:01] Unknown: True 🤔
[2021-08-13T18:50:00] Artem Bulashev: man that if it says it allows 12s this means it allows 3v * 12= 36v thé lowest Id your battery is 13s than you can / should not discharge your battery bellow 3v * 13s = 39v
[2021-08-13T18:50:28] Artem Bulashev: Or it will damage battery
[2021-08-13T18:50:46] francois schempers: it's like I'm reading myself 🤣
[2021-08-13T18:50:54] francois schempers: 👍
[2021-08-13T18:52:08] Artem Bulashev: 😁 brother 😁👌
[2021-08-13T18:55:00] Unknown: I know about that, good francois brought it up. Would'nt have tought of that, it's just that 13s is 54.6v and trampa can't have spikes above 60v
[2021-08-13T18:55:12] Unknown: I don't feel like burning 400€ 😂
[2021-08-13T18:59:15] Artem Bulashev: Got second motor today for only 100€ ☺️ I will replace my 650w rear motor on Vsett9 - this is special 500w cover (to be Legal in Eu) my scooter was supposed to come with that (documents are all 500w already) but motor under is still 650-1100w And mine I will install on front (will use cover without ANY engraving on front!(it’s just like a motor wheel but empty inside 😂 - in police mode front wheel will be only act like a e-break, this way I will tell police if they see a power cable going to it 😁😁
[2021-08-13T19:00:48] Happy Giraffe: Its funny how 500w motor at 2000w is legal but 650w on 650w is not despite having 1/3 of the power😂
[2021-08-13T19:05:08] Unknown: Is above 500w illegal in europe? 😂
[2021-08-13T19:05:16] Unknown: Im gonna have to paint my motor
[2021-08-13T19:05:48] Happy Giraffe: I dont know, I just try to limit the speed and maybe paint over the 1000w😂
[2021-08-13T19:07:04] Unknown: I always keep an eye out for the speed limits haha, i got flashed once on my electric skateboard back in the days haha, doing like 45kmh in a 30kmh zone
[2021-08-13T19:07:25] Unknown: Lucky electric was'nt as popular back then hahaha never got problems for it
[2021-08-13T19:07:39] Unknown: But will definetly paint over the 1000w part of the motor 😂
[2021-08-13T19:07:54] Artem Bulashev: In some countries 500w
[2021-08-13T19:07:58] Artem Bulashev: In Austria 600w
[2021-08-13T19:08:27] Unknown: Lol
[2021-08-13T19:08:29] Artem Bulashev: Mine came as usual vsett9 650w motor cover, instead of italian 500w motor cover :-)
[2021-08-13T19:08:45] Unknown: Nice haha
[2021-08-13T19:10:13] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌😄 problem rules also say all motors must have engraving of the nominal power and voltage
[2021-08-13T19:10:29] Artem Bulashev: At least in most Eu
[2021-08-13T19:11:57] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I’m gonna explain from motor motor having engraving To police as: « electric brake, look, I brake and try spinning, but if I accelerate only rear spins. Dual motor is called Vsett9+ and mine is Vsett9, here are sale documents they say 500w single motor »
[2021-08-13T19:12:27] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-13T19:14:59] Happy Giraffe: Was it possible in Vesc with ADC adapter to put only motor cutoff in front brake lever and then ebrake in rear lever?
[2021-08-13T19:25:55] Artem Bulashev: I didn’t get your sentence 🤷‍♂️
[2021-08-13T19:26:23] Happy Giraffe: Can I have motor cutoff in one lever and regen brake on other?
[2021-08-13T19:27:01] Artem Bulashev: What is motor cut off?
[2021-08-13T19:27:12] Artem Bulashev: Oh like dual mode or single mode ?
[2021-08-13T19:27:28] Happy Giraffe: That pressing brake stops power being delivered to motor
[2021-08-13T19:27:50] Artem Bulashev: Regen break stops power by default
[2021-08-13T19:27:59] Artem Bulashev: So does releasing throttle
[2021-08-13T19:28:13] Artem Bulashev: So I don’t understand what you want to do at the moment
[2021-08-13T19:28:35] Happy Giraffe: I only want to have one regen lever
[2021-08-13T19:28:55] Artem Bulashev: Sure than don’t connect second one
[2021-08-13T19:28:59] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-08-13T19:29:08] Happy Giraffe: Second I want no regen but to stop motor
[2021-08-13T19:29:30] Artem Bulashev: But if you release throttle it will already stop power to motor…
[2021-08-13T19:29:34] Happy Giraffe: If that's not possible, can I put two different parameters for left and right brake?
[2021-08-13T19:29:52] Artem Bulashev: Only if you connect them separate
[2021-08-13T19:30:06] Happy Giraffe: Is it possible with ADC?
[2021-08-13T19:30:10] Artem Bulashev: Other wise it is one signal
[2021-08-13T19:30:27] Happy Giraffe: I would like to make them separate
[2021-08-13T19:30:41] Artem Bulashev: Than need two separate adc inputs
[2021-08-13T19:30:52] Happy Giraffe: Oh shit
[2021-08-14T15:12:23] Artem Bulashev: Guys I’m ordering 21700 from supplier in china
[2021-08-14T15:12:28] Artem Bulashev: If any one in Eu needs
[2021-08-14T15:12:48] Artem Bulashev: I’m getting 50g (50s and t50 are 2x price), 48x is only 4% cheaper. Other cells don’t remain as cold as I want at 15a discharge beside p42a, but that one is too small capasity wise Don’t know complete price yet. But price for a cell (without import/shipping) 50g 4.9-5.1euro 48x 4.8-4.9euro
[2021-08-14T18:31:28] Artem Bulashev: 0.5mm thick
[2021-08-14T18:31:28] Artem Bulashev: 9x7 winding
[2021-08-14T18:31:28] Artem Bulashev: 92mm startor
[2021-08-14T18:31:28] Artem Bulashev: 9 wires
[2021-08-14T18:31:28] Artem Bulashev: 10mm
[2021-08-14T18:31:29] Artem Bulashev: 3mm
[2021-08-14T18:31:29] Artem Bulashev: 40mm
[2021-08-14T18:31:46] Artem Bulashev: Vsett9 / 9+ motor if any one wonders
[2021-08-14T19:01:59] sombre_enfant: What's wrong with the camera man show the angle right😐🤡
[2021-08-14T19:04:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🥰🥰🥰
[2021-08-14T19:06:59] Happy Giraffe: Hollywood action movie style
[2021-08-14T21:59:17] Artem Bulashev: Yeah, that cell does 20a continues without cooling at all and can do 35a with cooling like on drone
[2021-08-14T22:00:24] Artem Bulashev: 50s and Vapecell t50 is same
[2021-08-14T22:02:55] Tudor: Where can be bought?
[2021-08-14T22:02:59] Tudor: Nowhere 😅😅
[2021-08-14T22:10:24] Artem Bulashev: 10€ aprox
[2021-08-14T22:10:31] Artem Bulashev: My supplier has it
[2021-08-14T22:10:36] Artem Bulashev: But that’s from 100pcs
[2021-08-14T22:12:29] Artem Bulashev: 50g is prêtât close in terms of Wh up to 10amps load and just a bit worth at 15amps load continuously. For higher current you have to take molicel p42a up to 20-25a continuous Ioad (loosing capasity) or 40t for even higher continuous amps
[2021-08-14T22:13:22] Artem Bulashev: 50s give more capasity than 50g even, and same max amps as 40t 👌👌 that’s why they call it Ultimate 21700 (best of both worlds)
[2021-08-14T22:44:26] Artem Bulashev: Temp sensor if you guys want https://www.ebay.at/itm/Thermistance-NTC-3950-avec-Terminal-XH2-54-2P-100K-ohm-Hotend-Thermistor-capteur-/203524396217?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&_trksid=p2349624.m46890.l6249&mkrid=709-127639-2357-0
[2021-08-14T22:44:35] Artem Bulashev: Order it from Eu so should arrive fast
[2021-08-15T00:20:27] Happy Giraffe: @Tudor_VTA how did you make the spacers for your custom axle?
[2021-08-15T00:21:26] Happy Giraffe: I measured the thickness I need like this but would want something less diy for real use 😂
[2021-08-15T00:33:07] Tudor: I didn't make them
[2021-08-15T00:33:46] Tudor: I use already made spacers
[2021-08-15T00:35:47] Happy Giraffe: Do you have a pic of them?
[2021-08-15T00:36:45] Happy Giraffe: I think this is good to go for real use
[2021-08-15T00:38:23] Happy Giraffe: I have one spacer like this but I think I need a more stable solution as it needs to be 19mm wide
[2021-08-15T00:40:07] Happy Giraffe: Cutting this part is ok in Pro frame? Not making it too weak? I will also get rid of the light wire.
[2021-08-15T00:44:50] sombre_enfant: Put your motor on the back cuh
[2021-08-15T00:44:52] Happy Giraffe: These I could metal epoxy together but still a bit too wild of a solution
[2021-08-15T00:55:09] Happy Giraffe: Naah
[2021-08-15T00:55:16] Happy Giraffe: I like it in front
[2021-08-15T00:55:47] Happy Giraffe: Also gives me easy front disc
[2021-08-15T00:59:37] Tudor: Look on my page o have a video you can see there
[2021-08-15T00:59:55] Happy Giraffe: Thx
[2021-08-15T01:00:36] Happy Giraffe: Could this still work if I use the round tube+a flat washer epoxied together?
[2021-08-15T01:00:59] Happy Giraffe: Only one flat washer then with shit ton epoxy
[2021-08-15T01:04:21] Happy Giraffe: This is cool, maybe I do the long round one with square in the end then👍
[2021-08-16T18:38:56] Mirono escooters: Wich ebrake handles do you guys use?
[2021-08-16T18:45:16] sombre_enfant: My flip flops
[2021-08-16T18:59:02] Tudor: Flintstones style
[2021-08-16T18:59:06] Tudor: 😁😁😁
[2021-08-16T18:59:21] Mirono escooters: I cant find any (decent) ones lol
[2021-08-16T18:59:42] Artem Bulashev: <sticker>
[2021-08-16T18:59:45] Happy Giraffe: Maybe cant use xiaomi on right as the bead could drop🤔
[2021-08-16T18:59:49] Artem Bulashev: Vsett original once 🤷‍♂️
[2021-08-16T19:00:56] Happy Giraffe: If not then I got some cheapo alu levers from Wheelway kit
[2021-08-16T19:03:01] Mirono escooters: Some are just interrupt power cables Not with a h1ll magnet thing
[2021-08-16T19:04:24] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, sadly thats what they are. I tested these now and they are normally open
[2021-08-16T19:04:32] Happy Giraffe: Perfect for vesc
[2021-08-16T19:05:00] Mirono escooters: But then it will be On or off I like the xiaomi ones were u can choose how much brake power
[2021-08-16T19:05:34] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, my concern was if xiaomi handle mounted on right it could drop the cable off
[2021-08-16T19:05:52] Mirono escooters: Hmm. Fair enough
[2021-08-16T19:06:03] Mirono escooters: I got g30 frame I have monorim brake i could put on
[2021-08-16T19:06:15] Mirono escooters: I fucked the original rental brake i think. It was w magnet.
[2021-08-16T19:06:25] sombre_enfant: Use a second throttle then
[2021-08-16T19:06:35] sombre_enfant: Btw on g30 lever its hall
[2021-08-16T19:06:51] sombre_enfant: And u can take the sensor and magnet
[2021-08-16T19:07:14] Mirono escooters: Smart!
[2021-08-16T19:07:25] Mirono escooters: Done that. Can i just glue it to any lever xd
[2021-08-16T19:07:41] Mirono escooters: I like and dislike throttle idea Will see
[2021-08-16T19:07:45] sombre_enfant: Yes thats the whole point
[2021-08-16T19:07:50] Mirono escooters: First wire my vesc up and make sure i dont go boom
[2021-08-16T19:08:03] Happy Giraffe: Or you might make some sort of lid for the end
[2021-08-16T19:08:34] Happy Giraffe: Of course cable is under tension when pulled but still its open without any mods
[2021-08-16T19:08:36] sombre_enfant: Thats brake wire not part of sensor
[2021-08-16T19:08:45] Happy Giraffe: Exactly
[2021-08-16T19:09:33] Happy Giraffe: If we find a good solution to this people could have right side xiaomi handle with mechanical on back. Then hydro left/front
[2021-08-16T19:12:07] Unknown: That would be nice
[2021-08-16T19:17:31] Mirono escooters: I love vesc already
[2021-08-16T19:17:34] Mirono escooters: Silent quick motor
[2021-08-16T19:18:10] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-08-16T19:18:19] Artem Bulashev: Specially 15kmh and to the max
[2021-08-16T19:18:29] Artem Bulashev: 0 to 15kmh not as punchy
[2021-08-16T19:18:33] Mirono escooters: The motor test function was weird but fun
[2021-08-16T19:18:38] Mirono escooters: I found it hilarious
[2021-08-16T19:18:41] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-08-16T19:18:48] Mirono escooters: 1200w alie
[2021-08-16T19:19:11] Artem Bulashev: Need to lower motor resistance btw if you get motor stacking abit at low rpm
[2021-08-16T19:19:21] sombre_enfant: Ayo charge your phone
[2021-08-16T19:19:26] Mirono escooters: Thank you. Im gonna wire throttle up now
[2021-08-16T19:19:34] Mirono escooters: Got no brakes yet. Fun
[2021-08-16T19:20:05] Artem Bulashev: 1200w motor can handle full power of Ubox - 125a on motor and as much battery as your battery can handle
[2021-08-16T19:20:43] Mirono escooters: 80a it is
[2021-08-16T19:20:56] Mirono escooters: Its a good motor Sad it leaks through the fokin metal Got slime for that
[2021-08-16T19:21:08] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-08-16T19:21:26] Artem Bulashev: Slime is not very good
[2021-08-16T19:21:34] Artem Bulashev: There is other black one that is a lot better
[2021-08-16T19:21:38] Mirono escooters: Wich?
[2021-08-16T19:21:46] Mirono escooters: Ill prob silicon it lmao
[2021-08-16T19:21:52] sombre_enfant: Front drum dont work ? Also change your bearing it will do airplane sound
[2021-08-16T19:21:59] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-08-16T19:22:14] Artem Bulashev: Battery current 80a ?
[2021-08-16T19:22:38] Artem Bulashev: What motor is that on what scooter ? Single or dual?
[2021-08-16T19:23:05] Artem Bulashev: Nee vesc tool is comming up soon btw
[2021-08-16T19:23:20] Artem Bulashev: And new BMS lite from Trampa
[2021-08-16T19:26:23] Mirono escooters: G30 1200w Single
[2021-08-16T19:26:46] Mirono escooters: I havent messed w drum yet Got rear brake aswell
[2021-08-16T19:28:18] Artem Bulashev: Sweet damm
[2021-08-16T19:28:52] Artem Bulashev: What battery you have that can deliver that?
[2021-08-16T19:28:56] Artem Bulashev: Voltage?
[2021-08-16T19:29:06] Mirono escooters: 13s
[2021-08-16T19:29:16] Mirono escooters: My own made one with 21700
[2021-08-16T19:29:28] Artem Bulashev: P? Cells?
[2021-08-16T19:30:15] Mirono escooters: 5p Ncr21700a
[2021-08-16T19:30:29] Mirono escooters: They gonna sweat
[2021-08-16T19:30:36] Mirono escooters: Ill start w 50a lol
[2021-08-16T19:30:53] Artem Bulashev: I will check them out later
[2021-08-16T19:30:59] Artem Bulashev: But 5p is hard
[2021-08-16T19:31:11] Artem Bulashev: Rear cell 21700 does 15a continues
[2021-08-16T19:31:21] Artem Bulashev: From 4.8ah-5ah
[2021-08-16T19:31:32] Mirono escooters: This one is rated 15a
[2021-08-16T19:31:38] Mirono escooters: So 75a total
[2021-08-16T19:31:49] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-08-16T20:08:55] Mirono escooters: On 4.2 can you even add a ebrake?
[2021-08-16T20:10:39] sombre_enfant: Nah bro just throw it away
[2021-08-16T20:10:47] sombre_enfant: (u can)
[2021-08-16T20:10:47] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-08-16T20:10:53] Mirono escooters: How? Lol
[2021-08-16T20:11:56] sombre_enfant: https://youtu.be/4ylStCzZNV4
[2021-08-16T20:12:22] sombre_enfant: My bad i forgor u belgium and cant talk french😐
[2021-08-16T20:13:13] Mirono escooters: I cant understand shit 😅
[2021-08-16T20:13:51] sombre_enfant: Idk then but u can
[2021-08-16T20:15:13] sombre_enfant: Just watch u dont really need to understand
[2021-08-16T20:48:52] Luis Magalhaes: Mine is 1200w motor 😁 didn't burn but the other wolf with hm 3000w motors have burn one 😂
[2021-08-16T20:49:11] Luis Magalhaes: But the condition of use are very different 😅
[2021-08-16T23:11:10] Mirono escooters: Vesc doesnt see my throttle
[2021-08-16T23:11:18] Mirono escooters: CHecked w multimeter. It gives 5v and throttle works
[2021-08-16T23:11:21] Mirono escooters: Any ideas😅
[2021-08-16T23:11:31] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_736@16-08-2021_23-11-31.jpg>
[2021-08-16T23:28:21] sombre_enfant: Wtf is that battery 😐
[2021-08-16T23:29:04] Mirono escooters: Wich? In scooter? My kapton wrapped one..
[2021-08-16T23:51:14] francois schempers: if it's spinted it take 3.3v input, they sell an adc adapter
[2021-08-16T23:51:45] Tudor: 2 wire brake levers work.with vesc?
[2021-08-16T23:51:48] Tudor: Spintend?
[2021-08-16T23:54:24] Mirono escooters: I figured it out i think Connected it to reciever input 🤭
[2021-08-16T23:54:33] Mirono escooters: Isnt 3 wire better
[2021-08-17T02:07:47] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_737@17-08-2021_02-07-47.jpg>
[2021-08-17T02:08:01] Artem Bulashev: Stop lights available on Ubox??
[2021-08-17T08:31:56] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-17T08:32:42] Happy Giraffe: I bought a tiny CR2023 light that gets mounted in rear cable brake.
[2021-08-17T08:38:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no
[2021-08-17T12:33:05] Mirono escooters: Dumb question Vesc Do i limit battt A and do phase A high as possible? Or is there logic in it
[2021-08-17T12:53:50] francois schempers: limit bat to like a few Amps under your bms max discharge, and limit phase depending on the temps you get, if your fets are cooled well, you can increase phase
[2021-08-17T12:54:17] francois schempers: mine are 150A phase because its well cooled
[2021-08-17T12:54:46] francois schempers: <photos/photo_738@17-08-2021_12-54-46.jpg>
[2021-08-17T12:54:46] francois schempers: <photos/photo_204@26-05-2021_23-49-47.jpg>
[2021-08-17T12:55:10] Artem Bulashev: Phase current and battery current limit work together to propel you forword as fast as you allow it. I came up with approximate function to determine the suitable good start values - 1200w motor can handle 120a phase with 2/3 of it as battery current = 80a battery If you increase phase current by % than you need to reduce battery current by same %, but you are at the limit of your battery and ubox. So I would advise to max both out by doing 7% deviation 120amps + 7% = 128a phase 80-7% =74a battery That will be ALOT of power but will be at upper safe limit of your motor and your battery and Ubox controller, very balanced. ————- Formula is: 1. motor nominal watts / 10 = base phase amps 2. Base Phase amps -33% = battery amps limit == those are Highest safe values that motor can take without over heating ever most likely, further will require monitoring 3. Increasing Initial acceleration without overheating motor: decrease battery current limit by the same % as you increased phase current - that will manage motor heat (because it is power applied over period of time, and battery limit decrease will lower duration of full phase current applied to motor) Hope it helps
[2021-08-17T12:55:18] francois schempers: test value and see the temps you get, if its cool, you can increase phase
[2021-08-17T12:56:50] francois schempers: and the less your battery Amps are compared to phase, the more your fets have to work (and heat up)
[2021-08-17T13:04:18] Artem Bulashev: Yes it has been confirmed - it sort of works 👌 I’m getting more details on that topic from Russian Ubox forum
[2021-08-17T13:20:43] Artem Bulashev: So ppm can be configured to work as brake light signal aperantly
[2021-08-17T13:21:16] Artem Bulashev: “Ну на архитектуре веск 75/300 пин ппм переназначается на dac программно”
[2021-08-17T13:21:55] Artem Bulashev: “On 75/300 architecture pin PPM is assigned to DAC through the software”
[2021-08-17T13:47:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seriously ? i haven't seen any code modification in the published firmware to process that 😅😅
[2021-08-17T13:48:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh... curious to see that working
[2021-08-17T14:16:40] Luis Magalhaes: Wow so your using the 300A firmware ?
[2021-08-17T14:20:11] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2021-08-17T14:20:16] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-08-17T14:20:25] francois schempers: yeah, but i may role back it gets hot fast ^^
[2021-08-17T14:23:16] Luis Magalhaes: I'm managing mine ate 130A and 75A battery and its working good, can't use the 135A it hits the 180A absolut trigger and gives me an error 😂
[2021-08-17T14:23:52] Luis Magalhaes: But temperatura rise any way but at a controlled way
[2021-08-17T14:51:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: wired on the vesc ? if yes, how ?
[2021-08-17T14:58:20] Artem Bulashev: That’s only in 6.6 based vesc and not even all of them. Ubox has that and some people say they got it working
[2021-08-17T15:01:48] Luis Magalhaes: No i was just joking 😂 its direct to battery and to the sensor on brake 😜
[2021-08-17T15:03:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahaha 👍😁
[2021-08-17T15:04:30] Luis Magalhaes: You guys are the tech man im just the nob user 😂😂
[2021-08-17T18:37:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: single core spintend received 😉
[2021-08-17T18:37:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: &.running !
[2021-08-17T18:37:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2021-08-17T18:50:12] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2021-08-17T18:50:15] Artem Bulashev: 😊😊
[2021-08-17T18:50:18] Artem Bulashev: Don’t
[2021-08-17T18:50:22] Artem Bulashev: DONT burn it
[2021-08-17T18:50:25] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-08-17T18:50:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅🙈
[2021-08-17T18:50:56] Artem Bulashev: 😘
[2021-08-17T18:51:18] Artem Bulashev: Or she’ll we start new gofund complain already 😅😅
[2021-08-17T18:51:52] Artem Bulashev: Did you find what broke on old one? I remember not seeing any burned components
[2021-08-17T18:52:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i didn't remember : single core spintend doesn't have bluetooth. harder to debug since i won't plug usb while running on battery
[2021-08-17T18:53:11] Artem Bulashev: Connect external bt to it
[2021-08-17T18:53:22] Artem Bulashev: Or forword signal
[2021-08-17T18:53:45] Artem Bulashev: Also you can connect usb wittout “red wire”
[2021-08-17T18:54:00] Artem Bulashev: Just ideas
[2021-08-17T18:54:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: don't have. but smartdisplay have a pass-through mode for bluetooth/android vesctool
[2021-08-17T18:54:33] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌👌
[2021-08-17T18:57:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i am very surprised : can bus cable have 4 wires. on all description about can wiring, they always says "only use canl & canh, no power line". i'll contact spintend to see what i should use. i want to connect it with the mosfet-less flipsky with CAN.
[2021-08-17T18:59:09] Artem Bulashev: Does smart controller has i2c ? Because we could use that for extension board so that smart controller could see all the additional i/o individually :-) - try thinking it would be cool to have all stock battons to be wired up to it (turn signal, horn, Lcd buttons transmit on uart i suppose) than even just those 5 buttons could controll million function depending on combinations you press or how you press each one (double click, long press, and so on)
[2021-08-17T18:59:27] Artem Bulashev: Oh hm
[2021-08-17T18:59:32] Artem Bulashev: Strange indeed
[2021-08-17T19:00:06] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-08-17T19:00:35] Artem Bulashev: Make sure both vesc are powered on first than connect can - to be safe and not ground loop it
[2021-08-17T19:03:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: internally, yes, i use i2c. but i didn't place any output port. the issue with i2c is the wire length & perturbations. it's worst than uart as i understood. also, the i2c is already very busy with DAC to regenerate the throttle/brake signals. this why i added a specific 'one wire bus' for expansion boards.
[2021-08-17T19:04:42] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-08-17T19:04:58] Artem Bulashev: That’s true it’s very sensitive snd not advices to be over 15cm long
[2021-08-17T19:05:16] Artem Bulashev: It’s like opposite of Can 😅
[2021-08-17T19:05:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly
[2021-08-17T19:06:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the one wire resist to more than 100m 🤣
[2021-08-17T19:06:24] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁
[2021-08-17T19:06:29] Artem Bulashev: One wire is cool
[2021-08-17T19:06:37] Artem Bulashev: We use it on FC for drones
[2021-08-17T19:06:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh !! i didn't know that !
[2021-08-17T19:07:35] Artem Bulashev: Because you have like 4 motors with 4 Escs outputting 45amps each all on like 20 x 20cm space
[2021-08-17T19:07:53] Artem Bulashev: So wire length no more than 3cm
[2021-08-17T19:08:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-08-17T19:08:27] Artem Bulashev: One wire is used for 4in1 esc communication to flight controller (FC)
[2021-08-17T21:41:05] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-08-17T22:32:29] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_740@17-08-2021_22-32-29.jpg>
[2021-08-17T22:32:49] Mirono escooters: 35€ for 1 set rear hydraulic brakes; whats everyones opinion lol
[2021-08-17T22:37:08] Artem Bulashev: = 70€ for both - get shimano m6100 full kit 130€ instead - no ebrake though, will need to retrofit sensor, but a lot better kit ihmo
[2021-08-17T22:38:20] Mirono escooters: I only need rear brake
[2021-08-17T22:38:32] Mirono escooters: Fuck drum brake too. Lol Will look at that shit later
[2021-08-17T22:38:43] francois schempers: and I'm here with stock Xiaomi with no disk, doing full ebrake at 80A per motor 😂😂
[2021-08-17T22:38:44] Mirono escooters: I got thumb throttle for braking
[2021-08-17T22:38:49] sombre_enfant: I will buy meroca with 4 piston
[2021-08-17T22:38:57] Mirono escooters: I did before too lol. Sketchy
[2021-08-17T22:39:17] francois schempers: not with Vesc, plenty of brake power
[2021-08-17T22:39:54] francois schempers: only downside is no redundancy, if Vesc give up, I have no brakes
[2021-08-17T22:41:14] Mirono escooters: Oh thought u had stock xiaomi controllers lol. My bad
[2021-08-17T22:41:36] Mirono escooters: I want to have redundancy. Im sure ebrake will be used 90% off times. So strong. But i want a backup
[2021-08-17T22:41:43] Mirono escooters: Rear brake. I got 1200w motor w disk brake anyways so
[2021-08-17T23:47:58] Mirono escooters: Can vesc record graphs? To see v drop and stuff
[2021-08-17T23:48:38] Luis Magalhaes: yes
[2021-08-17T23:49:18] Luis Magalhaes: i record mine on the smartphone
[2021-08-17T23:49:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: export as xls, then graph
[2021-08-17T23:49:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: better view of the battery SAG
[2021-08-17T23:52:46] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_741@17-08-2021_23-52-46.jpg>
[2021-08-17T23:52:54] Luis Magalhaes: Voltage drop 😂
[2021-08-17T23:54:06] Luis Magalhaes: this was in the begining now its like 12v drop 😅
[2021-08-17T23:54:28] Mirono escooters: Poor battery
[2021-08-17T23:54:32] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-08-17T23:54:36] Mirono escooters: How much powa
[2021-08-17T23:54:37] Artem Bulashev: It’s Gavi if hard time
[2021-08-17T23:55:30] Mirono escooters: I wonder how much mine will drop On a load single cell 15a 4.2->3.8v
[2021-08-18T00:00:36] Luis Magalhaes: pushing 150A battery of available 160A lolol
[2021-08-18T00:02:57] Luis Magalhaes: im pushing 9.4A per cell in teory
[2021-08-18T00:03:11] Luis Magalhaes: my cells are 10A discharge
[2021-08-18T00:03:22] Luis Magalhaes: 16P
[2021-08-18T00:03:42] Artem Bulashev: What cells?
[2021-08-18T00:03:52] Mirono escooters: With copper?
[2021-08-18T00:05:22] Luis Magalhaes: no copper
[2021-08-18T00:05:31] Luis Magalhaes: mh1 and mj1
[2021-08-18T00:05:34] Mirono escooters: Wich nickel and how many layers
[2021-08-18T00:05:35] Luis Magalhaes: have 2 batterys
[2021-08-18T00:05:38] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄😄😄
[2021-08-18T00:05:42] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-08-18T00:05:46] Artem Bulashev: That’s fair
[2021-08-18T00:06:02] Artem Bulashev: I would not advice those cells for anything over 7amp per cell
[2021-08-18T00:06:04] Artem Bulashev: 😂
[2021-08-18T00:06:30] Luis Magalhaes: im pushing 92A from the original 10P mj1 and the rest from the 6P mh1
[2021-08-18T00:06:33] Artem Bulashev: 10amps burst sûre but sag is MASSIVE on them
[2021-08-18T00:06:37] Artem Bulashev: Specially mh1
[2021-08-18T00:06:45] Artem Bulashev: Voltage drop is huge
[2021-08-18T00:06:52] Artem Bulashev: About 0.15v more than mj1
[2021-08-18T00:06:53] Luis Magalhaes: yes it is lolol
[2021-08-18T00:07:10] Luis Magalhaes: but they where a cheap buy at that time
[2021-08-18T00:07:15] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-08-18T00:07:23] Artem Bulashev: Vsett uses them
[2021-08-18T00:07:30] Artem Bulashev: But load is only 7amp
[2021-08-18T00:07:39] Artem Bulashev: So they do perfectly ok there
[2021-08-18T00:07:58] Luis Magalhaes: and my minimotors setup was pushing the 100A from the mj1 battery and that was a lot to that battery , so i get that 6p mh1 and it was ok then
[2021-08-18T00:08:08] Artem Bulashev: These days mj1 seems like great choice when nothing is avaible haha
[2021-08-18T00:08:22] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-08-18T00:08:36] Mirono escooters: 21700 tho.😊
[2021-08-18T00:08:38] Luis Magalhaes: if i had monney now would be the molicel p42
[2021-08-18T00:08:42] Mirono escooters: Will see my v drop tomorrow
[2021-08-18T00:08:44] Mirono escooters: Same
[2021-08-18T00:08:59] Artem Bulashev: 50g does 15a amazingly
[2021-08-18T00:09:02] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌
[2021-08-18T00:10:04] Luis Magalhaes: whats price ?
[2021-08-18T00:10:18] Luis Magalhaes: the batterys are all expensive 🤣
[2021-08-18T00:10:24] Artem Bulashev: Im considering selling my 35e brand new - they do hold 10a continuous and deliver more wh than any other 18650 up to 7amp load
[2021-08-18T00:10:42] Artem Bulashev: I think will sell them same wholesale price I got them for
[2021-08-18T00:12:04] Artem Bulashev: 4.5euro
[2021-08-18T00:15:04] Luis Magalhaes: i think if i went to a new one it has to be 21700
[2021-08-18T00:16:11] Artem Bulashev: Not every one can fit 21700 well
[2021-08-18T00:16:13] Luis Magalhaes: but i continuo thinking its a lot of money 🤣
[2021-08-18T00:16:57] Luis Magalhaes: yes i know
[2021-08-18T00:17:48] Luis Magalhaes: i think my deck is small but know that theres some smaller
[2021-08-18T00:18:41] Luis Magalhaes: i was going to put my ubox outside deck to get more space but for now it continues inside
[2021-08-18T00:19:06] Luis Magalhaes: i was thinking of doing the same like andrew on the wolf
[2021-08-18T00:19:43] Luis Magalhaes: i was going to fit some ykz they are masive big lolol but then get the ubox
[2021-08-18T01:55:28] francois schempers: if you want best performance out of 18650, go for murata vtc6 35A discharge current and decent capacity
[2021-08-18T03:13:01] Luis Magalhaes: Good cells 👌👌
[2021-08-18T13:43:36] Happy Giraffe: Rear light solution for vesc if you hate xiaomi cables, ziptie 1€ light and done😂
[2021-08-18T13:43:48] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-18T13:58:27] francois schempers: if Anyone wants to join feel free to give the link, i dont sort people, no need to ask my permission ;)
[2021-08-18T13:58:38] francois schempers: link to the group Vesc help group https://t.me/VescHelpGroup
[2021-08-18T14:30:54] francois schempers: hi welcome ;)
[2021-08-18T14:43:02] DNP: Thanks for adding me
[2021-08-18T14:47:17] DNP: Im looking forward to upgrade me Xiaomi Pro2 to AWD with 2x 500w motor. I already got one 500W Motor from @Mister_Lithium, wich came today. I will use it with my 12s3p Rita at first.
[2021-08-18T14:50:39] DNP: I definitely want the Double Vesc. Should i use the 500w 12s3p with my stock controller. And then get the Double vesc, when im ready to Upgrade Battery and second motor. Or does getting the normal vesc first and then upgrade everything to double have a significant advantage?
[2021-08-18T14:51:32] DNP: Does Someone have a single Vesc lying around, that you‘d wanna sell? Iam from germany 🇩🇪
[2021-08-18T14:51:47] Artem Bulashev: Get one from Spintend
[2021-08-18T14:51:52] Artem Bulashev: It arrives fast
[2021-08-18T14:52:04] Artem Bulashev: And on discount for now
[2021-08-18T14:52:23] Artem Bulashev: Later will become more expensive so you will be able to sell it for same amount likely as you bought it
[2021-08-18T14:52:41] DNP: This one you mean
[2021-08-18T14:52:41] DNP: https://spintend.com/products/75v-100a-single-esc-single-ubox-based-on-vesc
[2021-08-18T14:52:42] Artem Bulashev: Or get dual right away. (Over all will be cheaper likely)
[2021-08-18T14:52:45] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-08-18T14:53:31] DNP: https://spintend.com/products/75v-100a-single-esc-single-ubox-based-on-vesc
[2021-08-18T14:53:36] DNP: This one you mean
[2021-08-18T14:53:39] sombre_enfant: 12s3p will never be enough for vesc... U need something like 16s5-7p to be good
[2021-08-18T14:54:07] DNP: But will 12s still work?
[2021-08-18T14:54:40] sombre_enfant: Will catch in fire
[2021-08-18T14:55:07] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-08-18T14:55:09] DNP: Can i set the parametes, so…. It won‘t 😹😹😹
[2021-08-18T14:55:09] Artem Bulashev: What
[2021-08-18T14:55:18] Artem Bulashev: No it won’t
[2021-08-18T14:55:32] Artem Bulashev: Why would you say that ?
[2021-08-18T14:55:40] sombre_enfant: It wont if u set right but 12s3p not enough
[2021-08-18T14:55:47] Happy Giraffe: He said he will upgrade battery later when he has dual
[2021-08-18T14:55:59] Happy Giraffe: 12s3p ok for one motor...
[2021-08-18T14:56:05] DNP: Getting Double vesc right ahead seems smarter. Because why spend 150$ and then 300$ again
[2021-08-18T14:56:27] sombre_enfant: And i dont see the point to stay with a little battery like that then use vesc...
[2021-08-18T14:56:28] Happy Giraffe: 25A batt current should be better with VESC than xiaomi
[2021-08-18T14:57:37] Artem Bulashev: 12s3p ? 🙅‍♂️ what cells?
[2021-08-18T14:58:09] Happy Giraffe: Point of notice is the limited space inside, 13s6p from scootermode barely fits in Pro frame with single vesc
[2021-08-18T14:58:10] DNP: I want to upgrade EVERYTHING. But i don’t want to do it now. Because it costs me way over 1000$
[2021-08-18T14:58:11] Artem Bulashev: That’s VERY SMALL
[2021-08-18T14:58:22] Happy Giraffe: 35E probably
[2021-08-18T14:58:42] DNP: Yes
[2021-08-18T14:58:45] Artem Bulashev: 35e ? …
[2021-08-18T14:59:00] DNP: <photos/photo_742@18-08-2021_14-59-00.jpg>
[2021-08-18T14:59:34] Happy Giraffe: If he wants to get dual vesc then a big 13s inside is not an option
[2021-08-18T15:00:15] Artem Bulashev: That will be ok for like 28a battery current and it is ok for single motor
[2021-08-18T15:00:41] DNP: <animation>
[2021-08-18T15:00:45] francois schempers: you can take the double Vesc and only use one side until you have everything for 2wd
[2021-08-18T15:00:53] Artem Bulashev: Discharge 20a? If that is due to bms than this is very little
[2021-08-18T15:01:04] Artem Bulashev: Yeap that’s what I use
[2021-08-18T15:01:07] Artem Bulashev: For now
[2021-08-18T15:01:14] Happy Giraffe: Those bms do 28A easy
[2021-08-18T15:01:29] DNP: I have this 1cm 3D printed frame
[2021-08-18T15:01:48] DNP: I can get a 5cm one, so a bigger battery fits inside
[2021-08-18T15:01:51] Happy Giraffe: How long is your internal battery?
[2021-08-18T15:02:14] Happy Giraffe: Because dual vesc won't fit with stock or typical 13s I think
[2021-08-18T15:03:08] DNP: I have no problem with having my external in a backpack like @Happy_Giraffe has
[2021-08-18T15:03:21] DNP: 13P 😂😂😂
[2021-08-18T15:03:25] francois schempers: yes, you need a smaller internal to fit the Ubox
[2021-08-18T15:03:38] Happy Giraffe: Would need a really custom solution for awd, or two single vesc on top of each other
[2021-08-18T15:03:47] sombre_enfant: I have several 13s5p if u want with ncr18650bd but still not good with vesc high voltage is the best
[2021-08-18T15:04:42] DNP: 13s is 46V right?
[2021-08-18T15:04:56] Happy Giraffe: 48v nominal
[2021-08-18T15:05:02] DNP: Whats the biggest possible?
[2021-08-18T15:05:18] DNP: Is there something like 20s?
[2021-08-18T15:05:22] Happy Giraffe: With single vesc 13s6p
[2021-08-18T15:05:32] sombre_enfant: No 17s on spinted
[2021-08-18T15:05:43] sombre_enfant: Uhh ???
[2021-08-18T15:05:47] Happy Giraffe: Leaves no extra space in frame
[2021-08-18T15:05:54] sombre_enfant: Who care
[2021-08-18T15:06:05] sombre_enfant: Theres other way to fit battery
[2021-08-18T15:06:08] DNP: 17s is how much V?
[2021-08-18T15:06:23] sombre_enfant: 17x3.6
[2021-08-18T15:06:27] DNP: I have nothing against having my battery externally
[2021-08-18T15:06:31] DNP: So 61V
[2021-08-18T15:06:40] francois schempers: i would advice 16s instead, to leave some room for regen braking
[2021-08-18T15:07:05] sombre_enfant: Then u can go one 13s5p inside and another in external
[2021-08-18T15:07:37] sombre_enfant: And add 3s10p later if 13s dont give you enough speed
[2021-08-18T15:08:02] DNP: Im wondering, can i somehow put those fckrs to use? I have alot of them
[2021-08-18T15:08:16] francois schempers: no
[2021-08-18T15:08:43] DNP: Discharge current too low?
[2021-08-18T15:08:44] sombre_enfant: Mdrrrr
[2021-08-18T15:08:45] francois schempers: too little A capability
[2021-08-18T15:09:03] francois schempers: they are like 1P
[2021-08-18T15:09:06] francois schempers: and no bms
[2021-08-18T15:09:09] Happy Giraffe: Wtffff nooo
[2021-08-18T15:09:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: avoid 😅
[2021-08-18T15:09:33] DNP: What if you have 2x 10s batterys
[2021-08-18T15:09:55] DNP: Can you make 20s put of that? 😂😂😂 I guess no
[2021-08-18T15:10:06] sombre_enfant: Too low voltage and cant do 20s
[2021-08-18T15:10:28] sombre_enfant: You in eu ? May can get u a cheap deal later
[2021-08-18T15:10:48] DNP: Yes im from 🇩🇪 germany
[2021-08-18T15:11:20] sombre_enfant: Should be fine if custom dont act up
[2021-08-18T15:11:31] DNP: I want to make this higher, to fit a bigger battery inside
[2021-08-18T15:12:13] DNP: IF i upgrade my battery. What do i do with the 10s Stock? Can it be put to good use somehow?
[2021-08-18T15:12:21] Happy Giraffe: Sell
[2021-08-18T15:12:43] francois schempers: you can sell it for around 150€ if it's still new
[2021-08-18T15:12:55] francois schempers: 100 if you've made some mileage
[2021-08-18T15:13:02] sombre_enfant: Sell all electronic...
[2021-08-18T15:13:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍🎉
[2021-08-18T15:13:41] francois schempers: controller could go for 60, ble for 20 you nearly payed the Vesc selling everything uneeded ;)
[2021-08-18T15:15:20] Happy Giraffe: If you want 16s then your setup could be: 13s6p inside sharing bms with 3s6p in Denis bag Two single vesc for awd, mounted on the side of frame etc. might require some further modding
[2021-08-18T15:16:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: dual core spintend doesn't fit inside ?
[2021-08-18T15:16:24] sombre_enfant: Battery from where and wich price ?
[2021-08-18T15:16:26] francois schempers: not with stock battery
[2021-08-18T15:16:27] Happy Giraffe: Not if you have big battery inside
[2021-08-18T15:16:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeh, but with a custom bat ?
[2021-08-18T15:16:47] sombre_enfant: Laugh in g30
[2021-08-18T15:17:00] francois schempers: it fit, look at the group's photo ;)
[2021-08-18T15:17:08] Happy Giraffe: 13s6p max with single, with dual much less
[2021-08-18T15:17:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i would clearly advise vesc inside considering the cable management.
[2021-08-18T15:18:05] Happy Giraffe: Yep 😅
[2021-08-18T15:19:06] DNP: 5000 km 😂😂
[2021-08-18T15:22:45] sombre_enfant: Isnt François schempers is on 13s rn ? How it feels ? Have u tried with the monorim motor to tell him if its enough or he will need 16s?
[2021-08-18T15:36:21] francois schempers: im on 13s8p with 1000w motors and 100A phase, cant be compared to what he can expect
[2021-08-18T15:38:04] sombre_enfant: U never tried this with one monorim 500w?
[2021-08-18T15:42:44] francois schempers: nop, was sold before, I had my 1000w from the start
[2021-08-18T15:45:43] sombre_enfant: Ait
[2021-08-18T16:48:05] DNP: Do you still need two dashboard for dual vesc?
[2021-08-18T16:48:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you need A dashboard 😁😁😁
[2021-08-18T16:49:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_745@18-08-2021_16-49-03.jpg>
[2021-08-18T16:49:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but i need to test dual vesc before 😅😅
[2021-08-18T16:52:23] francois schempers: no you can sell both Xiaomi ble, they are not used anymore
[2021-08-18T16:52:46] Artem Bulashev: Send me one will be happy to test 😄😄
[2021-08-18T16:53:00] Artem Bulashev: 😘
[2021-08-18T16:53:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: soon, soon my friend 😁
[2021-08-18T16:53:10] francois schempers: same 🤣🤣
[2021-08-18T16:53:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'll need to recontact the screen supplier, but i think they are still in production.
[2021-08-18T16:55:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: available on 8 september normally
[2021-08-18T16:57:08] Artem Bulashev: 👌😌 I would be sticking to vsett screen any way, but this screen is your work of art for sure - very clean look! (I shared it to Russian vesc group)
[2021-08-18T16:57:36] Artem Bulashev: Вам какой?)))
[2021-08-18T16:57:53] Artem Bulashev: Other people also start to make all kind of screens for vesc
[2021-08-18T16:58:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nice !
[2021-08-18T16:58:20] Artem Bulashev: But nothing as advance as your controller in my opinion
[2021-08-18T16:58:56] Artem Bulashev: @mark99i респект и уважуха! Шикарная вещь получилась)
[2021-08-18T16:59:14] Artem Bulashev: Via usb -> uart communication to vesc
[2021-08-18T17:01:57] Artem Bulashev: Russian guys are asking for some video of that in operation :) got any? 😜
[2021-08-18T17:12:21] sombre_enfant: What temp y'all use to shrink battery ?
[2021-08-18T17:21:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think i do. let me search
[2021-08-18T17:30:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2021-08-18T17:46:33] sombre_enfant: I just finished this two, how much its worth ?
[2021-08-18T17:47:24] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2021-08-18T17:47:37] Mirono escooters: Imma get red wrap and black. Should look cool
[2021-08-18T17:47:47] Mirono escooters: Although i love kapton too. Doesnt hide batt
[2021-08-18T17:48:17] sombre_enfant: Cant sell a batt with just capton
[2021-08-18T17:48:22] Mirono escooters: I know
[2021-08-18T17:48:24] Mirono escooters: For personal use
[2021-08-18T17:48:33] Mirono escooters: I always wrap mine
[2021-08-18T17:48:51] sombre_enfant: Personnal use, i use bike tube🤡
[2021-08-18T17:48:56] Mirono escooters: I got a battery here to build with 26650 from olddd project. Curious to see how they work out
[2021-08-18T18:07:01] Artem Bulashev: <sticker>
[2021-08-18T18:07:15] Artem Bulashev: Old trick 😄👌👌

[2021-08-18T19:10:11] DNP: Should i change something for the 500w motor? Maybe speed down to 35km/h?
[2021-08-18T19:52:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: good news ! Dual VESC (well ... 1.5 VESC considering the half dead flipsky) WORKS !!!!
[2021-08-18T19:52:43] Mirono escooters: How u fix it
[2021-08-18T19:52:58] Mirono escooters: Not xiaomi help group
[2021-08-18T20:00:03] Artem Bulashev: Good, no lT hung can stop progress!!
[2021-08-18T20:00:10] Artem Bulashev: Beside cash 👀🤣
[2021-08-18T20:00:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣 exactly 😅😅
[2021-08-18T20:18:04] Artem Bulashev: People are asking if you have any video of riding with your display

[2021-08-19T09:06:00] Tudor: And that 16s
[2021-08-19T09:06:32] francois schempers: with what ? a hight Kv motor ?
[2021-08-19T09:06:42] Tudor: Vsett 10+
[2021-08-19T09:06:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i ride with my 2 hands, and i don't have any gopro 😅
[2021-08-19T09:07:14] Mirono escooters: Lets sponsor him a gopro
[2021-08-19T14:55:44] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2021-08-19T14:59:32] francois schempers: your daily dose of dead people
[2021-08-19T15:44:01] Artem Bulashev: Honestly, that mono wheel is suicidal 😂
[2021-08-19T15:44:47] Mirono escooters: Not even a helmet lol
[2021-08-19T15:45:22] Artem Bulashev: Hope his airbag saved his something at least… but face is likely gone
[2021-08-19T15:46:02] Mirono escooters: Airbag?
[2021-08-19T15:50:00] Artem Bulashev: Huge belly :-)
[2021-08-19T15:50:08] Mirono escooters: A
[2021-08-19T17:49:33] francois schempers: guys, just noticed this on spinted ! https://spintend.com/collections/frontpage/products/over-voltage-protector-rehostatic-braking-resistor-module this could solve a lot of controller ^^
[2021-08-19T17:50:43] Mirono escooters: 10a peak braking current doe
[2021-08-19T17:50:46] Mirono escooters: But cool
[2021-08-19T17:51:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yep 😅
[2021-08-19T17:51:46] Mirono escooters: Cries
[2021-08-19T17:51:48] Mirono escooters: Im at 40 lmao
[2021-08-19T17:52:05] Mirono escooters: That thing is another thing to fail and destroy esc tho
[2021-08-19T17:52:22] Mirono escooters: Quick question If batt shuts off Will vesc destroy itself or juzt shut off
[2021-08-19T17:52:24] francois schempers: yes but it's 10A added to your battery once it cant mitigate the back emf no ?
[2021-08-19T17:59:56] Artem Bulashev: 60a regen on controller 1c discharge on battery= 30a 10a more amps on that thing :-) = only 20a left for vesc to deal with 👌
[2021-08-19T18:10:13] Artem Bulashev: It won’t destroy but all that braking current will have no where to go beside heat on fets - so depending on amps it may or may not kill mosfets
[2021-08-19T18:12:37] francois schempers: anyone interested in a pro 2 battery ? brand new
[2021-08-19T18:19:20] Mirono escooters: How much
[2021-08-19T18:20:17] Artem Bulashev: 14s5p 52v 13ah vsett9 also available if any one is onto it
[2021-08-19T18:41:53] sombre_enfant: 13s5p ncr18650bd cells here got 2pcs
[2021-08-19T18:42:13] Mirono escooters: Business ppl
[2021-08-19T18:42:26] Artem Bulashev: 😁🤝
[2021-08-19T23:04:21] DNP: Fck it, i‘ll buy vesc NOW! Will it work with 12s battery for the start?
[2021-08-19T23:05:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes 😁
[2021-08-19T23:05:35] Tudor: Here use this
[2021-08-19T23:06:00] Tudor: https://spintend.com/?ref=8quslzlbmf
[2021-08-19T23:06:09] Tudor: Use the link and get a discount
[2021-08-19T23:15:33] DNP: What is use to programm the VESC? Scooter Hacking Ultility app or something else?
[2021-08-19T23:15:48] DNP: Is Rita useable on it
[2021-08-19T23:17:44] sombre_enfant: No
[2021-08-19T23:17:46] sombre_enfant: No
[2021-08-19T23:18:19] sombre_enfant: Vesc tool and cant use rita
[2021-08-19T23:19:14] DNP: So i can only use 1 battery?
[2021-08-19T23:24:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-08-19T23:25:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a computer, a usb cable, vesc tool app, any battery, a throttle, a motor, and you are ready to go
[2021-08-19T23:26:35] DNP: Why cant i use two batteries??
[2021-08-19T23:40:19] sombre_enfant: Two weak battery and a switch rated at 25A on a vesc
[2021-08-19T23:40:54] Mirono escooters: 25a is too low :/
[2021-08-19T23:41:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you can too. like on any other controller if it supports the voltage.
[2021-08-19T23:48:41] sombre_enfant: When u go on vesc forget rita and low power battery its not on toys league
[2021-08-19T23:50:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: let's say if you spend 300$ on a vesc, it's a shame to use a 'poor' battery 😅
[2021-08-19T23:51:26] sombre_enfant: Same way around its sad to pay around 300$ for a rita and a 12s...
[2021-08-20T00:00:45] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-20T00:00:47] DNP: I dont want to buy a new battery Just yet. But i need a new controller NOW
[2021-08-20T00:01:38] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2021-08-20T00:01:39] Mirono escooters: Considered reinforced?
[2021-08-20T00:01:53] Mirono escooters: If not going with a crazy battery vesc doesnt have a lot of use
[2021-08-20T00:01:57] Happy Giraffe: But I got 40A Rita🌚
[2021-08-20T00:02:48] Happy Giraffe: Hopefully Rita test with vesc in the following days
[2021-08-20T00:03:16] DNP: Yes, you‘re selling those?
[2021-08-20T00:06:02] Happy Giraffe: 12s3p and 30A Rita is on the same level so all ok
[2021-08-20T00:06:15] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-08-20T00:06:48] Mirono escooters: Hope they dont go boom, maybe we can glue rita to bottom plate and have bit more cooling? Sad denis his black goo isnt so thermally conductive
[2021-08-20T00:07:01] Mirono escooters: Metal bare heatsink would be good
[2021-08-20T00:07:32] Mirono escooters: And a rc car design with small fan would do so much But deniz doesnt wanna send out rita without blaxk goop for me to experiment. So ig no rita for me
[2021-08-20T00:15:35] Happy Giraffe: Yep, and also you would want atleast 40A batt current anyways for 1000w motor
[2021-08-20T00:15:56] Mirono escooters: At least
[2021-08-20T00:16:08] Mirono escooters: I ran 32 for trst on 1200w Jeez g30 iz fokin heavy
[2021-08-20T00:16:20] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi already goes w that
[2021-08-20T00:16:25] Mirono escooters: Good i went 5p
[2021-08-20T00:33:34] Happy Giraffe: My chinese crap esc used 22A (no idea how much phase) and it barely made 1000w motor go 35kmh.
[2021-08-20T08:35:53] Happy Giraffe: Can vesc sensor/throttle cables share the same +5 and GND?
[2021-08-20T08:36:02] Happy Giraffe: In Xiaomi they do
[2021-08-20T08:36:38] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-08-20T08:41:01] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2021-08-20T15:04:15] Mirono escooters: Clean
[2021-08-20T15:06:18] Artem Bulashev: Vsett motor assembly i have to say amazingly well done

[2021-08-20T16:38:46] Artem Bulashev: Finished adding temp sensor… Hell of the job…. Took me 3h - take photo of original wiring - desoldered - wire down to be perpendicular to the opening and pull your end - cut off abit the ends - cut outer layer of isolation or better Make groove! Don’t cut completely! - place 1 wire out of 2 into groove - heat shrink wire and insert it with groove being 90 degree away from direction you going to bend that whole cable when motor installed ! (Use smallest heat shrink and wait till it is cold) - desoldered motor winding to individual strands, and than make your wire and winding strands in shape like \|/ and \|/ and twist together with pliers - solder through very well! - heat shrink with excess and on top of that use the the wire sleeve for high current / voltage application (see photos)

[2021-08-20T16:48:44] francois schempers: I wasn't that careful for my temp sensor xD

[2021-08-20T17:01:10] Artem Bulashev: Lol, was not even an option, I could not even move my motor wiring back and forth In the shaft - it was occupying 95% of dia, with added heatshrink all 100% lol
[2021-08-20T17:01:51] francois schempers: mine too, wd40 and a lot of work, took me 3hours 🤣🤣
[2021-08-20T17:36:33] Artem Bulashev: I like how your wheel has access without need to remove bell.
[2021-08-20T17:36:52] Artem Bulashev: And need to remove wiring harness at all 👌
[2021-08-20T17:53:52] francois schempers: it's the 1000w wheelway
[2021-08-20T18:38:39] Unknown: What setup are you running?
[2021-08-20T18:38:47] Unknown: <photos/photo_771@20-08-2021_18-38-47.jpg>
[2021-08-20T18:40:20] Unknown: Waiting on my cells, 12s4p molicel p42a, 60amp bms Gonna make a second 12s6p 80a bms as secondary later on, might place it as internal.. that way i can make an 80amp profile and disconnect the externall batt
[2021-08-20T21:10:35] Mirono escooters: Vesc has on off pins to wire switch to?
[2021-08-20T21:28:32] francois schempers: spinted yes
[2021-08-20T21:28:49] francois schempers: they even send you the on/off switch with it
[2021-08-20T21:29:15] francois schempers: for now 13s8p 35E dual 1000w
[2021-08-20T21:32:46] Mirono escooters: Got flipsky
[2021-08-20T21:45:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-08-20T22:44:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: battery cells testing and reassembly done with Repack ! 😅😅
[2021-08-20T22:44:45] Mirono escooters: Noice
[2021-08-20T23:45:47] Happy Giraffe: How do I wire a Normally Open brake sensor and Xiaomi sensor together on the ADC board? Was it even possible to use two different types of braking? iex . 0.5A for Front Hydro to just act as a motor power off 0-15A on Rear with xiaomi lever
[2021-08-20T23:48:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's gonna be really weird : - the xiaomi brake will be progressive - the hydro will send a fixed brake (probably 100%).
[2021-08-20T23:48:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i would advise to wire only the xiaomi or try to put a hall sensor on the hydro
[2021-08-20T23:51:41] Face de Pin Sucé: 16S12P Samsung 50E (I'm the one in front, disappearing)
[2021-08-20T23:51:41] Face de Pin Sucé: vous voulez voir ma disparition en live ? 😆(j'suis en 60V et le gars qui essaie de me suivre est en 72V mdr)
[2021-08-20T23:52:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but is it a VESC ? 😁😅
[2021-08-20T23:52:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Not yet 😁🤫🤫
[2021-08-20T23:52:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Soon
[2021-08-21T00:05:39] sombre_enfant: Attend mais c'est a lyon sa non ?
[2021-08-21T00:13:24] Happy Giraffe: Maybe not wire hydro at all then?🤔
[2021-08-21T00:13:38] Happy Giraffe: As its on same wheel as motor so it stops motor in the meantime
[2021-08-21T00:14:09] Happy Giraffe: Holy
[2021-08-21T00:15:04] Happy Giraffe: Thats some acceleration
[2021-08-21T00:19:32] Artem Bulashev: Xiaomi is normally closed ? 😅
[2021-08-21T00:20:39] Artem Bulashev: Why would they do that 🤣 You can’t wire both brake sensors in parallel - which is what it would usually be
[2021-08-21T00:20:55] Artem Bulashev: Moment but xiaomi break handles are Hall effect
[2021-08-21T00:21:09] Artem Bulashev: And not just open / closed like 99% of others
[2021-08-21T00:23:08] Happy Giraffe: Magura normally Open
[2021-08-21T00:23:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly
[2021-08-21T00:24:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: xiaomi, etwow, boosted, rion curve and some cheap escooters use analog sensor (aka hall) for ebrake.
[2021-08-21T00:24:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Oui mdr
[2021-08-21T00:26:15] sombre_enfant: Très bon spot pour ride mais bon je fais pas du tout le poid avec ma pauvre g30 dual 72v....tu est dans "les gone de lyon"?
[2021-08-21T00:26:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Go mp pour pas parasiter le groupe ;)
[2021-08-21T00:27:03] sombre_enfant: Also your friend got a weak battery thats why he cant catch up even on 72v he sag too much
[2021-08-21T00:28:00] Face de Pin Sucé: He has 20S9P Samsung 50E cells but he pulls 250-300A out of it, that's why it sags, waiting for P42A or 40T
[2021-08-21T00:28:22] Mirono escooters: Jeezus fok that's a lot
[2021-08-21T00:28:27] Mirono escooters: How is it build I hope copprr
[2021-08-21T00:28:29] Happy Giraffe: But if I connect them separate then? Xiaomi sensor is 3.3v?
[2021-08-21T00:28:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-08-21T00:29:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: make a schematic
[2021-08-21T00:29:52] Mirono escooters: His 72v batt went as low as 58v lol
[2021-08-21T00:30:00] sombre_enfant: Damn 300A bat or phase ? What he use sabvoton ?
[2021-08-21T00:30:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Kelly, battery, but I don't think he pulls more than 250A
[2021-08-21T00:32:58] sombre_enfant: Kelly always show phase... And not as good as sabvoton... Imo
[2021-08-21T00:33:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes but we've looked at BMS directly
[2021-08-21T00:33:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Sabvoton is too big
[2021-08-21T00:48:45] Happy Giraffe: Cant I just put the brakes here?
[2021-08-21T00:49:23] Happy Giraffe: But what happens to the switch then?😂
[2021-08-21T00:54:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: since the switch seems to be to choose between both brake types, i don't think it will work.
[2021-08-21T01:03:59] Happy Giraffe: Aah shiet, was xiaomi brake 3.3v?
[2021-08-21T03:07:29] Unknown: What speed do you reach top?
[2021-08-21T05:14:01] francois schempers: around 55km/h (and im heavy)
[2021-08-21T08:59:37] sombre_enfant: 5v
[2021-08-21T10:22:06] Artem Bulashev: He should have gotten P42a from startsay be 50s samsung but it cost more :))
[2021-08-21T11:29:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: dirty job, but it will be ok for a test ride with the single code spintend. both with SmartDisplay 😁

[2021-08-21T11:35:13] Artem Bulashev: 🤝😃
[2021-08-21T11:37:00] Artem Bulashev: Didn’t finish mine 😂 took me soo much time to replan all the wiring layouts 💩💩 but I think it will be super clean after all 😊 All direct solder cables 😁
[2021-08-21T11:42:16] Mirono escooters: Direct solder is best Until u realise u need to add brake disk. Like I did F
[2021-08-21T11:42:51] Tudor: How is vsett frame?
[2021-08-21T11:43:00] Tudor: I want to buy one to pimp it
[2021-08-21T11:43:04] Tudor: Vsett 10+
[2021-08-21T11:43:51] Mirono escooters: I need more leds. Lol (Sorry for that camera quality lmao)
[2021-08-21T11:44:00] Mirono escooters: Did 50a today Pulls nicely
[2021-08-21T11:59:39] sombre_enfant: U made a fiberglass battery cover
[2021-08-21T12:00:54] Mirono escooters: Nah just plexiglass
[2021-08-21T12:06:49] sombre_enfant: And u can put your weight on it without prob ?
[2021-08-21T12:07:24] Mirono escooters: 6mm thicc. It doesn't even bend
[2021-08-21T12:07:35] Mirono escooters: It can rest on batt too spreading load even more
[2021-08-21T12:07:40] Mirono escooters: Im not heavy. 50kg
[2021-08-21T12:07:43] Unknown: It will brake
[2021-08-21T12:07:54] Unknown: I tested it
[2021-08-21T12:08:14] Unknown: 6mm acrylic laser cuted
[2021-08-21T12:08:19] Mirono escooters: Here it doesnt even bend. And it rest on battery
[2021-08-21T12:08:35] Mirono escooters: Will see :) I didnt trst ride muxh. I could b wrong
[2021-08-21T12:08:57] Unknown: You will see it will deteriorate
[2021-08-21T12:09:21] Mirono escooters: Oki, its just a test
[2021-08-21T12:10:38] sombre_enfant: U sit on your battery 👍🏾😭
[2021-08-21T12:10:58] Mirono escooters: Its not much. And there's foam between
[2021-08-21T12:11:10] Mirono escooters: It's just a "buffer" and it rests on mousse and plastic holders
[2021-08-21T12:11:26] Artem Bulashev: Break disk on vsett is on the other side ;-)
[2021-08-21T12:11:41] Artem Bulashev: Nice and easy change :-)
[2021-08-21T12:12:11] Mirono escooters: Yea I know
[2021-08-21T12:12:13] Mirono escooters: :(
[2021-08-21T12:12:32] sombre_enfant: Ah nice ! Also u find a way to put rear disc ?
[2021-08-21T12:12:40] Artem Bulashev: Amazing - best frame from all scooters out there. Specially 10+. It has 2 things to fix even before it arrives to make it perfect scooter and best value 100% 1. Exa htdrolic shocks = 100€ for both together 2. Solid handlebar if you don’t want to have any movement at all, if you don’t mind just a bit than may not need that
[2021-08-21T12:12:58] Mirono escooters: Also. Daly bms I cant turn It off w my display. I "should have asked the factory " . Thought turning off/on a smart bms was bottom line... oh well. I ordered antispark.
[2021-08-21T12:13:17] Mirono escooters: Yea monoshit adaptor :) waiting for 140mm disk now
[2021-08-21T12:13:36] Mirono escooters: I cutted drum brake for now can't be arsed
[2021-08-21T12:13:42] Mirono escooters: Maybe later
[2021-08-21T12:13:48] Mirono escooters: Vesc ebrake is 🥰 tho
[2021-08-21T12:15:06] Artem Bulashev: ✅✅
[2021-08-21T12:15:27] Artem Bulashev: Fiberglass?
[2021-08-21T12:15:32] Mirono escooters: Nah. I wish
[2021-08-21T12:16:30] Artem Bulashev: You have laser cutter?
[2021-08-21T12:17:26] Unknown: Yes .... CO2
[2021-08-21T12:17:31] Unknown: 60 watts
[2021-08-21T12:17:39] Artem Bulashev: Batteries have Fiberglass walls so actually many scooter do that.
[2021-08-21T12:17:57] Artem Bulashev: Cooool
[2021-08-21T12:18:16] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_778@21-08-2021_12-18-16.jpg>
[2021-08-21T12:18:27] Unknown: I have problems with it for long time but next week i fix it...
[2021-08-21T12:19:27] Unknown: Fucking big machine i have to take it apart so it fits the door
[2021-08-21T12:19:57] Artem Bulashev: Cnc those - it’s spacer for vsett 9, first test. End result will be solid 12mm thick from transparent plexiglass or acrylic not sure yet
[2021-08-21T12:20:07] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅 not meant to be moved
[2021-08-21T12:20:28] Unknown: But I'm back now .....i hope my private problems will not more interfere...
[2021-08-21T12:21:41] Mirono escooters: 12mm?? Oh boy
[2021-08-21T12:22:27] Artem Bulashev: It will only extend out by 7.5mm
[2021-08-21T12:23:07] Artem Bulashev: 4.5mm is under side lip
[2021-08-21T12:23:40] Artem Bulashev: And remaining 7.5 will be used for surround lights / turn signal left and right / break signal rear half. So it will be functional (with addressable leds)
[2021-08-21T12:24:12] sombre_enfant: Should ve done like tudor
[2021-08-21T12:24:53] Artem Bulashev: 🙂 glad to have you back
[2021-08-21T12:25:13] Artem Bulashev: - phase wires leave deck asap to remove unnecessary EMI - rear wire is only 35cm long 😅
[2021-08-21T12:25:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: welcome back !
[2021-08-21T12:26:09] Unknown: Back to work fun and positivity...
[2021-08-21T12:26:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😁👍
[2021-08-21T12:26:32] Mirono escooters: I already ordered it
[2021-08-21T12:26:38] Mirono escooters: I got a free monorim kit tho so all good
[2021-08-21T12:26:40] sombre_enfant: U got vitiligo too ?
[2021-08-21T12:26:49] sombre_enfant: A nice
[2021-08-21T12:27:08] Mirono escooters: They shipped me 2 :)
[2021-08-21T12:27:10] Artem Bulashev: Post traumatic - it goes away, unlike usual one. But my month does have
[2021-08-21T12:27:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol. so do I. it must be related a escooters, too stressful 🤣
[2021-08-21T12:28:14] sombre_enfant: I ordered a shit ton of disc adapter and dualtron adapter, but not able to get screw🤡🤡
[2021-08-21T12:28:58] sombre_enfant: Damn, mine stay on my foot and hands only palm so kinda ok
[2021-08-21T12:29:14] Unknown: Do you mean this adapter set???
[2021-08-21T12:29:24] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂
[2021-08-21T12:29:48] Artem Bulashev: If we get 15 more people we are def re naming group 🤣🤣
[2021-08-21T12:30:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: looooooool
[2021-08-21T12:35:35] Mirono escooters: Yea. I got that and don't need it now. Lol
[2021-08-21T12:36:12] Mirono escooters: I got a 350w motor w drum brake (rental has dual brake) . No idea what to do with it
[2021-08-21T12:43:01] sombre_enfant: They trash asl... Might be ok on another frame with a common esc and delta
[2021-08-21T12:43:48] Tudor: Cool
[2021-08-21T12:43:50] Mirono escooters: Maybe on front inverted fork
[2021-08-21T12:43:52] Tudor: I will get one soon
[2021-08-21T12:44:00] Mirono escooters: Gen 1 too
[2021-08-21T12:48:02] sombre_enfant: They 5x not 6x, teardown it u will see difference about magnet, stator...
[2021-08-21T13:20:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Why direct solder ?
[2021-08-21T13:22:09] Artem Bulashev: Because I won’t need to remove it for long time and soldering gives best current transfer (no connector losses)
[2021-08-21T13:23:03] Face de Pin Sucé: If you use good connectors, you don't have losses ^^ Be sure about what you do then, don't forget anything
[2021-08-21T13:23:22] Mirono escooters: Aka don't be me lol
[2021-08-21T13:30:20] Artem Bulashev: Soldering is more compact than connectors that would not have losses
[2021-08-21T13:30:43] Artem Bulashev: I need all the space I can get. Specially with AS120 battery connector
[2021-08-21T13:47:00] Happy Giraffe: Thanks
[2021-08-21T14:21:18] Unknown: Haven't used this batt in a while, plugged it in and the voltage on cells increased rapidly, and is still increasing pretty fast, or maybe it's just cos it's 0.001 increments it looks faster to me as I'm not used this batt anymore.
[2021-08-21T14:21:55] Mirono escooters: Nah its just super low, at that v batteries don't store much charge so v raises rapidly. Not good to store it so low for long
[2021-08-21T14:22:11] Mirono escooters: 0.064 ah capacity lol
[2021-08-21T14:22:25] Unknown: If u remember it was disbalanced, I left it to auto balance and forgot about it 😬
[2021-08-21T14:22:26] Mirono escooters: And that's a big cell diff
[2021-08-21T14:22:34] Unknown: This is my old scoot batt
[2021-08-21T14:22:37] Mirono escooters: It drained itself while balancing
[2021-08-21T14:22:38] Unknown: The last one left
[2021-08-21T14:22:40] Unknown: Yeah
[2021-08-21T14:22:40] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2021-08-21T14:22:50] Unknown: Rip rip?
[2021-08-21T14:23:07] Unknown: <photos/photo_782@21-08-2021_14-21-18.jpg>
[2021-08-21T14:23:09] Unknown: We'll see.
[2021-08-21T14:23:20] Unknown: The Ah was incorrect I'm pretty sure anyway it's still at the same
[2021-08-21T14:23:33] Unknown: Oh nah it's at 0.2 now lol
[2021-08-21T14:23:42] Mirono escooters: Its low
[2021-08-21T14:23:47] Mirono escooters: Almost too low
[2021-08-21T14:23:54] Unknown: Will it survive is the question
[2021-08-21T14:24:02] Unknown: Expensive ass sanyo GA cells
[2021-08-21T14:24:02] Mirono escooters: I hope so
[2021-08-21T14:24:20] Unknown: It's slowed down now it's charging normally I think
[2021-08-21T14:24:31] Artem Bulashev: 2.6 is very empty 2.8 is empty, 3v time to charge 😁✌️
[2021-08-21T14:25:01] Mirono escooters: With so much v diff not normal charging imo lol
[2021-08-21T14:25:10] Unknown: It's literally
[2021-08-21T14:25:14] Unknown: Always had that of u remember
[2021-08-21T14:25:19] Unknown: I rebuilt it couple times too
[2021-08-21T14:25:22] Unknown: It's cells
[2021-08-21T14:25:26] Unknown: I thought it was BMS for ages
[2021-08-21T14:25:31] Unknown: But I'm pretty sure it's cells
[2021-08-21T14:25:47] Unknown: I'm never building a pack without testing all cells fully ever again
[2021-08-21T14:25:53] Artem Bulashev: There may be one cells in that parallel that doesn’t hold charge - other cells still hold but physics force other cells in parallel assembly to give it away to the cell that doesn’t hold. So May be you need to replace one cell in one parallel assembly
[2021-08-21T14:26:04] Unknown: Maybe
[2021-08-21T14:26:09] Unknown: Or maybe 3 or maybe 5
[2021-08-21T14:26:31] Unknown: I'm just reviving my scooter
[2021-08-21T14:26:38] Unknown: Been sitting away for way too long
[2021-08-21T14:26:39] Unknown: I miss it
[2021-08-21T14:27:00] Unknown: But I only have one batt since my external got stolen , hence why I gave up on scoot and focused on ebike
[2021-08-21T14:27:23] Mirono escooters: Stolen? F
[2021-08-21T14:27:33] Unknown: I know right
[2021-08-21T14:27:41] Unknown: My well built 12s4p
[2021-08-21T14:27:43] Unknown: I miss it
[2021-08-21T14:27:54] Mirono escooters: :(
[2021-08-21T14:27:56] Mirono escooters: Rip money
[2021-08-21T14:28:31] Unknown: It's okay money comes money goes
[2021-08-21T14:28:32] Unknown: Hehe
[2021-08-21T14:28:52] Unknown: I have a few Chinese batts
[2021-08-21T14:28:56] Unknown: Im gonna open then
[2021-08-21T14:29:03] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2021-08-21T14:29:04] Unknown: Build myself an internal
[2021-08-21T14:29:15] Unknown: <photos/photo_784@21-08-2021_14-29-15.jpg>
[2021-08-21T14:29:50] Unknown: Only thing
[2021-08-21T14:29:55] Unknown: Ik not sure if they're all the same cell
[2021-08-21T14:30:07] Unknown: I'll test capacity
[2021-08-21T14:30:10] Mirono escooters: U need to capacity test
[2021-08-21T14:30:11] Unknown: If they're all roughly same
[2021-08-21T14:30:13] Unknown: Is it doable
[2021-08-21T14:30:14] Unknown: Yeah
[2021-08-21T14:30:15] Unknown: I texted one
[2021-08-21T14:30:20] Unknown: It was like 2700 from memory
[2021-08-21T14:30:33] Mirono escooters: Repackr
[2021-08-21T14:30:47] Unknown: Okay so u can mix and match provided they have same capacity roughly
[2021-08-21T14:31:02] Unknown: I need to get a new computer,doing this stuff on mobile is pretty long
[2021-08-21T14:37:45] Unknown: I think it might be vesc time for this bad boy
[2021-08-21T14:37:48] Unknown: Error 10
[2021-08-21T14:37:54] Unknown: Only new display but hey
[2021-08-21T14:37:56] Unknown: Why not
[2021-08-21T14:40:12] Artem Bulashev: They also need to give about same under load, because one cell my give 3ah before it hits 3v other May give 1.5ah under 7a load for example
[2021-08-21T14:40:14] Unknown: <photos/photo_785@21-08-2021_14-40-14.jpg>
[2021-08-21T14:40:19] Unknown: Are u mad

[2021-08-21T14:40:49] Unknown: How can I test this?
[2021-08-21T14:41:07] Unknown: Ok so I'm not paying £40 for a display when I can pay £100 and get vesc 😂😂😂😂
[2021-08-21T14:41:11] Unknown: Looks like it's time to save
[2021-08-21T14:41:37] Artem Bulashev: There are special dischargers for that

[2021-08-21T14:48:38] Mirono escooters: 60€ vs 150
[2021-08-21T14:49:24] sombre_enfant: U need to buy a AS switch and some problem will happen and no foc on 10s+ with 4.2
[2021-08-21T14:49:40] Mirono escooters: Mine works perfectly. Foc too

[2021-08-21T14:50:40] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-08-21T14:52:10] Artem Bulashev: FlipSky = keeps service points busy 😜
[2021-08-21T14:56:37] Unknown: Who can repair my trampa
[2021-08-21T14:57:41] Happy Giraffe: Trampa can?👀
[2021-08-21T14:57:45] Unknown: <photos/photo_786@21-08-2021_14-57-45.jpg>
[2021-08-21T14:57:52] Unknown: Yeah ok fuck it
[2021-08-21T14:57:55] Unknown: Gonna send it to them
[2021-08-21T14:58:01] Unknown: Aee what they say
[2021-08-21T14:58:05] Unknown: Cos it broke randomly
[2021-08-21T14:58:05] Happy Giraffe: Or wait for others input
[2021-08-21T14:58:16] Unknown: And I opened it and then was testing with multimeter and poof
[2021-08-21T14:58:30] Happy Giraffe: Maybe part can be bought and local repair shop could do it. Who knows
[2021-08-21T14:58:38] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-21T14:58:39] Unknown: I'll send back first and see
[2021-08-21T14:59:38] Artem Bulashev: Just don’t say that 😅 and through a tiny solder ball inside pcb ;-)
[2021-08-21T15:00:21] Unknown: <photos/photo_787@21-08-2021_15-00-21.jpg>
[2021-08-21T15:00:43] Unknown: June, bit late send off xD
[2021-08-21T15:01:01] Unknown: But it's okay I dont mind paying them to fix to be fair as long as it's not extortionate
[2021-08-21T15:01:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: first test on single core/motor Spintend & boosted : 120A phase 80A bat ==> 55°C controller / 80°C motor. clearly, it's too much for this single 750W motor ;)
[2021-08-21T15:01:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: need to be confirmed with logs
[2021-08-21T15:02:18] Unknown: Controller seems like it performs well for 120A phase tho
[2021-08-21T15:02:21] Unknown: How long of a ride?
[2021-08-21T15:02:40] Unknown: Through what
[2021-08-21T15:02:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 7/8 minutes
[2021-08-21T15:02:47] Unknown: Oh not too long
[2021-08-21T15:02:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope !
[2021-08-21T15:02:57] Face de Pin Sucé: 80A battery is wayyy to much for that small motor 😂
[2021-08-21T15:03:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😊😊
[2021-08-21T15:03:13] Unknown: U mean add a little solder ball?
[2021-08-21T15:03:17] Unknown: Where should I 😂👁️👁️
[2021-08-21T15:03:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I counted to push the motor temperature to see if the VESC limit the current ... and it seems to do it.
[2021-08-21T15:04:14] Unknown: That's good. I am gonna get the single spinted for my scooter
[2021-08-21T15:04:23] Unknown: Hopefully I can pair with your screen 😏 how much is it?
[2021-08-21T15:04:58] Unknown: Unless I fix my trampa
[2021-08-21T15:05:23] Face de Pin Sucé: You can push your motor to 110°C
[2021-08-21T15:05:35] Unknown: I've heard 80 is near max
[2021-08-21T15:05:39] Unknown: Due to magnets
[2021-08-21T15:05:52] francois schempers: past 80 you loose magnet efficienty
[2021-08-21T15:06:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Depends of your magnets
[2021-08-21T15:07:05] Face de Pin Sucé: But I've pushed many motors at more than 80°C without deterioration 😁
[2021-08-21T15:11:15] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2021-08-21T15:13:14] Unknown: Guys use Statorade and motor temp is gone
[2021-08-21T15:13:32] Unknown: How messy is it to install
[2021-08-21T15:13:42] Unknown: Im scared of opening my ebike motor because I don't want to break the seal
[2021-08-21T15:13:42] Unknown: Not at all
[2021-08-21T15:13:51] Unknown: Reseal it
[2021-08-21T15:14:04] Unknown: But I do need it for my ebike as I power 120A phase and it gets hot on long rides
[2021-08-21T15:14:06] Unknown: Rlly hot
[2021-08-21T15:14:17] Unknown: Also because of 203mm disks heating up and everything sharing the heat
[2021-08-21T15:14:36] Mirono escooters: I got ebrake only now, no disk

[2021-08-21T15:18:30] Happy Giraffe: I tighten the screws to 99% but put some silicon in the joint outside😂
[2021-08-21T15:18:36] Mirono escooters: Weird how so small helps so much
[2021-08-21T15:19:41] Happy Giraffe: Thats what she said (sry couldnt resist)
[2021-08-21T15:19:43] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-21T15:20:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: around 200€
[2021-08-21T15:21:01] Unknown: For the screen?
[2021-08-21T15:21:12] Unknown: Whats the advantages of the smart controller that comes with
[2021-08-21T15:21:24] Unknown: That's a lot of money for a screen 🥺🥺🥺
[2021-08-21T15:21:29] Unknown: Display*
[2021-08-21T15:22:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: check the specs and settings page
[2021-08-21T15:22:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://github.com/Koxx3/SmartController_SmartDisplay_ESP32
[2021-08-21T15:25:47] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but it’s has drawbacks I remember researching it
[2021-08-21T15:27:24] Unknown: Riggghttt
[2021-08-21T15:27:25] Unknown: Okay
[2021-08-21T15:27:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: let's a bit more reasonable 🤪
[2021-08-21T15:27:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_789@21-08-2021_15-27-26.jpg>
[2021-08-21T15:27:33] Unknown: Some pretty cool features you don't see generally
[2021-08-21T15:27:42] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-08-21T15:27:43] Unknown: Just a shame it's so expensive to produce
[2021-08-21T15:27:52] Face de Pin Sucé: You could keep 100A phase
[2021-08-21T15:27:52] Artem Bulashev: Moment i calculate
[2021-08-21T15:28:00] Unknown: I like the step down to 5v availability, that's a nice touch
[2021-08-21T15:28:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. just the tft screen costs 22€ 😁
[2021-08-21T15:28:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok !
[2021-08-21T15:30:00] Artem Bulashev: 750w can take 75a phase and 75a battery. If you increase one you need to decrease other by equal %, so 75+ 50% = 112a phase 75 -50% = 38a battery
[2021-08-21T15:30:57] Artem Bulashev: Or 75 + 35% = 101a phase 75 - 35% 49a battery
[2021-08-21T15:31:27] Artem Bulashev: This is a formula I came up with
[2021-08-21T15:31:50] Face de Pin Sucé: What if it's not a 750W motor after all ?
[2021-08-21T15:32:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't see why i should decrase the battery. the battery can take 90A.
[2021-08-21T15:32:05] Artem Bulashev: Try both and see - motor temp should be about same, if not let me know, I’m trying to create quick and easy formula for beginners
[2021-08-21T15:32:13] Face de Pin Sucé: Most of factories don't know the wattage of their motors
[2021-08-21T15:32:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: completly true. those datasheete power are shit.
[2021-08-21T15:32:53] Artem Bulashev: Battery current limit effect how long max phase amps are applied to motor = motor heat
[2021-08-21T15:33:34] Face de Pin Sucé: I speak with a lot of chinese factories for our motors and they laugh a lot when people start speaking about wattage
[2021-08-21T15:33:37] Unknown: Well then pfft I'm on 50A battery on 2000w motor 120A phase and it gets hottttt
[2021-08-21T15:34:00] Artem Bulashev: Also battery amps don’t effect acceleration until you hit phase current * motor voltage at that speed rpm > than battery limit * battery voltage
[2021-08-21T15:34:47] Artem Bulashev: So battery voltage determines top end acceleration if it set low enough to limit phase current and determines top speed
[2021-08-21T15:34:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: that, i agree. but during the acceleration phase, i don't see the relationship for max bat current
[2021-08-21T15:35:23] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_790@21-08-2021_15-35-23.jpg>
[2021-08-21T15:35:23] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2021-08-21T15:35:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Those are not 2800W motors trust me
[2021-08-21T15:35:43] Face de Pin Sucé: It's barely 1200-1400W
[2021-08-21T15:35:44] Happy Giraffe: Bigger number=Better product
[2021-08-21T15:35:48] Artem Bulashev: Than your battery lim * battery voltage = more watt limit than motor voltage at rpm * max phase amps require
[2021-08-21T15:37:57] Happy Giraffe: Luckily our 1000w motors are heavy af, so better not be sand there👀😂
[2021-08-21T15:38:07] Artem Bulashev: Try this 75+ 60% = 120amps phase 75 -60% = 30 battery This should keep motor under good 60c if my estimation is correct in that simple formula, than increase from that 🤝 I will test that formula tomorrow on mine as well once I have it finished from all the modes of last night
[2021-08-21T15:38:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hummm. ok. i should donthe math, but i trust you on this 😁
[2021-08-21T15:38:36] Unknown: Can you help me decide?
[2021-08-21T15:38:48] Unknown: I have 2000w motor ebike one, 120A phase max 90A batt max...
[2021-08-21T15:38:52] Unknown: How do you determine?
[2021-08-21T15:39:04] Unknown: Please 😁
[2021-08-21T15:39:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Are you sure it's a 2000W ? 😏
[2021-08-21T15:39:54] Unknown: Well it better be xD
[2021-08-21T15:41:17] Artem Bulashev: Most reputable companies that produce scooters mark their scooter wheels rather close with in 15% +- (because nominal value doesn’t have industry standard guide line, but usually means the Amps at which wheel can work continuesely without over heating - but that temp is not industry standard, can be 60c can be 90c or more)
[2021-08-21T15:41:48] Unknown: Interesting
[2021-08-21T15:42:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Mmmh, ask Huameng, if they repond you, they'll tell you how they deal with wattage of motors 😂
[2021-08-21T15:43:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Or any other chinese factory of motors
[2021-08-21T15:43:46] Artem Bulashev: Lol what brand ? 😅😅 that means it is really over rated even if it was max 2000w (1000w nominal even should handle 120amps 50a)
[2021-08-21T15:44:12] Unknown: Oh it handles it
[2021-08-21T15:44:15] Unknown: Don't get me wrong
[2021-08-21T15:44:19] Unknown: It handles very well
[2021-08-21T15:44:27] Unknown: Plus we were in summer so temps were worse
[2021-08-21T15:44:37] Unknown: In talking about 40km rides
[2021-08-21T15:44:39] Unknown: Constant
[2021-08-21T15:44:47] Unknown: Top speed most the time
[2021-08-21T15:45:24] Unknown: It heats up but not to the point it's burning, that only happened 2-3 times in the summer on super hot days
[2021-08-21T15:45:37] Unknown: It heats up that I can feel it's HOT but i can hold my hand
[2021-08-21T15:46:07] Artem Bulashev: That’s about 1000w nominal motor performance :)
[2021-08-21T15:46:44] Unknown: @4000-5000w?
[2021-08-21T15:46:51] Unknown: Hm interesting....
[2021-08-21T15:47:05] Unknown: I'll do further testing so we can maybe figure it out if it's 1000 or rlly 2000 xD
[2021-08-21T15:47:18] Unknown: Cos on small rides like 5-10mi
[2021-08-21T15:47:24] Unknown: It's hardly warm to be fair
[2021-08-21T15:48:38] Artem Bulashev: It is not 2000w nominal for sure if it gets hot from that ;-) Vsett 10+ 1400w can take it and will be warmish but not hot
[2021-08-21T15:49:00] Unknown: For 40+km ride at a time?
[2021-08-21T15:49:05] Unknown: Like one long ride like that
[2021-08-21T15:49:13] Unknown: Ebike pushing 100kg total
[2021-08-21T15:49:19] Unknown: Hills and the rest
[2021-08-21T15:50:38] Unknown: Plus the brake disk as well dissipating loadss of heat ? Could that be a factor that adds a little
[2021-08-21T15:50:54] Unknown: My brake disks get HOT 😂😂😂😂😂
[2021-08-21T15:50:55] Artem Bulashev: Depending on your battery current limit
[2021-08-21T15:51:07] Unknown: 50A / 120A in my trampa
[2021-08-21T15:51:28] Unknown: 12s
[2021-08-21T15:51:31] Artem Bulashev: If it is low enough than on high top speed motor phase amps will be reduced and motor will actually be colder than on lower speed where phase amps are still max
[2021-08-21T15:51:47] Unknown: I'm probably mostly using max phase amps
[2021-08-21T15:51:53] Unknown: Because of traffic and I ride like a maniac
[2021-08-21T15:52:12] Artem Bulashev: Could be 😜😜
[2021-08-21T15:52:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-08-21T15:52:25] Unknown: Cos I can tell
[2021-08-21T15:52:29] Unknown: WHen the current is lowered
[2021-08-21T15:52:31] Unknown: At higher speeds
[2021-08-21T15:52:32] Face de Pin Sucé: I understand 😂
[2021-08-21T15:52:35] Unknown: I am one with the bike
[2021-08-21T15:52:43] Unknown: So I try to stick to a speed where torque is at highest
[2021-08-21T15:52:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: in cities, if you use mainly electric brake, it's clear it's much more demanding
[2021-08-21T15:52:52] Unknown: Because then I can overtake cars
[2021-08-21T15:52:52] Happy Giraffe: The second part is very true
[2021-08-21T15:53:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I'll make my second test in few minutes, I'll take some logs
[2021-08-21T15:54:03] Unknown: 😂😂😂
[2021-08-21T16:22:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/2021-08-21_16-02-57.csv>
[2021-08-21T16:24:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's cool to see the motor temperatue on the display 🤪
[2021-08-21T16:24:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the second one is mosfets
[2021-08-21T16:27:49] Happy Giraffe: Thats dope👍
[2021-08-21T16:31:39] Sébastien Michon: 👍🏻👍🏻
[2021-08-21T16:39:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2021-08-21_16-39-17.png>
[2021-08-21T16:39:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very interesting
[2021-08-21T16:39:38] Artem Bulashev: MOSFET 39? 😅 Spintend man 😂😂 some guys run 150a 110a phase and 180 battery and it doesn’t exceed 74c
[2021-08-21T16:40:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: look at the graph
[2021-08-21T16:41:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: in the second half, the duty is limited by motor temperature
[2021-08-21T16:43:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this part is interesting too ... how a hard electric brake give you 5 more degrees 🤣
[2021-08-21T17:07:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_792@21-08-2021_17-07-59.jpg>
[2021-08-21T17:08:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: (60A bat / 100A phase)
[2021-08-21T17:12:34] sombre_enfant: <voice_message>
[2021-08-21T17:26:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: zooom on first accel/brake
[2021-08-21T17:26:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_793@21-08-2021_17-26-48.jpg>
[2021-08-21T17:29:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: even 1h later, the motor indicate 52° ... 😅😅
[2021-08-21T17:30:01] Artem Bulashev: Try that
[2021-08-21T17:30:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it was very close to that : 100 / 60
[2021-08-21T17:30:41] Artem Bulashev: Isn’t motor temp about 70 here?
[2021-08-21T17:30:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-08-21T17:30:55] Artem Bulashev: 1h ride?
[2021-08-21T17:31:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope, 5 min
[2021-08-21T17:31:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 5 min before I start recording
[2021-08-21T17:31:57] Artem Bulashev: Ok 👌
[2021-08-21T17:32:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I recharge the battery and test again a 100/50, then 90/45, then 80/40
[2021-08-21T17:33:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think those motor have seals to be waterproof, it might not help 😅
[2021-08-21T17:34:12] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_794@21-08-2021_17-34-12.jpg>
[2021-08-21T17:34:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-08-21T17:35:11] Mirono escooters: Isn't phase vs batt too low/high?
[2021-08-21T17:35:16] Artem Bulashev: So with 60a battery 100a phase gets chopped at around 25kmh
[2021-08-21T17:35:19] Mirono escooters: I dont understand batt a and phase A (yet)
[2021-08-21T17:35:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ?? no, I was going 50 km/h (10S)
[2021-08-21T17:36:09] Mirono escooters: 10s?? 50kmh?? Wow
[2021-08-21T17:36:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yep 🤣🤣
[2021-08-21T17:36:34] Artem Bulashev: Look at what speed max phase was cut down by bat limit
[2021-08-21T17:36:36] Mirono escooters: Wich motor lmao
[2021-08-21T17:37:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahhhh ok !
[2021-08-21T17:37:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, around 25-30 km/h
[2021-08-21T17:37:23] Artem Bulashev: You motor must be very high KV
[2021-08-21T17:38:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: considering the speed for 10S, clearly, yes
[2021-08-21T17:39:30] Artem Bulashev: For me bat limit of 28a cuts 90a phase at same 25kmh (that’s half of your battery amp limit)
[2021-08-21T17:39:46] Artem Bulashev: Yeah cool too see in action in numbers
[2021-08-21T17:43:46] Mirono escooters: Got any torque? As that's high kv
[2021-08-21T17:44:08] Mirono escooters: Can we make vesc do phase amps on itself? That it automatically adjust?
[2021-08-21T17:46:00] sombre_enfant: U rewired it or lacing of the phase ? Its rare to get fast motor from factory
[2021-08-21T17:46:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I could see 2000W during acceleration
[2021-08-21T17:46:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. stock boosted rev motors
[2021-08-21T17:46:29] Mirono escooters: Uhu.. I got 1200w It hits 22kmh on 42v. Lol
[2021-08-21T17:46:41] sombre_enfant: Boosted ? U mean the brand who do skateboard ?
[2021-08-21T17:46:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-08-21T17:47:27] sombre_enfant: Ah, didnt kno they started to make scoot
[2021-08-21T17:47:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: they bankrupted 😅😅
[2021-08-21T17:47:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: because of their escooter 🙈🙈
[2021-08-21T17:49:33] sombre_enfant: Really😂 this company was at their peak when e sk8 became popular in 2018...
[2021-08-21T17:56:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: they had good products. It's a shame. the boosted rev is really an excellent commute device. but 12kms max at max speed, it's what trashed them. they completly understated the battery. a poor 12s3p if I remember.
[2021-08-21T18:00:51] Happy Giraffe: And it costed a kidney
[2021-08-21T18:01:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, that too 🤪🤪
[2021-08-21T18:03:56] Happy Giraffe: Imagine paying something 2500€ for 12s3p
[2021-08-21T18:05:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes... but nothing compare : 20kg, dualmotor, waterproof, low deck, easy to fold, big wide tires (9x3).
[2021-08-21T18:07:26] sombre_enfant: On 16s with good Discharge u might get a lot of speed...
[2021-08-21T18:07:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I'll prepare a 14S battery (6P with Samsung 30Q)
[2021-08-21T18:08:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_796@21-08-2021_18-08-47.jpg>
[2021-08-21T18:08:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: deck can't fit more
[2021-08-21T18:09:25] sombre_enfant: Cells from ?
[2021-08-21T18:09:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nkon
[2021-08-21T18:09:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: all tested
[2021-08-21T18:10:42] sombre_enfant: Used one ? How u deal to solder them again ?
[2021-08-21T18:11:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the blue one, yes. I used them in a esk8 battery pack (10 cycles max). I rewrapped them.
[2021-08-21T18:12:19] sombre_enfant: Sometime the solder tab get pierce from second solder..
[2021-08-21T18:12:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I have some left if it happen.
[2021-08-21T18:13:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I guess bottom ? or top too ?
[2021-08-21T18:14:21] Artem Bulashev: Look basic equation with 2 sides Battery limit amp * battery voltage at any moment = watts avaible Motor phase amps lim * by voltage on motor wheel that grows up as you speed up (relation of kV and rpm you travel at)= watts on the wheel
[2021-08-21T18:16:33] Artem Bulashev: Job of controller is to make sure your output demand doesn’t exceed available watts on input. Controller can’t controll battery voltage, can’t control motor voltage, can’t control battery lim, it can only control phase amps So as motor voltage increase, at one point controller has to reduce phase amps to maintain input watts to be equal or more than output motor watts 👌
[2021-08-21T18:17:22] Mirono escooters: Soo.. I max phase out? 🤭😁
[2021-08-21T18:17:24] Artem Bulashev: If battery amps limit is high enough than this will never happen and full phase current will be available on the motor at any speed it can spin
[2021-08-21T18:17:37] Artem Bulashev: Yes if you motor can take
[2021-08-21T18:17:44] Mirono escooters: 1200w so I think zo
[2021-08-21T18:17:48] Mirono escooters: And mosfets to keep cool
[2021-08-21T18:18:05] Artem Bulashev: If it is good 1200w and not like example above of 2000w 👀
[2021-08-21T18:18:07] Mirono escooters: Does anyone overheat vesc?
[2021-08-21T18:18:21] Mirono escooters: It was decent, many tested it on a lot of w and doesn't get warm
[2021-08-21T18:18:28] Artem Bulashev: Depends which one, Ubox, rarely any one
[2021-08-21T18:18:34] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 4.2 lol
[2021-08-21T18:18:57] Mirono escooters: 50a was fine
[2021-08-21T18:19:18] sombre_enfant: The positive most time
[2021-08-21T18:20:11] Artem Bulashev: Best of luck with it 😜 no idea but usually people don’t have much time with it to experiment 🤷‍♂️
[2021-08-21T18:22:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh ! ok !
[2021-08-21T18:23:22] sombre_enfant: Its because voltage go trough the drv... On 4xx and 6xx...
[2021-08-21T18:24:02] Happy Giraffe: My single motor will kick its ass😎
[2021-08-21T18:24:32] sombre_enfant: Dont forget its a xiaomi 🤡
[2021-08-21T18:24:55] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi is da boss
[2021-08-21T18:25:30] Artem Bulashev: Вот еще куча, ждет своего часа)
[2021-08-21T18:27:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: surely, but for a stock escooter, it's not bad ;)
[2021-08-21T18:27:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳
[2021-08-21T18:27:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🙈
[2021-08-21T18:29:36] Happy Giraffe: Yep haha
[2021-08-21T18:29:51] Happy Giraffe: I wonder what would fully pimped vsett look like
[2021-08-21T18:38:12] francois schempers: higher battery Amps means you stay longer on phase Amps (mode heat on the fets)
[2021-08-21T18:38:28] francois schempers: Here is what happens if you only change battery current limit: Battery consumption won’t change up till same rpm(speed) because phase current is the limit. Fast = full phase amp acceleration will continue up till higher rpm. Max power will be higher because - example, at previous max speed 60kmh voltage was 45v and phase current was limited by battery limit obviously. So by increasing battery limit we now have more room for phase amps at those same 45v (60kmh) meaning we can get to higher max speed
[2021-08-21T18:38:39] francois schempers: <photos/photo_476@30-06-2021_22-32-48.jpg>
[2021-08-21T18:46:31] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-08-21T18:47:28] Artem Bulashev: Thanks forgot about this one
[2021-08-21T18:47:31] Happy Giraffe: For me easiest way to understand was to imagine the motor not needing/using all voltage on lower speeds so it can transform spare voltage into current
[2021-08-21T18:56:18] Artem Bulashev: Motor doesn’t transform anything - it’s a question of output can not be more than input, so controller can lower phase current to balance output power to input power available
[2021-08-21T18:57:56] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I mean esc of course transforms it. But simplified as possible
[2021-08-21T18:58:14] Happy Giraffe: 2000w in 2000w out 50v 40A, and 20v 100A
[2021-08-21T18:58:32] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-08-21T18:59:00] Artem Bulashev: As speed increases (RPM) motor will now have 40v so phase current will have to become 50a
[2021-08-21T18:59:23] Happy Giraffe: Less voltage leftovers from battery to convert
[2021-08-21T18:59:31] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-08-21T18:59:38] Artem Bulashev: Nothing to do with left over
[2021-08-21T18:59:43] Artem Bulashev: It’s not a stake :)
[2021-08-21T18:59:47] Happy Giraffe: I imagine it that way😂
[2021-08-21T19:00:02] Happy Giraffe: My poor brain only thinks about food
[2021-08-21T19:00:21] Artem Bulashev: It’s more like you can’t eat more than on the table
[2021-08-21T19:00:28] Artem Bulashev: But as you eat faster
[2021-08-21T19:00:33] Artem Bulashev: They bring more plates
[2021-08-21T19:00:41] Artem Bulashev: And you take less food from each plate
[2021-08-21T19:00:47] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2021-08-21T19:01:01] Artem Bulashev: 😂✅
[2021-08-21T19:11:03] Happy Giraffe: Or one other would be to think it as a torque converter. Same power (Wattage) all the time but it can be transformed into high rpm lower torque or slow rpm high torque
[2021-08-21T19:15:49] Artem Bulashev: You are over thinking it
[2021-08-21T19:15:50] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-08-21T19:16:29] Artem Bulashev: It is simple equation Voltage of motor * phase amps = battery voltage * battery amp lim
[2021-08-21T19:16:46] Artem Bulashev: Left side can’t be larger than right side
[2021-08-21T19:17:07] Artem Bulashev: Only one value can be controlled by controller
[2021-08-21T19:17:10] Artem Bulashev: Done
[2021-08-21T19:17:43] Artem Bulashev: Torque converter also not very accurate 🥺
[2021-08-21T19:18:47] Happy Giraffe: Haha, yes
[2021-08-21T19:33:26] francois schempers: 2 technically if you considère phase Amps and bat limit
[2021-08-21T19:34:53] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-21T19:40:04] Artem Bulashev: Bat lit you can set - controller can’t alter it
[2021-08-21T19:41:04] Artem Bulashev: Contrôler can only change phase amps to balance equation sides
[2021-08-22T14:13:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: starting battery pack assembly 😅😅
[2021-08-22T14:13:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_800@22-08-2021_14-13-37.jpg>
[2021-08-22T14:13:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: followed repackr proposal
[2021-08-22T14:14:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: now, esk8-freedom super tutorial for assembly...
[2021-08-22T14:14:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_801@22-08-2021_14-14-19.jpg>
[2021-08-22T14:14:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: first, glue & ring stickers
[2021-08-22T14:20:59] Artem Bulashev: I always debated - better have equal capacity between series (so each parallel assembly total should have same mah) Or better have each cell inside parallel assembly to be equal, so that no one cell discharges too quickly, but than one series may become lower voltage than other during ride
[2021-08-22T14:28:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: RepackR works to equalize P packs capacity and try to keep good RI
[2021-08-22T14:28:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_802@22-08-2021_14-28-08.jpg>
[2021-08-22T14:28:47] Artem Bulashev: agree
[2021-08-22T14:28:50] Artem Bulashev: Good point
[2021-08-22T14:29:44] Artem Bulashev: Equal total resistance in each P will provide equal discharge across all series
[2021-08-22T14:30:02] Artem Bulashev: Thus needing equal ah in each as well
[2021-08-22T14:30:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: cell rings
[2021-08-22T14:30:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: done
[2021-08-22T14:30:41] Artem Bulashev: I guess it will be up to high mah cells to deliver current inside each pack
[2021-08-22T14:30:52] Artem Bulashev: 🤙
[2021-08-22T14:31:09] Artem Bulashev: What cells are those?
[2021-08-22T14:32:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very tight space in the deck. like esk8 packs : glued packed
[2021-08-22T14:33:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i follow this super tutorial :
[2021-08-22T14:33:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://youtu.be/7QjO90LG67g
[2021-08-22T19:01:46] sombre_enfant: How do field weakening perform on spinted esc ? Same as focrunner ?
[2021-08-22T19:09:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: never tried. have you seen the option ??
[2021-08-22T19:16:28] sombre_enfant: I dont even have both im just asking
[2021-08-22T19:17:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_804@22-08-2021_19-17-12.jpg>
[2021-08-22T19:17:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not finished ... I am out of fish paper 😭😭😭 can it be found on Amazon ? didn't find it
[2021-08-22T19:59:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: does any body where to find fish paper on Amazon (europe) ?
[2021-08-22T19:59:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: even nkon doesn't have rolls 😢
[2021-08-22T20:01:46] Mirono escooters: I can donate you
[2021-08-22T20:04:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: serioulsy ?! it would be awesome. but I need 3m, do you enought ?
[2021-08-22T20:04:39] Mirono escooters: I will check this evening
[2021-08-22T20:04:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍❤️
[2021-08-22T21:06:41] Artem Bulashev: I should get tomorrow a lot
[2021-08-22T21:09:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😊😊
[2021-08-22T21:12:34] Mirono escooters: I have 2 meters left
[2021-08-22T21:40:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 26.5cm for each p group x 6 groups left, it will leave me some in case i fail, it's perfect !
[2021-08-22T21:41:45] Happy Giraffe: Are you building a nuclear power station with that?
[2021-08-22T21:47:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol. no, just a 14s6p
[2021-08-22T21:47:41] Mirono escooters: Close enough
[2021-08-22T21:51:35] Artem Bulashev: You don’t need 2 layers of it between series!
[2021-08-22T21:51:37] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-08-22T21:51:56] Artem Bulashev: Normally used one sheet between series
[2021-08-22T21:53:18] Artem Bulashev: If space allows that’s ok I guess but sheet is 0.1mm so 10 series is extra 2m instead of 1mm
[2021-08-22T21:53:38] Artem Bulashev: Looking good so far :-)
[2021-08-22T21:56:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it won't have that shape 😉
[2021-08-22T21:56:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'll use glass fiber between layers
[2021-08-22T22:04:07] Artem Bulashev: 👀😅 as long as you have space for it 🤷‍♂️
[2021-08-22T22:05:22] Unknown: Fish paper shortage.. German shops have some but expensive
[2021-08-22T22:05:47] Mirono escooters: Well he gets what I had left :)
[2021-08-22T22:05:48] Unknown: Why that??
[2021-08-22T22:06:14] Unknown: What's next..., Air shortage??
[2021-08-22T22:07:52] Unknown: @koxx3 did you use hot glue??
[2021-08-22T22:15:04] Tudor: Barley paper 🛴💨💨
[2021-08-22T22:15:44] Artem Bulashev: He did
[2021-08-22T22:23:49] Unknown: I don't like fish paper or another tape, my next packs will have wood fiber jacket
[2021-08-22T22:24:13] Unknown: Tape makes recycling difficult
[2021-08-22T22:24:54] Unknown: A 0.8 mm kraftplex jacket will do the job
[2021-08-22T22:31:10] Tudor: If you don't like it doesn't mean its not good. Everyone has its own style of doing things. And everybody uses what makes his work easier and safer. True we share experiences and learn from that and we can combine to get better products. Another true thing is that there is completion and not always we share all we got. Also some competitors use others to build their business by slandering and putting down their reputation etc etc. 🛴💨💨😃😃
[2021-08-22T22:32:46] Unknown: It wasn't a critic to you @Tudor_VTA it was to how we do things just for tradition
[2021-08-22T22:33:12] Tudor: I didnt take it as a critic
[2021-08-22T22:33:17] Tudor: Was just an opinion
[2021-08-22T22:33:36] Tudor: Don't worry i ain't getting offended that easy
[2021-08-22T22:34:08] Unknown: I think we have to innovate test work more environmental friendly and building thinking of repair and recycling...
[2021-08-22T22:34:17] Mirono escooters: Agree
[2021-08-22T22:35:06] Unknown: Why we use fish paper??
[2021-08-22T22:35:14] Tudor: True and we do our part more or less but we are just a small dot on the map in regards to pollution etc. We are insignificant
[2021-08-22T22:35:31] Unknown: Everybody counts
[2021-08-22T22:36:08] Artem Bulashev: Link?
[2021-08-22T22:36:40] sombre_enfant: I only use the ring one for positive tab...
[2021-08-22T22:36:43] Unknown: https://www.kraftplex.com/
[2021-08-22T22:36:45] Artem Bulashev: As side wall you mean?
[2021-08-22T22:36:56] Artem Bulashev: Or isolation between series
[2021-08-22T22:37:01] Tudor: True . I give you an example that i recycle everything i can. Cooking oil, car oil, paper everything . I never thrown a candy paper on the street
[2021-08-22T22:37:07] Unknown: A jacket side walls and everything
[2021-08-22T22:37:07] Artem Bulashev: Yes only on positive should be
[2021-08-22T22:37:37] sombre_enfant: Between series i put nothing... I glue the cell together with my layout...
[2021-08-22T22:37:38] Unknown: And for rigity use the 3mm
[2021-08-22T22:37:55] Unknown: I do normaly my cages with it
[2021-08-22T22:38:10] Unknown: With 3 mm and glue it with wood glue
[2021-08-22T22:38:25] Artem Bulashev: That’s no bueno mate
[2021-08-22T22:38:33] Unknown: 100 % recycling
[2021-08-22T22:38:44] Mirono escooters: Oof no good
[2021-08-22T22:38:57] sombre_enfant: Even factory do battery that way so...
[2021-08-22T22:39:08] Unknown: Nooo
[2021-08-22T22:39:18] sombre_enfant: I use holder too...
[2021-08-22T22:39:28] Mirono escooters: Ok holder good
[2021-08-22T22:39:37] Mirono escooters: Honeycomb so good
[2021-08-22T22:40:05] sombre_enfant: Depend in wath case...
[2021-08-22T22:40:09] Artem Bulashev: Cans outer shell is negative, between series they have voltage difference and if two cans of different series break the thin and fragile isolation heat shrink than there will be a short circuite of entier p pack
[2021-08-22T22:40:57] Unknown: That's why i don't like gluing
[2021-08-22T22:41:20] Artem Bulashev: With holder sure
[2021-08-22T22:41:49] Artem Bulashev: Never ever factory made batteries will be produced without series isolation if holders are not used
[2021-08-22T22:41:50] sombre_enfant: Yeah i kno theres a potential of short but puting fish paper fish every where is a waste of space... If i want to waste spase i use holder
[2021-08-22T22:42:10] Artem Bulashev: Not every where
[2021-08-22T22:42:21] Artem Bulashev: You don’t need it between parallel cells
[2021-08-22T22:42:26] Artem Bulashev: Only between series
[2021-08-22T22:42:35] sombre_enfant: Seen many pack without mantis bat especially
[2021-08-22T22:42:58] Artem Bulashev: It is not waist of space, it is safety of you and loved once.
[2021-08-22T22:43:17] Artem Bulashev: Kaboo is such shit company it’s unbelievable
[2021-08-22T22:43:34] Artem Bulashev: Stems were braking for like 3 years before they admitted it
[2021-08-22T22:43:59] Artem Bulashev: Btw
[2021-08-22T22:44:39] sombre_enfant: I will need to do 20s7p soon, but if i had fish paper theresnoway it fit...
[2021-08-22T22:45:00] Artem Bulashev: Dual motor set up 👌 super short phase wires. As clean as it can be 😜 and motor wires leave compartment immediately 🤙
[2021-08-22T22:45:32] Mirono escooters: It's not so thick
[2021-08-22T22:46:06] sombre_enfant: Well in a g30 retail frame with two esc its different..
[2021-08-22T22:46:28] sombre_enfant: I have a stock of mh1 and mj1...
[2021-08-22T22:59:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: few millimeters 😅
[2021-08-22T23:00:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: complicated, some bent nickels groups, i want to be sure i won't short with another layer
[2021-08-22T23:00:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. just for a first alignement
[2021-08-22T23:04:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: to be clear, i don't have mucj capabilities in battery assemnly. so, i follow tutorials from people who have done a lot of batteries... that's it 😅😅 remember, it's my first one 🤪
[2021-08-22T23:39:59] Happy Giraffe: T H I C C boi
[2021-08-22T23:40:12] Mirono escooters: I want it
[2021-08-22T23:40:24] Happy Giraffe: Imagine 2p outperforming 6p😂
[2021-08-22T23:41:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lot of lost space with such form..hope it worth it 😅
[2021-08-22T23:42:23] Happy Giraffe: 15s of these will be a meter long batt lol
[2021-08-22T23:42:59] Mirono escooters: Still wondering if a cube cell isn't better. Prob hard to make or smth?
[2021-08-22T23:43:14] Happy Giraffe: Cube should be solid then
[2021-08-22T23:43:34] Happy Giraffe: Ten more years😂
[2021-08-22T23:47:54] Unknown: Prismatic, and round is easier to manufacture automated..
[2021-08-22T23:48:31] Unknown: Big pouche batteries...
[2021-08-22T23:48:40] Mirono escooters: Prismatic isn't widely used anymore
[2021-08-22T23:49:09] Unknown: Yeah but some cars use versions of it ..
[2021-08-22T23:49:28] Mirono escooters: Yea. Ebikes too, but i only see older ones. No new ones
[2021-08-22T23:52:38] Unknown: I will try these ...https://m.de.aliexpress.com/item/32967823335.html
[2021-08-22T23:53:13] Mirono escooters: Mjeh. Liitokalq uses grade b cells. Dont manufacture themselves
[2021-08-22T23:53:40] Mirono escooters: I got 26650 from them Realistically 12a (promised 20) there was already 4.2-3.6v sag on 12a
[2021-08-22T23:53:45] Unknown: <photos/photo_808@22-08-2021_23-53-45.jpg>
[2021-08-22T23:54:14] Unknown: The chemistry is interesting...
[2021-08-22T23:54:48] Mirono escooters: Lifepo4 ? Yes
[2021-08-22T23:55:11] Mirono escooters: Super safe. Just less energy dense then li ion. And super expensive for now. Mostly used in powerwalls
[2021-08-22T23:55:24] Mirono escooters: Don't wanna burn house down / loads of space
[2021-08-22T23:56:54] Happy Giraffe: Thats worse than 35E 18650 lol
[2021-08-22T23:57:43] Mirono escooters: I know
[2021-08-22T23:58:03] Mirono escooters: I needed 26650 for a failed project; so I had 30 laying around anyway
[2021-08-22T23:58:18] Mirono escooters: And liitokala only ones at decent price as 26650 is almost never used. Just for flashlights
[2021-08-22T23:58:30] Mirono escooters: Anyway got a 15s2p with them now. Good enough 🤷‍♂️
[2021-08-23T00:02:31] Unknown: Much safer, longer lifespan and now almost the same price then lithium ion cells...
[2021-08-23T00:02:45] Mirono escooters: From liitokala 😅
[2021-08-23T00:03:00] Mirono escooters: Mine were unbalanced voltages and capacity was around 120mah off.. had to repackr em
[2021-08-23T00:03:26] Unknown: Let's try them out I read and see good things about it..
[2021-08-23T00:03:34] Happy Giraffe: Li-ion keeps you humble and feet on the ground
[2021-08-23T00:03:46] Mirono escooters: Well for price cant do wrong
[2021-08-23T00:03:57] Mirono escooters: Prepare to wait 2 months tho, its with postnl per boat 🙈
[2021-08-23T00:04:16] Unknown: I know just for fun. .
[2021-08-23T00:04:34] Mirono escooters: Cant do wrong with that
[2021-08-23T00:04:43] Mirono escooters: How much A?
[2021-08-23T00:04:55] Unknown: Or for the camper of my neighbor
[2021-08-23T00:04:58] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow starts wiring for vesc...
[2021-08-23T00:05:08] Mirono escooters: Have fun!
[2021-08-23T00:05:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeahhhh ! 👍👍
[2021-08-23T00:05:45] Unknown: 35A per cell i don't know I'll wait until I have it in hands....
[2021-08-23T00:06:14] Mirono escooters: I'd test that in a discharger 🙈
[2021-08-23T00:06:23] Unknown: What frame are you using???
[2021-08-23T00:07:44] Unknown: We have big fucking Keramik resistors i will show you in the next days connected
[2021-08-23T00:08:01] Mirono escooters: That works too🤓🥰
[2021-08-23T00:08:09] Mirono escooters: I'm interested in seeing that
[2021-08-23T00:08:27] Unknown: And an icharger from a friend

[2021-08-23T00:09:07] Mirono escooters: I just builded my own discharger up to 400w (for now) will put everything in a bitcoin miner case to g0 1000w and 3 tubes. Overkill. But to test batteries so handy. I discharge every battery to test capacity and see that there is no fault in cell capacity or bms 🤷‍♂️

[2021-08-23T00:16:26] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2021-08-23T00:23:14] Happy Giraffe: Nucular 6F 200$, only 50$ more than single vesc🤔
[2021-08-23T00:23:26] Happy Giraffe: Anybody used Nuculars?
[2021-08-23T00:24:55] Happy Giraffe: Thermo Nucular 24F has 7AWG phase cables for 500A lol
[2021-08-23T00:25:04] Happy Giraffe: Costs 600$🌚
[2021-08-23T08:49:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it seems likes VESC, bit they never says 'vesc' on their pages. are those vescs ?
[2021-08-23T09:38:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Nucular is not VESC
[2021-08-23T09:38:54] Face de Pin Sucé: And good luck for trying Nucular
[2021-08-23T09:39:15] Face de Pin Sucé: They constantly delay more and more the shipping
[2021-08-23T09:39:25] Mirono escooters: *cries*
[2021-08-23T09:39:27] Face de Pin Sucé: A friend ordered a year and half ago
[2021-08-23T09:39:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Price increased twice and they delayed it 4 times
[2021-08-23T09:40:07] Face de Pin Sucé: He finally cancelled his order
[2021-08-23T10:05:26] Happy Giraffe: Price increased after he ordered wtf?😂
[2021-08-23T10:08:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳🤪
[2021-08-23T10:27:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, it's crazy
[2021-08-23T10:27:37] Happy Giraffe: Amateur company 🙈
[2021-08-23T10:29:43] sombre_enfant: Wich vesc got field weakening ?
[2021-08-23T10:30:12] Mirono escooters: Is field weakening worth it? :)
[2021-08-23T10:30:12] Mirono escooters: (Don't kill me, just trying to learn)
[2021-08-23T10:31:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: as i understood, you'll increase speed by few km/h but with a MASSIVE current drain.
[2021-08-23T10:31:43] Mirono escooters: Well yea thats what I read too, I dont kno if its worth it
[2021-08-23T10:32:10] Face de Pin Sucé: Axiom 😂
[2021-08-23T10:32:29] Face de Pin Sucé: It's ALWAYS worth it if you can win some kmh 😂
[2021-08-23T10:32:52] sombre_enfant: I seen grin phase runner but 400€ per motor🙃
[2021-08-23T10:33:06] Face de Pin Sucé: By meaning few, it depends of the power but you can increase to 20 or 40Kmh (seen on big ebikes)
[2021-08-23T10:33:52] Mirono escooters: Really? That's a lot
[2021-08-23T10:34:01] Mirono escooters: Good for low kv motors 😇
[2021-08-23T10:34:28] sombre_enfant: I dont know if it worth right now or later to buy vesc or other esc since stock already got foc on 72v...
[2021-08-23T10:34:45] sombre_enfant: U loose torque....
[2021-08-23T10:35:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but it enabled only after reaching a fixed speed on controllers i tried.
[2021-08-23T10:36:02] Face de Pin Sucé: https://youtu.be/mDdR6e-Z3kU
[2021-08-23T10:36:14] Mirono escooters: But at low speeds no field weakening? And at higher speeds turned on?
[2021-08-23T10:36:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes you can enable it at a certain speed so you don't loose torque
[2021-08-23T10:36:19] sombre_enfant: I just seen it 2min ago😂
[2021-08-23T10:36:29] Mirono escooters: Ye my thought
[2021-08-23T10:36:41] sombre_enfant: Kinda like star delta switch...
[2021-08-23T10:37:28] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2021-08-23T10:37:31] Mirono escooters: Technology
[2021-08-23T10:39:05] Mirono escooters: Small loss in acceleration is nothing compared to gained speed
[2021-08-23T10:45:42] Happy Giraffe: Nobody of you want to ride scooter 60kmh+ anyways on daily basis
[2021-08-23T10:45:58] Face de Pin Sucé: I actually do 😂
[2021-08-23T10:46:05] Unknown: I would
[2021-08-23T10:46:17] Unknown: My 65kmh bike feels slow ;(
[2021-08-23T10:46:23] Happy Giraffe: 10" tires 60kmh baby
[2021-08-23T10:46:33] Happy Giraffe: Insanity
[2021-08-23T10:46:35] Face de Pin Sucé: I ride 118Kmh scooter on daily basis 😂
[2021-08-23T10:46:40] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-23T10:46:41] Unknown: That's tasty
[2021-08-23T10:46:43] Mirono escooters: I find 45-50kmh more then enough😇 I rather have low kv high torque
[2021-08-23T10:46:48] Mirono escooters: This 1200w is crazy. I go vroom
[2021-08-23T10:46:59] Unknown: Or have both XD
[2021-08-23T10:47:01] Happy Giraffe: This ..

[2021-08-23T10:49:45] Unknown: Hm
[2021-08-23T10:49:59] Unknown: I can't afford to buy cells at the moment
[2021-08-23T10:50:10] Face de Pin Sucé: If you go for 2 batteries in series, you need the same capacity, so ho for same cells as your main battery
[2021-08-23T10:50:12] Unknown: Car is coming in to weeks
[2021-08-23T10:50:17] Mirono escooters: I recycled eve 26v for my 12s5p Imo not worth it. A lot of v sag and big batt for low capacity

[2021-08-23T10:52:01] Unknown: Hm
[2021-08-23T10:52:02] Mirono escooters: I can put in A
[2021-08-23T10:52:02] Mirono escooters: 3a and it went from 4.1v to 3.5
[2021-08-23T10:52:03] Mirono escooters: Haha cell voltage go brrr
[2021-08-23T10:52:11] Unknown: Jesus
[2021-08-23T10:52:17] Unknown: Wtf lol
[2021-08-23T10:52:27] Mirono escooters: Aovo is shit
[2021-08-23T10:52:27] Unknown: Okay so they definitely won't handle shit
[2021-08-23T10:52:32] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2021-08-23T10:52:52] Unknown: What could I do with all those cells I wonder
[2021-08-23T10:53:01] Mirono escooters: Powerbanls and sell? 😇

[2021-08-23T10:53:32] Mirono escooters: Got 2000mah cells lmao
[2021-08-23T10:53:32] Mirono escooters: A lot
[2021-08-23T10:53:42] Unknown: The cells I tested were like 2700mah
[2021-08-23T10:53:42] Mirono escooters: 3a and they sag. Sooo big pack
[2021-08-23T10:53:45] Unknown: Well one of them was
[2021-08-23T10:53:55] Mirono escooters: I will build a powerwzll later tho
[2021-08-23T10:54:01] Unknown: I need to get a discharger where I can see sag
[2021-08-23T10:54:07] Unknown: Yeah one day when I got my house I'll do that
[2021-08-23T10:54:11] Unknown: Been dreaming about it for agws
[2021-08-23T10:54:34] Unknown: Hm so all these cells I have are uselessssss
[2021-08-23T10:55:11] Mirono escooters: Build urself with some resistors
[2021-08-23T10:55:14] Mirono escooters: I got 2000 cells ready, now I need time to assemble 😇
[2021-08-23T10:55:43] Unknown: I have like 24 35E to hand... Hm
[2021-08-23T10:56:10] Unknown: Maybe I can build a 4s6p

[2021-08-23T10:57:34] Unknown: Make 16s5p total
[2021-08-23T11:06:20] Unknown: What app?
[2021-08-23T11:07:05] sombre_enfant: Waze
[2021-08-23T11:07:20] Unknown: I'm doing a solar charger thing...
[2021-08-23T11:07:44] Unknown: So scooters will be be solar powered😁😁😁😁
[2021-08-23T11:15:14] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2021-08-23T11:38:04] Artem Bulashev: 2 18650 will be same mah count and aaalot smaller + also higher voltage (every 9s of those = 8s li ion)
[2021-08-23T11:38:40] Happy Giraffe: Welcome to Jihad club with me and Rumi
[2021-08-23T11:39:16] Mirono escooters: How is backpack battery? Any voltage sag? How heavy ? And wich setup😳😀
[2021-08-23T11:39:25] Happy Giraffe: 4mm gold plated bullets, theres no way current motor cables can do 100A
[2021-08-23T11:39:52] Happy Giraffe: I got my 13s7p there atm, no sag with 13s13p😂
[2021-08-23T11:40:24] Mirono escooters: That's big
[2021-08-23T11:40:25] Mirono escooters: Wich cells?
[2021-08-23T11:40:33] Happy Giraffe: Stock...
[2021-08-23T11:40:37] Happy Giraffe: 35E
[2021-08-23T11:40:43] Mirono escooters: I got 8mm, so good😳🥰 same as spotwelder used
[2021-08-23T11:40:49] Mirono escooters: Fuck them
[2021-08-23T11:40:55] Happy Giraffe: Single vesc 4mm bullet...
[2021-08-23T11:40:58] Mirono escooters: Wow. That has cost a lot😳
[2021-08-23T11:41:19] Happy Giraffe: Bought when prices were good
[2021-08-23T11:41:26] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2021-08-23T11:41:37] Mirono escooters: I'm cheap boy, will just use recycled from long ago
[2021-08-23T11:44:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i use 4mm too for phases. 100/120A, no issue. most vesc comes with 4mm and can handle such current. remember, it's a kind of 'alternative' current/voltage for phases, and it's a strong current only for few seconds (or climbing hill)
[2021-08-23T11:44:42] sombre_enfant: Hxt4mm
[2021-08-23T11:44:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: looks like minimotors connectors 😅😅
[2021-08-23T11:45:04] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, the gold plated ones are rated for 80A. These stock must be like 40 lol
[2021-08-23T11:45:08] Mirono escooters: A spotwelder is 800A easy😳 I problably went overkill
[2021-08-23T11:45:08] Mirono escooters: I direct soldered mine anyway. I'm a fan of that
[2021-08-23T11:45:39] sombre_enfant: 800a but at 1v so its not the same
[2021-08-23T11:45:53] Happy Giraffe: Here it goes again lol
[2021-08-23T11:46:14] sombre_enfant: Its all about watt guy stop playin
[2021-08-23T11:46:23] Happy Giraffe: 🙈
[2021-08-23T11:48:23] Mirono escooters: 12v but mkay
[2021-08-23T11:48:58] sombre_enfant: Ye idk what hour welder is...
[2021-08-23T11:49:08] Mirono escooters: Home made 😇
[2021-08-23T11:49:15] Happy Giraffe: Im not an electric engineer but resistance makes the heat, hence resistor😂
[2021-08-23T11:49:17] sombre_enfant: Microwave ?
[2021-08-23T11:49:25] Mirono escooters: No
[2021-08-23T11:49:29] Mirono escooters: A lott of mosfets
[2021-08-23T11:49:31] Mirono escooters: :)
[2021-08-23T11:49:38] Mirono escooters: And 2 big ass 120c 5200mah lopos
[2021-08-23T11:49:56] Mirono escooters: A is heat maker V isn't Hence y power cables are thousands of v
[2021-08-23T11:50:03] Mirono escooters: Otherwise huge losses
[2021-08-23T11:50:04] Happy Giraffe: Lipo👀 boom
[2021-08-23T11:50:11] sombre_enfant: It also does but volt without enough amps do nothing same for amps without enough volt
[2021-08-23T11:50:30] Mirono escooters: My house wiring didn't like microwave transformer
[2021-08-23T11:51:03] Mirono escooters: My workroom is a old thing in garden; electric cabling is from long ago. It cznt supply the power needed
[2021-08-23T11:51:14] Mirono escooters: Meh as long as u don't abuse it It has scary power though
[2021-08-23T11:51:31] Mirono escooters: 2 lipos parallel 5ms is enough for 0.15mm pure nickel🥰
[2021-08-23T11:51:33] Happy Giraffe: Yes current and resistance play together. V=I*R👀
[2021-08-23T11:52:01] Mirono escooters: I love this group; such interesting talks
[2021-08-23T11:52:39] Happy Giraffe: One guy in Denis group used 5 lipos in xiaomi
[2021-08-23T11:53:11] Mirono escooters: I'm no fan of lipo in the scooter It's way more dangerous, for only little advantage Also €€
[2021-08-23T11:53:52] Artem Bulashev: 4mm are kit all same. It also depends on the length of the connector. Xt60 are 4mm as well I think and they get super hot with 120amps phase current 👀 It also depends on battery current limit - as we said before, it will determine how long full 120amps phase amps will be running to the motor = connector heat up
[2021-08-23T11:54:20] Mirono escooters: Xt90 gang?
[2021-08-23T11:54:35] Happy Giraffe: And imagine having the shitty stock motor wires I posted 😂
[2021-08-23T11:54:48] Artem Bulashev: AS120 on battery
[2021-08-23T11:55:09] Artem Bulashev: Direct solder on phase, because MT60 - rated nominal 30a dc
[2021-08-23T11:55:57] Mirono escooters: There's a connector with 3 pins like xt60, I forgot name
[2021-08-23T11:56:00] Mirono escooters: Mr or smth
[2021-08-23T11:58:02] sombre_enfant: Mr60
[2021-08-23T11:58:22] sombre_enfant: Same as other amas 60 series...
[2021-08-23T11:59:08] Mirono escooters: Thank you
[2021-08-23T11:59:20] Mirono escooters: Still i direct solder Shit when needing to change brake caliper lol
[2021-08-23T12:00:04] Artem Bulashev: That’s the one I’m talking about xT60 2 pins MT60 3 pins
[2021-08-23T12:00:49] Happy Giraffe: Or change brake rotor
[2021-08-23T12:01:13] Happy Giraffe: You need to get motor wires unplugged
[2021-08-23T12:01:23] Artem Bulashev: 60a on that connector and it will be hoott
[2021-08-23T12:01:49] Happy Giraffe: These I will change definitely
[2021-08-23T12:02:13] Happy Giraffe: The wire is also so thin Im afraid to go above 80A
[2021-08-23T12:02:20] Artem Bulashev: Not if your motor wires are on the other side from disk
[2021-08-23T12:02:39] Happy Giraffe: I wish they were...😂
[2021-08-23T12:02:39] Artem Bulashev: Measure dia of the conductor and tell me length
[2021-08-23T12:02:59] Happy Giraffe: Its 4mm bullet
[2021-08-23T12:03:25] Happy Giraffe: Fits right into single vesc
[2021-08-23T12:04:17] Artem Bulashev: Not of the connector
[2021-08-23T12:04:21] Artem Bulashev: Of the conductor
[2021-08-23T12:04:44] Happy Giraffe: 2mm
[2021-08-23T12:04:46] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-23T12:05:26] Happy Giraffe: GG, 2mm on 1000w motor
[2021-08-23T12:06:03] Artem Bulashev: 2mm is what Vsett uses on 500-650w, but my rear is only 35cm long. It takes 90a phase now problem (without connector to reduce over all resistance)
[2021-08-23T12:06:26] Artem Bulashev: 😧
[2021-08-23T12:06:48] Happy Giraffe: Seems it will be ok if I solder the proper 4mm gold plated bullet to it
[2021-08-23T12:06:54] Artem Bulashev: My motor is 650 nominal - 1100w max
[2021-08-23T12:07:05] Happy Giraffe: Yes...
[2021-08-23T12:07:48] sombre_enfant: Or you can change your motor phase wire but it not a real 1000w if it got 36mm magnet
[2021-08-23T12:08:19] Happy Giraffe: This 1000w motor is same what Francois S. has and it weights a lot...but yeah fake watts might be
[2021-08-23T12:09:00] sombre_enfant: Its more like 400-600w...but decent for the price...
[2021-08-23T12:10:44] Artem Bulashev: Holly shit
[2021-08-23T12:10:56] Artem Bulashev: I just found there is BUILt in alarm !!!
[2021-08-23T12:11:05] Artem Bulashev: In spintend Ubox!!!
[2021-08-23T12:11:09] Happy Giraffe: ?👀👀👀👀👀
[2021-08-23T12:11:10] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-08-23T12:11:44] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-23T12:11:57] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2021-08-23T12:12:02] Artem Bulashev: If I power on scooter without my remote controller being avaible for connection, than alarm / HORN will sound!!
[2021-08-23T12:12:28] Artem Bulashev: I think it damaged my eardrums
[2021-08-23T12:13:11] Happy Giraffe: But will scooter move?
[2021-08-23T12:13:25] Happy Giraffe: Some guy on meth wont hear the sound😂
[2021-08-23T12:29:16] Artem Bulashev: Yeah of course - @koxx3 will have some kind of alarm, so hand brake can be applied to both wheels if use is unauthorised 👌+ alarm. This thing is so loud it’s insane, and I will add one more up front, just to be sure 🤣
[2021-08-23T12:29:20] Mirono escooters: That is so good!!!
[2021-08-23T12:31:18] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_817@23-08-2021_12-31-18.jpg>
[2021-08-23T12:31:22] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-08-23T12:31:54] Artem Bulashev: This is dual motor 90a / 13a 90a / 17a Because stock vsett9 13ah 52v battery only
[2021-08-23T12:32:54] Artem Bulashev: 50kmh on 17a battery
[2021-08-23T12:33:12] Artem Bulashev: Can’t wait to get it to be dual 30a battery limits 😂😂
[2021-08-23T12:33:54] Artem Bulashev: That remote is golden for quick start on project
[2021-08-23T12:39:25] sombre_enfant: What cheap smart bms are good and can work from 20s to 17s or 16s?
[2021-08-23T12:50:13] Artem Bulashev: Moment moment
[2021-08-23T12:51:18] Artem Bulashev: € 8,84 17％ Off | Active Balance Battery Protection Board Bluetooth BMS 12S 13S 14S 15S 16S 20S 24S RS485 GPS APP Lifepo4 li-ion LTO JK 48V 60V https://a.aliexpress.com/_Aa47EA
[2021-08-23T12:51:31] Artem Bulashev: There is 17s version smaller, which I got for my 16s
[2021-08-23T12:51:51] Artem Bulashev: And there is 20s version abit bigger for higher currents
[2021-08-23T12:52:42] Artem Bulashev: That’s one of the smallest 17s smart BMS I found (bt is built in) and it has 2 temp sensors and even 4g/gps add on for remote access
[2021-08-23T12:59:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it a shame none of those features can be controled through uart/can 😓
[2021-08-23T13:01:28] Artem Bulashev: They can
[2021-08-23T13:01:28] Artem Bulashev: It has both uart and can. GPS/sim module is connected on one of those and you can remotely controll and set BMS via 4g (so it is jot read only, but write as well)
[2021-08-23T13:02:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i talked about spintend alarm/horn/lights
[2021-08-23T13:02:06] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2021-08-23T13:02:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😉
[2021-08-23T13:03:35] Artem Bulashev: Well 2.4ghz TX is small ;-) sure it would not be too hard to catch and replicate messages if you had ubox and contorller in hands (after all 2.4rx inside ubox is connected to uart, that you can monitor)
[2021-08-23T13:04:25] Artem Bulashev: But yeay physical adc / digital controlled inputs would be nice.
[2021-08-23T13:04:43] Artem Bulashev: Actually wait
[2021-08-23T13:04:56] Artem Bulashev: If 2.4ghz uart can controll those outputs
[2021-08-23T13:05:23] Artem Bulashev: This means you should be able to target them as well
[2021-08-23T13:06:24] sombre_enfant: Gps and uart are already in the package when u buy it ? 2A balance ?
[2021-08-23T13:06:42] Artem Bulashev: 20s has up to 2a balancing yes
[2021-08-23T13:06:56] Artem Bulashev: 17s has less 600ma I think
[2021-08-23T13:07:06] sombre_enfant: What uart does ?
[2021-08-23T13:07:31] Artem Bulashev: It’s communication type
[2021-08-23T13:08:28] Artem Bulashev: In theory ubox / vesc support BMS on can line or uart, but implementing it will require some tinkering
[2021-08-23T13:09:10] sombre_enfant: Gps module built in bms need a sim or ?
[2021-08-23T13:24:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vesc supports very few bms 'protocols' 😓
[2021-08-23T13:25:09] Mirono escooters: ;(
[2021-08-23T13:25:18] Mirono escooters: 2a balance shouldn't be needed if pack is good
[2021-08-23T13:31:53] Happy Giraffe: Rip, such a great screen
[2021-08-23T13:33:58] Mirono escooters: It's simple but quite decent
[2021-08-23T13:34:30] Artem Bulashev: GPS/sim is a seperate module extra to the BMS
[2021-08-23T13:35:28] Artem Bulashev: But I love the idea of hiding it inside battery facing up - vsett has plastic footplate so no metal to cover gps antenna, and no one will find tracker inside battery 🤪
[2021-08-23T13:36:07] Artem Bulashev: It’s up to. Configurable
[2021-08-23T13:36:17] Mirono escooters: Fair enough
[2021-08-23T13:36:17] Artem Bulashev: It is meant for huge batteries
[2021-08-23T13:37:15] Artem Bulashev: Normal BMS (passive usually do 70ma -100ma only when balancing 😅)
[2021-08-23T13:38:32] Mirono escooters: Good enough for me
[2021-08-23T13:39:18] Artem Bulashev: I will receive that one very soon it is already in Austria :-)
[2021-08-23T13:39:27] Artem Bulashev: So will test it all out
[2021-08-23T13:39:43] Mirono escooters: Is it worth it :?
[2021-08-23T13:40:25] Artem Bulashev: At this price I didn’t find any BMS smaller and better, or even just smaller smart BMS of any shit show china brand
[2021-08-23T13:42:14] Mirono escooters: Daly was just perfect for me. And their display is superior. Ant bms has this weird tiny one (ok) but xiaoxiang.. oh boy. Shit lcd
[2021-08-23T13:42:59] sombre_enfant: Lcd clearly useless in a scoot when u can manage it with your phone...
[2021-08-23T13:43:42] Artem Bulashev: Size wise DalySmart BMS they don’t fit my build in the same 16s same A discharge capability - larger surface than this 17s BMS, and price is basically same I think
[2021-08-23T13:46:07] Mirono escooters: I like daly bms display, it's just a test😇 dont wanna take out phone to check %, and it looks cool
[2021-08-23T13:46:38] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 4.2 vesc I bought for 58 Now 100€ Wow
[2021-08-23T13:47:22] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-08-23T13:47:37] Mirono escooters: No point now; rather get that better one from that site
[2021-08-23T13:47:48] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_820@23-08-2021_13-47-48.jpg>
[2021-08-23T13:48:04] Mirono escooters: Its "only" rated 50a batt current, but 120A pulsed (no idea how long) I'm gonna take the F and go 70A battery current
[2021-08-23T13:48:05] Artem Bulashev: 77€
[2021-08-23T13:48:56] Artem Bulashev: That one I sent 70€
[2021-08-23T13:49:16] Mirono escooters: Decent
[2021-08-23T13:49:39] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_821@23-08-2021_13-49-39.jpg>
[2021-08-23T13:50:25] Artem Bulashev: 78x115x17.6
[2021-08-23T13:52:40] Artem Bulashev: They gave me this link
[2021-08-23T13:52:45] Artem Bulashev: For documentation
[2021-08-23T13:52:48] Artem Bulashev: download in this link : http://qr17.cn/BApbC0 Bluetooth connection password 1234 Parameter setting password 123456 JK BMS manual or protocols download in this link : http://mysharegadget.com/562551673
[2021-08-23T13:58:35] Artem Bulashev: Btw in VescTool - set motor poles to actual number of magnets, not magnets pairs! 🤷‍♂️😂 why wheel for example 30 magnets. In the uni1 remote it requires motor pole pairs - 15 pairs. Than you will have correct speed and range measurements Wheel dia to set that check radius from hub center to the grand when you stand on scooter. My 8.5inch wheels (215mm) in reallity are 208mm, but once I step on it they are 200mm exactly (100mm from floor to the hub center) - I will set it to 204mm because once you start riding centrifugal forces and heat will expend dia abit
[2021-08-23T14:03:52] Mirono escooters: Idk how many magnets I got. Is it important ?
[2021-08-23T14:04:00] sombre_enfant: Ofc
[2021-08-23T14:04:11] Mirono escooters: Fak. For?
[2021-08-23T14:04:15] Artem Bulashev: Yes for correct speed and mileage calculation
[2021-08-23T14:04:23] Mirono escooters: @Tudor_VTA u know how many magnets 1200w has?
[2021-08-23T14:04:32] Mirono escooters: Meh I use gps anyways :)
[2021-08-23T14:04:35] Artem Bulashev: Because it calculates it based on rpm, which is counted by passing magnets
[2021-08-23T14:04:51] Artem Bulashev: GPS is no good for measuring acceleration.
[2021-08-23T14:04:56] Artem Bulashev: Too slow and inaccurate
[2021-08-23T14:05:02] Mirono escooters: I only use it for speed
[2021-08-23T14:05:05] Mirono escooters: Accel didn't do yet
[2021-08-23T14:05:12] Artem Bulashev: Vesc though 100% accurate ✅
[2021-08-23T14:05:14] Mirono escooters: I just kno it's quick lol
[2021-08-23T14:05:20] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2021-08-23T14:13:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Waze
[2021-08-23T14:15:01] Unknown: <video_file>
[2021-08-23T14:15:13] Luis Magalhaes: You order but don't pay at the order 😅
[2021-08-23T14:16:13] Luis Magalhaes: Nucular are good controllers have a friend that has the 6f on his scooter home made and it runs very well and in a ebike he had 24f was a beast 😂
[2021-08-23T14:16:47] Face de Pin Sucé: He paied at the order
[2021-08-23T14:17:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes it's a beast but impossible to have :/
[2021-08-23T14:19:19] Luis Magalhaes: ? You don't have to pay, is just like picking your turn ticket 😂 but its a long time waiting thats really true, they say its because of the casing but before that it was like 1year waiting 😅
[2021-08-23T14:20:04] Luis Magalhaes: Yes out of question, too long waiting 😅
[2021-08-23T14:54:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-08-23T15:39:03] Artem Bulashev: Problem that in 1.5 years it will be outdated alrwady 😂
[2021-08-23T15:39:47] Artem Bulashev: Specially when ubox covers two 6f with 25% discount and no wait and 99% of functions 😂
[2021-08-23T15:40:10] Luis Magalhaes: 😂 they are selling those controllers for a few years now and not outdated
[2021-08-23T15:40:37] Luis Magalhaes: Yes but the build quality they aclaim its better
[2021-08-23T15:41:24] Luis Magalhaes: It works very good in the ebike i talked and you can see them in some surron too but not cheap
[2021-08-23T15:42:12] Artem Bulashev: 🤷‍♂️ I don’t see Any advantage
[2021-08-23T15:44:10] Happy Giraffe: If seller cant make it ready in 1.5 year beta I would never trust their RMA service or anything else about them
[2021-08-23T15:44:41] Happy Giraffe: Soon bois...soon...
[2021-08-23T15:46:33] Luis Magalhaes: Runs cooler then mine 😂😂
[2021-08-23T15:47:03] Luis Magalhaes: Im thinking of putting halls on mine
[2021-08-23T15:47:25] Luis Magalhaes: To see if get a faster start
[2021-08-23T15:47:49] Artem Bulashev: You will 👌
[2021-08-23T15:48:12] Artem Bulashev: Same settings as ubox but 6f stays cooler ?
[2021-08-23T15:48:35] Artem Bulashev: That’s probably because ubox has fets with like 6mOh resistance vs top once are like 1.5mOh
[2021-08-23T15:48:51] Artem Bulashev: I’m surprised how ubox stays so cold under crazy amps
[2021-08-23T15:49:13] Happy Giraffe: Thats the power of properly using thermal pad😂😂😂
[2021-08-23T15:49:33] Artem Bulashev: Some one runs it at 180a phase and 130a battery on rear and 150amps phase on front and 90a battery
[2021-08-23T15:49:36] Happy Giraffe: vs xiaomi kapton shit
[2021-08-23T15:50:04] Happy Giraffe: 310A👀
[2021-08-23T15:50:04] Artem Bulashev: Without extra cooling. It over heats but still doesn’t burn, protection works well.
[2021-08-23T15:50:08] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-08-23T15:50:14] Happy Giraffe: What the hell😂
[2021-08-23T15:50:16] Artem Bulashev: It’s insane
[2021-08-23T15:50:53] Happy Giraffe: That guy could put radiator outside scooter frame also lol, some 60kmh wind catching it would be ton of cooling
[2021-08-23T15:51:02] Artem Bulashev: If they were to swap fets for low resistance once it would probably not even over heat
[2021-08-23T15:51:24] Mirono escooters: Don't they already use low resistance ones?
[2021-08-23T15:51:33] Artem Bulashev: Not Tommy knowledge
[2021-08-23T15:51:36] Artem Bulashev: It is not needed
[2021-08-23T15:51:37] Mirono escooters: My idea with watercooling
[2021-08-23T15:51:39] Artem Bulashev: As you can see
[2021-08-23T15:51:43] Mirono escooters: Cmon it would look cool
[2021-08-23T15:52:03] Artem Bulashev: Would look cool but best of luck over heating it even without it haha
[2021-08-23T15:52:08] Artem Bulashev: I run mine today
[2021-08-23T15:52:18] Artem Bulashev: 90amp phase both wheels
[2021-08-23T15:52:24] Mirono escooters: That's high, any advantages or just cost
[2021-08-23T15:52:25] Luis Magalhaes: He had 3 modes on single motor dont remeber specs 😂
[2021-08-23T15:52:25] Artem Bulashev: Fets temp 39c
[2021-08-23T15:52:39] Happy Giraffe: Thats impressive
[2021-08-23T15:53:17] Artem Bulashev: Front wheel slips haha even at 15kmh
[2021-08-23T15:53:30] Artem Bulashev: Will use 80a on front phase
[2021-08-23T15:53:40] Mirono escooters: Front wheel🤷‍♂️ rwd is superior
[2021-08-23T15:53:50] Artem Bulashev: I have AWD now
[2021-08-23T15:53:56] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-08-23T15:54:08] Happy Giraffe: I will use front😂👀
[2021-08-23T15:54:09] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2021-08-23T15:54:20] Mirono escooters: I had 3" front Xuancheng back Front slipped. Back didnt
[2021-08-23T15:54:27] Mirono escooters: Why?🙈
[2021-08-23T15:54:42] Happy Giraffe: Back gives more grip yeah
[2021-08-23T15:55:04] Happy Giraffe: Wont fit on rear properly
[2021-08-23T15:55:07] Mirono escooters: Way more
[2021-08-23T15:55:40] Happy Giraffe: And I like the feel of motor pulling instead of pushing, weird to explain
[2021-08-23T15:56:05] DNP: I know exactly what you mean, me too
[2021-08-23T15:56:22] Mirono escooters: I like pushing more 🙈 personal preferences
[2021-08-23T15:56:40] Happy Giraffe: But you have much more grip tho
[2021-08-23T15:57:17] Happy Giraffe: I should be fine with 2.5" cst and heavy scooter+rider tho
[2021-08-23T15:57:52] Mirono escooters: Fair enough
[2021-08-23T15:57:57] Mirono escooters: Rear more grip
[2021-08-23T16:06:18] sombre_enfant: Anyone familiar with hxt 4mm ? I cant push the thing
[2021-08-23T16:23:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope 😅
[2021-08-23T17:25:52] Artem Bulashev: Not at all😝 it’s cool when you accelerate out of the turn :)
[2021-08-23T17:26:08] Artem Bulashev: AWD is best 😝
[2021-08-23T17:30:17] Mirono escooters: Fair enough. But expensive and complicated
[2021-08-23T17:30:22] Mirono escooters: I do wheelies on my g30 now🥰
[2021-08-23T17:30:30] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_824@23-08-2021_17-30-30.jpg>
[2021-08-23T17:30:38] Mirono escooters: Now 24h curing time baby
[2021-08-23T17:38:52] sombre_enfant: U dont make any effort cuh😂 remove the qr code and put the cover plate of controller back
[2021-08-23T17:39:16] Mirono escooters: I'm slowly building up
[2021-08-23T17:39:22] Artem Bulashev: That’s because it is no longer g30 🤣
[2021-08-23T17:39:22] Mirono escooters: I'll be making my own qr code
[2021-08-23T17:39:36] Artem Bulashev: What for?
[2021-08-23T17:39:44] Mirono escooters: Well If I need to be inside for cables or so gotta break silicon.. rip
[2021-08-23T17:39:57] Mirono escooters: Fun? Just linking to mirono escooters 🤓
[2021-08-23T17:40:12] Artem Bulashev: I see haha
[2021-08-23T17:40:20] Artem Bulashev: Screen gives you away lol
[2021-08-23T17:40:24] Artem Bulashev: Plasma
[2021-08-23T17:40:39] Artem Bulashev: iMax of scooter world 😉
[2021-08-23T17:40:58] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_825@23-08-2021_17-40-58.jpg>
[2021-08-23T17:41:03] Mirono escooters: I wanna do smth with original esc place. Ionno what. Custom speaker? Powerbank? Idk
[2021-08-23T17:41:10] Artem Bulashev: How do you like that throttle vs something like zero trigger style
[2021-08-23T17:41:13] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_826@23-08-2021_17-41-13.jpg>
[2021-08-23T17:41:43] Mirono escooters: It's fun.. but it has many death points Beginning 15% or so nothing Last 20% nothing too
[2021-08-23T17:42:00] Mirono escooters: But its something else. Idk if I will keep it. Difficult at low speeds to keep finger in same position long
[2021-08-23T17:43:57] Artem Bulashev: Damm.
[2021-08-23T17:44:15] Mirono escooters: China throttle what did I expect
[2021-08-23T17:44:19] Artem Bulashev: Yeah, I agree. Cruise is needed
[2021-08-23T17:44:46] Artem Bulashev: I really understand why vsett went with trigger throttle
[2021-08-23T17:45:02] Mirono escooters: Meh. I hate cruise Throttle is just too long and the "swing" also, defo w those dead pointz
[2021-08-23T17:45:06] Artem Bulashev: After trying few others I actually miss it … it seems to work the best
[2021-08-23T17:45:27] Artem Bulashev: Dead points defeat the purpose of it
[2021-08-23T17:45:32] Mirono escooters: It's good, but not the best. I will maybe later change. First wanna try it
[2021-08-23T17:45:52] Mirono escooters: I almost do wheelies now 55/120a
[2021-08-23T17:45:57] Mirono escooters: If I don't lean forward
[2021-08-23T17:46:05] Artem Bulashev: I used remote as thumb throttle on rion.
[2021-08-23T17:46:07] Artem Bulashev: It’s nice
[2021-08-23T17:46:17] Mirono escooters: Wow🙈
[2021-08-23T17:46:20] Artem Bulashev: But on bumps throttle input also bumps up and down
[2021-08-23T17:46:40] Mirono escooters: Yea. Mine helps w that
[2021-08-23T17:46:43] Artem Bulashev: Not good and doesn’t happen with trigger style like zero/miniMotor/vsett
[2021-08-23T17:46:48] Mirono escooters: My finger gets used to it tho
[2021-08-23T17:46:56] Mirono escooters: Any picture of trigger style
[2021-08-23T17:47:22] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_827@23-08-2021_17-47-22.jpg>
[2021-08-23T17:47:28] Artem Bulashev: Trigger
[2021-08-23T17:47:29] Mirono escooters: Aaaaa
[2021-08-23T17:47:38] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2021-08-23T17:47:42] Mirono escooters: I will try that on my gt100 different scoot and see if I like it
[2021-08-23T17:47:47] Mirono escooters: It seems promising
[2021-08-23T17:48:55] Artem Bulashev: Response had no dead zone on vsett, but controller throttle was abit jumpy at low speeds - I think that’s actually controller specific and not Throttle issue, thus with vesc will be awesome
[2021-08-23T17:49:17] Mirono escooters: Throttle is made for display, so I expect it to be good 🤓
[2021-08-23T17:49:31] Mirono escooters: I will build that scoot tomorrow when axle arrives. O boy I got too many projects
[2021-08-23T17:50:32] Artem Bulashev: Rfid also seems to be like an indépendant subsystem inside display, that interrupts throttle pass through to the controller adc and overlays display with lock sign! So it should work even with vesc!
[2021-08-23T17:51:14] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 👀 peu peu
[2021-08-23T17:51:23] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2021-08-23T19:38:41] Tudor: Nop. Didnt open it
[2021-08-24T08:03:33] Mirono escooters: New Xisodash App with crazzy options. This is a 13 S Xiaomi m365 pro. YOU CAN HIRE THE POWER OF THE 350 w Motor
[2021-08-24T08:03:33] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_828@24-08-2021_08-03-33.jpg>
[2021-08-24T08:03:39] Mirono escooters: Field weakening??😳
[2021-08-24T10:06:30] Mirono escooters: Also, how we do field weakening on vesc?
[2021-08-24T10:21:08] sombre_enfant: U cant 🤡
[2021-08-24T10:21:21] Mirono escooters: Fuk. Isn't there a beta?
[2021-08-24T10:21:50] sombre_enfant: Foc on 4xx is already buggy and tend to blow drv imagine field weakening....
[2021-08-24T10:21:57] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2021-08-24T10:22:07] Mirono escooters: My foc works perfectly. Weird
[2021-08-24T10:23:06] sombre_enfant: If his flasher really work it will outperform some 4xx 6xx vesc and grin phaserunner controller
[2021-08-24T10:23:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://vesc-project.com/node/2859
[2021-08-24T10:23:49] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2021-08-24T10:23:53] Mirono escooters: I hope so
[2021-08-24T10:24:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_829@24-08-2021_10-24-01.jpg>
[2021-08-24T10:24:02] Mirono escooters: So cool how much we push these xiaomi controllers
[2021-08-24T10:24:25] Mirono escooters: Is updating vesc hard? 😆🙈
[2021-08-24T10:24:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: interesting ! my motor 'scream' a little at low speed / high torque.
[2021-08-24T10:24:47] Mirono escooters: I haven't heard anything (yet) maybe depends on motor
[2021-08-24T10:24:56] Mirono escooters: Someone tried constant delta with vesc?
[2021-08-24T10:26:25] Unknown: We are on it...
[2021-08-24T10:26:42] Mirono escooters: I dont wanna use delta switch But always delta..🤷‍♂️
[2021-08-24T10:26:58] Mirono escooters: Still I don't wanna lose my torque. Maybe on another scoot
[2021-08-24T10:27:35] sombre_enfant: It works on bldc and vesc
[2021-08-24T10:27:37] Unknown: You don't lose Torque, if, then you're doing something wrong...
[2021-08-24T10:27:48] Mirono escooters: Rlly?
[2021-08-24T10:27:56] sombre_enfant: U loose without switching
[2021-08-24T10:27:57] Mirono escooters: Wasn't it 170% more speed but less torque?
[2021-08-24T10:28:23] sombre_enfant: Theres no way to mess a rewire or your motor just dont turn...
[2021-08-24T10:28:36] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_830@24-08-2021_10-28-36.jpg>
[2021-08-24T10:29:08] Mirono escooters: I rather have torque over speed. So don't wanna lose torque
[2021-08-24T10:29:50] Unknown: I will show you a video, more torque then a Tesla...i have to produce it...
[2021-08-24T10:30:41] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2021-08-24T10:34:53] Artem Bulashev: Yes torque is not lost but it requires a lot more amps if I remember correctly
[2021-08-24T10:35:54] Mirono escooters: I'm already at 55A :)
[2021-08-24T10:36:01] Mirono escooters: Not a lot of v drop tho
[2021-08-24T10:36:06] Mirono escooters: Imma go up. Let vesc sweat
[2021-08-24T12:35:39] Artem Bulashev: 55a battery amps for single motor ?
[2021-08-24T12:36:58] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-08-24T12:37:00] Mirono escooters: 1200w rear
[2021-08-24T12:37:10] Mirono escooters: do wheelies if I dont lean forward
[2021-08-24T12:43:40] Artem Bulashev: Battery amps don’t effect you acceleration 0-20kmh :-) you can put battery 30amps and your acceleration 0-20kmh will remain without change 🤝
[2021-08-24T12:44:14] Artem Bulashev: 55a is nice though because you getting that same amount of torque even if you floor it at 30kmh 😄
[2021-08-24T12:45:32] Mirono escooters: Yess :) phase amps at 120 lol
[2021-08-24T12:45:33] Mirono escooters: I like it
[2021-08-24T12:45:34] Artem Bulashev: My point was that increasing it above 55a will likely not change Anything - check logs. 120a phase usually don’t pull more than 55a battery at any point.
[2021-08-24T12:45:47] Mirono escooters: Oki guess I go higher phase?
[2021-08-24T12:45:59] Mirono escooters: As long as mos don't overheat
[2021-08-24T12:46:02] Artem Bulashev: One guy had 11 motor oriented for torque and it pulled 68a battery max
[2021-08-24T12:46:09] Artem Bulashev: Sure
[2021-08-24T12:46:17] Artem Bulashev: Ubox should manage 130a
[2021-08-24T12:46:21] Mirono escooters: 4.2 esc. Let it sweat If it dies it dies
[2021-08-24T12:46:27] Mirono escooters: 🙈
[2021-08-24T12:46:28] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2021-08-24T12:46:30] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-08-24T12:46:44] Artem Bulashev: That one doesn’t work well in foc I think
[2021-08-24T12:46:53] Mirono escooters: It does
[2021-08-24T12:47:02] Mirono escooters: Idk why everyone says it. It works super fir me
[2021-08-24T12:47:03] Artem Bulashev: Sorry 4.12 didn’t
[2021-08-24T12:47:08] Mirono escooters: 4.2 does
[2021-08-24T12:47:12] Artem Bulashev: Good
[2021-08-24T12:47:17] Mirono escooters: I bought for 58€ Now 102€ F
[2021-08-24T12:47:46] Mirono escooters: 50a continuous 150a pulse Idk if batt amps or phase
[2021-08-24T12:47:51] Artem Bulashev: Isn’t it a dual version ?
[2021-08-24T12:47:58] Mirono escooters: I got single
[2021-08-24T12:48:09] Mirono escooters: Dual 120€ lol. Rather get that even when songle
[2021-08-24T12:48:19] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_831@24-08-2021_12-48-19.jpg>
[2021-08-24T12:48:39] Artem Bulashev: This one?
[2021-08-24T12:48:54] Artem Bulashev: I hear it works long time only on up to 10s
[2021-08-24T12:48:57] Mirono escooters: Yea. Banggood cheaper now
[2021-08-24T12:49:07] Mirono escooters: The makers recommend 13s max. 60v chip.
[2021-08-24T12:49:11] Artem Bulashev: 11s okey 12s dies fast
[2021-08-24T12:49:22] Mirono escooters: 13s😳
[2021-08-24T12:58:16] Mirono escooters: Kay me dumb. Foc vs bldc. What's the best?
[2021-08-24T12:58:24] Mirono escooters: Can't find anything good online . only debate
[2021-08-24T12:58:37] Artem Bulashev: 5min
[2021-08-24T12:59:58] Mirono escooters: Foc quieter Bldc abit faster That it?😆
[2021-08-24T13:02:59] Artem Bulashev: So foc - sine wave, bldc is square wave Foc: is more efficient on low and mid duty cycle. Smoother throttle response. Quite motor. Colder motor because same less current is needed to archive same result - it is applied at the right place and the right timing. Bldc More efficient at max duty cycle, faster top speed. Less controllable start. A lot more noise from motor. Motor heats up more.
[2021-08-24T13:03:20] Mirono escooters: What you recommend?
[2021-08-24T13:03:39] Artem Bulashev: Foc
[2021-08-24T13:05:24] Mirono escooters: Ok! Thanks!! So interesting stuff
[2021-08-24T13:35:28] Tudor: This ones for 13 s are best. They work well and plenty of torque
[2021-08-24T13:36:06] Tudor: I run dual motor with these and no problem qt 13 s
[2021-08-24T13:38:18] Mirono escooters: Yes I got them for 13s :) super good
[2021-08-24T13:38:31] Mirono escooters: @Tudor_VTA how much power do u push through?
[2021-08-24T13:40:30] Tudor: If i remember well 3kw for each mot peak 500w motors
[2021-08-24T13:40:38] Tudor: Somewhere there
[2021-08-24T13:41:12] Tudor: Dont have any built anymore i sold the 13 s batteries and i am doing 16 and 17 s 120A
[2021-08-24T13:43:57] Mirono escooters: How much A and phase A?
[2021-08-24T13:44:05] Mirono escooters: 3kw each Is 🥰
[2021-08-24T15:44:41] Happy Giraffe: I will put the xiaomi throttle and brake here, was there any schematic which wire was what? I dont wanna fuck it up😅
[2021-08-24T15:46:36] Mirono escooters: That'd way simpler then flipsky lmao (didn't include connectors had to direct solder)
[2021-08-24T15:55:16] Artem Bulashev: There will be 3 wires one of them will be red and one will be black. One doesn’t f matter 🤙😜
[2021-08-24T16:05:19] Happy Giraffe: Can I trust chinese color coding?😂
[2021-08-24T16:05:54] Happy Giraffe: Okok, I'll do that. Thanks, I just dont wanna blow it up
[2021-08-24T16:09:24] Mirono escooters: Shit. Chip shortage will be resolved. Not in near future tho according to experts
[2021-08-24T16:12:09] Happy Giraffe: Its very profitable for companies like TSMC😂
[2021-08-24T16:12:56] Happy Giraffe: Luckily I got all what I need now...
[2021-08-24T16:15:40] Mirono escooters: Yea I know; America ban on smic (or smty like that) helped them
[2021-08-24T16:15:46] Mirono escooters: They need to increase capacity : D
[2021-08-24T16:16:00] Mirono escooters: Flipsky price went up, I was intrigued. So cool shit
[2021-08-24T16:16:05] Happy Giraffe: They are at 110-120% capacity now
[2021-08-24T16:16:11] Mirono escooters: It requires so much water too to make chips. Didn't know
[2021-08-24T16:16:20] Happy Giraffe: Time to sell flipsky and buy Spintend haha
[2021-08-24T16:16:33] Mirono escooters: 110 billion $ lost in car industry
[2021-08-24T16:16:40] Mirono escooters: Makes my wallet feel like shit lmao
[2021-08-24T16:17:01] Mirono escooters: Meh who would buy it. I'm happy with it lol (for now) ;)
[2021-08-24T16:17:17] Mirono escooters: Only thing I could do now is 75v vesc but then I'd need to revuild pack and shit. I'm good
[2021-08-24T16:18:08] Happy Giraffe: Haha, today hopefully will get test ride of vesc. Then will waterproof it like a maniac
[2021-08-24T16:18:49] Mirono escooters: Same lol, few more days testing (I got my antispark and brake disk today) and adding more leds. Then silicon the shit out of plexiglass
[2021-08-24T16:18:57] Mirono escooters: I cant access cable bay already
[2021-08-24T16:19:04] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_824@23-08-2021_17-30-30.jpg>
[2021-08-24T16:19:10] Mirono escooters: I forgot to wire led. Woops
[2021-08-24T16:20:03] Mirono escooters: Im gonna add a small 30mm fan to bottom of vesc I think. Will help significantly
[2021-08-24T16:20:08] Happy Giraffe: Lol, I hope today not raining so I can test.
[2021-08-24T16:20:18] Mirono escooters: Here its sun (idk where u live)
[2021-08-24T16:21:06] Happy Giraffe: Might help, I would optimize all passive cooling first. A fan wont help if thermal pads or contact is not transfering heat in first place.
[2021-08-24T16:21:56] Mirono escooters: Seems like passive is on point
[2021-08-24T16:22:09] Mirono escooters: I could screw/ glue it to base lol, frame would b masskve heatsink
[2021-08-24T16:22:41] Mirono escooters: For now 50* after 2km hard riding. But I don't wanna risk it on long rides. Heatsink smol
[2021-08-24T16:23:40] Happy Giraffe: If you bolt it into frame and put thermal paste in between I see no reason why it wouldnt work
[2021-08-24T16:25:15] Mirono escooters: It already has fins tho. So i would need to mount bare mosfets or so
[2021-08-24T16:25:34] Mirono escooters: Idk how I would bolt it tho. Oh I will see when I'm closing shit up
[2021-08-24T16:27:21] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi Pro deck is two layers, I will drill the first and then make a thread for it. Then put vesc and bolt it in place
[2021-08-24T16:29:04] Mirono escooters: Sounds interesting. Will look at g30 frame
[2021-08-24T16:29:26] Mirono escooters: So cool that vesc stays cool with so much power. Comparing to other esc
[2021-08-24T16:31:39] Unknown: on g30 we have plenty of room, otherwise i was thinking mounting outside.....aircooled
[2021-08-24T16:32:29] Mirono escooters: I have a lot of laptop radiator thingis
[2021-08-24T16:32:31] Mirono escooters: 🤔
[2021-08-24T16:32:45] Mirono escooters: If u ride it acts like fan through fins
[2021-08-24T16:33:17] Mirono escooters: I'm again over engineering shit. Without fan would be prob fine. A fan would b super. Guess I'll go with that lol
[2021-08-24T17:06:34] Unknown: https://youtu.be/PUzWaUWEdTY
[2021-08-24T17:07:09] Unknown: i dont know why the shite gps race timer shut off....——- 10s
[2021-08-24T17:14:23] Happy Giraffe: Could even the power button share same 5v with brake and throttle?🤔
[2021-08-24T17:15:54] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise I would need two cables for sensors

[2021-08-24T17:21:55] Artem Bulashev: More and more sellers get ubox though :)
[2021-08-24T17:22:02] Artem Bulashev: Popularity is rising for sure
[2021-08-24T17:22:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳
[2021-08-24T22:21:21] sombre_enfant: It looks slow on vid idk why😂
[2021-08-24T22:22:14] Mirono escooters: Uhu.. its baddd
[2021-08-24T22:25:07] sombre_enfant: Spinted 2 the moon
[2021-08-24T23:07:14] Tudor: Fuck me
[2021-08-24T23:07:36] Tudor: Wtf its gold fking greedy
[2021-08-24T23:07:49] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-08-24T23:07:52] Artem Bulashev: No sales
[2021-08-24T23:07:53] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2021-08-25T00:19:09] Happy Giraffe: Which firmware should I run on spintend single vesc? Im soon finishing the sensor cables
[2021-08-25T03:34:15] Happy Giraffe: So far didnt want to update it at all before someone who knows it better could check with me. Motor runs on table so I call it a win for today🎉
[2021-08-25T11:26:03] Unknown: First batch of molicels should arrive this week 👌
[2021-08-25T11:26:20] Mirono escooters: Jaj🥰
[2021-08-25T12:01:37] Artem Bulashev: Don’t change
[2021-08-25T12:01:57] Artem Bulashev: Spintend ships it with latest suitable
[2021-08-25T13:48:36] Happy Giraffe: If XT90S antispark won't plug and the way in, did I use too much time heating it while soldering? I saw some guy on YT to do a loop style with it also
[2021-08-25T13:54:10] Mirono escooters: I'm afraid u melted its casing and its abit f now
[2021-08-25T13:55:27] Happy Giraffe: Then I just make new 👍 Thanks, I knew I was just powering vesc from the resistor so just checked if motor spinned😂
[2021-08-25T13:55:46] Happy Giraffe: This from YT skateboard guy
[2021-08-25T14:51:48] Happy Giraffe: Later today gonna wire it up to be tested, time to see then how "1000w" motor does with single vesc😎
[2021-08-25T16:23:17] sombre_enfant: Whats better ? 2 single spinted or 1 dual ? Its to put in my g30 u guy know when price going to increase ?
[2021-08-25T16:24:41] Artem Bulashev: Well, singles you can place at each end of the deck = short phase cables. But it I better to have short battery lead than phase motor wires
[2021-08-25T16:24:55] Artem Bulashev: On other hand singles you can stuck on top of each other
[2021-08-25T16:25:07] sombre_enfant: And if anyone know shipping price for france ?
[2021-08-25T16:25:11] Artem Bulashev: So it really depends more on the proportion of the deck
[2021-08-25T16:25:35] sombre_enfant: Maybe @koxx3 or @francois_schempers
[2021-08-25T16:25:38] Artem Bulashev: Spintend website will help you with that. 15€ I think
[2021-08-25T16:25:47] sombre_enfant: For two ?
[2021-08-25T16:26:08] sombre_enfant: Fuck i need 20$ more...
[2021-08-25T16:26:27] Artem Bulashev: Check on website
[2021-08-25T16:26:30] Artem Bulashev: Takes 2 min
[2021-08-25T16:26:48] Artem Bulashev: They didn’t order 2pcs
[2021-08-25T16:29:32] sombre_enfant: 32/35$ so just a bit more expensive
[2021-08-25T16:29:50] sombre_enfant: Then need to add 80€ 17s bms same as you
[2021-08-25T16:32:22] sombre_enfant: No actually same price then i get 2x solo if its same price, do i need to add some other thing ? Bt module already idk ?
[2021-08-25T16:55:27] Artem Bulashev: Singles do not have Bt built in
[2021-08-25T16:59:13] sombre_enfant: Thats crap, and it also mean i need to buy 2 bt module...
[2021-08-25T17:00:32] Artem Bulashev: One
[2021-08-25T17:00:45] Artem Bulashev: Modules communicate over can
[2021-08-25T18:44:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: single core Spinted VESC doesn't have integrated bluetooth ;)
[2021-08-25T18:44:24] Artem Bulashev: That’s why you need one external :-)
[2021-08-25T18:44:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yep !
[2021-08-25T18:45:49] Happy Giraffe: Wait wtf
[2021-08-25T18:46:02] Happy Giraffe: I cant use my phone as a screen?👀👀👀👀
[2021-08-25T18:46:14] Artem Bulashev: With BT you can
[2021-08-25T18:46:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope, unless you add an external BT "dongle"
[2021-08-25T18:46:26] Happy Giraffe: I didnt buy the module
[2021-08-25T18:46:35] Happy Giraffe: Thought it was inside...rip
[2021-08-25T18:46:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: then you are fucked 😅
[2021-08-25T18:46:49] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-25T18:47:19] Happy Giraffe: Cant have the police mode then either
[2021-08-25T18:47:46] Happy Giraffe: If someone orders single vesc in EU get one BT module for me I pay the expenses👍
[2021-08-25T18:49:04] Artem Bulashev: Just email Spintend and ask them to add one
[2021-08-25T18:49:16] Artem Bulashev: Pay the difference via PayPal or something
[2021-08-25T18:50:31] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_837@25-08-2021_18-50-31.jpg>
[2021-08-25T18:50:41] Artem Bulashev: They are very fast to respond
[2021-08-25T18:50:50] Artem Bulashev: You can also contact them on Facebook
[2021-08-25T18:55:00] Unknown: Any idea on m365 throttle/ brake voltage?
[2021-08-25T18:55:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 5V power supply / 0.8 - 4.1V signal ouput
[2021-08-25T18:55:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: NEVER connect directly on the VESC
[2021-08-25T18:55:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you'll fry the STM32
[2021-08-25T18:57:12] Artem Bulashev: Yeap, need adc board. I have one in EU if any one needs .
[2021-08-25T19:01:30] sombre_enfant: So when i order a vesc i need adc board and Bluetooth x2 ?
[2021-08-25T19:01:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: or simply 2 resistors (1k/2k) ;)
[2021-08-25T19:02:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_838@25-08-2021_19-02-38.jpg>
[2021-08-25T19:03:22] Artem Bulashev: True as well 👌
[2021-08-25T19:03:34] Unknown: I got trampa vesc?
[2021-08-25T19:03:43] Artem Bulashev: Btw man I outlined an basic spec for light controll board that would be necessary for vesc scooter integration
[2021-08-25T19:14:53] sombre_enfant: Dual vesc dosent have them neither ?
[2021-08-25T19:15:11] Unknown: <photos/photo_840@25-08-2021_19-15-11.jpg>
[2021-08-25T19:15:14] Unknown: Would it be built in at trampa?
[2021-08-25T19:15:33] Unknown: <photos/photo_841@25-08-2021_19-15-33.jpg>
[2021-08-25T19:15:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. all VESCs are based on the same microcontroller, and none have ADC voltage reduction as far as I know.
[2021-08-25T20:23:49] Sébastien Michon: So, i think i pass order next month for a dual. So what should i buy ? - spintend - ADC module - what else ???
[2021-08-25T20:32:47] sombre_enfant: Bluetooth bms and repack your battery to 16s or 17s is a plus🙂
[2021-08-25T20:41:07] Unknown: <video_file>
[2021-08-25T20:41:13] Unknown: Nothing blew up 🤷‍♂️
[2021-08-25T20:52:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: well, if you want to loose a vesc, continue ! 🤣 read the stm32 datasheet if don't trust me. i fried enought esp32 adc to know... if it exceed 3.3v, you are off limit. it might work few minutes, but datasheet aren't here for nothing.
[2021-08-25T20:53:36] Luis Magalhaes: ✅
[2021-08-25T20:54:09] Luis Magalhaes: If you don't want do burn your adc input you should listen..
[2021-08-25T20:57:05] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2021-08-25T21:00:24] Artem Bulashev: That is correct to my knowledge as well. At least Ubox has throttle pulled down to ground so that it won’t go to 50% if line disconnects 🤪😅
[2021-08-25T21:01:11] Artem Bulashev: Man don’t. You were told for a reason.
[2021-08-25T21:02:36] Artem Bulashev: If you need adc board just text will send it to you. Don’t plug it in without adc. It will burn it and repair will be needed
[2021-08-25T21:03:03] Artem Bulashev: There is no way this won’t turn out any other way
[2021-08-25T21:28:29] Unknown: But i can't find anything about an adc board for trampa 🤔 only for flipsky and stuff
[2021-08-25T21:28:52] Artem Bulashev: Didn’t matter
[2021-08-25T21:29:14] Artem Bulashev: All it does it converts 5v level throttle and brake to 3.3
[2021-08-25T21:29:32] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t matter what vesc - all same
[2021-08-25T21:29:42] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-08-25T21:35:33] Unknown: Where can i get this adc board?
[2021-08-25T21:51:05] Artem Bulashev: I have stock in eu if you need
[2021-08-25T21:51:12] Artem Bulashev: Or on Spintend.com
[2021-08-25T21:51:28] Mirono escooters: Wait. I didn't follow, what does the board do and when needed
[2021-08-25T21:51:30] Artem Bulashev: They ship from china
[2021-08-25T21:51:52] Artem Bulashev: When you want to use non 3.3v brake and throttle
[2021-08-25T21:51:55] Artem Bulashev: On vesc
[2021-08-25T21:51:57] Unknown: Is china eu? 😂
[2021-08-25T21:52:11] Mirono escooters: Oh.. my throttle is prob non 3.3v as It has massive deadpoints
[2021-08-25T21:52:13] Unknown: I'd like eu stock please
[2021-08-25T21:52:18] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-08-25T21:52:22] Artem Bulashev: I have one
[2021-08-25T21:52:26] Unknown: Yes then it probably is
[2021-08-25T21:52:53] Artem Bulashev: Pm me your address if you need and I will send you 👌 Brand new. I never used it.
[2021-08-25T21:54:00] Artem Bulashev: If it so Hall effect , than it is not likely. Some Hall effect have resistors built inside of them and they sell explicitly marking 3.3v logic
[2021-08-25T21:54:23] sombre_enfant: Bye bye drv chip 🙏🏾
[2021-08-25T21:54:32] Mirono escooters: I used 3.3v input sooo
[2021-08-25T21:56:28] Unknown: Sent you a message 😇😂 i wanted to set it up temporary on m365 stock batt, i bricked my dash and did'nt wanna go true the st link hassle
[2021-08-25T21:57:03] Unknown: Guess i'll have to wait just a little longer, anyways by then my batts probably arrived and bms should too
[2021-08-25T22:05:36] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-08-25T22:06:30] Artem Bulashev: Your brake is 3 pin right?
[2021-08-25T22:06:42] Artem Bulashev: It’s Hall effect brake on m365
[2021-08-25T22:07:55] Unknown: Yes 3 pin
[2021-08-25T22:08:03] Unknown: It's both hall
[2021-08-25T22:08:07] Unknown: Magnetic
[2021-08-25T22:12:51] Artem Bulashev: I would advice use only one as regen brake
[2021-08-25T22:13:50] Unknown: I dont want regen brake, i want no "kers"
[2021-08-25T22:13:57] Artem Bulashev: Leave other brake handle as mechanical only. Hall effect don’t like to be connected in parallel because one will be sending 4v when you don’t touch it and other mean while will send 2v when you press it
[2021-08-25T22:14:25] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-08-25T22:14:42] Artem Bulashev: Still same
[2021-08-25T22:14:50] Artem Bulashev: Best to have one hall on one channel
[2021-08-25T22:15:58] Unknown: Crap so i can't have e brake? Could i possibly use e brake if i can connect it without bridging power with throttle?
[2021-08-25T22:16:59] Artem Bulashev: No no
[2021-08-25T22:17:01] Artem Bulashev: You can
[2021-08-25T22:17:10] Artem Bulashev: But only from one of the 2 brake handles
[2021-08-25T22:17:26] Artem Bulashev: Because there is 2 adc inputs on one vesc
[2021-08-25T22:17:44] Unknown: I only have 1 brake handle haha
[2021-08-25T22:17:47] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2021-08-25T22:17:48] Unknown: Single motor
[2021-08-25T22:17:54] Artem Bulashev: That’s confused me
[2021-08-25T22:18:00] Artem Bulashev: Than you are all ok
[2021-08-25T22:18:56] Unknown: Ooh ok haha awesome 😂 no i meant like, the throttle and brake both work with magnetic sensor
[2021-08-25T22:19:34] Unknown: Motor has hall sensors, did'nt want them.. but a friend told me it's way better to have them
[2021-08-25T22:19:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it is
[2021-08-25T22:19:57] Unknown: No clue haha
[2021-08-25T22:23:03] Artem Bulashev: Yeah absolutely! Always better to have them
[2021-08-26T08:40:40] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_842@26-08-2021_08-40-40.jpg>
[2021-08-26T08:42:06] Mirono escooters: China didn't know what phase/ motor current is..
[2021-08-26T08:42:44] Mirono escooters: Anyone got a idea? Max batt is 50 continuously 150 pulse
[2021-08-26T08:57:09] francois schempers: i know flpsky is shit, thats all i know x) maybe youll change my mind of them ^^
[2021-08-26T08:57:25] francois schempers: start with 50 and see what temps you got
[2021-08-26T08:57:59] Mirono escooters: Dude I'm on 120🙈
[2021-08-26T08:58:03] Mirono escooters: 50*
[2021-08-26T08:58:35] Mirono escooters: Flipsky has been super good for me, its really a nice device. Just sad I didn't get cables and had to direct solder
[2021-08-26T08:58:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i already exchanges with flipsky. it was kinda 'funny'. they don't know shit about their product. they sell vesc like potatoes 🙈
[2021-08-26T08:59:03] Mirono escooters: Yeaa.. their helpdesk isn't helping..
[2021-08-26T08:59:26] Mirono escooters: But.. can I just increase phase current until it gets too hot or
[2021-08-26T09:00:04] francois schempers: don't forget to test brakes too while testing phase current temps
[2021-08-26T09:02:35] Mirono escooters: I decelerate and accel only xd
[2021-08-26T09:02:44] Mirono escooters: Must look funny on road
[2021-08-26T09:03:33] Mirono escooters: Wonder if 120A phase is already too much 🤔 idk wich modfets they use
[2021-08-26T09:03:59] Unknown: 105 cell holder..for g30....13s8p....
[2021-08-26T09:04:10] Mirono escooters: 🥰🥰🥰🥰
[2021-08-26T09:04:42] Mirono escooters: If mosfet max A is 150 Is this max limit of phase current too?
[2021-08-26T09:08:34] sombre_enfant: U can fit 150if u trim the edge
[2021-08-26T09:51:08] Unknown: trim the edges??? show me ....without cage, glued unprofessional, maybe
[2021-08-26T09:51:45] sombre_enfant: With cage and single esc u can do 140
[2021-08-26T09:51:54] Mirono escooters: Ieuw glue
[2021-08-26T10:10:43] Unknown: show
[2021-08-26T10:11:20] Unknown: ???
[2021-08-26T10:12:01] Mirono escooters: I just joked that gluing isn't good
[2021-08-26T10:16:29] sombre_enfant: 120 2 controller and straight cell if u do honey and 1 controller u can
[2021-08-26T10:16:29] sombre_enfant: Ihr müsst nicht zählen: 120. Aktuell habe ich aber einen Cellspacer, der noch mal 2cm kürzer ist.
[2021-08-26T10:16:29] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_845@26-08-2021_10-16-29.jpg>
[2021-08-26T10:16:48] Unknown: 120
[2021-08-26T10:18:19] Mirono escooters: I give up with flipsky Gives me name of non existing mosfet And 50a current. Bcs batt current is 50A too..🙄🤦‍♂️
[2021-08-26T10:19:16] Mirono escooters: If im correct, the mosfet is 94A 60v Does this mean phase current is max 94A? Or am I doing this all wrong
[2021-08-26T10:19:42] Unknown: this is bullshit to flex away structure stuff
[2021-08-26T10:21:10] Unknown: i try and make stuff that everybody can install, yes i can print or cnc myself extender and fit 300 cells..... but why...
[2021-08-26T10:21:55] Mirono escooters: 300🥰
[2021-08-26T10:32:28] sombre_enfant: My bad bro🙏🏾
[2021-08-26T10:34:58] Unknown: my first tought was to flex the aluminium bars away.... and i will do it, but this mod ist not for normal persons
[2021-08-26T10:38:25] sombre_enfant: Yes but you an advanced guy i tough u was doing this for yourself... How u going to do it ? Im lazy to take apart my frame again 😂
[2021-08-26T10:39:16] Unknown: you talk too much, over
[2021-08-26T10:39:50] sombre_enfant: 😐👍🏾
[2021-08-26T11:13:49] francois schempers: roger that x)
[2021-08-26T13:03:52] Happy Giraffe: What could be the cause of this crunchy noise? Bad halls?
[2021-08-26T13:04:16] Happy Giraffe: Only happens on low throttle like 10%
[2021-08-26T13:04:41] Mirono escooters: Sensorless?
[2021-08-26T13:05:17] Unknown: bearings??
[2021-08-26T13:06:00] Happy Giraffe: Cries
[2021-08-26T13:06:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if have the same issue, less audible when you ride.
[2021-08-26T13:06:38] Happy Giraffe: Bearings dont have any space in them to move, this issue is related to throttle
[2021-08-26T13:06:59] Happy Giraffe: If I go 50% throttle then it disappeaes
[2021-08-26T13:07:05] Happy Giraffe: And motor goes fast
[2021-08-26T13:07:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but you have a vibration too
[2021-08-26T13:07:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: material vibration
[2021-08-26T13:07:24] Happy Giraffe: So its spintend issue?🤔
[2021-08-26T13:07:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't think it's spintend related.
[2021-08-26T13:07:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: more vesc related
[2021-08-26T13:08:10] Happy Giraffe: Could be the crunching vibrating the motor on suspension
[2021-08-26T13:08:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the latest firmware seems to fix such issue
[2021-08-26T13:08:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but still in dev
[2021-08-26T13:08:32] Happy Giraffe: Oh shiet, is it ok to ride like this tho?
[2021-08-26T13:09:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, no pb
[2021-08-26T13:09:48] Artem Bulashev: Yeah mine does some vibration from about 6-15kmh
[2021-08-26T13:09:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is no many settings in vesc, it could be anything 🤣
[2021-08-26T13:09:54] Artem Bulashev: Than no thing
[2021-08-26T13:09:58] Artem Bulashev: Super quite
[2021-08-26T13:10:51] Happy Giraffe: <voice_message>
[2021-08-26T13:11:11] Happy Giraffe: Mic close to motor, but then also quiet for me
[2021-08-26T13:11:41] Happy Giraffe: I tried maxspeed on 49v, not that fast maybe 50kmh I felt
[2021-08-26T13:12:04] Artem Bulashev: Speed doesn’t depend on controller
[2021-08-26T13:12:21] Artem Bulashev: It is product of motor KV vs battery voltage
[2021-08-26T13:12:26] Artem Bulashev: Mostly
[2021-08-26T13:12:29] Artem Bulashev: Like 90%
[2021-08-26T13:13:52] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I never ran this motor to its potential before due to lack of amps (22A) on the chinese esc before
[2021-08-26T13:20:37] Sébastien Michon: i love your brake. What is the model ?
[2021-08-26T13:21:33] Happy Giraffe: Magura MT5e
[2021-08-26T13:21:42] Happy Giraffe: Absolute insane power
[2021-08-26T13:21:45] Unknown: Lol like £130 for lever no?
[2021-08-26T13:22:00] Happy Giraffe: One finger braking from 50ish kmh
[2021-08-26T13:22:12] Happy Giraffe: 130 for one set
[2021-08-26T13:22:22] Unknown: 😩
[2021-08-26T13:22:37] Happy Giraffe: And Im running stock pads, I got better ready lol
[2021-08-26T13:22:58] Happy Giraffe: Not that bad for quality
[2021-08-26T13:22:58] Sébastien Michon: Yeah ...but beautiful. And quality
[2021-08-26T13:23:21] sombre_enfant: No brake 😈😩
[2021-08-26T13:23:26] Happy Giraffe: It really feels like just right and relaxed but powerful
[2021-08-26T13:23:29] Unknown: Oh no it's reealllyy good
[2021-08-26T13:23:34] Unknown: I have magura on ebike and pffftt
[2021-08-26T13:23:37] Unknown: Shit is insane
[2021-08-26T13:23:48] Happy Giraffe: You can just bolt an adapter, dont use monorim
[2021-08-26T13:24:00] Happy Giraffe: Monorim has to be retarded modded to fit
[2021-08-26T13:24:01] Unknown: The E version is super expensive tho unfortunately
[2021-08-26T13:24:08] Happy Giraffe: I got it lol
[2021-08-26T13:24:23] Happy Giraffe: So nice to have the cable if I need
[2021-08-26T13:24:32] sombre_enfant: Like dat ?
[2021-08-26T13:24:40] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2021-08-26T13:24:41] sombre_enfant: Cant rn
[2021-08-26T13:24:53] Happy Giraffe: What is that adapter btw?
[2021-08-26T13:24:54] sombre_enfant: Need to move a bit the disc
[2021-08-26T13:25:00] sombre_enfant: Dualtron
[2021-08-26T13:25:42] Happy Giraffe: Bolt from inside out with low profile nut, then it should not run against disc
[2021-08-26T13:27:25] sombre_enfant: Im going to the shop with a friend but only got 1 active motor and only electric brake, i hope i dont burn everything since im still on 72v...what amps i could use ?
[2021-08-26T13:27:42] Sébastien Michon: Actually i have a silly zoom hydraulic. It's better as original, but i want to upgrade it.
[2021-08-26T13:28:09] Sébastien Michon: <photos/photo_849@26-08-2021_13-28-09.jpg>
[2021-08-26T13:28:34] Mirono escooters: Wich for example?
[2021-08-26T13:29:13] Happy Giraffe: My 1000w motor had 105A phase too much, maybe theres some software issue also but now I have to lower it
[2021-08-26T13:29:28] Happy Giraffe: I meant exactly what sombre had
[2021-08-26T13:29:35] Happy Giraffe: This
[2021-08-26T13:29:38] Mirono escooters: Ahaa
[2021-08-26T13:29:56] sombre_enfant: Im going to do it with spelth in like 2 hours
[2021-08-26T13:30:09] Mirono escooters: I got m9noshit one from friend for free. It was a hell. Monorim suspension was bended.. all axles didn't wanna come out..
[2021-08-26T13:30:19] Happy Giraffe: I might end up doing that aswell but for now trying with this
[2021-08-26T13:30:25] Sébastien Michon: this why ? Yes it's mine. But i think i'll put magura
[2021-08-26T13:30:32] sombre_enfant: Too tighten
[2021-08-26T13:30:32] Mirono escooters: Close tolerances no? Does it hit disk?
[2021-08-26T13:30:35] Mirono escooters: Screws I mean
[2021-08-26T13:30:42] Mirono escooters: I didnt tighten. Friend did. Horrible
[2021-08-26T13:30:50] Happy Giraffe: I got 1mm tolerances😂
[2021-08-26T13:30:52] sombre_enfant: Tout est calculé
[2021-08-26T13:30:52] Mirono escooters: I hat to hit imbus with hammer
[2021-08-26T13:31:00] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_850@26-08-2021_13-31-00.jpg>
[2021-08-26T13:31:02] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-26T13:31:05] sombre_enfant: It be like tath😂😂😂
[2021-08-26T13:31:37] Artem Bulashev: Usually 105a will be easy for true nominal 1000w.
[2021-08-26T13:31:44] sombre_enfant: Shouldve used angle grinder...
[2021-08-26T13:31:46] Sébastien Michon: no. all are ok
[2021-08-26T13:31:57] Artem Bulashev: I gave you 105a estimating your motor is really about 800w
[2021-08-26T13:32:20] Artem Bulashev: And that’s why it may get warm like 50c is no problem for it
[2021-08-26T13:32:39] Happy Giraffe: Francois S. says his motor does fine, they are from same seller🤔
[2021-08-26T13:32:47] Happy Giraffe: Same motor
[2021-08-26T13:32:57] Artem Bulashev: Same setting?
[2021-08-26T13:33:25] Happy Giraffe: I'll asked him, hes at work prob
[2021-08-26T13:33:30] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-08-26T13:33:37] Artem Bulashev: May be his battery current is like 25
[2021-08-26T13:33:39] Sébastien Michon: No difficult to do. You will see
[2021-08-26T13:34:03] Artem Bulashev: So mad phase amps available up to lower speed = shorter period of time = less heat
[2021-08-26T13:34:09] Happy Giraffe: I noticed acceleration to be slower side on 0-20 than 20-50ish
[2021-08-26T13:34:25] Happy Giraffe: Even tho more phase should be available 0-20🤔
[2021-08-26T13:34:44] Happy Giraffe: After like 20kmh the torque was really nice sturdy and smooth
[2021-08-26T13:35:55] Happy Giraffe: Lets see after I change the values and do FOC wizard
[2021-08-26T13:43:29] Artem Bulashev: That a switch from sensored to sensorless
[2021-08-26T13:45:32] Happy Giraffe: Oh, Interesting
[2021-08-26T13:45:52] Mirono escooters: Why would u wanna switch?
[2021-08-26T13:47:22] Happy Giraffe: Its so stupid the usb port of single vesc is on the side
[2021-08-26T13:47:50] Happy Giraffe: Need that bt module as quick as possible lol
[2021-08-26T13:52:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's automatic in vesc. hall sensors can't keep up the speed. only good at low speed while backemf is too low
[2021-08-26T13:52:38] Mirono escooters: Oki
[2021-08-26T13:52:47] Mirono escooters: Love Bluetooth on vesc
[2021-08-26T13:53:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i find it painful with vesc tool.
[2021-08-26T13:53:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no auto bt cnx, too many panels
[2021-08-26T13:53:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and poor menu organisation
[2021-08-26T13:53:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but it's better than nothing
[2021-08-26T13:58:32] Happy Giraffe: Does autotune result on motor affect from motor being horizontal or vertical?
[2021-08-26T14:07:48] Happy Giraffe: It gives me now sensorless autotune result🤔
[2021-08-26T14:09:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: whoups... nope. either hall sensors are conntected correctly, or something else wrong
[2021-08-26T14:10:56] Happy Giraffe: They worked fine in yesterday autotune, no changes to them. Also connector is fully in
[2021-08-26T14:14:18] Happy Giraffe: Can I just run it sensorless then and warranty myself a new motor?
[2021-08-26T14:18:52] Happy Giraffe: Even hall sensor detection cant find them lol, its sensorless times bois
[2021-08-26T14:26:08] Happy Giraffe: What sensor port mode I must use without Hall then?
[2021-08-26T14:51:45] Happy Giraffe: And now it found the hall sensors, who gave beer to my vesc?😂😂😂
[2021-08-26T14:52:18] Mirono escooters: Bad connection?
[2021-08-26T14:53:38] Luis Magalhaes: Have to change it do sensorless
[2021-08-26T14:54:11] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_851@26-08-2021_14-54-11.jpg>
[2021-08-26T14:54:36] Luis Magalhaes: Its what i use on mine 😅
[2021-08-26T14:55:09] Mirono escooters: Why would u use sensorless🙈
[2021-08-26T14:56:41] Happy Giraffe: No idea
[2021-08-26T14:57:06] Happy Giraffe: But FOC will work even if sensor go kaboom or error so Im good to go...
[2021-08-26T14:58:49] Mirono escooters: How can it do foc without sensors
[2021-08-26T15:08:38] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_852@26-08-2021_15-08-38.jpg>
[2021-08-26T15:08:45] Happy Giraffe: Not sure how reliable this is but well
[2021-08-26T15:10:44] Happy Giraffe: But my motor worked even tho vesctool gave hall error
[2021-08-26T15:10:58] Happy Giraffe: So it kinda could confirm this to be true
[2021-08-26T16:15:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: last time ih happend to me, it was a burnt mosfet and detection didn't really pass correctly (flipsky)
[2021-08-26T16:15:40] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-08-26T16:17:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: does the motor wiezard pass correctly ? no special noise excpet the 1rst sequence ?

[2021-08-26T17:07:28] Happy Giraffe: Bruhs I got single vesc and Im more than fine if the bastards works now with sensors without blowing up😂
[2021-08-26T18:31:35] Happy Giraffe: Motor made crunch sounds and stopped
[2021-08-26T18:31:46] Happy Giraffe: Shows red blinking light on power button
[2021-08-26T18:43:59] Sébastien Michon: Is it right or a Fake 🤔🤔 ???
[2021-08-26T18:46:06] Mirono escooters: Welll. We don't kno
[2021-08-26T19:04:04] Sébastien Michon: Hum really interesting... He accept PayPal ?

[2021-08-26T19:06:11] Sébastien Michon: Arggg....I will be weak ...i think
[2021-08-26T19:06:47] Mirono escooters: I also succumbed
[2021-08-26T19:07:35] Mirono escooters: Was too nice to not try

[2021-08-26T19:18:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: spintend single core
[2021-08-26T20:04:52] Happy Giraffe: How is the sensorless working? Is the start much worse than sensored?
[2021-08-26T22:43:53] Artem Bulashev: Interesting design choice. Both boards are attached to opposite sides, so that there is no pressure on interconnecting pins, unlike in Ubox
[2021-08-26T22:44:12] Artem Bulashev: Also spaced out more that way which is good for EMI
[2021-08-26T22:44:17] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_863@26-08-2021_22-44-17.jpg>

[2021-08-27T09:34:39] sombre_enfant: What tath mean ?
[2021-08-27T09:34:52] Mirono escooters: No idea
[2021-08-27T09:35:46] sombre_enfant: We'll never receive it even the order count isnt right,and he got 3000 product
[2021-08-27T09:38:37] Mirono escooters: Thats normal for alie stores
[2021-08-27T11:13:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol. 3000. i doubt the last spintend batch is so big.

[2021-08-27T19:43:13] Tudor: Hehhe havent had a ride for ages also
[2021-08-27T19:43:29] Tudor: I am relocating and no time for my scoots
[2021-08-27T21:49:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: work in progress ...
[2021-08-27T21:49:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_872@27-08-2021_21-49-45.jpg>
[2021-08-27T21:57:57] sombre_enfant: U still didnt finish it ?
[2021-08-27T21:58:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: they are fished & wrapped in kapton
[2021-08-27T21:58:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but I cut the fish paper at 6.4mm (not 6.5)
[2021-08-27T21:59:14] sombre_enfant: I see a bit too much imo but it look good
[2021-08-27T21:59:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: next step, balabing wires.... it will be painfull because i have very low width left (2mm)
[2021-08-27T22:01:34] Artem Bulashev: Looking good
[2021-08-27T22:01:40] Artem Bulashev: I will have it same way
[2021-08-27T22:01:53] Artem Bulashev: Just 6 along and 8 in parallel
[2021-08-27T22:02:12] Artem Bulashev: Than BMS on top
[2021-08-27T22:02:22] Artem Bulashev: Instead of 2 p assemblies
[2021-08-27T22:02:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: at the front for me ;)
[2021-08-27T22:03:31] Artem Bulashev: My contrôler is closer to rear wheel, so battery will be also facing back
[2021-08-27T22:04:08] Artem Bulashev: @Mister_Lithium you said one that hot glue should not be used for holding cells together, why is that?
[2021-08-27T22:04:40] Artem Bulashev: Should we remove it after p is assembled? Can it creat hot spots doing operation?
[2021-08-27T22:07:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: some people says it could melt when cells are really hot
[2021-08-27T22:08:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I don't think I'll get my battery up to 80°C, so ... I glued
[2021-08-27T22:17:54] Happy Giraffe: Only when using LG cells 👀😂
[2021-08-27T22:18:09] Happy Giraffe: LG "Vdrop" MJ1
[2021-08-27T22:18:12] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-27T22:18:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol
[2021-08-27T22:20:39] Artem Bulashev: It can but if it does. Than you already have a problem :)))
[2021-08-27T22:21:01] Artem Bulashev: Hot glue should not and will not add structural integrity
[2021-08-27T22:21:23] Artem Bulashev: Because it will fall off the cell during vibrations over time. Fairly quickly.
[2021-08-27T22:21:45] Happy Giraffe: Double comp glue then😂😂😂
[2021-08-27T22:21:49] sombre_enfant: They good whats wrong ?
[2021-08-27T22:21:50] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-08-27T22:22:02] Artem Bulashev: They are okeish
[2021-08-27T22:22:10] Happy Giraffe: They shit compared to 35E
[2021-08-27T22:22:18] Artem Bulashev: Mh1 sag a lot more about 0.15v more than mj1
[2021-08-27T22:22:25] sombre_enfant: No
[2021-08-27T22:22:35] Artem Bulashev: Mj1 and mh1 are ok up to 7a
[2021-08-27T22:22:53] Artem Bulashev: Mj1 are fairly good up to 5a
[2021-08-27T22:22:59] Happy Giraffe: I used both, 12s4p mj1 performs like 12s3p 35E😂
[2021-08-27T22:23:23] Happy Giraffe: Same vdrop
[2021-08-27T22:23:28] Artem Bulashev: 35e are ok up to 10a and are great up to 7a
[2021-08-27T22:23:52] Artem Bulashev: 35e have special slope that not many people understand
[2021-08-27T22:25:03] Artem Bulashev: 35e drop voltage 0.1v quicker tha ga for example, in the first 30%. But <—— after that they stop dropping voltage and keep on going and going
[2021-08-27T22:26:08] Unknown: Bad Recycling, if one fails you cannot disassemble...
[2021-08-27T22:26:09] Artem Bulashev: That’s why they end up Witt more Wh in real life than any other 18650 on current up to 7a and only Ga cell does slightly more Wh with 10amp discharge
[2021-08-27T22:26:48] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-08-27T22:27:04] Unknown: Wrap is gone double work..
[2021-08-27T22:36:05] Happy Giraffe: Yep, the 13s6p did 50A like a champ
[2021-08-27T22:36:15] Happy Giraffe: With 35A bms roflmao
[2021-08-28T02:29:06] Artem Bulashev: I only need 60a and will have 8p so will be perfect. Just about 7amps load at most, that’s why 35e where beat choice = max range in all type of loads
[2021-08-28T02:29:32] Happy Giraffe: Whats your opinion on HFI?
[2021-08-28T02:29:55] Happy Giraffe: Would it suit sensorless starup better than just kicking it with FOC?
[2021-08-28T03:28:25] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/kaFeAjzTqfc
[2021-08-28T03:28:47] Happy Giraffe: Found this video to be quite interesting

[2021-08-28T11:50:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: new seller 0 sale before price cut by half wrong stock number (spintend themself doesn't have such stock) no answer to private messages => it was either a false material or a scam
[2021-08-28T11:51:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i am not even sure 160€ cover the material parts
[2021-08-28T11:51:39] Mirono escooters: Wow

[2021-08-28T11:54:05] Mirono escooters: :(
[2021-08-28T11:54:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: normally, it should be something like 3/4$ for this STM if I remember
[2021-08-28T11:54:22] Mirono escooters: Experts say it will be resolved some time.. but not soon.. :(
[2021-08-28T11:54:26] Mirono escooters: 2024 or smth
[2021-08-28T11:54:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, we are in deep shit 😅
[2021-08-28T11:54:47] Mirono escooters: If u are a multi miljardair, a chip making company is money now
[2021-08-28T12:12:54] sombre_enfant: Damn this n.O seems to be from crystal auto store
[2021-08-28T13:32:32] Mirono escooters: :(

[2021-08-28T13:34:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: wonderfull automatic answer 🤣
[2021-08-28T13:45:30] Mirono escooters: https://www.makerx-tech.com/collections/x-esc/products/makerx-go-foc-hi100-75v-100a-base-on-75300-hardware-pre-sale This shit ok?
[2021-08-28T13:49:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no remote power switch ... and the datasheed is shit. no explanation at all about capabilibities
[2021-08-28T13:50:22] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-08-28T13:51:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for a single VESC, Spintend does better for a similar price ;)
[2021-08-28T13:51:46] Mirono escooters: I can get that one for 100€🤔
[2021-08-28T13:52:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, but you'll have to add a key loop, or a remote controlled power switch
[2021-08-28T13:52:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this remote power control is a pain for VESCs.
[2021-08-28T13:52:39] Mirono escooters: Antispark?
[2021-08-28T13:52:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-08-28T13:53:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but you have some "stupid" antispark
[2021-08-28T13:53:09] Mirono escooters: Y is it so important a power control
[2021-08-28T13:53:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: like XT90S
[2021-08-28T13:53:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: or an antispark with remote power switch
[2021-08-28T13:53:45] Mirono escooters: Got that
[2021-08-28T13:53:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but it costs a LOT if you need more than 10/12S
[2021-08-28T13:54:22] Mirono escooters: :(
[2021-08-28T13:54:32] Mirono escooters: 13s one flipsky was like 40, others I couldn't even find

[2021-08-28T13:55:11] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-08-28T14:03:55] sombre_enfant: Its not a xiaomi board bro😂😭
[2021-08-28T14:04:08] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2021-08-28T16:47:53] Unknown: Just got to wait for the bms now 😇👌

[2021-08-28T16:49:49] Mirono escooters: Hot
[2021-08-28T18:06:35] Artem Bulashev: Nice :)
[2021-08-28T18:06:53] Artem Bulashev: Wound not work for assembly like me and @koxx3 need :(
[2021-08-28T18:07:38] Artem Bulashev: Wooden railway from IKEA + rubber band = straight alignent 👌👌
[2021-08-28T18:07:39] Artem Bulashev: Done
[2021-08-28T18:07:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope, or i would need samsung 50g 😅😅😅
[2021-08-28T18:08:25] Artem Bulashev: Would be a lot of empty space 😂
[2021-08-28T18:09:42] Artem Bulashev: Now hot glue👌those 4x rings really give extra rigidity, should have gotten 8x
[2021-08-28T18:09:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it seems they start selling
[2021-08-28T18:09:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://www.lanplus.com.au/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=492
[2021-08-28T18:09:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 20$ per cell 🤣🤣
[2021-08-28T18:10:01] Artem Bulashev: 50g I can get no issues
[2021-08-28T18:10:06] Artem Bulashev: 50s is the hard new one
[2021-08-28T18:10:11] Artem Bulashev: But even that I can get
[2021-08-28T18:10:19] Artem Bulashev: But price is over 10$ per cell
[2021-08-28T18:10:30] Artem Bulashev: 50g i can get 5€ per cell
[2021-08-28T18:10:35] Artem Bulashev: Approx
[2021-08-28T18:10:43] Artem Bulashev: About 6 with shipping and eu tax
[2021-08-28T18:10:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seriously ? it's really low !!
[2021-08-28T18:11:04] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-08-28T18:12:01] Artem Bulashev: It’s actually price that supposed to be normal 👌
[2021-08-28T18:12:32] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_878@28-08-2021_18-12-32.jpg>
[2021-08-28T18:12:49] Artem Bulashev: Remember gps / sim module I told about for BMS
[2021-08-28T18:12:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 14s x 4p x 6€ = 336€... shit... it would have be cheaper than my 30q 😓
[2021-08-28T18:13:10] Artem Bulashev: Minimal order 100pcs
[2021-08-28T18:13:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but not sure it could fit
[2021-08-28T18:13:17] Artem Bulashev: But sure some one would share
[2021-08-28T18:14:00] Artem Bulashev: 7awg damm
[2021-08-28T18:14:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, interesting. need to see the software part (refresh rate, location server, remote cut off options...)
[2021-08-28T18:15:01] Unknown: 12s 4p at 5,70 for the molicel p42a's this is for internall, externall will become 12s6p
[2021-08-28T18:15:34] Artem Bulashev: Will see soon
[2021-08-28T18:16:14] Artem Bulashev: BMS installation requires specific order in which wires should attach to the pack to prevent ground loop
[2021-08-28T18:26:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: question... how do you solder the main output wires on the battery pack ? any picture ? (i have only 1 cells row)
[2021-08-28T18:29:33] Artem Bulashev: So will be last thing on the list I will have 2 3mm dia solid copper wires going from negative end (attached in the middle of of 2 half’s of the p assembly.
[2021-08-28T18:29:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_880@28-08-2021_18-29-41.jpg>
[2021-08-28T18:30:15] Artem Bulashev: 2 for more balanced current flow into into single point
[2021-08-28T18:30:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: such soldering directly on the nickel once spotted should heat up the cells no ?
[2021-08-28T18:30:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no sure to understand
[2021-08-28T18:31:38] Happy Giraffe: Sensorless worked in small hallway test
[2021-08-28T18:31:49] Happy Giraffe: Vesc is fuking awesome, saved my ass from broken motor
[2021-08-28T18:31:59] Happy Giraffe: Startup torque is very good
[2021-08-28T18:32:11] Artem Bulashev: That 3mm dia solid core Cable would attach this way
[2021-08-28T18:32:29] sombre_enfant: Put hall sensor it will be better
[2021-08-28T18:33:04] Happy Giraffe: I have but they fucked
[2021-08-28T18:33:17] sombre_enfant: Rly ? How ?
[2021-08-28T18:33:24] Happy Giraffe: Somehow after like 10kmh the full phase kicks in so smooth I love it
[2021-08-28T18:33:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok ! why not full length soldering like the picture i posted ?
[2021-08-28T18:33:53] Happy Giraffe: Ali Wheelway motor, I rode it 20km with the included esc from kit and it went brrr
[2021-08-28T18:34:06] Artem Bulashev: Because Curran flows by the path of least resistance
[2021-08-28T18:34:21] Artem Bulashev: Resistance = length * condactor resistance
[2021-08-28T18:34:47] Artem Bulashev: So more will flow through cells closer to the output cable
[2021-08-28T18:35:12] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I split into two
[2021-08-28T18:35:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: can you post the original picture, without the drawing ?
[2021-08-28T18:35:41] Artem Bulashev: May be it is not needed but I will feel better about it knowing how physics work
[2021-08-28T18:35:48] Artem Bulashev: You posted
[2021-08-28T18:35:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: loooool
[2021-08-28T18:35:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok 😁
[2021-08-28T18:35:58] Artem Bulashev: :-))
[2021-08-28T18:36:11] Unknown: Wich wheelway? I got the 1000w ready to be plugged soon, just hang doubts about the phase wires.. i'm thinking about upgrading those to copper wirng or like 14 awg cable
[2021-08-28T18:36:22] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_882@28-08-2021_18-36-22.jpg>
[2021-08-28T18:37:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @Mister_Lithium , and you ? how do you solder terminal wires ?
[2021-08-28T18:37:32] Artem Bulashev: Lon that type of assembly.
[2021-08-28T18:45:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_883@28-08-2021_18-45-12.jpg>
[2021-08-28T18:46:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this seems a bit better (even if the output at the middle would be better). at least you don't solder directly on the top/bottom of the cells. it should do some degrees lower
[2021-08-28T18:48:55] Artem Bulashev: In the middle would be better
[2021-08-28T18:48:59] Artem Bulashev: For sure
[2021-08-28T18:49:17] Artem Bulashev: 2 in two middles I decided is best for 60amps continues
[2021-08-28T18:49:41] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2021-08-28T18:49:42] Artem Bulashev: Hot glue, how to apply evenly
[2021-08-28T18:50:17] Artem Bulashev: Will never be like that than 👌
[2021-08-28T18:51:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-08-28T19:05:23] Happy Giraffe: 1000w....
[2021-08-28T19:05:38] Happy Giraffe: It was close to overheat with 50A batt 105A phase
[2021-08-28T19:06:06] Happy Giraffe: Be careful with that, no more than 90A phase to start with and feel the side of motor each 3-5min you ride
[2021-08-28T19:06:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: mosfet or motor ? do you have a thermal sensor inside the motor ?
[2021-08-28T19:06:17] Happy Giraffe: This motor need statorrade
[2021-08-28T19:06:21] Happy Giraffe: Nope
[2021-08-28T19:06:24] Happy Giraffe: Motor overheat
[2021-08-28T19:06:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok
[2021-08-28T19:06:50] Happy Giraffe: Vesc idk, dont have bt module😂 Its coming in the mail now
[2021-08-28T19:07:33] Happy Giraffe: Now going to test ride 40A/95A sensorless
[2021-08-28T19:13:14] Unknown: I have bt module, and i am planning to put a sensor in, just have to figure out wich one, and how to connect since it's single wire on vesc to connect, i guess i'll have to fix power on somewhere
[2021-08-28T19:14:45] Happy Giraffe: Wheelway 1000w has hall sensor inside already, just configure FOC with hall sensors and you are good to go.
[2021-08-28T19:15:12] Happy Giraffe: No more than 90A phase and feel the motor side once in a while if its too hot
[2021-08-28T19:16:29] Unknown: Yes i know, i took hall version hha but the phase wires seem thin for 1000w
[2021-08-28T19:16:48] Unknown: And i'm thinking to fix a temperature sensor in
[2021-08-28T19:19:08] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_885@28-08-2021_19-19-08.jpg>
[2021-08-28T19:19:26] Artem Bulashev: Damm applying it this way gives clean lines
[2021-08-28T19:19:30] Artem Bulashev: 👀
[2021-08-28T19:26:59] sombre_enfant: If i do dual with two single what do i need to order on spinted website and wich connection i need to do ?
[2021-08-28T19:29:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: just 2 vescs. cables to link them is provided.
[2021-08-28T19:29:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you need to split you power supply too
[2021-08-28T19:30:08] sombre_enfant: For Bluetooth and adc i need two ?
[2021-08-28T19:30:15] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-08-28T19:30:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. it will use CAN bus to share those datas
[2021-08-28T19:30:31] sombre_enfant: Cant just put the two in //
[2021-08-28T19:31:00] Artem Bulashev: Two adc needed only if you plan to have Ability to switch on and off one of the motors with physical switch
[2021-08-28T19:31:09] sombre_enfant: Adc and Bluetooth modul to the main and uart wire to the slave ?
[2021-08-28T19:31:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you'll just have 2 xt90
[2021-08-28T19:31:45] Happy Giraffe: You could solder gold plated propee bullet connector to them
[2021-08-28T19:31:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: all on the 'master'
[2021-08-28T19:31:55] sombre_enfant: Cant do this just by cut 1 of the rx tx to shut down one ?
[2021-08-28T19:33:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no
[2021-08-28T19:33:20] sombre_enfant: Doing it that way is more expensive like 20$ but its worth to reduce phase wire lenght ?
[2021-08-28T19:33:59] sombre_enfant: But still power supply wire lenght then...
[2021-08-28T19:34:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's a bit more complicated, but at least if you fry one vesc, the other will live 😅
[2021-08-28T19:34:48] sombre_enfant: Yes and the single got recovery fuse and less heat since they dont share same heatsink
[2021-08-28T19:38:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: heat dissipation seems to have a better designed on the single vescs.
[2021-08-28T19:39:07] Happy Giraffe: Thats cool
[2021-08-28T19:41:56] Artem Bulashev: Yes but volume that 2 single occupy is more :-) so depends is the answer
[2021-08-28T19:42:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: agreed !
[2021-08-28T19:43:05] Happy Giraffe: They can be stacked on top of each other in xiaomi frame tho
[2021-08-28T19:43:24] Unknown: Wft
[2021-08-28T19:43:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah if frame high enough
[2021-08-28T19:43:37] Unknown: Wtf
[2021-08-28T19:43:46] Artem Bulashev: What?
[2021-08-28T19:43:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol.
[2021-08-28T19:43:51] Unknown: Ohhh shite
[2021-08-28T19:43:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: loooooool
[2021-08-28T19:44:12] Unknown: Guyssss what's going on here
[2021-08-28T19:44:17] Mirono escooters: I rather use holders. Cell hahe better cooling too and sturdier
[2021-08-28T19:44:20] Unknown: Not hot glue
[2021-08-28T19:44:29] Artem Bulashev: Yes hot glue
[2021-08-28T19:44:31] Unknown: Use cell holders
[2021-08-28T19:44:34] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-08-28T19:44:37] Artem Bulashev: Hate them
[2021-08-28T19:44:38] Mirono escooters: And cells heat up, hotglue gets soft
[2021-08-28T19:44:48] Artem Bulashev: Too much wasted space
[2021-08-28T19:44:49] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2021-08-28T19:44:55] Unknown: Use solder fat and between cells soldering
[2021-08-28T19:44:56] Mirono escooters: Honeycomb
[2021-08-28T19:44:58] Mirono escooters: Almost nothing
[2021-08-28T19:45:17] sombre_enfant: Poor method only🙏🏾
[2021-08-28T19:45:40] Artem Bulashev: And I won’t need they take a lot of you compare honeycomb with holders and without
[2021-08-28T19:45:42] Unknown: Fuckkkk i have to make my battery classes
[2021-08-28T19:45:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: up
[2021-08-28T19:45:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yessss !
[2021-08-28T19:45:59] Artem Bulashev: Can you show what you mean?
[2021-08-28T19:46:09] Unknown: I will, but just in generall the wires seem a bit thin
[2021-08-28T19:46:13] Mirono escooters: Honeycomb vs normal I already compared on my fb..
[2021-08-28T19:46:50] Artem Bulashev: Yes that saves quite a bit. But holders vs no holders also massive difference
[2021-08-28T19:47:01] Artem Bulashev: Or me tolerance is already 2mm only
[2021-08-28T19:47:26] Unknown: And why no Nickelstrip????
[2021-08-28T19:47:33] Artem Bulashev: I’m occupying 100% of hight and width and like 95% of width
[2021-08-28T19:47:39] Unknown: Double
[2021-08-28T19:47:40] Artem Bulashev: This is internet photo
[2021-08-28T19:49:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think there is, but very narrow.
[2021-08-28T19:49:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so, do you have a picture how you solder your terminals ? 😁
[2021-08-28T19:49:35] Mirono escooters: Not smort
[2021-08-28T19:49:35] Unknown: Yeah I see it
[2021-08-28T19:50:45] Unknown: Sure but i have to search..... Phone data transfered to PC..
[2021-08-28T19:51:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍👍👍
[2021-08-28T19:54:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: fyi, with a full discharge of 30q at 15A, the cell (at ambiant temperature) reach 80°c
[2021-08-28T19:54:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_887@28-08-2021_19-54-44.jpg>
[2021-08-28T19:54:58] Mirono escooters: Poor cell..
[2021-08-28T19:55:12] Mirono escooters: And hotglue will release. Atleast silicon the batteries together
[2021-08-28T19:55:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: of course, for our usage, it's far from this since it's at 15A only during acceleration pikes.
[2021-08-28T19:58:10] sombre_enfant: Single spinted and dual got same mosfet type/spec ? Still 2 per phase ?
[2021-08-28T19:58:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no idea. i didn't dismantle the single vesc
[2021-08-28T20:01:37] Artem Bulashev: Actually not really there I nickel strip all across parallel assembly, y oh can see left and right ends. It’s just cable soldered as a bus to reduce resistance difference and make amps pull more equal
[2021-08-28T20:02:08] Artem Bulashev: It’s common practice, but execution here is very ugly
[2021-08-28T20:03:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's really difficult to find a picture of a good assembly on the web...
[2021-08-28T20:03:59] Happy Giraffe: I feel its not 1000w motor, more like 700w
[2021-08-28T20:04:17] Mirono escooters: It's still china
[2021-08-28T20:04:33] Happy Giraffe: Speed seems same than Xiaomi esc + monorim 500w
[2021-08-28T20:04:59] Happy Giraffe: But man the vesc upper torque is nice👀
[2021-08-28T20:05:24] Unknown: Now designing 16s5p for internal m365
[2021-08-28T20:05:28] Artem Bulashev: Parameters i gave you were based on 800w estimation
[2021-08-28T20:05:32] Artem Bulashev: But still a bit on high side
[2021-08-28T20:05:35] Happy Giraffe: Was too much haha
[2021-08-28T20:05:36] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2021-08-28T20:05:38] Happy Giraffe: Or...
[2021-08-28T20:05:38] Artem Bulashev: So I guess yeah
[2021-08-28T20:05:48] Happy Giraffe: Maybe the fucked hall sensors interfered
[2021-08-28T20:06:09] Happy Giraffe: Now I came full throttle 40/95A and motor just little warm
[2021-08-28T20:06:43] Unknown: How was the speed??
[2021-08-28T20:07:30] Happy Giraffe: My gps app didnt work, what gps app do you guys use for screen off logging?
[2021-08-28T20:07:36] Mirono escooters: Speedometer
[2021-08-28T20:07:39] Happy Giraffe: I would estimate 45kmh
[2021-08-28T20:07:44] Happy Giraffe: But not sure
[2021-08-28T20:08:31] Happy Giraffe: This?
[2021-08-28T20:10:16] Mirono escooters: No, wait

[2021-08-28T20:11:34] Happy Giraffe: 100 apps named "gps speedometer"😂
[2021-08-28T20:11:52] Mirono escooters: Look at logo :)
[2021-08-28T20:12:01] Mirono escooters: It's 1 of the most downloaded

[2021-08-28T20:14:18] Happy Giraffe: I will do some testing on both when I go for the 1km long straight road that has 3 meter wide bike lane lol
[2021-08-28T20:14:41] Unknown: Geo tracker is nice
[2021-08-28T20:15:10] Mirono escooters: 3m bike Lane.. nice
[2021-08-28T20:15:15] Mirono escooters: Belgium wildest dreams
[2021-08-28T20:15:40] Unknown: ???
[2021-08-28T20:15:57] Happy Giraffe: And one way
[2021-08-28T20:15:57] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-28T20:16:42] Unknown: I hate your 3 meter penis.....
[2021-08-28T20:17:04] Happy Giraffe: I got 1000w chinesium motor, frear me
[2021-08-28T20:19:47] sombre_enfant: Google gps or waze gps have good speedometer...
[2021-08-28T20:20:51] sombre_enfant: Its 36mm taths the prob... But on ebay theres a real 1000w with 45mm magnet for 180€
[2021-08-28T20:28:13] Happy Giraffe: I thought also about Vsett motor 🤔
[2021-08-28T20:28:32] Happy Giraffe: But this is fine, a bit more kv wouldn't hurt tho
[2021-08-28T20:32:50] sombre_enfant: Go to an hm motor u will get the best with best kv/torque
[2021-08-28T20:35:12] Happy Giraffe: Hm?
[2021-08-28T20:35:38] sombre_enfant: The brand who do motor for haloknight and some other beast
[2021-08-28T20:35:52] Happy Giraffe: Aah, haven't heard of those
[2021-08-28T20:36:12] sombre_enfant: 2800w version go 64kph freewheel on 36v with ninebot esc
[2021-08-28T20:37:20] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but need on load test haha
[2021-08-28T20:37:36] Happy Giraffe: The chinese esc I had made 65kmh air 35kmh on ground
[2021-08-28T20:37:41] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-28T20:37:44] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2021-08-28T20:37:50] Mirono escooters: I like super high torque low kv
[2021-08-28T20:38:18] Happy Giraffe: I will measure my top speed soon, but I would like 50kmh atleast
[2021-08-28T20:38:19] Mirono escooters: With field weakening u have best of both Super high torque And still decent speed
[2021-08-28T20:38:31] Happy Giraffe: But weaking is so amp hungry
[2021-08-28T20:38:36] Mirono escooters: 45-50kmh I like, higher is suicide in Belgium
[2021-08-28T20:39:08] Mirono escooters: Fair. I'd like a button on mine. To switch on off. When I have loads of batt and I wanna get quick to somewhere not far🤔
[2021-08-28T20:39:40] Happy Giraffe: You would want deltaswitch instead
[2021-08-28T20:39:55] Mirono escooters: Fair enough
[2021-08-28T20:40:18] Happy Giraffe: Atleast thats what I would think would be better
[2021-08-28T20:45:48] sombre_enfant: Theres no weakening on vesc
[2021-08-28T20:50:34] Happy Giraffe: Some yt videos claim they have lol
[2021-08-28T20:50:44] Happy Giraffe: Havent watched as its waste of time
[2021-08-28T20:51:29] Mirono escooters: Not yet..😀
[2021-08-28T20:52:03] Artem Bulashev: Me too don’t need to go above 50km, but want it at any battery level
[2021-08-28T20:53:06] Artem Bulashev: On 5.3 beta it is working alrwady 8kmh+ on 20a extra
[2021-08-28T20:53:53] Happy Giraffe: How is vsett motor?
[2021-08-28T20:54:24] Happy Giraffe: I tried to search vsett group for info but failed lol
[2021-08-28T20:55:27] Happy Giraffe: I wonder what speed does Vsett 9 motor do at 48v instead of 52v
[2021-08-28T21:00:21] Mirono escooters: Thats noice
[2021-08-28T21:02:56] Artem Bulashev: 9 is single but 52v = 48kmh 9+ is dual but 48v = 52kmh
[2021-08-28T21:03:25] Artem Bulashev: Motor is same
[2021-08-28T21:03:43] Artem Bulashev: I run now dual on 52v = 58kmh
[2021-08-28T21:04:04] Artem Bulashev: On 90/17a rear and 80/13a front
[2021-08-28T21:09:05] Happy Giraffe: Hmm I see, that should be similar kv to what I have now
[2021-08-28T21:09:36] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if there's a good motor that would do 55kmh on 48v with disc holder
[2021-08-28T21:10:33] Mirono escooters: Sure possible
[2021-08-28T21:11:21] Happy Giraffe: I should be just happy with this "1000w" tho
[2021-08-28T21:12:07] sombre_enfant: Its their own hardware and modded firmware not spinted...
[2021-08-28T21:12:31] Happy Giraffe: Haha, yes I haven't watched
[2021-08-28T21:12:55] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but those are 8.5 inch wheels
[2021-08-28T21:13:09] sombre_enfant: But it will work a day somehow but idj how the hardware will handle
[2021-08-28T21:13:16] Artem Bulashev: So kv is about 15% higher
[2021-08-28T21:13:57] Happy Giraffe: What about the torque and phase amp side?
[2021-08-28T21:14:07] Artem Bulashev: I think some one here on Russin vesc group bought Vsett 10+ wheel for custom frame
[2021-08-28T21:14:36] sombre_enfant: XiaoDash seems to works but its not enough amps of weakening... But if xiaomi hardware can do it every controller can...
[2021-08-28T21:14:46] Artem Bulashev: Because they have great torque and good top speed of 74kmh on 35a battery contorller
[2021-08-28T21:15:23] sombre_enfant: Get hm motor 3000w🙂
[2021-08-28T21:15:30] Mirono escooters: True
[2021-08-28T21:15:42] Mirono escooters: Where that fits lmao
[2021-08-28T21:16:38] sombre_enfant: G30 frame can so front inverted monorim should or any big scooter frame not toy
[2021-08-28T21:17:06] Mirono escooters: Rlly g30? Nice
[2021-08-28T21:17:11] sombre_enfant: Yup
[2021-08-28T21:17:12] Mirono escooters: How expensive is it doe
[2021-08-28T21:17:18] sombre_enfant: 200
[2021-08-28T21:17:33] Happy Giraffe: 74kmh on which voltage?👀
[2021-08-28T21:17:39] sombre_enfant: And u buy tire apart 11"
[2021-08-28T21:18:07] Mirono escooters: 11" will feel like riding down
[2021-08-28T21:18:09] sombre_enfant: Its the motor on big 6000w/ 5600w scooter
[2021-08-28T21:18:30] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2021-08-28T21:18:36] sombre_enfant: U can put 10"...
[2021-08-28T21:18:39] Mirono escooters: I got a 11" 5600w motor on my shelf. Lol
[2021-08-28T21:19:05] Mirono escooters: Will check tomorrow. I got it in parts lot. No idea what's wrong with it. Ig hall sensors
[2021-08-28T21:19:11] sombre_enfant: Look for inside not branding...
[2021-08-28T21:19:33] Mirono escooters: It's minimotors. I trust em
[2021-08-28T21:20:10] Mirono escooters: Got som 48v500w from kugoo too. Idk what else
[2021-08-28T21:20:25] Mirono escooters: Ur making me upgrade again if that motor works. Damn you😅
[2021-08-28T21:24:37] Artem Bulashev: 16s
[2021-08-28T21:24:40] Artem Bulashev: 60v
[2021-08-28T21:24:55] sombre_enfant: Tell wich motor u got to face de pin sucé he know the motor so he will tell u wich one the best...
[2021-08-28T21:25:02] Happy Giraffe: I will be seriously undervolting it then
[2021-08-28T21:25:35] Mirono escooters: Alrighty. Idk if it even works lol. Have to test whole lot
[2021-08-28T21:32:47] Happy Giraffe: 13s should go then 60kmh🤔 If it's linear
[2021-08-28T21:33:11] Mirono escooters: Vroom
[2021-08-28T21:33:22] Mirono escooters: Not when batt is depleted xd
[2021-08-28T21:33:32] Happy Giraffe: Then still 45 ish
[2021-08-28T21:33:33] Mirono escooters: That sucks with 13s, at low soc
[2021-08-28T22:04:37] Happy Giraffe: Lol 45kmh
[2021-08-28T22:15:06] Happy Giraffe: Next was 48kmh with little uphill, seems gps not precise
[2021-08-28T22:16:35] Happy Giraffe: The race timer didn't even wanna start
[2021-08-28T22:36:59] Happy Giraffe: How is the axle and the mounting of the Vsett 10+ motor?🤔 Are they sold for reasonable price?
[2021-08-28T22:40:56] Mirono escooters: Didn't tudor get em aswell
[2021-08-28T22:41:49] Artem Bulashev: I got minen for 100€ in Eu from distributor, but I think retail price is 150€ for that motor at very least
[2021-08-28T22:42:02] Artem Bulashev: 10+ must be more expensive
[2021-08-28T22:42:07] Artem Bulashev: AliExpress should have them
[2021-08-28T22:47:11] Happy Giraffe: HM 1600w😂
[2021-08-28T22:58:42] Happy Giraffe: Vsett store has the gay 150€ shipping prices
[2021-08-28T23:01:35] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-08-28T23:01:41] Artem Bulashev: 150€ nuts
[2021-08-28T23:01:46] Artem Bulashev: I got free shipping
[2021-08-28T23:01:56] Artem Bulashev: If you want I can ask him how much to sell
[2021-08-28T23:03:52] Artem Bulashev: Yey :)) now need to get lost package with copper and nickel 👀 it has been in vienna central post office for 5 days and didn’t move to my post office since (10km away) 🤣
[2021-08-28T23:23:57] Happy Giraffe: This means in order to put tire you can just take it in half?
[2021-08-28T23:24:11] Happy Giraffe: Yes, it would be cool thanks!
[2021-08-28T23:33:16] sombre_enfant: Yes same thing on 180€ ebay motor with 45mm magnet and 3.0, tuvot tire
[2021-08-29T00:17:11] Happy Giraffe: I think Im gonna buy this vsett if I get free shipping. If it has more torque and speed than 1000w chinesium with broken hall why in the hecc should I even bother with that?😂
[2021-08-29T00:29:41] Artem Bulashev: Yes 👌 called split rim. Tube can be replaced from other side without disconnecting motor wires and disk brake also can be replaced without 👌 Only tier change will require to unscrew few screws on the motor wire interconnection 😊
[2021-08-29T00:30:34] Artem Bulashev: Oh that thing does 130a at 50a battery without heating up much at all 😂
[2021-08-29T00:31:08] Artem Bulashev: 1400w nominal. Max is around 2800-3000w
[2021-08-29T00:31:15] Artem Bulashev: On 60v
[2021-08-29T00:31:26] Artem Bulashev: Btw it requires 60v battery
[2021-08-29T00:32:07] Artem Bulashev: If you install it with 48v battery it will have lower top speed. Not sure it will work well for 48v
[2021-08-29T00:38:49] Happy Giraffe: Hmm
[2021-08-29T00:41:17] Happy Giraffe: Will be so nice to monitor the amps, seems like vesc only gives the 95a phase sometimes. Not on every acceleration
[2021-08-29T00:41:50] Happy Giraffe: Sometimes its bit slower start and 50% it gives crazy boost on 20kmh
[2021-08-29T00:44:43] Artem Bulashev: I just realised my vsett9 turned from 950€ into 2215€ + extras …..
[2021-08-29T00:44:45] Artem Bulashev: 🤣
[2021-08-29T00:44:50] Artem Bulashev: Don’t tell my wife
[2021-08-29T00:48:11] Happy Giraffe: Lol, my 408€ Xiaomi is about 1600-1700€ now
[2021-08-29T00:48:50] Happy Giraffe: But 48v45Ah will travel me far with comfort
[2021-08-29T00:59:25] Artem Bulashev: Than I’m def a lot more efficient haha :)
[2021-08-29T00:59:38] Artem Bulashev: 45ah? 😅😅
[2021-08-29T01:02:18] Happy Giraffe: Yes with Rita 20.7Ah internal and 24Ah external😎
[2021-08-29T01:03:03] Happy Giraffe: Connecting then parallel would give nice amps for 2000w motors
[2021-08-29T01:13:19] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-08-29T01:27:09] Happy Giraffe: Zero 100% original motor but picture shows kaabo mantis😂😂😂
[2021-08-29T01:27:32] Happy Giraffe: I definitely would want to buy the vsett motor throught your contacts if possible lol
[2021-08-29T01:31:07] Happy Giraffe: Vsett 10 50mm magnets sound too good, hope it would work with 48v
[2021-08-29T02:04:49] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_897@29-08-2021_02-04-49.jpg>
[2021-08-29T02:05:09] Luis Magalhaes: Will this work or will he burn 2 stormcore?
[2021-08-29T02:05:11] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-08-29T02:05:15] Artem Bulashev: Yes will do👌
[2021-08-29T02:05:37] Luis Magalhaes: It looks he wants to use a dual esc in 1 motor
[2021-08-29T02:05:49] Artem Bulashev: That’s preaty bad idea
[2021-08-29T02:05:57] Artem Bulashev: Sync will be difficult
[2021-08-29T02:06:17] Artem Bulashev: Unless there is dedicated design solution to run them this way
[2021-08-29T02:06:48] Artem Bulashev: He may end up loosing sync and getting -180 phase going full speed
[2021-08-29T02:07:06] Artem Bulashev: That = -100% phase amps 😄
[2021-08-29T02:07:22] Artem Bulashev: = death
[2021-08-29T02:08:59] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂 so not just burn esc but burned body's
[2021-08-29T10:58:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think it will burn. mosfets commutations aren't synced between the cores of the vesc.
[2021-08-29T11:00:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 2 burnt stormcores. 💸💸💸
[2021-08-29T11:14:40] Mirono escooters: 100€? steal
[2021-08-29T11:26:06] Artem Bulashev: 🔥🔥🔥🔥
[2021-08-29T11:26:33] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 🙂
[2021-08-29T11:33:04] Happy Giraffe: I asked Vsett store in AE would 13s work with 10+ motor and they said no. Not sure if they understood that I expect lower speeds 🙈
[2021-08-29T11:34:39] Mirono escooters: Y wouldn't it work
[2021-08-29T11:36:54] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_898@29-08-2021_11-36-54.jpg>
[2021-08-29T11:37:14] Happy Giraffe: No idea...chinese office guys...
[2021-08-29T11:37:16] sombre_enfant: It does but not at good spec
[2021-08-29T11:37:41] Happy Giraffe: "sad noises"
[2021-08-29T11:39:39] Artem Bulashev: I would not expect anything else from AE store manager
[2021-08-29T11:40:22] Happy Giraffe: Who would know it then? 😂
[2021-08-29T11:40:47] Happy Giraffe: Hard to get engineer in a call haha
[2021-08-29T11:42:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol
[2021-08-29T11:43:12] Mirono escooters: Considering my chats with flipsky.. wrong mosfet name and not knowing phase amps.. 🙈
[2021-08-29T11:45:50] Artem Bulashev: It will work
[2021-08-29T11:45:56] Artem Bulashev: Just slower speed
[2021-08-29T11:46:38] Happy Giraffe: Tbh I expected more from Vsett than Flipsky😂
[2021-08-29T11:47:44] Happy Giraffe: We need to be sure before I slap 200€ for it😅 But bigger magnets should give me more torque when using like 95A phase?
[2021-08-29T11:48:13] Happy Giraffe: Quote from Francois S: here is my full comparison, going from right to left, 300w pro, 500w monorim, 1000w wheelway stator diameter: 300w 10cm 500w 11cm 1000w 10,5cm wire thickness: 300w 0.5mm 500w 0.7mm 1000w 1mm 👀 magnet thickness: 300w 3cm 500w 2.7cm 1000w 3,6cm 👀
[2021-08-29T11:49:10] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know if you will get more torque at same settings
[2021-08-29T11:49:10] Unknown: Is'nt it that when you run a 60v motor at 48 that it's working inefficient, wich would cause You to use more wh and cause more heat
[2021-08-29T11:49:33] Artem Bulashev: Only if you try to get to same max speed
[2021-08-29T11:49:47] Artem Bulashev: Same amps will get you lower top speed
[2021-08-29T11:49:52] Artem Bulashev: Proportionally
[2021-08-29T11:50:08] Happy Giraffe: As Vsett motor is higher Kv it should be opposite for me maybe
[2021-08-29T11:50:28] Artem Bulashev: Compared to yours ?
[2021-08-29T11:50:55] Happy Giraffe: Yes the 1000w wheelway, does 50kmh on fully charged 13s
[2021-08-29T11:51:11] Mirono escooters: I want 1000w now lol
[2021-08-29T11:51:23] Mirono escooters: 1200w is good tho, but kv a tiny bit less then I'd like
[2021-08-29T11:51:56] Artem Bulashev: 45kmh / 13s = 3.46kmh/s 72kmh / 16s = 4.5kmh/s *13 = 58kmh
[2021-08-29T11:52:21] Happy Giraffe: Also would be nice as I wouldn't need to worry overheating vsett motor
[2021-08-29T11:52:32] Artem Bulashev: So I would estimate your top speed to be about 55-58kmh on 13s on 30-35amp battery
[2021-08-29T11:52:41] Artem Bulashev: That you won’t that motor can handle full Ubox power
[2021-08-29T11:52:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-29T11:53:13] Happy Giraffe: Now it's on the edge I can't push it too much
[2021-08-29T12:07:33] Unknown: I'm just wondering if i'm going to get this motor up to like 120-150 amp phase with statorade (only for short periods of time) wich is why i'm gonna place a temp sensor 😂
[2021-08-29T12:07:48] Unknown: So i can keep it below 60°
[2021-08-29T12:08:10] Unknown: I think yes...
[2021-08-29T12:08:40] Unknown: Temp sensor inside motor or on controller???
[2021-08-29T12:09:26] Unknown: Motor for sure, i think vesc has it's own sensor
[2021-08-29T12:10:37] Unknown: Batts wil get a temp sensor too, i dont worry about them too much tho, 4p molicel p42a. Will get an 80a bms, so 20a continuous max per batt
[2021-08-29T12:22:37] Happy Giraffe: FOC makes a funny sound at max rpm
[2021-08-29T12:23:09] francois schempers: foc doesn't have a max rpm, once it's to fast it switch to bldc
[2021-08-29T12:23:16] Happy Giraffe: Especially with wet road it will go brr
[2021-08-29T12:23:26] francois schempers: that's bldc
[2021-08-29T12:23:36] Happy Giraffe: But I got no hall👀
[2021-08-29T12:24:53] francois schempers: that's what it means, bldc is brushless direct current, no hall needed
[2021-08-29T12:25:03] Happy Giraffe: Aah lol
[2021-08-29T12:25:09] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-29T12:25:11] francois schempers: xD
[2021-08-29T12:25:55] Happy Giraffe: Then also it must use back emf or something
[2021-08-29T12:26:14] Happy Giraffe: I wanna try HFI when I get bt
[2021-08-29T12:26:49] Happy Giraffe: Motor making terminator sounds on startup will scare stock xiaomi pheasants
[2021-08-29T12:26:59] Unknown: 😂😂😂
[2021-08-29T12:27:36] Unknown: They be like 😱😱😨😬 that my scoot's daddy? 🥺
[2021-08-29T12:27:55] Happy Giraffe: "Come with Vesc if you wanna live"
[2021-08-29T12:28:29] Unknown: 😂😂 my aunt was looking at me like i was about to blow shit up when i turned on foc detection 😂😂
[2021-08-29T12:30:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ???? first time ear that. are you sure ? any source ? for me, it can't be possible. change from sensored to sensorless, yes. but to bldc, never seen that (field weaking wouldn't even be possible). in any firmware i've analyzed, no such transition either.
[2021-08-29T12:30:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: foc compute id/iq even at high speed.
[2021-08-29T12:32:27] francois schempers: hum I don't know where I saw that, I was sure foc sensored couldn't handle high speed, nvm if that's not the case ^^
[2021-08-29T12:32:58] Face de Pin Sucé: There's a feature to sync both dual, because there's only one MCU per board (like Unity) so, yes it is fully working, but hell expansive
[2021-08-29T12:33:08] Happy Giraffe: How dare you to call my FOC slow!
[2021-08-29T12:33:27] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_899@29-08-2021_12-33-27.jpg>
[2021-08-29T12:33:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: completly true, sensors can't follow on fast rotation. it swith to sensorless and estimate position based on current sensing and backemf 😁
[2021-08-29T12:34:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳
[2021-08-29T12:36:08] Face de Pin Sucé: If you search, you'll find something about Unity running one motor with both controllers, it's only possible because of one MCU running the two powerboards
[2021-08-29T12:36:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahhhh ok ! understood, same stm, yes !
[2021-08-29T12:37:40] Happy Giraffe: And mine is FOC sensorless as Mr. Wang sent me a defective motor😂
[2021-08-29T12:38:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, and Stormcore is same design, so it's working
[2021-08-29T12:38:48] francois schempers: but isn't senseless basically bldc ?
[2021-08-29T12:39:25] Happy Giraffe: Its really quiet tho
[2021-08-29T13:19:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope
[2021-08-29T13:19:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Bldc is a type of signal
[2021-08-29T13:19:40] Face de Pin Sucé: You can have BLDC with sensors
[2021-08-29T13:44:58] Artem Bulashev: No no man
[2021-08-29T13:45:05] Artem Bulashev: It is still FOC
[2021-08-29T13:45:39] Artem Bulashev: But senseless - position of the rotor is extrapolated without sensors. This is possible once rpm is high enough
[2021-08-29T13:46:06] Happy Giraffe: Vesc does that from walking speed already👀
[2021-08-29T13:46:14] Happy Giraffe: Its insanely smooth
[2021-08-29T13:46:35] Happy Giraffe: Maybe less torque (from start) but hey it makes my broken motor work
[2021-08-29T13:46:38] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-29T13:47:31] Artem Bulashev: Bldc on and off - no modulation at all
[2021-08-29T13:47:59] Happy Giraffe: Did bldc require hall all the time?
[2021-08-29T13:48:06] Artem Bulashev: No idea
[2021-08-29T13:48:08] Artem Bulashev: https://electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-difference-between-motors-commutation-bldc-vs-foc-trapeziodal-sinosuidal/3002
[2021-08-29T13:48:16] Artem Bulashev: Read here some good read
[2021-08-29T13:49:30] Happy Giraffe: BLDC = Machine gun FOC = Laser cannon
[2021-08-29T13:51:32] Artem Bulashev: https://www.ti.com/lit/ml/slyp711/slyp711.pdf?ts=1630205683976
[2021-08-29T13:51:36] Happy Giraffe: And as FOC has slightly less topspeed I could say now the wheelway 1000w motor has more kv than 500w monorim. 45kmh on monorim with xiaomi bldc and 50kmh on wheelway with FOC
[2021-08-29T13:51:40] Artem Bulashev: Also interesting presentation.
[2021-08-29T13:52:04] Happy Giraffe: Do you think we should care about HFI?
[2021-08-29T13:52:19] Happy Giraffe: Could it compensate for lack of hall in the start?
[2021-08-29T13:52:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-08-29T13:54:33] Happy Giraffe: Does it consume more power only when starting up or does it have some background consumption?
[2021-08-29T13:55:13] Happy Giraffe: It seems to require calibration with BackEMF so I will need to wait for BT module
[2021-08-29T13:55:52] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't know
[2021-08-29T13:57:37] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know anything about hFI
[2021-08-29T13:58:44] Artem Bulashev: https://forum.esk8.news/t/vesc-tool-2-0-and-firmware-4-0-the-beginning-of-a-new-era-serious/18881/195 video link
[2021-08-29T14:00:14] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-29T14:00:25] Happy Giraffe: That I linked yesterday
[2021-08-29T14:02:07] Happy Giraffe: My motor resistance values are like 25% to each other so it should work great on scooter motor, time to soon find out I guess
[2021-08-29T14:13:59] Happy Giraffe: Luis Maybe you might also wanna try HFI
[2021-08-29T14:27:53] Happy Giraffe: Anti-blinding lid with some alu foil to reflect the light going into sky back to road. Time to test the bad boy😂
[2021-08-29T14:31:18] Unknown: Let me know the results of that please 😂
[2021-08-29T14:32:15] Happy Giraffe: It blinds much less when I set it pointing far on road, will do some video
[2021-08-29T15:15:34] Luis Magalhaes: Not good 😂
[2021-08-29T15:20:57] Luis Magalhaes: Have tried but cant adjust it 😅
[2021-08-29T15:58:51] Happy Giraffe: Yes you can👀
[2021-08-29T15:59:06] Happy Giraffe: You can set the voltage of the signals
[2021-08-29T15:59:32] Happy Giraffe: And see with mapping how it creates the sinewave
[2021-08-29T16:19:18] Luis Magalhaes: Have to have more time of testing😅 it was screaming like a crazy wolf 😂😂😂
[2021-08-29T16:19:58] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-08-29T16:41:05] Happy Giraffe: Vesc went completely dead now
[2021-08-29T16:41:18] Happy Giraffe: Like what the actual fuck is this unreliability
[2021-08-29T16:41:58] Happy Giraffe: I felt one knock from motor when accelerating and then even power button has no light
[2021-08-29T16:42:01] Mirono escooters: Wich vesc
[2021-08-29T16:42:07] Happy Giraffe: Spintend single
[2021-08-29T16:42:17] Mirono escooters: Wich powa
[2021-08-29T16:42:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ohhhh crap
[2021-08-29T16:42:20] Mirono escooters: Maybe batt shutted off
[2021-08-29T16:43:06] Happy Giraffe: 35A bms handled 50A easy
[2021-08-29T16:43:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what exactly did you do ? powered with battery ? plugged to computer ? testing what ?
[2021-08-29T16:43:14] Happy Giraffe: Now I had 40A
[2021-08-29T16:43:27] Happy Giraffe: I accelerated from traffic lights
[2021-08-29T16:43:32] Happy Giraffe: Felt one knock
[2021-08-29T16:43:43] Happy Giraffe: Then all quiet, no sign of life
[2021-08-29T16:43:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh ! you were riding ?!!
[2021-08-29T16:44:06] Happy Giraffe: Yes, luckily not far from home
[2021-08-29T16:44:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: how much phase current ?
[2021-08-29T16:44:19] Happy Giraffe: 95A
[2021-08-29T16:44:21] sombre_enfant: Cheh wola
[2021-08-29T16:44:57] Happy Giraffe: So stupid I did everything correctly....
[2021-08-29T16:45:08] Happy Giraffe: Worked for two days
[2021-08-29T16:45:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: weird...
[2021-08-29T16:45:25] Luis Magalhaes: I had that
[2021-08-29T16:45:31] Happy Giraffe: How?
[2021-08-29T16:45:33] Luis Magalhaes: But it was the battery
[2021-08-29T16:45:40] Happy Giraffe: Bms?
[2021-08-29T16:46:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the hard part for vescs is installation/cabling. after that, if you don't exceed specs, it's pretty reliable.
[2021-08-29T16:46:01] Luis Magalhaes: Had to disconnect it all wait and connect again and it turned on again 😅
[2021-08-29T16:46:04] Luis Magalhaes: Ya
[2021-08-29T16:46:05] Happy Giraffe: I used 40A batt on xiaomi for 2000kilmeters
[2021-08-29T16:46:07] Luis Magalhaes: Yes
[2021-08-29T16:46:20] Happy Giraffe: So 40A nothing new
[2021-08-29T16:46:31] Mirono escooters: I think battery aswell
[2021-08-29T16:46:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you have a power supply or another battery, try it
[2021-08-29T16:47:10] Happy Giraffe: Its stupid, battery does 50A easy
[2021-08-29T16:47:11] Luis Magalhaes: Check if bms is on and disconect the esc wait 5 minutes and connect it again
[2021-08-29T16:47:24] Happy Giraffe: Bms wrapped inside
[2021-08-29T16:47:45] Mirono escooters: Just disconnect and see if it outputs v🤔
[2021-08-29T16:47:49] Happy Giraffe: I guess I open deck, disconnect batt and wait
[2021-08-29T16:47:52] Mirono escooters: Could b triggering overcurrent or unfervoltage
[2021-08-29T16:47:54] Luis Magalhaes: Check xt conection
[2021-08-29T16:48:37] Artem Bulashev: When BMS shuts off it can kill controller
[2021-08-29T16:48:53] Happy Giraffe: Why would it shut off at 40A?
[2021-08-29T16:49:07] Happy Giraffe: I used that for a year now
[2021-08-29T16:49:10] Luis Magalhaes: Why? Back emf?
[2021-08-29T16:50:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1000
[2021-08-29T16:50:24] Artem Bulashev: Possible that xiaomi actually was not able to pull more. Vesc can have battery current spike up quite high
[2021-08-29T16:50:41] Artem Bulashev: On regen though. Not on discharge (acceleration)
[2021-08-29T16:50:45] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi pulled exactly 40A
[2021-08-29T16:50:50] Happy Giraffe: Measured with meter
[2021-08-29T16:50:56] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-08-29T16:51:15] Happy Giraffe: If vesc is damaged I'm mad af😂
[2021-08-29T16:51:53] Happy Giraffe: Also power wires are 12AWG with xt60 so no problem there
[2021-08-29T16:53:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, we fried an power supply & controller like that. we repriduced the issue : spinning at 60v, then power cut... backemf when up to 100v... the xiaomi controller fried instantly.
[2021-08-29T16:53:42] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2021-08-29T16:53:59] Happy Giraffe: It was spinning maybe 10v
[2021-08-29T16:54:02] Happy Giraffe: 10kmh
[2021-08-29T16:54:23] Happy Giraffe: So should not be fatal then?
[2021-08-29T16:54:53] Luis Magalhaes: But you it break when you dont accelerate?
[2021-08-29T16:55:27] Happy Giraffe: How is all this possible tho? 35A Daly bms should do 40A easy
[2021-08-29T16:55:32] Luis Magalhaes: Or just for the motor rotation you get bemf to phases?
[2021-08-29T16:55:46] Happy Giraffe: 20A Daly bms does 30-35
[2021-08-29T16:55:52] Artem Bulashev: In theory unlikely, or much less likely to die if battery cuts of during acceleration (discharge)
[2021-08-29T16:56:19] Luis Magalhaes: My cut had been acelerating
[2021-08-29T16:56:49] Artem Bulashev: But when power is lost, MCU can miss-behave for split second and shit can go wrong
[2021-08-29T16:56:56] Luis Magalhaes: The parallel battery was not discharging so i hit the max ampa from the other battery above 70kmh
[2021-08-29T16:57:07] Luis Magalhaes: And giving more throtlle
[2021-08-29T16:57:34] Artem Bulashev: But less likely than during regen- because there you get 100% chance of backEMF going all suddenly into fets and possibly destroying them
[2021-08-29T16:57:35] Luis Magalhaes: Maybe theres why o had to disconnect the ubox 😂
[2021-08-29T16:57:38] Luis Magalhaes: Bemf
[2021-08-29T16:58:00] Happy Giraffe: How would I prevent this from happening again?
[2021-08-29T16:58:03] Luis Magalhaes: 👍
[2021-08-29T16:58:12] Happy Giraffe: There's no reason it happened in first place
[2021-08-29T16:58:18] Artem Bulashev: Depends what really happened
[2021-08-29T16:58:31] Happy Giraffe: I only rode 1km
[2021-08-29T16:59:06] Artem Bulashev: Mesure voltage of the battery on main connector without disconnecting controller (poke through isolation or find a spot)
[2021-08-29T16:59:09] Happy Giraffe: Then at traffic lights I accelerated 10khm and felt a knock on motor. Then all went dead
[2021-08-29T16:59:18] Artem Bulashev: Than disconnect and check again on main power lead.
[2021-08-29T16:59:35] Happy Giraffe: I don't wanna open the battery in any way tho, not my expertiece
[2021-08-29T16:59:35] Artem Bulashev: Than put it on charger for 5sec and disconnect. Check voltage on main lead again
[2021-08-29T16:59:47] Artem Bulashev: It is not needed
[2021-08-29T17:00:18] Happy Giraffe: But poking holes? 😅😂
[2021-08-29T17:03:43] Happy Giraffe: I will try to find a spot
[2021-08-29T17:09:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah can use needle or needle type of heads for multimeter 👌
[2021-08-29T17:12:10] Happy Giraffe: I measured it from parallel charge cable
[2021-08-29T17:12:19] Happy Giraffe: Something 0.4v
[2021-08-29T17:12:31] Happy Giraffe: When testing in 20v DC mode
[2021-08-29T17:13:28] Happy Giraffe: Now I'm opening up the deck
[2021-08-29T17:16:39] Happy Giraffe: Nothing out of normal here, everything is cool and no smell of burnin
[2021-08-29T17:17:41] Happy Giraffe: But for some reason there is water wtf
[2021-08-29T17:21:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://youtu.be/83O2Il6Hc5U
[2021-08-29T17:22:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: shit, you're right @SibClimb !
[2021-08-29T17:22:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: therenisba firmware for that 😁
[2021-08-29T17:22:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but only if you share the same stm32 for both sides
[2021-08-29T17:28:35] Happy Giraffe: Phasewires ok, no sign pf anything else than moisture outside of the power cable from batt
[2021-08-29T17:28:44] Happy Giraffe: Might be condensation
[2021-08-29T17:30:16] Happy Giraffe: Battery output is 50v, thank god no problem there
[2021-08-29T17:31:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Were you using vesc in canbus ?
[2021-08-29T17:31:37] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm always right, you'll learn 😏😁
[2021-08-29T17:36:33] Happy Giraffe: I have only one vesc
[2021-08-29T17:36:46] Happy Giraffe: One vesc one motor
[2021-08-29T17:40:17] Happy Giraffe: Vesc went kaboom
[2021-08-29T17:40:30] Happy Giraffe: Connected battery to it, had sparks inside vesc and then I disconnected it
[2021-08-29T17:40:37] Happy Giraffe: Rip 130€
[2021-08-29T17:43:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Weird
[2021-08-29T17:43:15] Happy Giraffe: How can small moisture kill it this easy? Its on the roof of the deck so only small moisture would get there
[2021-08-29T17:43:53] DNP: I feel you 😢
[2021-08-29T17:43:56] Happy Giraffe: Scooter also fully sealed in silicone
[2021-08-29T17:44:08] Happy Giraffe: No idea how this is possible at the slightest
[2021-08-29T17:47:53] Luis Magalhaes: Ubox dual don't right?
[2021-08-29T17:48:28] Luis Magalhaes: 😂💪
[2021-08-29T17:48:55] Luis Magalhaes: Dammm 😅
[2021-08-29T17:50:56] Happy Giraffe: Next time I will need to put silicone all over the vesc casing it seems
[2021-08-29T17:54:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly
[2021-08-29T17:55:13] Luis Magalhaes: Was not planning to use dual x2 ubox dont have battery for that all 😂
[2021-08-29T18:00:16] Happy Giraffe: Inside out siliconed charge port
[2021-08-29T18:00:16] Happy Giraffe: Cables soaked in silicone all the way so water wont go down throught them. Also used rubber cutout soaked in silicone...😂
[2021-08-29T18:02:01] Happy Giraffe: And then I end up finding water droplets inside🙈
[2021-08-29T18:05:55] Mirono escooters: Jezus fuck that's siliconed good
[2021-08-29T18:07:52] Luis Magalhaes: But did you ride on water?
[2021-08-29T18:08:08] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2021-08-29T18:08:16] Happy Giraffe: I always have during last two years
[2021-08-29T18:08:39] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_904@29-08-2021_18-08-39.jpg>
[2021-08-29T18:08:41] Happy Giraffe: Kapofffff
[2021-08-29T18:09:01] Happy Giraffe: The chip side seems fine
[2021-08-29T18:09:03] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2021-08-29T18:12:48] Happy Giraffe: This also looks ok
[2021-08-29T18:16:02] Happy Giraffe: I just wonder if any TV / Radio repair guy could get these components to solder
[2021-08-29T18:16:14] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2021-08-29T18:16:23] Mirono escooters: I do that microsoldering all the time
[2021-08-29T18:16:33] Mirono escooters: Hope nothing else is fucked
[2021-08-29T18:16:48] Happy Giraffe: Then I will call places and take the vesc with me👍
[2021-08-29T18:17:10] Mirono escooters: Oki, isit open source :? So u kno wich component iyis
[2021-08-29T18:17:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: can you take a picture where we could seen the reference please ?
[2021-08-29T18:17:38] Happy Giraffe: With reference you mean?
[2021-08-29T18:17:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh sorry, the mosfets.
[2021-08-29T18:19:18] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_906@29-08-2021_18-19-18.jpg>
[2021-08-29T18:19:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thanks, but i can't read anything 😅
[2021-08-29T18:19:59] Happy Giraffe: Ok I try better

[2021-08-29T18:33:18] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_907@29-08-2021_18-33-18.jpg>
[2021-08-29T18:33:22] Happy Giraffe: If you need anything else just ask, I have no warranty as I opened and it wont work so Im up for sacrifice
[2021-08-29T18:33:32] Artem Bulashev: Was not water
[2021-08-29T18:33:37] Artem Bulashev: Solder ball
[2021-08-29T18:33:41] Happy Giraffe: What the heck
[2021-08-29T18:33:54] Happy Giraffe: You are right
[2021-08-29T18:33:58] Artem Bulashev: Did you solder Anything near by vesc?
[2021-08-29T18:34:03] Happy Giraffe: Nope
[2021-08-29T18:34:08] Artem Bulashev: Than defect
[2021-08-29T18:34:13] Happy Giraffe: Vesc was in box covered
[2021-08-29T18:34:14] Happy Giraffe: Yessss
[2021-08-29T18:34:21] Happy Giraffe: Warranty time it seems
[2021-08-29T18:34:25] Artem Bulashev: You are welcome
[2021-08-29T18:34:27] Artem Bulashev: 😘
[2021-08-29T18:34:39] Happy Giraffe: I love you Artem😘
[2021-08-29T18:34:43] Happy Giraffe: Nohomo
[2021-08-29T18:34:58] Artem Bulashev: that’s why I always open and check before plugging in :)
[2021-08-29T18:35:16] Happy Giraffe: I didnt as I didnt want problem with cooling or anything haha
[2021-08-29T18:35:29] Happy Giraffe: Thermal pads work best I think when not opened
[2021-08-29T18:35:55] Artem Bulashev: I was doing lost of soldering right on top of Ubox
[2021-08-29T18:35:58] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2021-08-29T18:36:16] Artem Bulashev: And before plugging in decided to inspect.
[2021-08-29T18:36:28] Happy Giraffe: I will contact Amy from Spintend, shall I just say that scooter stopped working and I saw ball of solder inside when opened.
[2021-08-29T18:36:42] Artem Bulashev: - phase wires, temp sensor 6 wires - power wires 2 - phase motor wires 6 wires
[2021-08-29T18:37:05] Artem Bulashev: So glad I opened it completely and checked all through
[2021-08-29T18:37:28] Happy Giraffe: I soldered everything in differerent place as I didnt directly do anything, not even the phases
[2021-08-29T18:37:36] Happy Giraffe: Damn, smort
[2021-08-29T18:38:10] Happy Giraffe: I am lucky, defect motor, defect vesc
[2021-08-29T18:38:19] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_908@29-08-2021_18-38-19.jpg>
[2021-08-29T18:38:21] Happy Giraffe: Defect battery I wouldnt survive I think😂
[2021-08-29T18:38:41] Artem Bulashev: Added spacers btw to Ubox! Highly recommend that instead of foam solution :) or both
[2021-08-29T18:38:48] Artem Bulashev: 😄
[2021-08-29T18:39:26] Happy Giraffe: Im gonna need that 750gram beef burger, so depressed
[2021-08-29T18:39:37] Artem Bulashev: Also I think single I had ports on sides so much harder to get anything inside
[2021-08-29T18:39:40] Happy Giraffe: I hope spintend respects warranty
[2021-08-29T18:39:46] Artem Bulashev: They always do
[2021-08-29T18:40:01] Happy Giraffe: Alrighty, I write to Amy
[2021-08-29T18:40:07] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-08-29T18:43:07] Luis Magalhaes: My defective vesc made some fire and the bms didn't cut it on time and shorted 3 cells ok battery 😂 so... 😅
[2021-08-29T18:45:03] Luis Magalhaes: Had no problem with the warranty, they send me another ubox and checked it all before sending it to me so it does not happened again, but the battery was at my cost off course 😅
[2021-08-29T18:45:14] sombre_enfant: Same modelas dual or better ?
[2021-08-29T18:48:59] Artem Bulashev: After removing this solder ball
[2021-08-29T18:49:30] Artem Bulashev: Check with multi meter the resistance of those two resistors and of the same once on other phase
[2021-08-29T18:50:14] Artem Bulashev: I’m pretty sure your vesc should be alive if you replace those resistors (if they shot through)
[2021-08-29T18:50:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think those are capacitors (considering the color)
[2021-08-29T18:50:20] Happy Giraffe: Mine sparked too when I connected batt lol
[2021-08-29T18:50:48] Happy Giraffe: Should I wait for Amy response first?
[2021-08-29T18:51:07] Happy Giraffe: Then I have two singles lol
[2021-08-29T18:51:30] Happy Giraffe: AWD knocking on the door maybe
[2021-08-29T18:51:53] Artem Bulashev: May be 😁
[2021-08-29T18:52:19] Artem Bulashev: True actually sorry , had minimal brightness on my phone.
[2021-08-29T18:52:47] Artem Bulashev: They will likely ask you to send it back
[2021-08-29T18:53:35] Happy Giraffe: Its so good it wasnt my fault tho
[2021-08-29T18:53:49] Artem Bulashev: 😜
[2021-08-29T18:53:57] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-29T18:54:20] Artem Bulashev: That is also why you may have had some odd behavior with Foc
[2021-08-29T18:54:36] Happy Giraffe: Hall sensors atleast
[2021-08-29T18:54:47] Artem Bulashev: Unlikely though
[2021-08-29T18:54:51] Happy Giraffe: But I still believe its fucked motor
[2021-08-29T18:55:24] Happy Giraffe: Vesc recognized them and then it didnt after 10 meter ride lmao
[2021-08-29T18:55:36] Happy Giraffe: Connector cable fully connected in
[2021-08-29T18:56:35] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that sounds like separate issue somewhere along hall sensor wires
[2021-08-29T18:57:13] Happy Giraffe: The white wire ofc not connected to anytging as I have no sensor
[2021-08-29T18:57:31] Happy Giraffe: I soldered those wires so no crappy chinese white box connector issue now
[2021-08-29T18:57:32] Artem Bulashev: Yes de pin it
[2021-08-29T19:03:15] Luis Magalhaes: But mine spark in fire 🔥 😂😂😂
[2021-08-29T19:05:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so, we all fried at least a vesc here ? 🤣🤣
[2021-08-29T19:06:10] Unknown: I did'nt 😂 yet
[2021-08-29T19:06:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: soon my friend 🤣🤣
[2021-08-29T19:06:30] Artem Bulashev: Not gonna say no
[2021-08-29T19:06:43] Artem Bulashev: I was close :)) as video showed 🤪
[2021-08-29T19:08:03] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2021-08-29T19:08:09] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂
[2021-08-29T19:11:06] Luis Magalhaes: When i bought ubox a friend said to me "its like a drone esc and i burn lots os them all the time", when i put the first one on fire he told me "i told you so" 😂😂 when i said they would send me a new one he said " sell it" and i said "no i will try again" and he said "film it, your crazy" and i film it 😂😂😂
[2021-08-29T19:11:16] Luis Magalhaes: Its doing great for now 😂😂
[2021-08-29T19:14:36] Luis Magalhaes: 16km to work lets go
[2021-08-29T19:18:14] Mirono escooters: Beast helmet
[2021-08-29T19:51:30] Happy Giraffe: Oh fuuuuu
[2021-08-29T19:52:06] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-29T19:52:59] Happy Giraffe: One everyone should wear...
[2021-08-29T19:53:33] Mirono escooters: Defenitely
[2021-08-29T19:54:50] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_910@29-08-2021_19-54-50.jpg>
[2021-08-29T19:54:53] Artem Bulashev: Yes or neh?
[2021-08-29T19:55:03] Artem Bulashev: 15-55kmh
[2021-08-29T19:55:17] Mirono escooters: Ye looks cool
[2021-08-29T19:55:22] Mirono escooters: Full face nicer doe
[2021-08-29T19:59:44] Happy Giraffe: Nah, get proper helmet that actually protects you
[2021-08-29T20:00:36] Happy Giraffe: Scooter falling is different than with bike, ECE 22.06 certification is your best bet
[2021-08-29T20:01:39] Happy Giraffe: ECE 22.05 also fine. DOT wont mean anything in protecting you, that certoficate can just be purchased without testing at all👀😂
[2021-08-29T20:22:21] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌 protection to head is priceless
[2021-08-29T20:24:04] Luis Magalhaes: Full face or if you fall your chin could suffer some grinding 😂
[2021-08-29T20:26:07] Happy Giraffe: People got very bad head injuries from 30kmh already
[2021-08-29T20:33:16] Luis Magalhaes: Lots of people disregard to use helmet's because they are at 25 or 30kmh but in a scooter if the front wheel its a big hole you could get directly with the head on flor 😅lots of cases like this, heads smached theeth broken not a good thing 🙈
[2021-08-29T20:34:29] Happy Giraffe: People are afraid as wearing helmet looks stupid or the most common reason "it messes my hair"
[2021-08-29T20:34:58] Happy Giraffe: I would conclude that their hair wasn't connected to anything smart afterall if they think like this😂
[2021-08-29T20:37:51] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂
[2021-08-29T20:37:57] Luis Magalhaes: Agree
[2021-08-29T20:40:13] Mirono escooters: My mom
[2021-08-29T20:43:47] Happy Giraffe: Oof
[2021-08-29T20:51:16] Mirono escooters: I'm only one in family who wears helmet.. makes me mad
[2021-08-29T20:52:50] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2021-08-29T20:53:11] Happy Giraffe: Only one with a brain*
[2021-08-29T20:53:38] Happy Giraffe: My dad also retarded but on bike its not critical as in scooter
[2021-08-29T20:54:39] Mirono escooters: he got speed pedelec today, needs helmet by law now
[2021-08-29T20:54:55] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2021-08-29T20:55:05] Happy Giraffe: Thats a moped basically
[2021-08-29T20:55:39] Mirono escooters: yep
[2021-08-29T20:55:44] Mirono escooters: its cuul, and road legal
[2021-08-29T20:55:54] Mirono escooters: i insisted on building myself.. but.. ye xd
[2021-08-29T20:56:08] Mirono escooters: ill build my own later when i saved enough and beat him
[2021-08-29T21:03:44] Luis Magalhaes: My dad uses a bicycle helmet he has my last scooter a ubgo 1005 😂 he has 2 Arai helmets from when he had motorcycles but he think thats too mutch to uso on the scooter 😅
[2021-08-29T21:09:42] sombre_enfant: Damn give me his arai scooter
[2021-08-29T23:21:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: helmet is essential. i even advise MIPS or equivalent to save your brain.
[2021-08-29T23:21:28] Mirono escooters: Mips?
[2021-08-29T23:21:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ??
[2021-08-29T23:21:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok yes, mips
[2021-08-29T23:21:52] Mirono escooters: I got motor glooves too , gud shit
[2021-08-29T23:22:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's a technology from downhill bikes. it avoid brain from being shocked/rotated inside the helmet.
[2021-08-29T23:22:52] Mirono escooters: Wow
[2021-08-29T23:23:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://mipsprotection.com/
[2021-08-29T23:23:41] Happy Giraffe: ECE 22.06 should have rotational limit*
[2021-08-29T23:23:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not sure it has
[2021-08-29T23:24:41] Happy Giraffe: It has maximum rotational force it cant exceed, none of the other DOT, Snell have it
[2021-08-29T23:24:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: even motorbike helmets has tests at something like 30 km/h to pass tests 😔😔
[2021-08-29T23:26:48] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/9d8MALEJCHg
[2021-08-29T23:26:52] Happy Giraffe: My fav channel
[2021-08-29T23:35:19] Mirono escooters: Good video
[2021-08-29T23:35:23] Mirono escooters: Thanks for sharing
[2021-08-29T23:35:41] Mirono escooters: My idea is, a full face will draw a lot of attention from cops :/
[2021-08-29T23:35:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeq, excellent
[2021-08-29T23:36:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i've made a comparaison datasheet for bike helmets. let me find it
[2021-08-29T23:36:29] Mirono escooters: I got this one, it's nice and sleek and still protects most of face
[2021-08-29T23:36:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://www.anumme.fr/2020/07/19/comparateur-de-casques-vtt-esk8-avec-mentonnieres/
[2021-08-29T23:36:45] Mirono escooters: Survived 1 crash already lol
[2021-08-29T23:36:55] Happy Giraffe: I try to look innocent while in full moto gear and frankenstein xiaomi
[2021-08-29T23:36:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sorry... in french, but a lot of interesting shit.
[2021-08-29T23:38:21] Happy Giraffe: Fear not
[2021-08-29T23:38:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😁👍
[2021-08-29T23:38:37] Mirono escooters: Worst idea is to look at cops When I rode with little brother, we passed 2 cops. Just told him quietly "just look forward"
[2021-08-29T23:38:41] Luis Magalhaes: Sometimes when going to work i uso motorcycles jacket and trousers, gloves and helmet 😂
[2021-08-29T23:39:04] Mirono escooters: I need a jacket, but school is like 2km only lol. Gloves and helmet are fine. Maybe now with winter
[2021-08-29T23:39:07] Luis Magalhaes: But its more because of the cold days 😂
[2021-08-29T23:39:27] Unknown: Idd, if you look at them at high speeds, they know you know you fucked up big time xd
[2021-08-29T23:39:48] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-08-29T23:40:07] Mirono escooters: Passing cops on bikes I don't fear. I'm faster Motorcycles.. different story
[2021-08-29T23:40:12] Mirono escooters: My city is shit. Full of cops
[2021-08-29T23:40:21] Happy Giraffe: Yep lol, I just go right past them without giving a fuck
[2021-08-29T23:40:29] Happy Giraffe: They dont even pay attention then
[2021-08-29T23:40:31] Unknown: Belgiul is shit for that matter
[2021-08-29T23:40:45] Mirono escooters: Aalst full of marginal people
[2021-08-29T23:40:57] Mirono escooters: Catch me first I guess
[2021-08-29T23:41:17] Unknown: I live near aarschot, marginale driehoek
[2021-08-29T23:41:19] Mirono escooters: That's y field weakening button is good too. I dont care bout range at that moment lol
[2021-08-29T23:41:25] Mirono escooters: Oh even worse
[2021-08-29T23:41:32] Unknown: Hahahaha
[2021-08-29T23:41:57] Happy Giraffe: I was first night testing vesc, there was stationary moto police waiting on the straight road. Luckily foc is is shhhh so he didnt hear me coming behind and I braked when I saw him. Then just 25kmh past😂
[2021-08-29T23:42:05] Happy Giraffe: And different route back
[2021-08-29T23:42:09] Mirono escooters: They would defo take my g30, that thing is not sleek at all
[2021-08-29T23:42:21] Mirono escooters: Hahaha smart
[2021-08-29T23:42:39] Mirono escooters: I like police mode on my green one, it's sleek too. My daily driver before g30
[2021-08-29T23:43:34] Happy Giraffe: Here Im lucky they dont care if I dont create a problem
[2021-08-29T23:43:36] Mirono escooters: I cznt even turn led off, thzts shit. My friend has full matt black ebike and escaped from cops at 80kmh and hid in a dark road. They didn't hear or see him. He filmed it. Was cool
[2021-08-29T23:44:15] Mirono escooters: Here its.. sometimes. Imo if you ride carefully and not like a dick; they won't bother. But always some cops who are out for blood
[2021-08-29T23:44:20] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-08-29T23:44:25] Mirono escooters: But hey my city got 300 rentals now lol
[2021-08-29T23:44:36] Mirono escooters: Blue tho, I wish I painted mine blue now..
[2021-08-29T23:44:37] Happy Giraffe: Sneak 100
[2021-08-29T23:44:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it also why a 'discrete' escooter is interesting (not something like dualtron, zero, vsett, curus or weped), much more chances to be ignored by cops (at least in france)... xiaomi, boosted, etwow, you pass fingers in the noze
[2021-08-29T23:44:54] Mirono escooters: Yes :) I like sleekness
[2021-08-29T23:45:01] Mirono escooters: Also y I like using stock xiaomi shit. Sleek
[2021-08-29T23:45:24] Mirono escooters: Well cops will get used to scoots more and prpb not even pay attention.. different color but it still looks like a voi scoot
[2021-08-29T23:45:26] Happy Giraffe: Until you put monorim suspension and other visible shit😂
[2021-08-29T23:45:36] Mirono escooters: I ordered rear suspension. Oops
[2021-08-29T23:45:40] Mirono escooters: Also won't fit with my rack. Fak
[2021-08-29T23:45:41] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2021-08-29T23:45:51] Mirono escooters: Will diy until it fits
[2021-08-29T23:46:06] Mirono escooters: Prob drill through suspension 😭
[2021-08-29T23:46:07] Happy Giraffe: You might wanna have welding gear
[2021-08-29T23:46:19] Mirono escooters: I'm learning to weld soon
[2021-08-29T23:46:43] Happy Giraffe: I wish I was 15 in high school we had welding gear there free to use
[2021-08-29T23:46:59] Unknown: Well, i'm off to bed got a hard week coming 😴 6-16hr all week

[2021-08-29T23:47:30] Mirono escooters: I know someone with a "frees macinne" and big ass cnc who teaches it. He did my axle for scoot 🥰
[2021-08-29T23:47:46] Mirono escooters: It's that thing that spins shit fast and cuts
[2021-08-29T23:47:55] Mirono escooters: Young enough to learn
[2021-08-29T23:48:26] sombre_enfant: U learned cnc program, solidworks yet ?
[2021-08-29T23:48:36] Mirono escooters: Solidworks on it
[2021-08-29T23:48:41] sombre_enfant: How to use fanuc board ?
[2021-08-29T23:48:41] Mirono escooters: Cnc is for next year

[2021-08-29T23:49:32] Mirono escooters: I'm only learning it as hobbyist for now... lol
[2021-08-29T23:49:48] Mirono escooters: I now study science, later I will go electronics/mechanic
[2021-08-29T23:49:54] sombre_enfant: Ain't no way boy
[2021-08-29T23:50:09] Mirono escooters: :?
[2021-08-29T23:51:39] sombre_enfant: belgium dont have regular and workshop school ? Bc when u go on a regular path u cant go into mechanic or other thing, if u good u go lawyer or doctor or u end up at Mcdonald or lidl...
[2021-08-29T23:52:29] Mirono escooters: We do, but I prefer science for now
[2021-08-29T23:53:21] sombre_enfant: Go for docta or sum u missed your path if u done all these year to go in mechanic/electronic
[2021-08-29T23:54:09] Unknown: Alarm at 5 for me 😭😂 i gotta work from 6 am to 4 pm or 6- 16 haha some poeple sick 🤦‍♂️ anyway, that's 12 hours at 150% payoff so that's good
[2021-08-29T23:54:24] Mirono escooters: Nah university and electronics mechanics was advised to me, I trust head masters of the school
[2021-08-29T23:54:38] sombre_enfant: Weird ahh school
[2021-08-29T23:55:12] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-08-29T23:55:45] sombre_enfant: Here after 12yo u choose wich path u want and find your school and keep in mind what job u goin... Not at 18yo in university😂
[2021-08-29T23:56:09] Mirono escooters: Belgium
[2021-08-29T23:56:33] Happy Giraffe: I thought you guys make just chocolate

[2021-08-30T00:02:03] Happy Giraffe: To have your last name "chocolate"
[2021-08-30T00:04:07] sombre_enfant: Miro is black too
[2021-08-30T00:04:36] Happy Giraffe: Then thats pretty funny
[2021-08-30T00:04:47] Mirono escooters: Since when am I black? Xd

[2021-08-30T20:50:41] Unknown: @Mirono_escooters i noticed some beast on fb, he had a pretty big bottom extension. Do you perhaps have a 3d printer? Also did you perhaps print that? 😂
[2021-08-30T20:56:38] Mirono escooters: I have :) I printed
[2021-08-30T20:57:33] Unknown: Can you print one for an m365, non pro version? :o i could ask a friend, but he would have to make an entire template for it
[2021-08-30T20:58:02] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2021-08-30T21:00:43] Unknown: Awesome, i will measure out how high it needs to be tomorrow and hit you up :p how much would it cost +-? Gonna be around 3-4.5cm probably i'm gonna place my boys vertical
[2021-08-30T21:01:09] Mirono escooters: Don't worry, I do it for free
[2021-08-30T21:01:52] Unknown: My holder just fits perfectly, i have like 1-2mm of space 😄 i had to rework the holder a little tho 😝
[2021-08-30T21:03:32] Mirono escooters: I need to rewire bms as it blocks me from letting cells stand up and adds like 20mm lol
[2021-08-30T21:15:08] Unknown: Ouch 😂 i tought about that, im gonna fit a thin shock absorber, and a 2mm spacer that will allow the wire to connect to the cell
[2021-08-31T00:39:30] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2021-08-31T01:01:57] Happy Giraffe: Nice!
[2021-08-31T01:02:20] Happy Giraffe: Did you try mounting the light higher?🤔
[2021-08-31T01:02:32] Happy Giraffe: I wish I had the deck space of vsett...
[2021-08-31T03:17:26] Artem Bulashev: The higher it is the further beam starts - I’m going for oem look. Vsett had original lamp in this place that even looked similar but was week
[2021-08-31T03:18:31] Artem Bulashev: I will be re making it though. Too much shaking - will try to mount it on the stem bottom. Need to design and 3D print mounting bracket
[2021-08-31T12:35:28] Mirono escooters: Morning smartasses Rode my g30 today Bms cutted off once; when I gave full throttle and cells sagged under 2.7v I have a antispark But bms still had discharge off. Even when full scoot was off.. I had to physically disconnect xt90.. :/ will not be possible when my scoot is sealed.. Daly shit bms can't turn on off bms with my display.. Any ideas? Thought antispark would fix this shit..
[2021-08-31T12:35:43] Mirono escooters: Next thing 3.36v on every cell Soc 33% Is this even accurate?
[2021-08-31T12:36:27] Unknown: Morning 😂😂 12.36
[2021-08-31T12:36:37] Mirono escooters: Now I roll out of bed
[2021-08-31T12:37:38] sombre_enfant: Vacation hitting hard😂
[2021-08-31T12:38:33] Mirono escooters: Tomorrow school. Fck me
[2021-08-31T12:38:48] Mirono escooters: Gonna finish a scoot today The more I build the more fails. Lol
[2021-08-31T12:42:23] sombre_enfant: Same here...
[2021-08-31T13:02:57] Artem Bulashev: This is BMS protection. It shuts off when under voltage, but should restore once you charge it up high enough
[2021-08-31T13:03:51] Mirono escooters: Well it went up to 3.3v again but bms protection kept on.. daly shit
[2021-08-31T13:05:13] DNP: poor people with cheap standart scooter VS. VESC user
[2021-08-31T13:18:32] Unknown: Reset discharge on Daly app
[2021-08-31T13:18:41] Mirono escooters: Can't
[2021-08-31T13:18:46] Unknown: Yes you can
[2021-08-31T13:19:10] Unknown: In tab on the right you can switch on/off charge/discharge
[2021-08-31T13:19:14] Unknown: Password is 123456
[2021-08-31T13:19:20] Unknown: Turn it off leave for few secs and then back on
[2021-08-31T13:19:48] Mirono escooters: I dont have Bluetooth bms, I have daly display
[2021-08-31T13:19:52] Unknown: On ebike my vesc shuts off on super high load when temps get a bit oopsie I have to disconnect and reconnect
[2021-08-31T13:19:53] Unknown: Ahhhh
[2021-08-31T13:20:00] Mirono escooters: And the discharge on off button doesn't work. Shit design
[2021-08-31T13:20:05] Unknown: Weird isn't it
[2021-08-31T13:20:08] Unknown: And hm
[2021-08-31T13:20:15] Unknown: Why did it shut off discharge again?
[2021-08-31T13:20:35] Mirono escooters: Under v due to pulse
[2021-08-31T13:20:36] sombre_enfant: Vesc failed
[2021-08-31T13:20:50] Unknown: That happens to me
[2021-08-31T13:20:53] Unknown: Vesc shuts off
[2021-08-31T13:20:59] Unknown: If I throttle erratically

[2021-08-31T13:21:31] Unknown: 🧐
[2021-08-31T13:21:45] Mirono escooters: Fucking worthless designed product.. lol
[2021-08-31T13:22:19] sombre_enfant: Why u wanted a screen while u could do everything with phone ?
[2021-08-31T13:25:46] Mirono escooters: To see batt % and cool shit
[2021-08-31T13:25:52] Mirono escooters: It was cool. Y not
[2021-08-31T13:26:36] Mirono escooters: Even with antispark it doesn't release... i need to disconnect physically
[2021-08-31T15:27:09] Artem Bulashev: Anti spark has simply 2 stages on the pin. As you plug it in first tip of the pin connects through resistor - no spark, than you push further and the rest connects without spark and resistance of the flow goes back to basically 0
[2021-08-31T15:27:46] Artem Bulashev: Point is, when anti spark connector is connected fully it is just like usual non anti spark connector
[2021-08-31T15:28:04] Mirono escooters: I mean antispark switch
[2021-08-31T16:00:38] Unknown: I wish 😂😂 i miss mobbin out at scorro, now i gotta work 6-4
[2021-08-31T16:01:40] Mirono escooters: Trade with me
[2021-08-31T16:09:55] Unknown: Sure, but i keep my paycheck though 😂 you can have the taxes if you want 😝
[2021-08-31T16:12:16] Happy Giraffe: Move to Monaco, no tax 😂
[2021-08-31T16:12:35] Unknown: I don't make enough for that 😂😂
[2021-08-31T16:13:34] Unknown: Belgium expensive as hell tho, last year i payed 4.3k taxes 😭
[2021-08-31T16:13:45] Mirono escooters: Yea. Fck belgium
[2021-08-31T16:13:52] Mirono escooters: Our government doesn't do anything useful too
[2021-08-31T16:14:23] Unknown: I do too many hours 🙄 and idd but we set a record tho, longest time without any goverment 😅😝
[2021-08-31T16:14:52] Happy Giraffe: You have Eden Hazard tho
[2021-08-31T16:15:00] Unknown: True
[2021-08-31T16:15:07] Happy Giraffe: The player I never got in Fifa😭
[2021-08-31T16:15:07] Mirono escooters: It's a circus
[2021-08-31T16:15:50] Unknown: Loll fifa and yes it is indeed... unbelievable
[2021-08-31T16:17:39] Unknown: I calculates last year, did 270 hours overtime, made around 14.000 net extra, and had to pay 4.3k on tax so i worked 270 hours at "150%" and made 10k for it.. i make more withoud doin overtime
[2021-08-31T16:18:00] Unknown: Because of tax shifts upwards and i went just over the edge 🤦‍♂️
[2021-08-31T16:19:18] Unknown: And my work refuses to work idk how to say it, "int zwart" without a contract i guess 😂 so everything is "clean money"
[2021-08-31T16:19:54] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-08-31T16:20:11] Unknown: Yup haha
[2021-08-31T19:12:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what awg table do you use guys for continous current ?
[2021-08-31T19:21:12] Happy Giraffe: I watch video where guy uses 160A to burn AWG12 and call it a day😂
[2021-08-31T19:22:17] Happy Giraffe: Tables are really confusing as they claim 16AWG to handle sometimes like 15A while I did 40A peak on it for a long time without issues. XT30 was bigger problem in that matter🤔
[2021-08-31T19:23:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'd like to finish my battery pack today... but i wonder if my 12awg is enough for 90A peak
[2021-08-31T19:23:16] Happy Giraffe: I tried my 16awg cables and they were barely warm while xt30 was hot😂
[2021-08-31T19:23:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i left the 10 awg at home 🙈
[2021-08-31T19:23:32] Happy Giraffe: Go for awg10 if you can
[2021-08-31T19:23:44] Happy Giraffe: Its almost double the size of conductors
[2021-08-31T19:24:00] Mirono escooters: I got 10. So nice
[2021-08-31T19:24:34] Happy Giraffe: Awg 12 is nice but I wouldnt use 90A on it
[2021-08-31T19:25:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: fuck...
[2021-08-31T19:25:39] Happy Giraffe: AWG12 is what I use in my xiaomi 13s6p batt output👀😂
[2021-08-31T19:26:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i doubt it's stock 😅 most dualtron doesn't use 12 awg 🙈
[2021-08-31T19:27:24] Happy Giraffe: Haha, yes far from stock...but I think if having 10AWG there doesnt have any negatives in terms of size it should be much better🤔
[2021-08-31T19:27:43] Happy Giraffe: Maybe @artBula has experience with these
[2021-08-31T19:28:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: or i put 2 outputs in 12awg...
[2021-08-31T19:29:50] Happy Giraffe: I would wait for what Artem says, also delaying building by one day instead of doing it all over again seems like a good deal to me😂
[2021-08-31T19:30:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no so easy, not building at home and with help of a busy friend.
[2021-08-31T19:33:09] Artem Bulashev: Guys
[2021-08-31T19:33:17] Artem Bulashev: First you need to define
[2021-08-31T19:33:21] Artem Bulashev: - length
[2021-08-31T19:33:31] Artem Bulashev: - dc or AC (motor)
[2021-08-31T19:33:46] Artem Bulashev: Only than you can discuss nominal amps
[2021-08-31T19:33:49] Artem Bulashev: 👌😊
[2021-08-31T19:34:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: negatif : 50cm positive : 15cm
[2021-08-31T19:34:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: DC
[2021-08-31T19:34:08] Happy Giraffe: Usually first batt cable is short no?😂
[2021-08-31T19:34:51] Artem Bulashev: Battery amp limit 90a together from both esc? = never more than 90a, correct?
[2021-08-31T19:37:28] Artem Bulashev: I would use take solid core wire biggest you can find locally and run it from battery negative to BMS directly - for 60 amps 3.5 dia solid core will not even heat up with length of 40cm, but I run 2 lines of 3mm solid core to be safe
[2021-08-31T19:37:49] Artem Bulashev: Solid core has about 40% more ampacity than multithreaded wire
[2021-08-31T19:38:06] Artem Bulashev: So you need less diameter to get more amps 😊
[2021-08-31T19:39:16] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_914@31-08-2021_19-39-16.jpg>

[2021-08-31T23:32:08] Happy Giraffe: Did you end up using 12awg?😂
[2021-08-31T23:36:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. a friend brought me the 10 awg 😉

[2021-09-01T00:10:58] Happy Giraffe: Trying to make my light not blinding
[2021-09-01T00:12:44] Happy Giraffe: Hard to make the edge of light sharp but the amount it bleeds above waist/chest level wont blind anyone badly
[2021-09-01T00:22:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_917@01-09-2021_00-22-18.jpg>

[2021-09-01T00:25:17] Happy Giraffe: I see you soldered away from batt end, is it to avoid heating cell?
[2021-09-01T00:35:15] sombre_enfant: Obv
[2021-09-01T01:45:50] Artem Bulashev: Not bad 😊 but as I said using 2 half cross section would be better for equal cell pull :)
[2021-09-01T01:48:29] Artem Bulashev: Like so :) half cross section is easier to route and and pull from each cell would be more equal But than again I do like to over complicate tasks for some questionable perfection
[2021-09-01T01:49:27] Artem Bulashev: Greta job 😊 I’m still waiting for the main package with all the copper and tape to arrive… arrived to Austria and got f lost in here

[2021-09-01T11:31:58] Unknown: What's the soc standing for?
[2021-09-01T11:39:49] Happy Giraffe: System on a chip?
[2021-09-01T11:39:57] Mirono escooters: I can program soc with lcd too
[2021-09-01T11:39:57] Mirono escooters: You know its a Bluetooth one but just with a extra lcd right?.. its exactly the same
[2021-09-01T12:07:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: youhou ! spintend has shipped my dual vesc (on the 28th)

[2021-09-02T12:14:53] Mirono escooters: Oh and if i givr full throttle instanty it cuts off power, and vesc has red led blinking? Any idea what that is? After few seconds it recovers
[2021-09-02T12:19:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: blinking red = error
[2021-09-02T12:19:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: can be undervoltage for example
[2021-09-02T12:20:50] Mirono escooters: Undervoltagr has been disabled
[2021-09-02T12:21:02] Mirono escooters: Overcurent or smth? But dhouldnt happen
[2021-09-02T14:40:08] Artem Bulashev: Did you get your single right?
[2021-09-02T14:59:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the single is running fine since 2 weeks on my Bossted rev 😁
[2021-09-02T15:05:37] Artem Bulashev: What are your settings?
[2021-09-02T15:05:47] Artem Bulashev: Phase and battery amps?
[2021-09-02T15:07:08] Artem Bulashev: You run 2 single ? Because that scooter is 2*750w motors right?
[2021-09-02T15:34:59] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_920@02-09-2021_15-34-59.jpg>
[2021-09-02T15:35:20] Luis Magalhaes: @artBula do you know whats this scale for?
[2021-09-02T15:43:37] Luis Magalhaes: первую цифру ставь 135 на обоих весках
[2021-09-02T15:43:56] Luis Magalhaes: Why 135? Any one knows?
[2021-09-02T16:06:16] Luis Magalhaes: So from what i saw on the internet its just the scale for mesure the amps, just have to adjust if its not reading right 😅
[2021-09-02T16:07:13] Artem Bulashev: What do you want to set as 135?
[2021-09-02T16:07:18] Artem Bulashev: Phase amps?
[2021-09-02T16:08:28] Artem Bulashev: Ubox sometimes can take 135a, depending how lucky you sample is, but it may start misbehaving above 125a -130a for most people (125a is safe, 130a May be, 135a unlikely)
[2021-09-02T16:09:20] Luis Magalhaes: No i was seeing they talking at the Russian vesc group and trying to understand why
[2021-09-02T16:13:42] Artem Bulashev: Ok 👌
[2021-09-02T16:14:23] Artem Bulashev: They were talking about maximum safish limit of Ubox for phase amps
[2021-09-02T16:15:17] Artem Bulashev: 135a, but start from 125a and work you way up to 135a - only works in clean set ups like she phase wires go out of deck right away
[2021-09-02T16:16:46] Artem Bulashev: About 5cm of phase wires only next to controller - phase wires are like antennas emitting EMI
[2021-09-02T16:19:30] Happy Giraffe: I wish I had the deck space
[2021-09-02T16:19:53] Happy Giraffe: God knows how many cells diy pack could hold there
[2021-09-02T16:44:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, just one (on my dual motor), with one motor off. it will be replaced by the dual as soon as possible
[2021-09-02T16:44:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 100a phase / 50a bat
[2021-09-02T16:45:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 100% on vesc tool, but modified in live by the smartdisplay
[2021-09-02T16:47:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it allows me to set 'eco' modes.
[2021-09-02T16:59:57] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-09-02T17:00:19] Artem Bulashev: Have you checked how hot your motors get or how hot your gets get?
[2021-09-02T17:00:32] Artem Bulashev: May be log it to esp
[2021-09-02T17:00:53] Artem Bulashev: Or if you use your controller BT than can log through phone app
[2021-09-02T17:02:04] Mirono escooters: My g30 motor (it fitted) has a brown cable next to the 5 hall sensor cables Any idea?
[2021-09-02T17:02:11] Mirono escooters: Temp sensor? 4th hall sensor?
[2021-09-02T17:03:15] sombre_enfant: Temp
[2021-09-02T17:03:54] Mirono escooters: Wooo cooool
[2021-09-02T17:03:56] Mirono escooters: Love g30
[2021-09-02T17:04:12] Mirono escooters: My aftermarket shit controller doeskt have temp sensor to
[2021-09-02T17:07:45] Mirono escooters: @lBabacar any idea how much magnets ?
[2021-09-02T17:19:20] sombre_enfant: 30
[2021-09-02T17:27:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's displayed on the smartdisplay 😁 my rear motor reach 80° after 5km and 12min (with many starts/stops)
[2021-09-02T17:28:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: bottom right : hotter mosfets / motors
[2021-09-02T17:41:54] Happy Giraffe: What motors are they?
[2021-09-02T18:04:47] Artem Bulashev: I just over heated motor
[2021-09-02T18:04:52] Artem Bulashev: Went into protection
[2021-09-02T18:05:02] Artem Bulashev: Set 70c to start and 80c to finish
[2021-09-02T18:05:42] Mirono escooters: Testing hall sensors Probe - and the 3 hall sensors Or probe + and the 3?
[2021-09-02T18:05:44] Artem Bulashev: 650w nominal 1100w max
[2021-09-02T18:05:53] Artem Bulashev: Setting 100a 17a battery
[2021-09-02T18:06:05] Artem Bulashev: Going long time up the hill
[2021-09-02T18:06:17] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 be careful if you don’t have motor sensors
[2021-09-02T18:06:37] Happy Giraffe: Damn, chinesium 1000w wasnt that bad afterall
[2021-09-02T18:06:37] Artem Bulashev: Your wheel is 750w but max is same 1100w I think
[2021-09-02T18:07:07] Mirono escooters: Internet says probe - and the hall But then i read 0 out of 3 If i do + i read 1 of 3
[2021-09-02T18:07:34] Artem Bulashev: Need to test may be sensor is not alcalibrated correctly to mesure 80c
[2021-09-02T18:07:40] Artem Bulashev: Calibrated at 25c
[2021-09-02T18:10:40] Happy Giraffe: Costs 15€ to send vesc back to China while DHL and UPS charge 60-80€ lmao. Comparing postal companies is a must😂
[2021-09-02T18:26:13] Mirono escooters: Are g30 motors hard to open?
[2021-09-02T18:29:48] sombre_enfant: No
[2021-09-02T18:30:11] sombre_enfant: Remove the screw and step on it
[2021-09-02T18:35:52] Happy Giraffe: This design I dont like at all, insulated by a small piece of tape...
[2021-09-02T18:36:04] Happy Giraffe: Which fell off when I opened it lol

[2021-09-02T18:43:17] Luis Magalhaes: Im using 130A cant give more because of the absolute current 😂
[2021-09-02T19:02:00] Luis Magalhaes: @artBula thanks for the info mate 😁👌
[2021-09-02T19:52:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: stock boosted
[2021-09-02T19:53:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: they are sensored 😉
[2021-09-02T19:54:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: boosted 9" => 10" tires conversion done !

[2021-09-02T19:54:40] Mirono escooters: Y be careful without sensorw?
[2021-09-02T20:04:55] Mirono escooters: 100€ for gen1 That oki?
[2021-09-02T20:06:41] Happy Giraffe: Quite nice then
[2021-09-02T20:30:47] Artem Bulashev: Good :)
[2021-09-02T20:31:10] Artem Bulashev: Temp sensor is a great add on
[2021-09-02T20:31:40] Artem Bulashev: Strange that my motor cover was barely warm when sensor said 80c on windings
[2021-09-02T20:32:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I fully agree. I saw my motor where REALLY hot on my Dualtron mini, but except and external PTC sensor, I wasn't able to mesure it.
[2021-09-02T20:32:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: same thing for me.
[2021-09-02T20:32:35] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-09-02T20:32:56] Artem Bulashev: Is yours 10k or 100k ntc?
[2021-09-02T20:34:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 10k
[2021-09-02T20:35:12] Artem Bulashev: Mine is 100k - supposed to be even more accurate at higher temps
[2021-09-02T20:35:21] Artem Bulashev: What’s your temp limits?
[2021-09-02T20:35:32] Artem Bulashev: Stock is 85 ->100c
[2021-09-02T20:42:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'll check. from memory 80->85
[2021-09-02T20:43:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I've just added "nitro boost" for VESC in the Smart 🤣🤣
[2021-09-02T20:43:36] Artem Bulashev: What I don’t get is why it over heated
[2021-09-02T20:43:44] Artem Bulashev: I had 100a 17a setting
[2021-09-02T20:43:55] Artem Bulashev: And was going fast
[2021-09-02T20:43:59] Artem Bulashev: 50kmh
[2021-09-02T20:44:05] Artem Bulashev: This means high voltage on motor
[2021-09-02T20:44:08] Artem Bulashev: Low amps
[2021-09-02T20:44:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on "eco" none, it sets a percentage of the max phase current (configurable in the UIs). if you push the nitro button, it sets the max VESC current from VESC tool.
[2021-09-02T20:45:01] Artem Bulashev: Nitro would need to add 5amps to battery current as well, on each motor, that’s how vsett does it for examples increases acceleration on speed above 30. Like over take
[2021-09-02T20:46:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I "can't" ... I prefer to set only RELATIVE current limits. Adding more current means changing the max current in the VESC. you configure the MAX you can reach in VESC tools, and the max will be nitro.
[2021-09-02T20:56:36] Artem Bulashev: In this case nitro will not do anything at all if you travel fast enough for battery amp limit to limit your phase amps
[2021-09-02T21:00:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I have speed limits and current limits for standard modes & eco modes. nitro boost disabled all limits and will use max settings set in vesc tool
[2021-09-02T21:01:37] Artem Bulashev: Ok 👌
[2021-09-02T21:02:29] Artem Bulashev: It’s just that nitro on battery amps limit would make more sense from the relation of phase vs battery amp
[2021-09-02T21:25:08] sombre_enfant: No
[2021-09-02T21:33:18] Happy Giraffe: Watch "VESC HFI: Sensorless position tracking at zero speed" on YouTube (1:25) https://youtu.be/-qV1_xyrgzs
[2021-09-02T21:33:51] Happy Giraffe: Dont listen with headphones as it has a strong high frequency sound
[2021-09-02T21:41:03] Happy Giraffe: Interesting thing that he says HFI doesnt have any other negatives than the small noise emitted. When calibrated it can give us sensorless strong torque and then keep HFI tracking when moving until its stopped for longer time again🤔
[2021-09-02T21:43:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and what are your results ? i tried, but it wasn't a real success ... but I think I already had a dead mosfet
[2021-09-02T21:44:45] Happy Giraffe: I didnt have bluetooth module to test with, will try immediately once I get my replacement vesc
[2021-09-02T21:45:29] Happy Giraffe: Did you try to calibrate the parameters or just used as stock?
[2021-09-02T21:45:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I adjusted
[2021-09-02T21:45:54] Happy Giraffe: With electronic brake and the dotted map?
[2021-09-02T21:46:22] Happy Giraffe: Also how was your inductance difference in motors if you measured?
[2021-09-02T21:46:44] Happy Giraffe: Some say the if its larger than 15-20% it should work fine
[2021-09-02T21:54:55] Artem Bulashev: Can you elaborate ?
[2021-09-02T21:55:09] Happy Giraffe: Yes, one sec
[2021-09-02T21:56:09] Happy Giraffe: You will need to measure your motor and look at the two values shown in a video
[2021-09-02T21:59:08] Happy Giraffe: On vesc terminal: measure_ind
[2021-09-02T21:59:40] Happy Giraffe: After that comes number from 0-1 about duty cycle which the guy used 0.2
[2021-09-02T22:03:22] Happy Giraffe: Total inductace and then the difference what spinning motor makes. Here 1.9÷15=0.13 so its enough difference for Vesc to notice HFI inductance change
[2021-09-02T22:05:20] Happy Giraffe: HFI also has to count the polarity of magnets motor is facing against based on the faster current saturation in the coil lmao, alien stuff but yeah ld_lq_diff needs to be 15% atleast from total inductance for it to work as I understood.
[2021-09-02T22:05:55] Happy Giraffe: Vedder failed only to do it in a 2 pole inrunner😂
[2021-09-02T22:10:02] Happy Giraffe: And if I understood correctly a bigger motor might need more voltage to saturate it so it will be beeping like in terminator on startup😂
[2021-09-02T22:10:20] Mirono escooters: Ill keep my hall sensors. Lol
[2021-09-02T22:11:01] Happy Giraffe: Haha, I think Wheelway doesnt wanna give me warranty. Shitty to have motor hall fail after 20km smooth road riding
[2021-09-02T22:12:43] Artem Bulashev: Same here haha
[2021-09-02T22:12:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-02T22:13:32] Mirono escooters: Repair?
[2021-09-02T22:14:44] Happy Giraffe: Not sure if I wanna bother with this chinesium motor. Maybe just run it sensorless. Other solution could be to buy Vsett motor but 150€ shipping and no certainty of disc mount being on the same place lol
[2021-09-02T22:15:27] Mirono escooters: Is sensorless so bad
[2021-09-02T22:15:45] Happy Giraffe: Only startup gives less torque, otherwise its good
[2021-09-02T22:16:02] Artem Bulashev: I’m without scooter
[2021-09-02T22:16:04] Artem Bulashev: For now
[2021-09-02T22:16:06] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-09-02T22:16:13] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2021-09-02T22:16:26] Happy Giraffe: But the problem is the overheating 1000w motor lol, I would rather have a beefy motor impossible to kill
[2021-09-02T22:17:03] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-02T22:19:33] Mirono escooters: Trade for a broken g30 motor? Lol
[2021-09-02T22:19:59] Happy Giraffe: Mine works tho😂
[2021-09-02T22:20:43] Happy Giraffe: But on other thought its nice to have lower torque on low rpm as then it gives you good grip even on wet road when you are 100% throttle
[2021-09-02T22:21:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: while changing my tires, i noticed my tubes were 'glued' to my motor... could it be due to hot motor ?
[2021-09-02T22:21:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: never seen that before
[2021-09-02T22:21:59] Happy Giraffe: Me neither, maybe heat caused it
[2021-09-02T22:26:50] Happy Giraffe: Whats your opinion on this? battery + and - only separated by tape and like 1mm space from casing
[2021-09-02T22:27:12] Mirono escooters: No good
[2021-09-02T22:27:28] Happy Giraffe: For me its a bit weird stuff
[2021-09-02T22:27:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if it REALLY can't move, why not. you're not supposed to open it and remove the tape.
[2021-09-02T22:28:38] Happy Giraffe: Yes, true. But durability wise its sort of like a DIY solution haha
[2021-09-02T22:29:13] Happy Giraffe: If the tape is badly placed in factory or soldering left some residue
[2021-09-02T22:29:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: then it fries at first test 😅
[2021-09-02T22:30:25] Happy Giraffe: It was 4th test for me 😂
[2021-09-02T22:31:11] Happy Giraffe: Day before the kaboom had exact same settings and worked like charm
[2021-09-02T22:31:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: as i understood, spintend test each product before shipping (not sure, but they replied to me they needed time to test before shipping for the dual)
[2021-09-02T22:31:28] Happy Giraffe: Hmm
[2021-09-02T22:32:37] Mirono escooters: Happy giraffe How is sensorless vs sensored? I got that 350w gen1 now with sensors dead aswell.
[2021-09-02T22:33:22] Happy Giraffe: Havent tried vesc sensored yet, sensorless needs small 3-4kmh kick and then it goes smoothly
[2021-09-02T22:33:54] Happy Giraffe: Has lower start torque than with Hall but after 15kmh it was pulling me really nicely
[2021-09-02T22:33:56] Mirono escooters: Oki; not too bad Gt100 displzt constantly flashes error 7 now but rides fine. Stupid chinese
[2021-09-02T22:34:08] Mirono escooters: Wil try to fix gen1 ig
[2021-09-02T22:34:37] Mirono escooters: Im unlucky Killed 2 500w threads (monoshit) 1 gen1 48v500w doesnt fit This scoot is doomed.. i just wanna see it ride
[2021-09-02T22:34:43] Happy Giraffe: If you dont manage to fix it I think for your weight sensorless aint a problem even starting uphill
[2021-09-02T22:35:09] Mirono escooters: Problably. Will need a vesc then or new controller. Anyway more money 😅😭
[2021-09-02T22:35:46] Happy Giraffe: Lmao, I put too much locktite to the monorim motor side plate and had to get it out with violence. Maybe I could just make an m8 thread for it lmao
[2021-09-02T22:35:57] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_927@02-09-2021_22-35-57.jpg>
[2021-09-02T22:36:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-09-02T22:36:12] Happy Giraffe: How?
[2021-09-02T22:36:14] Mirono escooters: Happend to 2 motors.. was both from old batch left on shelf. Rip 200€
[2021-09-02T22:36:26] Mirono escooters: I just tightened it.. not even hard. Im weak af
[2021-09-02T22:36:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 'lmao' ?
[2021-09-02T22:36:53] Happy Giraffe: Yes, we have a gang of fucked monorim products
[2021-09-02T22:36:59] Mirono escooters: Wasn't even on my max strengh I was like "1 last turn so it doesnt move" As monoshit needs force to keep motor from rotating. Not a groove..
[2021-09-02T22:37:18] Mirono escooters: I have a library full of broken monoshit. Prepare for a war
[2021-09-02T22:37:22] Happy Giraffe: Hero had his suspension brake mounting bolt misaligned like 20% lol
[2021-09-02T22:37:48] Mirono escooters: My mounting bolts were out of place too And my xtech adaptor And aaa just fck em
[2021-09-02T22:38:05] Mirono escooters: I wouldnt be mad if their customer service was nice Na they just ignore me afrer spending 250£
[2021-09-02T22:38:38] Happy Giraffe: Yeahh, Wheelway gonna ignore me aswell I think
[2021-09-02T22:38:40] Mirono escooters: Even a retailer i know doesnt recommend the motors..
[2021-09-02T22:38:46] Mirono escooters: Chinese ig..
[2021-09-02T22:39:02] Mirono escooters: Monorim big brand tho. Everyone hypes it up. But its shit. Overpriced garbage
[2021-09-02T22:41:07] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, the small bolts they include I wouldnt at all. Instead I drilled a stainless M6 bolt to keep brake holder in place😂
[2021-09-02T22:41:19] Mirono escooters: Haha lol. Nice 😅
[2021-09-02T22:41:42] Mirono escooters: Im not out for blood, but someone needs to call monorim back..
[2021-09-02T22:41:54] Happy Giraffe: I snapped both of the M3 used in mudguard mount...but yes its funny
[2021-09-02T22:42:16] Happy Giraffe: Need some EU based company but nobody does it
[2021-09-02T22:42:29] Mirono escooters: Their bolts are also rusting..
[2021-09-02T22:42:38] Mirono escooters: Imagine pzying 150€ for suspension with rusting bolts
[2021-09-02T22:42:48] Mirono escooters: If i only had the time and budget..
[2021-09-02T22:43:03] Mirono escooters: I wanted a cnc machine for metal adaptors 3000€ Holy cow
[2021-09-02T22:43:22] Mirono escooters: And to make custom axles and threads and taps.. 25k Well yea..
[2021-09-02T22:43:33] Mirono escooters: Ill start saving up
[2021-09-02T22:44:00] Happy Giraffe: Custom axle for Wheelway rim is just M10 high tensile bolt. I think 8.8 is enough for it
[2021-09-02T22:44:48] Mirono escooters: I had to cut my axle from china as it was too big Specially made for 6000rs bearing they said..
[2021-09-02T22:44:52] Mirono escooters: 2mm too thic
[2021-09-02T22:52:20] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-02T22:53:30] Mirono escooters: Maybe later ill go bigger. For now batteries lol Soon ill release my own footboards too. Made in belgium 🇧🇪
[2021-09-02T22:54:47] Luis Magalhaes: Been there 😂😂
[2021-09-02T22:57:51] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-02T23:00:42] Luis Magalhaes: In really curious of the diference of sensored vs sensoless ubox
[2021-09-02T23:01:10] Happy Giraffe: I would wanna feel the starting torque😔
[2021-09-02T23:01:17] Mirono escooters: Its great
[2021-09-02T23:02:32] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, it could be more powerful above 10 or 15kmh 😂
[2021-09-02T23:06:25] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_460@27-06-2021_14-59-39.jpg>
[2021-09-02T23:06:41] Luis Magalhaes: Could not start faster 😂
[2021-09-02T23:06:58] sombre_enfant: Its a scam if u sell/trade it as a g30 one, tell its snsc 2.3 it have nothing to do with other motor its not the same spec
[2021-09-02T23:10:06] sombre_enfant: Also for your bad thread monorim motor im kinda interested...
[2021-09-02T23:10:36] sombre_enfant: If hall and winding and price also correct
[2021-09-02T23:15:28] Happy Giraffe: Hmmmm, interesting
[2021-09-02T23:28:41] Luis Magalhaes: My motors don't have much torque too
[2021-09-03T00:03:59] Happy Giraffe: But you have dual?
[2021-09-03T00:14:40] Luis Magalhaes: Yes dual 1200w motors
[2021-09-03T00:14:53] Luis Magalhaes: 11" 60mm magnets
[2021-09-03T00:17:58] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-09-03T00:18:15] Happy Giraffe: I got one "1000w" motor 36mm magnets
[2021-09-03T00:23:59] Luis Magalhaes: Had started with a brushed scooter, upgrade to a xiaomi m365, then an ubgo 1005 , and now i have a wolf warrior 11
[2021-09-03T00:24:42] Luis Magalhaes: Your scooter with that single 1000w motor maybe is more powerfull then all my scooters except the wolf 😅 ao...
[2021-09-03T00:24:44] Luis Magalhaes: So...
[2021-09-03T00:26:50] Happy Giraffe: I wanna also bigger magnets, this 1000w motor is like 600-700w in reality
[2021-09-03T00:31:05] Luis Magalhaes: Never understand how they mesure the motor power, what i understand is they said the power the motor can do without getting too hot 😅
[2021-09-03T00:31:44] Luis Magalhaes: So the motors can do more power until it burn or saturate 😂
[2021-09-03T00:42:53] Happy Giraffe: In china it is measured: Bigger watt number than our competitors = more sales for us
[2021-09-03T01:48:59] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_929@03-09-2021_01-48-59.jpg>
[2021-09-03T01:49:34] Happy Giraffe: Spinted advertises their motor at 2x nominal haha, I wonder how would this be?

[2021-09-03T07:40:35] Mirono escooters: 🥰🥰
[2021-09-03T07:40:57] Mirono escooters: Would 10" fit
[2021-09-03T08:59:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: assembly count too..... 'standard dirty' motor
[2021-09-03T08:59:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://youtu.be/ktsmWUMiP88
[2021-09-03T08:59:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 'dirty' motor
[2021-09-03T08:59:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://youtu.be/uv7dTpnnLsg
[2021-09-03T09:00:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 'nice' motor
[2021-09-03T09:00:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://youtube.com/shorts/dOiQLuupsZs?feature=share
[2021-09-03T09:00:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤪🤪
[2021-09-03T09:43:24] Happy Giraffe: No idea
[2021-09-03T09:43:52] Happy Giraffe: I think maybe not
[2021-09-03T09:56:31] Unknown: Its nominal vs peak power, you often find this in subwoofers for examplefor in cars, they go (example) for a 400w rms 800w peak sub, with an 800w amplifier, i think it's more something like, it uses 400w to work properly and 800w max
[2021-09-03T10:03:23] Happy Giraffe: Yes but they advertising with peak power is funny
[2021-09-03T14:19:07] francois schempers: and him here, handling my motor with care, when they are just smacking the coils with a hammer until it fits into place xD
[2021-09-03T16:02:32] Unknown: True haha
[2021-09-03T16:32:12] Happy Giraffe: I think I know why my hall is fucked
[2021-09-03T16:32:45] Mirono escooters: Does vesc have a error log?
[2021-09-03T16:40:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not that I am aware of
[2021-09-03T16:41:03] Mirono escooters: So i need to ride until it errors on me and quickly look?
[2021-09-03T16:43:00] Mirono escooters: 2 questions for the goup My big internzl is beginning to be weird So their delta voltage is 30mv apart I draw 50A Their delta volt is 150mv.. It seems to be 1 cell row thats going lower then orthers But when i ride normal or stand still delta v is back normal Is this just weak spotweld? As if cells were bad id expect their delta v to be always lower. Not just during riding? When batt is almodt empty (3.1v) delta v is 80mv.. but thats at the end of soc. So doesnt bother me Let me know what you think. Or normal during riding? Misreading? 🤷‍♂️
[2021-09-03T16:45:12] sombre_enfant: Battery patterns i guess
[2021-09-03T16:47:23] Mirono escooters: Explain?🙈 Add more nickel? I find weird as its only 1 cell row thats abit lower When at end of batt % tho; delta v is 80 or so, then its 1 cell row.. maybe i should test the cells
[2021-09-03T17:40:31] Artem Bulashev: It does
[2021-09-03T17:40:46] Artem Bulashev: Well sort of
[2021-09-03T17:41:28] Artem Bulashev: Any device that is connected to it. Like phone or pc will be see if there is an error
[2021-09-03T17:41:30] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_930@03-09-2021_17-41-30.jpg>

[2021-09-03T17:41:50] Artem Bulashev: It will also log it locally than
[2021-09-03T17:42:18] Artem Bulashev: This app is called xmatic
[2021-09-03T17:42:56] Mirono escooters: Does it log when u connect?
[2021-09-03T17:43:01] Mirono escooters: Or always
[2021-09-03T17:43:28] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_932@03-09-2021_17-43-28.jpg>
[2021-09-03T17:43:33] Mirono escooters: Now monoshit hit disk
[2021-09-03T17:43:37] Artem Bulashev: When you are connected
[2021-09-03T17:43:42] Artem Bulashev: Vesc has no memory chip
[2021-09-03T17:43:48] Artem Bulashev: To store logs or profiles
[2021-09-03T17:43:58] Artem Bulashev: It’s all locally on your connected device
[2021-09-03T17:44:33] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-03T17:45:06] Mirono escooters: Faking shit Will use that vsett adaptor ._.
[2021-09-03T17:45:06] Happy Giraffe: Don't you want the caliper inside?
[2021-09-03T17:45:29] Mirono escooters: Suspension makes frame bit smoller Monoshit so thic it hits it
[2021-09-03T17:45:38] Mirono escooters: (Hits disk brake)
[2021-09-03T17:45:49] Mirono escooters: Lets desolder motor wires. . again :)
[2021-09-03T17:46:03] Mirono escooters: And get this shit piece off
[2021-09-03T17:46:30] Happy Giraffe: Just need different caliper holder
[2021-09-03T17:46:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nothing internal, we agree ? (i mean without BLE)
[2021-09-03T17:48:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it has flash (1Mb) but it's only issue for app storage, no logs.
[2021-09-03T17:48:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😉😉
[2021-09-03T17:48:59] Mirono escooters: I should work on cable management. Lol
[2021-09-03T17:49:26] Happy Giraffe: Zipties
[2021-09-03T17:49:29] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2021-09-03T17:49:40] Mirono escooters: And glue these shit leds as their glue is already loosening
[2021-09-03T17:50:02] Mirono escooters: I got ideas, but when i do them its always worse then in my mind
[2021-09-03T17:50:31] Happy Giraffe: If you need glue that stays then double component😂 but its real fight to get off
[2021-09-03T17:50:45] Mirono escooters: Good idea+
[2021-09-03T17:50:55] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_933@03-09-2021_17-50-55.jpg>
[2021-09-03T17:51:09] Mirono escooters: Good thing i didnt silicon it sjut yet.. lol
[2021-09-03T17:51:19] Mirono escooters: Winter comes. Ill have yo
[2021-09-03T17:51:20] Happy Giraffe: Why you have leds there lmao?
[2021-09-03T17:51:25] Mirono escooters: Clear bottom
[2021-09-03T17:51:30] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_934@03-09-2021_17-51-30.jpg>
[2021-09-03T17:51:33] Mirono escooters: Sorry top
[2021-09-03T17:51:36] Mirono escooters: :)
[2021-09-03T17:51:38] Happy Giraffe: Aaah
[2021-09-03T17:51:41] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-03T17:51:57] Mirono escooters: Its kinda cuul. But i shouldnt be cheap ass and get real strong leds not this shit
[2021-09-03T17:52:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: how fat is the plexiglass ? 5mm ? more ? it doesn't bend ?
[2021-09-03T17:52:00] Mirono escooters: At night its cuul
[2021-09-03T17:52:03] Mirono escooters: 6pm
[2021-09-03T17:52:04] Mirono escooters: 6mm
[2021-09-03T17:52:06] Mirono escooters: Doesnt bend
[2021-09-03T17:52:09] Mirono escooters: (50kg)
[2021-09-03T17:52:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: excellent. thanks
[2021-09-03T17:52:32] Mirono escooters: And if it does it can rest on battery :) ( not optimal yeahhh but shared load on holders)
[2021-09-03T17:52:35] Mirono escooters: But it doesnt. So :)
[2021-09-03T17:53:04] Mirono escooters: Hard to waterproof without being permanent.. silicon ig..
[2021-09-03T17:53:24] Happy Giraffe: But do you want to have kapton wrapped battery showing like this?😂
[2021-09-03T17:53:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah. It's perfect. I've just finished my first plexi deck design. I'll test on a thin wood piece (3mm), then I'll order a plexi 5mm with laser cut
[2021-09-03T17:53:53] Happy Giraffe: You could do a thin layer of something on top of battery so it would be clean
[2021-09-03T17:53:55] Mirono escooters: I like it! U can see my battery. Its cool for non tech people
[2021-09-03T17:54:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_935@03-09-2021_17-54-04.jpg>
[2021-09-03T17:54:08] Mirono escooters: I did plexiglass so ppl could see my shit inside :)
[2021-09-03T17:54:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-09-03T17:54:23] Happy Giraffe: Could even put something reflective to boost leds
[2021-09-03T17:54:23] Mirono escooters: I can always give u dimensions
[2021-09-03T17:54:43] Mirono escooters: I hoped frame would do it I tried leds directly on top of batteries shining up Was too much imo
[2021-09-03T17:55:00] Mirono escooters: Too strong leds didnt hahe anything to spread light
[2021-09-03T17:55:16] Mirono escooters: I will order new leds i think... project costed me a lot. Dont wannz cheap on ledz
[2021-09-03T17:55:58] Mirono escooters: Or leave these. Idk. Its already nice. Lol
[2021-09-03T17:56:03] Happy Giraffe: I got 15€ (10€ on sale) 5 meter rgb leds with controller and remote on my ceiling lol
[2021-09-03T17:56:15] Unknown: Don't do it
[2021-09-03T17:56:18] Mirono escooters: These were 15€ for 15 meter or so
[2021-09-03T17:56:25] Unknown: I tried it breaks
[2021-09-03T17:56:29] Happy Giraffe: Stuff became cheap now
[2021-09-03T17:56:34] Mirono escooters: Not here. Fine for a month
[2021-09-03T17:56:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: about what ? wood or plexiglass ?
[2021-09-03T17:56:47] Mirono escooters: Well. Not waterproof and shit to diffuse light
[2021-09-03T17:56:54] Unknown: Plexi
[2021-09-03T17:57:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ??? 5mm on the top will break ???
[2021-09-03T17:57:17] Mirono escooters: I considered a frosted top. But then u cant see shit
[2021-09-03T17:57:24] Happy Giraffe: If your deck is waterproof then why not? Condensation might happen tho
[2021-09-03T17:57:27] Unknown: I tried 6 mm plexy it's not good for things where force is involved
[2021-09-03T17:57:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I don’t think we can consider 1mb to be a memory in 2021 🤣
[2021-09-03T17:57:38] Artem Bulashev: Yeap we do
[2021-09-03T17:57:44] Artem Bulashev: ❤️
[2021-09-03T17:57:45] sombre_enfant: Use dualtron but need to re thread and use screw bolt thread locker or do a piece with angle grinder and drill
[2021-09-03T17:57:45] Mirono escooters: Poor thing gets discriminated
[2021-09-03T17:57:52] Happy Giraffe: Get bulletproof glass, problem solved
[2021-09-03T17:58:01] Mirono escooters: Link? And size
[2021-09-03T17:58:05] Unknown: Yeah the only option
[2021-09-03T17:58:05] Mirono escooters: I rlly rlly want rear brake..
[2021-09-03T17:58:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: SHIT !!
[2021-09-03T17:58:30] Mirono escooters: Accidentally i did 20A overcurrent on charge.. i had to brake hard . Bms cutted out.. almost crashed lol.
[2021-09-03T17:58:43] Artem Bulashev: Is it self made frame?
[2021-09-03T17:58:45] Mirono escooters: +++ for vesc Battery cutted out Vesc didnt kill itself like xiaomi
[2021-09-03T17:58:53] Mirono escooters: G30 rental
[2021-09-03T17:58:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: impossible, I need to bend it. (with heat gun)
[2021-09-03T17:58:59] Mirono escooters: For me its been fine.. 🤷‍♂️
[2021-09-03T17:59:17] Mirono escooters: It has a lot of place to rest on in rental frame. And u could design stands or just on battery to suppott it
[2021-09-03T17:59:19] sombre_enfant: Dualtron 2/spider need to rework it
[2021-09-03T17:59:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I don't really have choice. I'll go 6mm then.
[2021-09-03T17:59:38] Artem Bulashev: Good idea 🙃🙃
[2021-09-03T17:59:54] Mirono escooters: This shit like a torque arm
[2021-09-03T17:59:58] Happy Giraffe: You might be able to make a small support in middle?
[2021-09-03T18:00:03] Mirono escooters: ?*
[2021-09-03T18:00:19] Mirono escooters: Yea sure. Was my plan but it bends 0mm lol. Its perfectly possible
[2021-09-03T18:00:29] Mirono escooters: Rework what? How?
[2021-09-03T18:00:46] sombre_enfant: Same issue cant put it on these shitty suspension be carreful bro on how u mounted it, red thread locker every where too
[2021-09-03T18:01:14] Happy Giraffe: That went fine on my Monorim fork👀
[2021-09-03T18:01:53] Mirono escooters: Works for me too..
[2021-09-03T18:02:15] sombre_enfant: Thread are too small they explode dont even need to tight it a bit, need to drill then tap again in m6 its better imo, its just poor aluminium so add a nut so it cant go away...
[2021-09-03T18:02:32] Mirono escooters: I hard braked a few times to check if ebrake worked. Then i heard grererrr Apperantly axle spun 45*..😳 Need all the help i can get. Its powerful
[2021-09-03T18:02:36] Mirono escooters: Aa easy shit
[2021-09-03T18:02:41] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2021-09-03T18:02:57] Mirono escooters: Thanks i rlly want a mechanical brake
[2021-09-03T18:03:29] sombre_enfant: A good front always better but cant really adapt on this fork
[2021-09-03T18:03:31] Happy Giraffe: Yes...real nice to have a beefy brake on front
[2021-09-03T18:03:52] sombre_enfant: Rear is just good to slide or balance
[2021-09-03T18:04:44] Happy Giraffe: Yep, 20% power only there
[2021-09-03T18:05:21] sombre_enfant: https://a.aliexpress.com/_vnJ1Ru dt2/spider Got my two refunded beacause off shit aluminium
[2021-09-03T18:06:05] sombre_enfant: Steel is better for brake work...
[2021-09-03T18:06:08] Mirono escooters: My hero
[2021-09-03T18:06:20] Mirono escooters: I got that drum brake?..
[2021-09-03T18:06:58] sombre_enfant: I gonna do my second addapter and direct weld it so no more bolt issue
[2021-09-03T18:06:59] Mirono escooters: I cutted brake cable of drum. Lol
[2021-09-03T18:07:05] Mirono escooters: Weld 🥰
[2021-09-03T18:07:30] Mirono escooters: Is drum any decent otherwise ill use that? How do i even attzch brake cable to it. Its over engineered
[2021-09-03T18:08:36] sombre_enfant: Drum is good
[2021-09-03T18:08:54] sombre_enfant: But rear disk better
[2021-09-03T18:09:08] Mirono escooters: O fak i already sealed this shit. Cant get another brake czble through internal
[2021-09-03T18:09:38] Mirono escooters: And external cable will be ugly af
[2021-09-03T18:09:52] sombre_enfant: Rear suspension is dangerous asl i had some serious issue with
[2021-09-03T18:10:05] Mirono escooters: Ill test it :)
[2021-09-03T18:10:38] sombre_enfant: Make sure u put the axle on the right position
[2021-09-03T18:10:44] Mirono escooters: Is light easy to get out? I can rederect brake wire through it. Lol
[2021-09-03T18:10:47] Mirono escooters: Did thzt
[2021-09-03T18:11:34] Mirono escooters: Ill see if i can get brake cable through. Will be a challenge
[2021-09-03T18:11:48] sombre_enfant: Like dat
[2021-09-03T18:12:10] sombre_enfant: Otherwise it always get loose
[2021-09-03T18:12:30] Mirono escooters: Did it
[2021-09-03T18:12:33] Mirono escooters: Tightened hard
[2021-09-03T18:12:53] Mirono escooters: I got so much luck today!
[2021-09-03T18:12:59] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_938@03-09-2021_18-12-59.jpg>
[2021-09-03T18:13:04] Mirono escooters: Doesnt fit either
[2021-09-03T18:13:14] Mirono escooters: Need to washer it... thats horrible for stability
[2021-09-03T18:20:07] Mirono escooters: And included fender too thin for this motor and hits tire. Lol
[2021-09-03T18:21:28] Happy Giraffe: Not possible to make threaded holes here?
[2021-09-03T18:23:08] Mirono escooters: Too far up
[2021-09-03T18:40:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not really. filled with battery
[2021-09-03T18:40:34] Happy Giraffe: Hmm
[2021-09-03T18:41:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: first test with wood piece
[2021-09-03T18:41:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_940@03-09-2021_18-41-07.jpg>
[2021-09-03T18:41:23] Happy Giraffe: You made a skateboard😂
[2021-09-03T18:41:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: boosted rev is already a skateboard 🤪
[2021-09-03T18:42:49] Mirono escooters: Looks nicr
[2021-09-03T18:42:53] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_941@03-09-2021_18-42-53.jpg>
[2021-09-03T18:42:58] Mirono escooters: Hope this stops all wayer.. lol
[2021-09-03T18:43:05] Mirono escooters: (Prob not)
[2021-09-03T18:52:17] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>

[2021-09-03T18:53:05] Mirono escooters: Rip rack :(
[2021-09-03T18:53:19] Mirono escooters: Even with ridiculous spacers it will hit it when i ride
[2021-09-03T20:22:31] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_943@03-09-2021_20-22-31.jpg>
[2021-09-03T20:22:47] Mirono escooters: 1200w motor Before it was 45Aish Now 36 What? 😅
[2021-09-03T20:24:05] Mirono escooters: Almost impossible i already killed it kinda. Never road longer then10 mins
[2021-09-03T20:24:12] Mirono escooters: Will test ride lol
[2021-09-03T20:24:32] Happy Giraffe: The estimated amps doesnt matter
[2021-09-03T20:24:36] Happy Giraffe: Its retarded
[2021-09-03T20:25:00] Happy Giraffe: Try 90A phase and try if motor gets hot
[2021-09-03T20:25:19] Mirono escooters: Me ran 150 before
[2021-09-03T20:25:25] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-03T20:25:30] Mirono escooters: Think i triggered overcurrent from flipsky
[2021-09-03T20:25:36] Mirono escooters: Now 120. Will test. And push it hard
[2021-09-03T20:25:41] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2021-09-03T20:25:58] Happy Giraffe: 105A almost overheated my 1000w garbage
[2021-09-03T20:26:38] Mirono escooters: Feel like 1200w is good qualoty. Doesnt overheat shit
[2021-09-03T20:26:38] Happy Giraffe: In theory I should get more torque from Vsett motor with bigger magnets using same amps?🤔
[2021-09-03T20:27:15] Happy Giraffe: I weight 90kg with all gear so it has to accelerate more mass
[2021-09-03T20:27:37] Happy Giraffe: Also wind is a huge factor
[2021-09-03T20:27:44] Mirono escooters: Cznt find on android lol
[2021-09-03T20:27:50] Mirono escooters: Fair
[2021-09-03T20:28:37] sombre_enfant: What protection u guy use ? I dont have any and i glt hit by dumb mofo many time...
[2021-09-03T20:28:51] Mirono escooters: Helmet and gloved
[2021-09-03T20:28:59] Mirono escooters: Flipsky blinks But vesc tools gives no error
[2021-09-03T20:32:22] Mirono escooters: Blink 2 times Wait 3 times
[2021-09-03T20:33:49] Mirono escooters: Fault_code_drv :?????
[2021-09-03T20:36:50] sombre_enfant: The lordy lord dead drv chip🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
[2021-09-03T20:37:02] Mirono escooters: But it rides?..
[2021-09-03T20:37:18] Mirono escooters: Shit works fine if i accelerate slowly.. if i do instantly.. not
[2021-09-03T20:37:31] Mirono escooters: Its a split second too. Had to record to see error
[2021-09-03T20:38:35] Mirono escooters: Oki no, horrible sounds. Can only ride slowly and careful. Whatefok
[2021-09-03T20:41:59] Mirono escooters: Its like its gettting out of sinc if that makes sense?..
[2021-09-03T20:45:34] Mirono escooters: Fault code drive now..
[2021-09-03T20:45:46] Mirono escooters: It literally worked fine before until i decided to mount suspension
[2021-09-03T20:46:03] Mirono escooters: "Fine" it rode just cutted out at max throttle from 0 start..
[2021-09-03T20:46:30] Mirono escooters: Nvm still drv Ill go cry
[2021-09-03T20:46:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: which flipsky is it ?
[2021-09-03T20:48:15] Mirono escooters: 4.2
[2021-09-03T20:48:15] Mirono escooters: Bldc mode works.. lol
[2021-09-03T20:48:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🙈🙈
[2021-09-03T20:48:44] Mirono escooters: Fuuck bldc is loud
[2021-09-03T20:49:08] Mirono escooters: But bldc is sensored too? It works😅
[2021-09-03T20:49:22] Mirono escooters: So halls are good..
[2021-09-03T20:49:53] Mirono escooters: Maybe 150a phase was a bit overkill.. still doesnt explain why it doesnt work at all now. I resoldered phase wires and did motor test again. This shit could fucked it up? Idk
[2021-09-03T20:55:25] Unknown: Fun fun fun...
[2021-09-03T20:55:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 150A for a 4.2 ?????
[2021-09-03T20:55:32] Mirono escooters: Maaybe
[2021-09-03T20:55:44] Mirono escooters: It worked and mosfets are still zlive
[2021-09-03T20:55:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: did you check the mosfet specs ?
[2021-09-03T20:55:57] Mirono escooters: Well. Non existent
[2021-09-03T20:56:14] Mirono escooters: It cant be that a different phase connection makes foc dont work right?
[2021-09-03T20:56:38] Mirono escooters: Ig foc was dying and now is dead.. still find it weird it worked fine and now randomly not at all Bldc it is. At abit lower amps. Lol
[2021-09-03T20:56:50] Mirono escooters: Bldc is loud at start but quiter at higher speed
[2021-09-03T20:59:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: when I had such issue, it was a dead mosfet : FOC dead / BLDC working but with high noise and low torque
[2021-09-03T21:04:05] Mirono escooters: It has a lot of torque for me
[2021-09-03T21:04:15] Mirono escooters: Just high noise (wigh i thought is normal for bldc)
[2021-09-03T21:04:27] Mirono escooters: Fak. Maybe 150a waq abit too much. Who would have thought that
[2021-09-03T21:04:56] Mirono escooters: I also think i noticed less torque then before But i thouggt its in my mind as i got used to it? (This is still questionable)
[2021-09-03T21:05:35] Happy Giraffe: Full moto gear, except for boots haha
[2021-09-03T21:06:21] Mirono escooters: Can i check mosfets easily @koxx3 to be sure?
[2021-09-03T21:06:54] Happy Giraffe: Flipsky spec is that it works for 2 months max and then dies to a chip-attack
[2021-09-03T21:07:19] Mirono escooters: I suspect dead chip now Faaak.. :(
[2021-09-03T21:07:27] Mirono escooters: I can never get shit working
[2021-09-03T21:07:36] Happy Giraffe: Even ubox cant do 150 lmao, how would worst vesc on market pull that?👀
[2021-09-03T21:08:00] Mirono escooters: Well theres my answer
[2021-09-03T21:08:06] Mirono escooters: It cant
[2021-09-03T21:08:33] Happy Giraffe: Time to update my pepe.jpg

[2021-09-03T21:09:48] Happy Giraffe: We are on the same boat
[2021-09-03T21:09:57] Happy Giraffe: Try Spintend single
[2021-09-03T21:10:24] Mirono escooters: How much € is that?
[2021-09-03T21:10:34] Happy Giraffe: 150$~125€
[2021-09-03T21:10:39] Mirono escooters: :(
[2021-09-03T21:10:54] Happy Giraffe: Atleast they honor warranty
[2021-09-03T21:11:04] Mirono escooters: Maybe ill just go gt100 display and thic esc :(
[2021-09-03T21:11:12] Mirono escooters: Ill think. Im too sad now
[2021-09-03T21:11:23] Mirono escooters: Bldc for now i think :) i sound like race car
[2021-09-03T21:11:56] Happy Giraffe: Monorim 500w with Xiaomi esc and 2000w also loud as hell, I miss that sound.
[2021-09-03T21:12:08] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi esc is loud lol
[2021-09-03T21:12:14] Mirono escooters: Vesc was 🥰
[2021-09-03T21:15:26] Happy Giraffe: FOC was really quiet, so quiet people cant hear me coming
[2021-09-03T21:18:52] Mirono escooters: Was until it died on me :)
[2021-09-03T21:19:25] Happy Giraffe: I cant wait to test HFI, so annoying to stop riding again
[2021-09-03T21:26:25] Mirono escooters: jolan de drone cmon lets already make our own vesc
[2021-09-03T21:26:34] Mirono escooters: I got a lot of backup scoots. Lol

[2021-09-03T22:19:59] francois schempers: yeah, dont go for baguette, take a pain de campagne ;)
[2021-09-03T22:20:23] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-03T22:21:42] francois schempers: xD
[2021-09-03T23:16:22] Mirono escooters: So spintend 100a max How much phase
[2021-09-03T23:45:05] Artem Bulashev: 125a max phase on Spintend Ubox On single start with 115 and work your way up (because it’s less known for now) don’t go above 130 on either
[2021-09-03T23:46:01] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2021-09-03T23:47:02] Mirono escooters: I got 3 options -Try bldc (i still think some foc chip died) -repair whatever died with jolan dead esc Go spintend

[2021-09-04T01:30:27] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-04T01:31:19] Artem Bulashev: 3mm solid copper 👌👌 will lay two of those from negative of the battery to the BMS 👌 (one from 4p center and one from other 4p center, for equal draw 😊)
[2021-09-04T01:31:39] Artem Bulashev: Will be like this but 16s8p (6 cells long)
[2021-09-04T01:31:56] Happy Giraffe: Now we are talking 👀
[2021-09-04T01:32:15] Happy Giraffe: And 21700 cells?
[2021-09-04T01:32:26] Happy Giraffe: 48G?
[2021-09-04T04:15:46] Artem Bulashev: 18650 35e 8p = 28ah. They produce same amount of Wh as 21700 50g 5p under proportional amount of amps pulls (80a is 10a per cell on 35e config and 16a if 50g config) So 18650 make more sense for me, 6p 21700 would be extremely hard to fit. But will see May end up selling this pack once done.
[2021-09-04T04:21:58] Artem Bulashev: Actually when you compare them 8p 18650 35e win in wh over 50g 5p (which are already best low current 21700 cells 0-10a loads)
[2021-09-04T04:22:15] Artem Bulashev: If only I could fit 6p 👀
[2021-09-04T04:24:37] Artem Bulashev: Also under 60-80a load 35e 8p would heat up less than 21700 50 p5 would
[2021-09-04T08:32:39] Happy Giraffe: Sexy, I got same 13s6p and 7p.
[2021-09-04T09:08:09] sombre_enfant: Best 21700 are the 40t or molicell p42a ?
[2021-09-04T09:19:17] Happy Giraffe: Less capacity
[2021-09-04T09:41:28] Mirono escooters: How do you guys attach a ebrake sensor to regular brake? Any pictures? Is it decent?
[2021-09-04T11:08:23] Happy Giraffe: @artBula any chance for us to buy vsett 10 motor with reasonable shipping?
[2021-09-04T11:08:56] Happy Giraffe: Also if there are some schematic for motor dimensions where the brake disc sits would be nice
[2021-09-04T11:09:34] Happy Giraffe: I think Im gonna slap the thermal paste in and go for maximum phase
[2021-09-04T11:09:51] Happy Giraffe: With regular you mean cable brake?
[2021-09-04T11:10:01] Mirono escooters: Ive tried Didnt work well as u could see yesterday
[2021-09-04T11:10:08] Mirono escooters: Ye And attach ebrake to it
[2021-09-04T11:10:44] Happy Giraffe: I can send you cable brake lever with closer sensor 5€+shipping
[2021-09-04T11:10:46] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-04T11:12:31] sombre_enfant: But about Discharge rate its better and cheaper ? U can go 5/4p and still have good Discharge and capacity
[2021-09-04T11:12:53] Happy Giraffe: I think he doesn't need that much discharge
[2021-09-04T11:13:01] Happy Giraffe: I don't either
[2021-09-04T11:42:50] Mirono escooters: Picture?😇😊
[2021-09-04T11:43:11] francois schempers: i just use stock Xiaomi bracks
[2021-09-04T11:43:34] Mirono escooters: I want something cuuler
[2021-09-04T11:50:51] francois schempers: paint it orange 🤣🤣
[2021-09-04T11:52:04] Happy Giraffe: I would suggest using Xiaomi stock lever and then hydro on other side
[2021-09-04T11:52:43] Happy Giraffe: Even tho I had to put xiaomi lever on right it seems fine
[2021-09-04T11:54:27] Happy Giraffe: Or, if you have space for bigger front caliper you could have two cable discs and those on/off levers
[2021-09-04T11:54:52] Happy Giraffe: I can sell TRP Spyke brake for 50€😂 best mechanical disk brake ever made thats comparable to some entry level hydros
[2021-09-04T15:42:10] Happy Giraffe: Would be so nice to slap some big ass motor with vesc here. Deck seems huge aswell
[2021-09-04T19:43:52] Mirono escooters: So i test rode At low speeds high frequency noise with bldc Higher speeds its quiet enough Works fine. Top speed fine. Acceleration fine. Seems good.
[2021-09-04T19:44:10] Mirono escooters: Ps wich setting i do for sensorless? Will test if hall is ded (Or can I test hall)
[2021-09-04T19:49:39] Happy Giraffe: If cables are good and vesc cant find hall then its propably ded
[2021-09-04T19:49:56] Mirono escooters: It detect hall
[2021-09-04T19:50:00] Happy Giraffe: For sensorless you dont need any setting other than FOC and sensorless mode
[2021-09-04T19:50:09] Mirono escooters: But idk if hall chip or wjatever if ded I cant seem to select sensorless mode?
[2021-09-04T19:50:30] Happy Giraffe: Run FOC motor wizard
[2021-09-04T19:50:46] Happy Giraffe: Should be able to do sensorless after that
[2021-09-04T19:53:50] Mirono escooters: Oka

[2021-09-04T23:22:01] Unknown: I bought 2 of them for dual....
[2021-09-04T23:22:15] Mirono escooters: Jep good motors
[2021-09-04T23:22:29] Mirono escooters: Hope this one hall sensor still works :) will see tomorrow

[2021-09-04T23:42:30] Happy Giraffe: Could use some skateboard motor haha
[2021-09-04T23:43:23] Mirono escooters: I got a driftbike i gotta finish. Will get this motor
[2021-09-04T23:43:27] Mirono escooters: Or lookalike
[2021-09-04T23:45:02] Happy Giraffe: Thats cool, with those geared motors with chain on belt we could get great balance of torque and speed
[2021-09-04T23:45:56] Mirono escooters: Yes true. And adjust for urself "I want more torque/speed" New gear
[2021-09-04T23:46:17] Mirono escooters: But gearless >gears
[2021-09-04T23:46:23] Happy Giraffe: And preferably with belt you would have little to no maintenance
[2021-09-04T23:46:26] Happy Giraffe: Yeahh
[2021-09-04T23:47:31] Mirono escooters: Its bigger too
[2021-09-04T23:47:51] Mirono escooters: I got a smol kids bike here with a motor like that. But brushed andd 500w. But fun thing
[2021-09-05T00:17:27] Happy Giraffe: I wanna do bicycle with scooter motor and 12" tire in rear
[2021-09-05T01:17:48] Artem Bulashev: Has started 😜 it’s f hard to bend sendwish evenly 😅

[2021-09-05T02:14:31] Artem Bulashev: i don't have any 3s bigger than 450mah, so I powered logic from distribution board with 4 of 450mah
[2021-09-05T02:16:15] Artem Bulashev: its all safe just not preaty to look at due to improviside solution - but choice was either spend 1h impprovising or going to sleep and waiting 2 weeks for proper battery to arrive

[2021-09-05T02:17:51] Happy Giraffe: Was about to say Moscow never sleeps but you not in there😂
[2021-09-05T02:18:43] Artem Bulashev: yeah same one from last time. nice and cleanly applied, I won't be dismounting this apck for few years, so if I will need to swap one cell or a few it wont be much if an issue in my type of layout.
[2021-09-05T02:18:55] Artem Bulashev: :DD

[2021-09-05T14:08:17] Mirono escooters: 1 anyone got idea where I can find them? Killed em
[2021-09-05T14:08:39] Mirono escooters: Second. I got 41f from xiaomi. But they are a tad bigger. Can I just make groove of them bit bigger?😬
[2021-09-05T14:12:00] Mirono escooters: Me don't get it why middle one is different brand.
[2021-09-05T14:12:25] Mirono escooters: But i don't need to replace that one I need to replace the 2 others :)
[2021-09-05T14:12:30] Mirono escooters: Ig I can use 41f too
[2021-09-05T14:13:40] Artem Bulashev: How can one kill hall sensors?? Over heat?
[2021-09-05T14:13:55] Mirono escooters: Idk.. I think they shorted when cables ripped?
[2021-09-05T14:14:33] Artem Bulashev: Oh for sure
[2021-09-05T14:14:34] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-09-05T14:14:36] Mirono escooters: CL
[2021-09-05T14:14:39] Mirono escooters: :(*
[2021-09-05T14:14:52] Mirono escooters: Gotta get em out without force or excessive heat.. lol
[2021-09-05T15:01:07] Happy Giraffe: I killed mine when riding first 20km lol
[2021-09-05T15:01:12] Happy Giraffe: Just defect motor
[2021-09-05T15:01:21] Mirono escooters: Maybe it's easy fix. Could b loose hall sensor
[2021-09-05T15:01:28] Mirono escooters: I've seen on xiaomi it was loose inside
[2021-09-05T15:01:30] Happy Giraffe: They were all in place
[2021-09-05T15:01:34] Mirono escooters: Fixing hall isn't too difficult
[2021-09-05T15:01:38] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_959@05-09-2021_15-01-38.jpg>
[2021-09-05T15:01:44] Mirono escooters: Hope supaglue holds.. 😬😬
[2021-09-05T15:30:16] Mirono escooters: Well.. still doesn't work
[2021-09-05T15:30:34] Mirono escooters: Blue works but did before Green and yellow just constantly output 2v?🤔🤷‍♂️
[2021-09-05T15:30:46] Unknown: Did you use the same sensors 1s it did before?
[2021-09-05T15:30:55] Mirono escooters: No 🙈
[2021-09-05T15:31:05] Mirono escooters: But principe is same. Hall sensor is hall sensor. Used 41f
[2021-09-05T15:31:15] Mirono escooters: Maybe I putted backwards or whatever. Lol
[2021-09-05T15:31:18] Unknown: Or maybe a wire with a bad connection where it ripped? And ni it does make a diff
[2021-09-05T15:31:26] Mirono escooters: Well 2 aren't working so
[2021-09-05T15:31:37] Mirono escooters: I'm done with it. Will just wait for replacement.. 🥴
[2021-09-05T15:31:47] Unknown: A had r43 in my xiaomi motor, i out r41 in because i had those lying around didnt work
[2021-09-05T15:32:00] Unknown: Placed an r43 and it worked fine
[2021-09-05T15:32:06] Mirono escooters: R43 is middle sensor R41 is 2 side ones
[2021-09-05T15:32:13] Mirono escooters: I cant find the ones in g30. Lol
[2021-09-05T15:32:19] Unknown: Mine was all r43 :o
[2021-09-05T15:32:27] Mirono escooters: @Mister_Lithium do you know wich sensor g30 uses?
[2021-09-05T15:32:36] Unknown: I got 250w xiaomi motot
[2021-09-05T15:32:37] Mirono escooters: Still 41f should work, no? Idk. I'm not an expert..
[2021-09-05T15:33:10] Unknown: Either am i, i just know that a different hall did'nt work for me haha had to be the exact same one
[2021-09-05T15:33:25] Mirono escooters: Oki will try to find same one 🤔🤔
[2021-09-05T15:33:32] Unknown: Did'nt it say wich one on the sensor? :o
[2021-09-05T15:34:07] Artem Bulashev: I never imagined that it would be SO f hard to get this cell alignment perfectly flat folded 👀 and not to have like a mm gap…. Damm… sandwich copper /nickel is not helping to make it easier to bend evenly
[2021-09-05T15:34:34] Mirono escooters: Yea I typed above. But not available online
[2021-09-05T15:34:55] Unknown: Ohh sucks xo
[2021-09-05T15:35:03] Mirono escooters: Mr lithium problably knows
[2021-09-05T15:35:16] Unknown: True :p he has a g30 to
[2021-09-05T15:39:08] Mirono escooters: Hes smort. Let's wait for him
[2021-09-05T15:42:45] Unknown: Indeed :p
[2021-09-05T15:58:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Remember, those need to be switch hall sensors
[2021-09-05T15:58:40] Mirono escooters: Bipolar?
[2021-09-05T16:00:05] Face de Pin Sucé: There are hall sensors that have two states 0V or 5V And hall sensors that modulate voltage with magnetic field (like on throttle), be sure you used first version and not the second one.
[2021-09-05T16:00:33] Mirono escooters: 41f is used in xiaomi so I'd think its the correct one
[2021-09-05T16:00:46] Mirono escooters: It just constantly gives 2v tho.. so maybe its wrong one. 🥴
[2021-09-05T16:02:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, SS41F should be okay
[2021-09-05T16:02:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe you got dead ones
[2021-09-05T16:04:05] Mirono escooters: They are new. And 2 I would find weird
[2021-09-05T16:04:15] Mirono escooters: Maybe orientation is wrong? 🥴
[2021-09-05T16:04:29] Face de Pin Sucé: I bought 10 hall sensors on amazon last time, all dead
[2021-09-05T16:04:36] Mirono escooters: Rlly?
[2021-09-05T16:04:39] Mirono escooters: These worked before
[2021-09-05T16:04:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah
[2021-09-05T16:05:05] Mirono escooters: Aaaa headaches
[2021-09-05T16:05:59] Mirono escooters: I'm too tired to dissasemble it again..
[2021-09-05T16:06:19] Mirono escooters: Do the text need to be readable or other way around?
[2021-09-05T16:09:41] Face de Pin Sucé: I always put the text facing me, but I don't know if it matters to be honest
[2021-09-05T16:10:12] Mirono escooters: I think I did other way around. Lemme swap that 🥴
[2021-09-05T16:27:55] Unknown: Sensor for what ..???
[2021-09-05T16:39:28] Mirono escooters: G30 motor
[2021-09-05T16:42:10] Artem Bulashev: Hall I assume
[2021-09-05T16:49:35] Unknown: Working sorry
[2021-09-05T16:52:51] Mirono escooters: Don't worry
[2021-09-05T16:53:05] Mirono escooters: This shit has no hurry. Been doing it for 5 days
[2021-09-05T17:01:32] Mirono escooters: Before I try again d9es hall sensor orientation matter
[2021-09-05T18:45:33] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 how straight did you manage to make yours ? I assembled by 2 series. And than connected 2+2 series and than folded back to be 2 series high and added last 2x series… surprisingly second (adding 5-6s) actually straighter than the first 2+2 (red arrow … Is there a technic I’m missing on?
[2021-09-05T18:45:36] Artem Bulashev: @Mister_Lithium
[2021-09-05T18:46:13] Artem Bulashev: How do you assemble such lay out to make it super straight ?
[2021-09-05T18:46:53] Unknown: You need a straight wood piece...
[2021-09-05T18:47:23] Unknown: I use a chess box...
[2021-09-05T18:49:06] Artem Bulashev: But I mean how do you assemble it 6s long with
[2021-09-05T18:49:17] Artem Bulashev: I would watch video on that 😁😁👌
[2021-09-05T18:51:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, i used wood 'box' preparation to align them correctly.
[2021-09-05T18:51:37] Artem Bulashev: I did find a way to make them super flat between cells, may be
[2021-09-05T18:51:37] Artem Bulashev: No gap between folds, but it’s a paint to make it this way
[2021-09-05T18:51:44] Artem Bulashev: Can you show me
[2021-09-05T18:53:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's not at home. but i didn't push them hard to make thel touch. the opposit un fact. i added a layer of epoxy to avoid the positivz touching the negative. i want the current to always flow through the nickel.
[2021-09-05T18:54:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_964@05-09-2021_18-54-17.jpg>
[2021-09-05T18:54:24] Artem Bulashev: Wow
[2021-09-05T18:54:34] Artem Bulashev: What for ?
[2021-09-05T18:54:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i want to avoid intermitant touch
[2021-09-05T18:55:27] Artem Bulashev: But it makes no sense
[2021-09-05T18:55:35] Artem Bulashev: Nickel is attached to the other side any way
[2021-09-05T18:55:57] Artem Bulashev: So if anything it will be nickel strip it self that got though o ring and isolation and shorted cell
[2021-09-05T18:56:23] Artem Bulashev: But thanks 👌
[2021-09-05T18:57:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think if it touch with a shorter path (and resistance), the current will try to flow there event if it a smart touch, and (from my point of view), it could damage the nickel. really not sure it's usefull, but why not 🤣🤣
[2021-09-05T18:58:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but i am not speaking about +/- of the same cell. sorry, difficult to explain
[2021-09-05T19:04:31] sombre_enfant: Still havent get a tracking on ali vesc @artBula @Mirono_escooters
[2021-09-05T19:04:42] Mirono escooters: Neither
[2021-09-05T19:05:11] sombre_enfant: It get closed in 1 days
[2021-09-05T19:12:15] Artem Bulashev: 39.5mm after tighteningwith fish paper 6s 👌= 65.8mm per series Cell with o ring = 65.3 Copper 0.1*2+ nickel 0.1*2=0.4mm Total average of air gap = 0.1mm 😍😍
[2021-09-05T19:33:07] Unknown: Aceton????
[2021-09-05T19:41:40] Happy Giraffe: @artBula You heard anythin about the Vsett motor?👀
[2021-09-05T19:58:25] Artem Bulashev: Yeah why? This marble table about 3.5m long :) it is at least 1.5m away from spot welder and there is nothing in proximity of batteries to cause short circuit 👌 everything is in its own plastic box
[2021-09-05T19:59:04] Unknown: I'm just asking for what???
[2021-09-05T19:59:12] Mirono escooters: Aceton isn't even conductive lol
[2021-09-05T19:59:22] Artem Bulashev: Oh I though you mean flammable - danger
[2021-09-05T19:59:37] Unknown: Nooo the purpose??
[2021-09-05T20:00:00] Unknown: Cleaning??
[2021-09-05T20:00:02] Mirono escooters: Mr lithium u kno g30 hall sensor name?
[2021-09-05T20:00:11] Unknown: No
[2021-09-05T20:00:22] Mirono escooters: :(
[2021-09-05T20:00:50] Artem Bulashev: I used it to dissolve the double sided tape or some kind of adhesive that 4s li-po has between s packs. Just few drops of aceton wait 3 min and cells separate almost them self 👌
[2021-09-05T20:01:22] Mirono escooters: I used 41f 1 "works " but only gives 2v not 5v 1 doesn't do shot
[2021-09-05T20:01:42] Artem Bulashev: Aceton is best in destroying adhesives ✅
[2021-09-05T20:02:02] Mirono escooters: Agree
[2021-09-06T17:30:56] Mirono escooters: G30 works again. Lol Had to re run the firmware motor setup and resetted everything. Ig i had smth configured wrong? Well now 40a battery and 80a phase. Not risking again
[2021-09-06T18:33:55] Unknown: The 2v could been because of the motor position, as you get 5v when it's "on spot" and 1.5-2v when not
[2021-09-06T18:42:09] Mirono escooters: I get 0 when not And 5v when itis
[2021-09-06T18:42:18] Mirono escooters: 2v actee like 5v And then 0v as.. 0v
[2021-09-06T18:42:30] Mirono escooters: Me done with it for a few days
[2021-09-06T18:42:38] Unknown: Oh, crappers that random :o i feel you haha
[2021-09-06T18:43:15] Mirono escooters: I cant even find correct halls? Only could find middle one wich i dont need
[2021-09-06T18:43:38] Mirono escooters: Theoretically i would think any hall sensor woule work
[2021-09-06T18:44:01] Unknown: Im my m365 they were all ss41f/ 41f, but i've read something about pro having 41. 43. 41f
[2021-09-06T18:44:25] Unknown: 43f did'nt work for me 😂 dont ask me why
[2021-09-06T18:44:36] Unknown: Put ss41f in and it was fine
[2021-09-06T18:45:32] Mirono escooters: Middle one seems to be different one (i think 120* inverted)
[2021-09-06T18:46:29] Unknown: Possible, seen some of those to, thing is the original looked like it was normal, but on replacement you had to solder it backwards and twist it 🤣
[2021-09-06T18:46:57] Mirono escooters: 120* isnt 180* tho Idk what to do now
[2021-09-06T18:47:00] Mirono escooters: Sensorless is a waste
[2021-09-06T18:47:26] Unknown: No clue, i know it was connected as
[2021-09-06T18:47:35] Unknown: 321 instead of 123
[2021-09-06T19:55:21] Happy Giraffe: Byebye Vesc, lets see how fast Spintend ships me the replacement unit and if the tracking code is enough for them to trust me lol
[2021-09-06T19:57:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for me, they failed the EMS shipping. EMS sent them back (electronic not allowed wih this type of shipping). they have to send it again 😭😭😭
[2021-09-06T19:57:39] Happy Giraffe: Wtf? For real? So they use Fedex then?
[2021-09-06T19:58:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, real. I don't know what they'll use
[2021-09-06T19:58:35] Mirono escooters: Bru y no electronic shipping

[2021-09-06T20:05:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: tracking translation is shitty. but they confirmed it failed.
[2021-09-06T20:05:51] Artem Bulashev: What true fuck. Since when and why would electronics not be allowed 😂😂
[2021-09-06T20:06:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think it depends of the shipping type. I might not be like in europe.
[2021-09-06T20:06:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this is not the first parcel which fail at customs with electronics for me
[2021-09-06T20:09:11] Happy Giraffe: I put "electronic controller" in the customs

[2021-09-06T20:10:19] Unknown: 🤣😂😂
[2021-09-06T20:15:44] Artem Bulashev: No it was denied at export - not allowed to ship electronics out of china. Sounds so wrong. I don’t know why you his happened.
[2021-09-06T20:15:55] Artem Bulashev: 😂
[2021-09-06T20:16:03] Artem Bulashev: That’s EMS thing likely

[2021-09-06T20:17:06] Mirono escooters: How expensive was it to ship?
[2021-09-06T20:19:23] Artem Bulashev: Priority with tracking up to 3cm thick up to 2kg = 3-7days = 15€

[2021-09-06T21:56:24] Artem Bulashev: Paper will save it likely
[2021-09-06T21:56:37] Happy Giraffe: I put it in a way so if they drop it from 2 meter the vesc aint even touching the side of the box
[2021-09-06T21:56:43] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>

[2021-09-07T16:04:08] Mirono escooters: China
[2021-09-07T16:06:29] Happy Giraffe: Could I just open dispute and get money back or something? This is ridiculous they cant do anything useful
[2021-09-07T16:11:43] Mirono escooters: U can try :)
[2021-09-07T16:11:46] Mirono escooters: Show it giving error

[2021-09-07T16:14:01] Mirono escooters: Ye🤷‍♂️
[2021-09-07T16:14:01] Happy Giraffe: They should tell me the hall atleast
[2021-09-07T16:14:25] Happy Giraffe: They didnt show dead, gave a reading. But still wont work reliably
[2021-09-07T16:14:41] Happy Giraffe: Sometimes vesc recognized, in the middle of ride not
[2021-09-07T16:15:33] Artem Bulashev: Sounds like loose wiring
[2021-09-07T16:15:49] Happy Giraffe: Loose like from sensor or?
[2021-09-07T16:16:23] Artem Bulashev: Any where
[2021-09-07T16:16:37] Artem Bulashev: Cable can be broken inside isolation
[2021-09-07T16:16:43] Happy Giraffe: Shiet
[2021-09-07T16:16:50] Artem Bulashev: Or poor contact on vesc (pin too loose)
[2021-09-07T16:16:59] Artem Bulashev: Or cold soldering
[2021-09-07T16:17:11] Happy Giraffe: It had problems with both esc I tried
[2021-09-07T16:17:16] Happy Giraffe: So I think motor fucked
[2021-09-07T16:17:20] Mirono escooters: I would say loose cable. Not hall
[2021-09-07T16:17:31] Mirono escooters: Or a hall sensor thats loose Add a drip of superglue on em
[2021-09-07T16:17:45] Happy Giraffe: They were fully in last time
[2021-09-07T16:18:10] Happy Giraffe: @artBula Is there any chance to buy vsett motor inside eu?

[2021-09-07T16:19:00] Mirono escooters: 1200w is nice too. Had 0 problems. Handled 5000w lmao
[2021-09-07T16:19:03] Happy Giraffe: I dont have the time to replace every cable lol
[2021-09-07T16:19:30] Happy Giraffe: Which shop you bought it from?
[2021-09-07T16:19:34] Mirono escooters: Its easy work. Cut off old. Drill so solicon gets out
[2021-09-07T16:19:40] Mirono escooters: Alieexpress spain
[2021-09-07T16:19:44] Mirono escooters: 150€ jpl store
[2021-09-07T16:19:49] Mirono escooters: Damn good motor
[2021-09-07T16:20:03] Happy Giraffe: Hmm
[2021-09-07T16:20:20] Happy Giraffe: I could try pulling the cables a bit and testing beep mode
[2021-09-07T16:21:17] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2021-09-07T16:21:36] Happy Giraffe: But most optimally a proper vsett motor...
[2021-09-07T16:21:55] Happy Giraffe: Would gain both more speed and torque with same settings
[2021-09-07T16:22:04] Mirono escooters: More €🙈
[2021-09-07T16:22:11] Mirono escooters: But vsett best agree
[2021-09-07T16:22:13] Happy Giraffe: Not an issue if it works
[2021-09-07T16:22:23] Mirono escooters: 1200w has low kv Me dont mind. But for regular plp idk
[2021-09-07T16:23:15] Happy Giraffe: Also motor splittin in half would be nice for tire change
[2021-09-07T16:27:31] Mirono escooters: Ye defo
[2021-09-07T16:37:02] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise I buy something like this🤔 60v dual = 85kmh so single 48v should be 60kmh ish
[2021-09-07T16:37:16] Happy Giraffe: 45mm magnets
[2021-09-07T16:37:40] Artem Bulashev: 85 free spinning
[2021-09-07T16:37:48] Happy Giraffe: Shit
[2021-09-07T16:37:50] Artem Bulashev: Real speed 35a gets 78kmh
[2021-09-07T16:38:11] Mirono escooters: Also good option
[2021-09-07T16:38:16] Artem Bulashev: So 52kmh at same 35a
[2021-09-07T16:38:32] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, vsett is higher kv then
[2021-09-07T16:39:03] Happy Giraffe: HM won't list speed on 3000w one
[2021-09-07T16:39:09] Artem Bulashev: I mean vsett
[2021-09-07T16:39:21] Artem Bulashev: 60v goes up to 78kmh on road
[2021-09-07T16:39:27] Artem Bulashev: Not sure in the air
[2021-09-07T16:39:38] Happy Giraffe: Aah, that's good to know
[2021-09-07T16:39:54] Mirono escooters: Thats a death trap speed lol
[2021-09-07T16:40:08] Happy Giraffe: 48v : 60v = 0.8
[2021-09-07T16:40:15] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-09-07T16:40:26] Happy Giraffe: 0.8 x 78 = 62kmh
[2021-09-07T16:40:31] Happy Giraffe: And then single motor
[2021-09-07T16:41:18] Artem Bulashev: Yes sorry
[2021-09-07T16:41:31] Artem Bulashev: I multiplied by 40 by mistake
[2021-09-07T16:41:43] Artem Bulashev: 62kmh is real on 48v 35a
[2021-09-07T16:41:43] Happy Giraffe: But yes I think 55 realistic
[2021-09-07T16:41:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeah should be
[2021-09-07T16:42:17] Happy Giraffe: But only challenge is shipping cost and me knowing the exact dimentions of the motor👀
[2021-09-07T16:42:47] Artem Bulashev: I've personally gotten either 62 or 63 MPH when in the air
[2021-09-07T16:42:59] Artem Bulashev: Around 100kmh
[2021-09-07T16:43:15] Artem Bulashev: In the air vsett10+
[2021-09-07T16:43:34] Artem Bulashev: So def higher KV and something that can take more than 35a 👌
[2021-09-07T16:45:48] Happy Giraffe: But that's 72v
[2021-09-07T16:46:01] Artem Bulashev: 60
[2021-09-07T16:46:07] Happy Giraffe: Need similar dimentions for the Vsett motors
[2021-09-07T16:46:21] Happy Giraffe: Oh blyat, that's sexy
[2021-09-07T16:46:48] Mirono escooters: Torque will b poor without super high currents. No?
[2021-09-07T16:46:51] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2021-09-07T16:47:10] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2021-09-07T16:47:50] Happy Giraffe: FOC will do ton of torque aswell so not a problem, also with the huge magnets...
[2021-09-07T16:48:14] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2021-09-07T16:48:36] Happy Giraffe: My current has 36mm magnets lol, almost 2x
[2021-09-07T16:49:28] Mirono escooters: I prefer high torque above high speed🤷‍♂️
[2021-09-07T16:49:36] Mirono escooters: I miss 120A phase. Cries in 80
[2021-09-07T16:50:03] Artem Bulashev: Me too
[2021-09-07T16:50:10] Artem Bulashev: Need 55kmh max
[2021-09-07T16:50:35] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_976@07-09-2021_16-50-35.jpg>
[2021-09-07T16:50:49] Happy Giraffe: I could use 55 or 60😂
[2021-09-07T16:51:01] Happy Giraffe: When batt go low charge it will still be nice
[2021-09-07T16:53:03] Artem Bulashev: I want to have 55 full battery and 50 at like 3.4v
[2021-09-07T16:53:43] Mirono escooters: Agreed Even more then 50 is in belgium suïcide. :) rather have good torque
[2021-09-07T16:53:43] Mirono escooters: I feel safer now with ebrake and soon dual brakes
[2021-09-07T16:58:52] Artem Bulashev: I have dual ebrake dual disk brakes by default on vsett 9+ so 48 feels safe, 55 will be sort of like a boost option
[2021-09-07T17:00:41] Happy Giraffe: Rarely I ride that fast aswell, but sometimes it's loads of fun to get some adrenaline
[2021-09-07T17:00:57] Mirono escooters: Yea and on long roads
[2021-09-07T17:01:10] Mirono escooters: When hitting car possibility is like 0
[2021-09-07T17:01:11] Artem Bulashev: + frame is with dual suspension and not as small as g30 or m365.
[2021-09-07T17:01:23] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-09-07T17:01:30] Happy Giraffe: And higher kv motor is more efficient on longer roads?
[2021-09-07T17:01:51] Happy Giraffe: Did bigger magnets improve efficiency in torque area?
[2021-09-07T17:01:57] Happy Giraffe: If using same phase A
[2021-09-07T17:02:26] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I’m so annoyed when people that never driven a scooter beside rent, say like oh it doesn’t even reach 80kmh 🤣
[2021-09-07T17:02:52] Happy Giraffe: 52kmh on Xiaomi pro was plenty scary
[2021-09-07T17:03:14] Happy Giraffe: But it was so stable I will get used to it
[2021-09-07T17:05:00] Mirono escooters: 60kmh was rlly scary lll
[2021-09-07T17:05:09] Mirono escooters: Huh, how
[2021-09-07T17:05:29] Artem Bulashev: It depends For example 400kv motor will barely get to 50kmh on the road and will need 40amps, but will need only 25amps to get to 45kmh for example 600kv motor will be able to get to 50kmh easier and will need 20amp to do that. But will accelerate slower.
[2021-09-07T17:05:35] Artem Bulashev: Aprox like that
[2021-09-07T17:06:50] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, a motor most efficient at 30-35kmh would be best. I think Vsett would be exactly that
[2021-09-07T17:07:09] Happy Giraffe: Then FOC isnt too fast either
[2021-09-07T17:07:16] Artem Bulashev: Ewing your voltage yes
[2021-09-07T17:07:30] Artem Bulashev: Yeah true as well
[2021-09-07T17:08:10] Artem Bulashev: Also foc driven motor is more efficient low to mid range of rpm
[2021-09-07T17:08:20] Happy Giraffe: But getting vsett motor in first place is hard. Paying 300€ for 150€ motor is a bit silly
[2021-09-07T17:08:28] Artem Bulashev: And less efficient than square wave at high rpm
[2021-09-07T17:08:47] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2021-09-07T17:09:03] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2021-09-07T17:09:23] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2021-09-07T17:10:13] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I can pay 200€ like 150€ motor 50€ shipping but anything above that is stupid imo
[2021-09-07T17:10:26] Artem Bulashev: Agree
[2021-09-07T17:10:53] Artem Bulashev: I took mine only because 100€ shipped was fair amount for Eu
[2021-09-07T17:11:01] Happy Giraffe: And need some spec dimentions if it fits on my fork etc with disc
[2021-09-07T17:11:21] Artem Bulashev: Why If it is so expensive
[2021-09-07T17:12:08] Happy Giraffe: I didnt understand what you mean?😂
[2021-09-07T17:12:36] Artem Bulashev: For what motor?
[2021-09-07T17:12:44] Happy Giraffe: Vsett 10+
[2021-09-07T17:13:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah and here is my question - why, since 400€ is way out of your budget by like twice
[2021-09-07T17:13:48] Happy Giraffe: I think atleast shaft axle lenght and then the measurement of how far disc will sit from the side
[2021-09-07T17:13:58] Happy Giraffe: Why 400€? Taxes?
[2021-09-07T17:14:21] Happy Giraffe: Wish they had EU warehouse for spare parts
[2021-09-07T17:14:40] Artem Bulashev: They have 10+ motor, price 400€ incl shipping
[2021-09-07T17:14:46] Happy Giraffe: Oh shit
[2021-09-07T17:14:55] Happy Giraffe: Thats crazy
[2021-09-07T17:15:04] Artem Bulashev: That is distributor for vsett in Eu
[2021-09-07T17:15:20] Happy Giraffe: How can it be so expensive then lol?
[2021-09-07T17:15:26] Artem Bulashev: 🤷‍♂️
[2021-09-07T17:16:09] Happy Giraffe: What about vsett 9/9+ then?
[2021-09-07T17:16:23] Artem Bulashev: It’s 8.5inch
[2021-09-07T17:16:27] Artem Bulashev: 650w
[2021-09-07T17:16:38] Artem Bulashev: Not what you looking for
[2021-09-07T17:17:05] Happy Giraffe: But still has bigger magnets than my "1000w"
[2021-09-07T17:17:15] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅😅
[2021-09-07T17:17:20] Happy Giraffe: How about zero motors then?👀😂
[2021-09-07T17:17:25] Artem Bulashev: Winding may be thinner
[2021-09-07T17:17:37] Artem Bulashev: No idea on other motors
[2021-09-07T17:17:47] Artem Bulashev: Never researched them
[2021-09-07T17:17:55] Happy Giraffe: Ёлки палки
[2021-09-07T17:18:17] Happy Giraffe: Quote from Francois S: here is my full comparison, going from right to left, 300w pro, 500w monorim, 1000w wheelway stator diameter: 300w 10cm 500w 11cm 1000w 10,5cm wire thickness: 300w 0.5mm 500w 0.7mm 1000w 1mm 👀 magnet thickness: 300w 3cm 500w 2.7cm 1000w 3,6cm 👀
[2021-09-07T17:18:38] Happy Giraffe: 1000w 1mm wire
[2021-09-07T17:18:59] Artem Bulashev: Mine is 0.5 I think
[2021-09-07T17:19:29] Artem Bulashev: Everything about vsett9/9+ motor: - 92mm startor - 30 magnets (15pairs) - 27 teeth/gaps - 9/7 winding with 0.5mm strand - 40mm x 10mm x 3mm magnets - 93mm magnet diameter = 0.5mm airgap - bearing RUWH 6003rs
[2021-09-07T17:19:52] Happy Giraffe: Oh, seems like I might have tp stick with my shity motor then until I can find a replacement
[2021-09-07T17:20:57] Happy Giraffe: Or...go for 12" motor
[2021-09-07T17:21:06] Happy Giraffe: Because I got no mudguard
[2021-09-07T17:22:36] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_977@07-09-2021_17-22-36.jpg>
[2021-09-07T17:22:57] Happy Giraffe: 40mm space so 20mm after suspension travel, maybe 11" might fit
[2021-09-07T17:23:06] Mirono escooters: I considerd 12" long ago Never tried
[2021-09-07T17:23:19] Happy Giraffe: 11" from Spintend?🤔
[2021-09-07T17:23:46] Artem Bulashev: It should since 11inch is 0.5 increase in radius = 1.78mm aprox
[2021-09-07T17:23:55] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-09-07T17:24:11] Happy Giraffe: But god knows about if they are legit
[2021-09-07T17:24:21] Happy Giraffe: Would need to speak directly with John

[2021-09-07T17:25:38] Happy Giraffe: Speed range 60-90kmh, gg info
[2021-09-07T17:26:34] Happy Giraffe: 1500 RPM
[2021-09-07T17:28:45] Happy Giraffe: I can fit about 14cm axle inside fork including washers, the amount it goes outside doesnt matter
[2021-09-07T17:33:16] Happy Giraffe: I did calculation that 1500rpm on 23.5cm 10" tire would be 66kmh
[2021-09-07T17:33:48] Artem Bulashev: 1500 in the air or on the ground under load
[2021-09-07T17:33:51] Artem Bulashev: That’s the question
[2021-09-07T17:34:17] Artem Bulashev: How than it could do “66-90km🤪
[2021-09-07T17:34:40] Happy Giraffe: With 1" bigger tire maybe 75 lol, 90 in air😂

[2021-09-07T17:40:57] Happy Giraffe: I dont think its visible and worhwhile for you to open it

[2021-09-07T17:44:58] Happy Giraffe: Yeah lol, cant see shit behind that bukkake
[2021-09-07T17:45:18] francois schempers: if you open it they are visible once you take the rotor off
[2021-09-07T17:45:57] Happy Giraffe: Too much trouble, I just do sensorless and 105A until it dies then😂
[2021-09-07T17:46:39] francois schempers: Photo de François
[2021-09-07T17:46:59] francois schempers: this is not the 1000w but once out, you should read on it like that
[2021-09-07T17:47:25] Happy Giraffe: Oof
[2021-09-07T17:47:49] Mirono escooters: Not difficult to do
[2021-09-07T17:48:11] francois schempers: hi miro ^^
[2021-09-07T17:48:12] Happy Giraffe: I dont have too much time for this shit
[2021-09-07T17:48:52] Happy Giraffe: And having sensors wont make much difference anyways I think, same fake 1000w shit
[2021-09-07T17:49:01] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-07T17:49:37] Unknown: I will take a pic for you later tonight, still working haha
[2021-09-07T17:50:06] Happy Giraffe: Don't open it for my sake
[2021-09-07T17:51:41] francois schempers: i just think you had a bad motor, because both of mine are plenty powerfull, better than monorim, and don't heat up under heavy load, for me they are 1000w at least with that heat headroom
[2021-09-07T17:52:38] francois schempers: do a warranty exchange, since it doesn't perform like promised
[2021-09-07T17:53:22] sombre_enfant: Its auto, i always get auto fefunded
[2021-09-07T17:53:53] Happy Giraffe: I asked, lets see. They might not wanna send me new motor
[2021-09-07T17:54:25] Happy Giraffe: Heavy load, me using 50/105A😂
[2021-09-07T17:55:21] Happy Giraffe: Cheapest HM motor would cost 160€ with free shipping from Spain, no tax

[2021-09-07T17:55:30] Mirono escooters: Hi
[2021-09-07T17:55:45] Mirono escooters: Well mine is still stuck.. 80€ gone
[2021-09-07T17:55:51] Happy Giraffe: Somehow they recommend 25/37A esc with that lol. Not sure if 1600w is peak and 800w nominal
[2021-09-07T17:56:15] Mirono escooters: Atleast thet recommekd phase amps
[2021-09-07T17:56:31] Happy Giraffe: I think it might be batt amps
[2021-09-07T17:56:47] Happy Giraffe: 3500w motor on 45A phase would be a joke
[2021-09-07T17:56:57] francois schempers: I'm at 2000w per motor, doing 55km/h on 13s, and after a 30min ride, motor is barly warm
[2021-09-07T17:57:21] Happy Giraffe: Yes but how much batt and phase amp?
[2021-09-07T17:57:38] francois schempers: 40 and 100
[2021-09-07T17:57:43] Happy Giraffe: Hmmmmmmm

[2021-09-07T18:02:22] Mirono escooters: Low. Plenty torque. Speed not so much. Can measure for u full 13s battery speed
[2021-09-07T18:02:49] Happy Giraffe: But these are "1600w" and up motors
[2021-09-07T18:02:55] Happy Giraffe: Maybe different

[2021-09-07T23:43:11] Happy Giraffe: I need a high beam (far away?) light
[2021-09-07T23:45:19] Mirono escooters: Tomorrow i can send u wich i had.
[2021-09-07T23:45:23] Mirono escooters: Super bright ones
[2021-09-07T23:45:57] Mirono escooters: I used it with a switch. Acted like fog lamps (just strong led wjen im alone on road) when car came turned off. Too briggt
[2021-09-07T23:47:23] Happy Giraffe: I want one that doesn't blind others 😅
[2021-09-07T23:47:49] Mirono escooters: U can just let em shine lower
[2021-09-07T23:47:53] Mirono escooters: Or less v/a

[2021-09-07T23:49:15] Happy Giraffe: I already have light near that I needed to build a blinding cover😂
[2021-09-07T23:49:28] Mirono escooters: 😆
[2021-09-07T23:49:32] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-09-07T23:50:19] Happy Giraffe: Only high beam missing for spotting pot holes during night
[2021-09-07T23:50:31] Mirono escooters: My g30 motors coming finally Im considering awd. Got disk side adaptor. But thats more hassle that i dont want :/ and poor 15s2p 30A wont like it. Think i will stick with rwd Got a custom front wheel already
[2021-09-07T23:51:19] Happy Giraffe: Imo no real need for awd in commuting scooter👀
[2021-09-07T23:51:58] Happy Giraffe: Smaller batt, esc etc so much simpler
[2021-09-07T23:55:02] Mirono escooters: Ye my thought too. I dont need awd. Im super light
[2021-09-07T23:55:11] Mirono escooters: I wont go offroad with this one It will be a cruiser
[2021-09-07T23:55:44] Mirono escooters: Only real reason i see is if i will sell it it would add a lot of value But ye I'm adding a lot of value too. Motor. Controller. Will keep it for other projects 😌
[2021-09-07T23:56:00] Mirono escooters: Poor battery won't handle it too. Would need a upgrade.. 🥴
[2021-09-07T23:57:22] Happy Giraffe: My 13s6p could do 20A (35A bms) per wheel but one motor is so simple
[2021-09-08T03:32:30] Artem Bulashev: for high beam 15w is not much. this lamps is good for 2-40m aprox. I consider that low beam
[2021-09-08T03:33:08] Artem Bulashev: you need high beam with sharp light line not to blind?
[2021-09-08T03:33:26] Happy Giraffe: Exactly
[2021-09-08T03:33:46] Happy Giraffe: 20-30m is high for me😂
[2021-09-08T03:34:07] Happy Giraffe: Atm I got like 3-5m
[2021-09-08T03:35:45] Artem Bulashev: yes it will do
[2021-09-08T03:36:09] Artem Bulashev: I took black one
[2021-09-08T03:36:19] Artem Bulashev: one color one mode
[2021-09-08T03:36:35] Happy Giraffe: So you took hi beam?

[2021-09-08T03:38:25] Happy Giraffe: This you wired to be used with Spintend remote?
[2021-09-08T03:38:41] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if I could use it from a button
[2021-09-08T03:38:56] Happy Giraffe: I hate remotes😂

[2021-09-08T10:34:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Might be because you have an older BMS
[2021-09-08T10:45:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hummm. weird. or the new app is still beta ?

[2021-09-08T12:32:12] Unknown: Piece of iron inside wheelway
[2021-09-08T12:32:35] Unknown: Both sides are 41f, middle one still unreadable as i am cleaning, i guess probably 43f
[2021-09-08T12:37:57] Unknown: Middle one is very unclear, i'd say N50 or N60, i think N50

[2021-09-08T12:39:22] Unknown: Please, send these back to wheelway store 🤣😂😂
[2021-09-08T12:59:42] Unknown: They even left a 4th sensor slot 😂
[2021-09-08T12:59:47] Unknown: <photos/photo_995@08-09-2021_12-59-47.jpg>
[2021-09-08T13:00:00] Unknown: Might use that one for sensor soon
[2021-09-08T13:01:59] Artem Bulashev: I don’t think that is for 4th sensors. Halls are always 3 sensor no ? I used that space inside my motor vsett for temp sensor
[2021-09-08T13:07:51] Mirono escooters: Magnet piece?
[2021-09-08T13:08:24] Mirono escooters: Looks n60 no?
[2021-09-08T13:31:09] Happy Giraffe: Thanks a lot, they will send me new sensors in mail. I think I could maybe order better quality ones from somewhere else 🤔
[2021-09-08T13:32:09] Happy Giraffe: Spintend waits until my vesc is there before sending new... Gonna take an eternity 🙈
[2021-09-08T13:52:49] Unknown: A link???
[2021-09-08T13:53:37] Happy Giraffe: This and scroll down
[2021-09-08T13:54:07] Unknown: Thanks
[2021-09-08T14:16:24] Happy Giraffe: Hm 3000w motor, looks like doesnt fit even on a monorim with spacers and reverse fork
[2021-09-08T14:16:50] Happy Giraffe: About 16cm inner axle + washer
[2021-09-08T14:18:29] Unknown: I know there is never 4 sensors 😂 but there was no temp option or anything, guess i will be placing my temp sensor there too.. just have to find a good one, anybody suggestions?
[2021-09-08T14:20:00] Unknown: No problem 😁 let's hope with new sensors it will work better! I'm just waiting for my 4p nickel strip and bms and then i can build up 💪
[2021-09-08T14:23:01] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-08T14:23:44] Happy Giraffe: 3 weeks now approx without scooter😂
[2021-09-08T14:24:29] Unknown: I feel you, i used mine for work untill rita let me down on my 13s
[2021-09-08T14:25:31] Unknown: Then i bought trampa vesc because i could'nt find a decent vesc for single motor, and had to rebuild a battery. So why not go for a high amp 12s 21700 pack
[2021-09-08T14:25:42] Happy Giraffe: From reliability standpoint I expect more from next vesc unit😂
[2021-09-08T14:26:06] Unknown: Maybe when vesc breaks i get a different one for highes S
[2021-09-08T14:26:14] Happy Giraffe: If you dont use Rita, you could fit 15s4p 21700 with single vesc I think
[2021-09-08T14:26:40] Happy Giraffe: Ah you had trampa, ubox only 16s my bad
[2021-09-08T14:28:09] Unknown: I got trampa, i measured out i was able to fit 12s 5p up straight with single vesc
[2021-09-08T14:28:39] Unknown: But gonna do 12s4p internall to have some space left over for wiring etc
[2021-09-08T14:28:52] Unknown: Will have to build a light unit etc
[2021-09-08T14:31:41] Happy Giraffe: 5p of 21700 is impressive
[2021-09-08T14:31:57] Mirono escooters: I got tha5
[2021-09-08T14:32:11] Mirono escooters: 13s
[2021-09-08T14:32:46] Happy Giraffe: 15s6p 18650 seems to be about max for pro with casing etc
[2021-09-08T14:33:19] Unknown: 12s vs 15s so i guess not :p 4 x 15 is 60, just as 12 x 4 is 60 😂
[2021-09-08T14:33:22] Artem Bulashev: With deck spacer ?
[2021-09-08T14:33:57] Unknown: Yes, i will have to get one still, the cells will go in vertical
[2021-09-08T14:35:08] Unknown: Fish paper around the batt, wrap it up, seal sides. Gonna place some insulation in my scooter too so if anything would ever come true it can't short out on the aluminum
[2021-09-08T14:39:40] Artem Bulashev: Brake light is available on Ubox !
[2021-09-08T14:43:27] Happy Giraffe: Haha, compromises then lights
[2021-09-08T15:06:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it needs remote 😔😔
[2021-09-08T15:10:14] Unknown: Have trampa
[2021-09-08T15:11:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: new vesc shipping from spintenf for me
[2021-09-08T15:12:32] Unknown: Nice
[2021-09-08T15:14:33] Unknown: Coming back to this, i did not find any damaged magnets, but i did find a .8mm gap tho

[2021-09-08T15:49:55] Artem Bulashev: Those metal strands can fuck up halls
[2021-09-08T15:50:23] Artem Bulashev: There should not be ANY metal magnetic debris in the motor
[2021-09-08T15:50:45] Artem Bulashev: It can even cause stater behavior
[2021-09-08T15:50:57] Mirono escooters: Maybe that's y mine died

[2021-09-09T19:04:36] Luis Magalhaes: Similar in Portuguese 😂
[2021-09-09T19:05:57] Luis Magalhaes: Mine got positive after 5 days of isolation 😂 before it i was negative but did the test in same day of my wife and she was positive i was not lucky that time 😂😂
[2021-09-09T19:06:14] Luis Magalhaes: But it was in February
[2021-09-09T19:07:36] Luis Magalhaes: Not getting any info here, are you all at 5.8ghz? My chip is from Jensen 😂😂
[2021-09-09T19:08:36] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-09T19:09:01] Happy Giraffe: Soon I receive vesc BT module (sadly not 5G)
[2021-09-09T19:09:15] Happy Giraffe: Then 3 weeks waiting for replacement
[2021-09-09T19:10:04] Unknown: I hope the magnet one so it can hold your phone
[2021-09-09T19:10:45] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-09-09T19:12:00] Unknown: After vaccination i took the phone and hold it on my arm, two doctors in the room couldn't stop laughing.
[2021-09-09T19:12:14] Unknown: Very funny
[2021-09-09T19:12:22] Unknown: Lol
[2021-09-09T19:13:40] Happy Giraffe: Sadly NFC tag cloning into phone requires root
[2021-09-09T19:13:49] Happy Giraffe: Huawei and their root limitations...
[2021-09-09T19:13:59] Unknown: 😂😂😂😂😂😂

[2021-09-09T22:58:26] Happy Giraffe: I wonder about speed etc
[2021-09-09T22:58:38] Happy Giraffe: I think the Blade motor is best contender so far
[2021-09-09T22:58:46] Mirono escooters: Boyueda is nice brand Laotie too

[2021-09-09T22:59:45] Mirono escooters: And cheap
[2021-09-09T22:59:52] Mirono escooters: I wish I'd get one of those
[2021-09-09T23:00:31] Unknown: Price is less important then quality for me in a way 😂 i'd rather pay 350-400 for a motor knowing it's topshelf then 250 on a questionmark for specs
[2021-09-09T23:00:44] Mirono escooters: Laotoe is decent
[2021-09-09T23:01:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-09-09T23:01:12] Happy Giraffe: They are brands whose di*k Pirate sucked
[2021-09-09T23:01:14] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-09T23:01:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: until you see the inside, it means shit.
[2021-09-09T23:02:00] Happy Giraffe: If Paolo tested Blade 10, I trust him
[2021-09-09T23:02:06] Mirono escooters: True true
[2021-09-09T23:02:29] Mirono escooters: I got a minimotors 11" 5400w on shelf, but it's so thick I got no use for it. Maybe a big ass go-cart. Lmao
[2021-09-09T23:02:33] Happy Giraffe: It is legit 1200w 150A ez
[2021-09-09T23:02:47] Happy Giraffe: Same with HM, too wide 16cm or so
[2021-09-09T23:02:59] Mirono escooters: My 1200w handled it too, vesc didn't like it
[2021-09-09T23:03:10] Mirono escooters: The one I got is super thick lol
[2021-09-09T23:03:32] Mirono escooters: Also I figured out my bad behaviour of my vesc! It was... Drum roll please 🥁 Overheating mosfets ._.
[2021-09-09T23:04:10] Unknown: 😂hard flipsky life
[2021-09-09T23:04:11] Mirono escooters: 50a/85a and it hits 60* after 3km. Winter will help but I'm probably adding a fan or bigger heatsink. Will see when my 12v converter is here
[2021-09-09T23:04:17] Unknown: Sorry bro
[2021-09-09T23:04:34] Happy Giraffe: Flipshit
[2021-09-09T23:04:36] Mirono escooters: In its defence. Its super tiny heatsink :) that it handled 150a and almost wheelied me fascinated me
[2021-09-09T23:04:47] Unknown: Price vset for europe?
[2021-09-09T23:04:51] Happy Giraffe: Man the mounting pressure in single vesc was just on point
[2021-09-09T23:05:04] Happy Giraffe: Its Blade 10 motor PaoloWU sells
[2021-09-09T23:05:13] Happy Giraffe: Is it same spanish Paolo second account btw?
[2021-09-09T23:05:16] Unknown: I believe you :D
[2021-09-09T23:05:20] Mirono escooters: I think its pretty good. The heasink is small and it's made for electric skateboard. I think I can push 100a phase safely if I keep mosfets Cool. 120 if I am bored
[2021-09-09T23:05:57] Unknown: Ooh ok
[2021-09-09T23:06:10] Unknown: And probably
[2021-09-09T23:06:22] Mirono escooters: Will keep you all updated with pictures and my (prob stupid) fan mounts :)
[2021-09-09T23:07:05] Happy Giraffe: Just make sure the heatsink contacts properly with good pressure first haha
[2021-09-09T23:07:30] Happy Giraffe: I did 105A without paste on Spintend all good, with paste I feel it can do it 24/7
[2021-09-09T23:08:07] Mirono escooters: Yea gonna check aswell. Last thing me want is to replace directfet 🥴
[2021-09-09T23:08:26] Mirono escooters: Maybe I upgrade heatsink but thzts so much work And adding heatsink on heatsink fins is super inneficient
[2021-09-09T23:08:49] Unknown: 60v motor would be unworthy for a 50.4 top setup haha
[2021-09-09T23:09:08] Happy Giraffe: Blade 10 13s 65kmh
[2021-09-09T23:09:11] Happy Giraffe: I want that 😂
[2021-09-09T23:09:37] Mirono escooters: Fak me had a 48v500w kugoo open last time and forgot to take measurements
[2021-09-09T23:09:41] Happy Giraffe: Will be really efficient cruising on half speed with foc
[2021-09-09T23:09:44] Unknown: Would be 60 on 12s for a good motor 🤔
[2021-09-09T23:09:51] Mirono escooters: Kugoo prob not strong. Lol
[2021-09-09T23:10:00] Mirono escooters: Doesnt fit in monoshit suspension
[2021-09-09T23:10:08] Happy Giraffe: 500w nominal so yes haha
[2021-09-09T23:10:24] Unknown: Sounds very descent if it can hold 40-50 on regular speeds
[2021-09-09T23:10:31] Unknown: With ferrofluid offcourse
[2021-09-09T23:11:43] Mirono escooters: Poor thing
[2021-09-09T23:11:43] Mirono escooters: It's thicc tho
[2021-09-09T23:12:08] Mirono escooters: We should make a spreadsheet keeping shit about motors
[2021-09-09T23:12:13] Unknown: I measured out wiring today, made it long enough to fit motor in the back later when i get a rear suspension
[2021-09-09T23:12:31] Unknown: I will give specs about my wheelway chinesium when complete haha
[2021-09-09T23:12:41] Unknown: With temp sensor offcourse
[2021-09-09T23:13:04] Unknown: @koxx3 please, what model of sensor is good, i know you have some placed
[2021-09-09T23:17:22] Happy Giraffe: They will send me the sensor board
[2021-09-09T23:17:49] Happy Giraffe: At this point I dont give a damn about it I go sensorless, if anybody else needs it then I can send
[2021-09-09T23:18:15] Happy Giraffe: Oh you meant temp sensor haha mb
[2021-09-09T23:19:25] Mirono escooters: Maybe sell 1000w and hall sensor later to someone
[2021-09-09T23:19:32] Mirono escooters: Id install sensor tho. Worth it
[2021-09-09T23:20:01] Happy Giraffe: Another guy also had issue with single vesc and xiaomi hall sensors
[2021-09-09T23:20:25] Happy Giraffe: At this point if more people have trouble with that it might be a problem in vesc
[2021-09-09T23:21:19] Mirono escooters: Sounds like xiaomi fault
[2021-09-09T23:21:31] Mirono escooters: Vesc idk what could b wrong But @koxx3 defo knows better
[2021-09-09T23:21:31] Happy Giraffe: But they worked with Xiaomi esc
[2021-09-09T23:22:09] Happy Giraffe: Also I tested my wheelway using 18650 cell at 3.5v and they gave readings between 0-3.5v
[2021-09-09T23:22:17] Happy Giraffe: So maybe vesc fucking things up
[2021-09-09T23:22:45] Mirono escooters: Really? Wow
[2021-09-09T23:22:54] Mirono escooters: Did it switch when rotating Acle?
[2021-09-09T23:23:00] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2021-09-09T23:23:13] Happy Giraffe: I will test them again when I have 5v from vesc
[2021-09-09T23:23:22] Mirono escooters: Can I say spintend is shit now or only flipsky can🙈😆
[2021-09-09T23:23:29] Mirono escooters: Use a power supply or even phone charger
[2021-09-09T23:23:51] Happy Giraffe: I wait for vesc
[2021-09-09T23:24:00] Happy Giraffe: Then its easy measurement
[2021-09-09T23:24:12] Mirono escooters: Ah ye vesc is gone for a while
[2021-09-09T23:24:13] Mirono escooters: Forgot
[2021-09-09T23:24:29] Mirono escooters: There are those cheap 12€ motor testers. I got 1 from alie. Will make my life easier
[2021-09-09T23:24:46] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2021-09-09T23:26:27] Mirono escooters: I gotta test like 20 motors Don't wanna wire every single one up or I go crazy
[2021-09-09T23:27:00] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-09T23:27:23] Mirono escooters: Mostly xiaomi shit. But hey its free
[2021-09-09T23:29:24] Happy Giraffe: But this guy's motor worked with Xiaomi esc👀
[2021-09-09T23:29:31] Happy Giraffe: So weird
[2021-09-09T23:30:05] Mirono escooters: Uea. Maybe cable got damaged?
[2021-09-09T23:30:14] Mirono escooters: XIaomi cable is weak and it can snap off easily inside
[2021-09-09T23:30:31] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't think vesc was problem. Idk. I won't speak out as I don't know shit
[2021-09-09T23:30:45] Happy Giraffe: I tortured mine and sent it via mail and second user has been happy
[2021-09-09T23:31:11] Happy Giraffe: Yes, its really weird. Everyone says hall sensors are tanky af
[2021-09-09T23:32:15] Mirono escooters: I killed mine by shorting
[2021-09-09T23:32:19] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2021-09-09T23:32:39] Mirono escooters: And @artBula said smth about metal dust killing em. Idk
[2021-09-09T23:33:00] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-09T23:33:39] Happy Giraffe: If I killed it the same way it shouldn't give readings I think
[2021-09-09T23:33:46] Mirono escooters: Tru
[2021-09-09T23:33:55] Mirono escooters: Mine just didn't switch anymore
[2021-09-09T23:33:56] Mirono escooters: Always 5v
[2021-09-09T23:41:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1000
[2021-09-09T23:41:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you want something simple for arduino, dht22
[2021-09-09T23:42:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you want something for motor, ntc10k
[2021-09-09T23:47:26] Unknown: I want one for motor, i have a temp slot on communication port, but i guess temp sensor has 3 wires? + - and comm?
[2021-09-09T23:48:09] Mirono escooters: No 2
[2021-09-09T23:48:22] Mirono escooters: A temp sensor changes resistance depending on heat :)
[2021-09-09T23:48:33] Artem Bulashev: That’s why 100k is better
[2021-09-09T23:48:37] Unknown: Only + and temp wire then?
[2021-09-09T23:48:38] Artem Bulashev: Change is same with temp
[2021-09-09T23:48:49] Artem Bulashev: But % of change is 10 times less
[2021-09-09T23:49:14] Unknown: Oh ok, so ntc 100k then? I only find some woth iron bars
[2021-09-09T23:49:14] Artem Bulashev: - and temp signal wire
[2021-09-09T23:49:22] Unknown: Ok 👍👌
[2021-09-09T23:49:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it use VCC + GND + signal. VCC & GND are already present since they are used for hall sensors. just need an additionnal wire.
[2021-09-09T23:49:48] Artem Bulashev: Yes just one wire to put along

[2021-09-09T23:51:24] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but expensive
[2021-09-09T23:51:39] Unknown: Yeah, but i live in belgium, very fast delivery
[2021-09-09T23:51:42] Artem Bulashev: Check eBay sort by from EU
[2021-09-09T23:51:51] Artem Bulashev: Link I have is from Germany
[2021-09-09T23:52:10] Artem Bulashev: Any way choice is yours 😊
[2021-09-09T23:52:46] Mirono escooters: Try amazon
[2021-09-09T23:53:05] Unknown: Ok i will look for it but i dont understand how does it connect vcc + gnd + signal when it's 2 wires do i bridge signal and ground?
[2021-09-09T23:54:35] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-09-09T23:54:45] Artem Bulashev: He was saying about halls
[2021-09-09T23:54:59] Artem Bulashev: Ntc connects to the halls’ gnd
[2021-09-09T23:55:17] Artem Bulashev: So only one other wire needs to be run to the vesc
[2021-09-09T23:55:23] Unknown: Ooh so hall gnd to sensor and 1 to sensor input
[2021-09-09T23:55:37] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-09-09T23:55:44] Unknown: Aight now i get it haha
[2021-09-09T23:56:07] Unknown: Then i can just go for this one
[2021-09-09T23:56:11] Unknown: <photos/photo_1015@09-09-2021_23-56-11.jpg>
[2021-09-09T23:56:30] Unknown: I'll do wiring and insulation myself then
[2021-09-09T23:56:31] Artem Bulashev: My advice to get one with thinnest wires
[2021-09-09T23:56:36] Artem Bulashev: Very helpful
[2021-09-09T23:56:48] Unknown: <photos/photo_1016@09-09-2021_23-56-48.jpg>
[2021-09-09T23:57:07] Unknown: I bet this is thin, i have some 24 awg comm cable on spare
[2021-09-09T23:57:13] Unknown: <photos/photo_1017@09-09-2021_23-57-13.jpg>
[2021-09-09T23:57:25] Artem Bulashev: You need me like 30awg
[2021-09-09T23:57:38] Unknown: Oh crap
[2021-09-09T23:57:45] Unknown: Why so thin
[2021-09-09T23:59:18] Artem Bulashev: Well usually there is not a lot of space to run it out of the motor
[2021-09-09T23:59:46] Artem Bulashev: But if you got no problem there use what ever works
[2021-09-10T00:00:48] Unknown: I'm gonna try to fit a wire true tomorrow and see if 24 fits, i think it will if its just 1 cable, and then just put a crimping sock over the outer motors wire for protection and keeping it together
[2021-09-10T00:02:35] Artem Bulashev: Another thing in wiring of those sensors normally is used high temp isolations that won’t get soft with 100c
[2021-09-10T00:02:38] Artem Bulashev: Wiring insulation: high temperature Teflon/PTFE.
[2021-09-10T00:03:16] Unknown: Offcourse, especially inside of the motor because of higher temps :p
[2021-09-10T00:03:21] Artem Bulashev: What I had to do is desolder and pull out wiring out of the motor completely
[2021-09-10T00:03:21] Unknown: Thanks for reminder
[2021-09-10T00:03:44] Unknown: Sounds like a pain in the ass
[2021-09-10T00:04:50] Artem Bulashev: Than I cut \/ groove on the outer thick isolation of the harness to fit 1mm cable 👌 and put one long heat shrink on top all the way ip to vesc
[2021-09-10T00:05:32] Artem Bulashev: If you cut isolation open thinking you will put it sort of inside and than heat shrink, no that won’t work well you will end up with a lot bigger diameter
[2021-09-10T00:05:51] Artem Bulashev: Just heads up
[2021-09-10T00:05:51] Unknown: Ooh, still though. Long time of work haha but better quality for sure
[2021-09-10T00:06:01] Unknown: Aight :p
[2021-09-10T00:06:07] Artem Bulashev: Yeah took me 3-4h
[2021-09-10T00:06:57] Unknown: Well, hope for the best of lucks tomorrow, i'll place the wire already and keep a heads up ;D off to bed now haha gotta wake up in 4 hours
[2021-09-10T00:09:58] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-09-10T00:10:01] Artem Bulashev: Gn

[2021-09-10T09:36:33] Unknown: Perhaps does anyone within europe have 21700 nickel strips for honeycomb? I talked to some seller on ali, they refuse to send only half a kilo.. what am i going to do with a kilo of nickel strip for 2 batts 🤦‍♂️

[2021-09-10T11:45:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Some molicel
[2021-09-10T11:46:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: miam !
[2021-09-10T11:46:27] Happy Giraffe: Why the solder?👀
[2021-09-10T11:47:24] Artem Bulashev: Yeah same question. Guess to further decrease resistance between series
[2021-09-10T11:47:50] Happy Giraffe: But copper would do it or thicker nickel?👀
[2021-09-10T11:48:22] Happy Giraffe: Does solder even do useful shit without the wire?
[2021-09-10T11:49:58] Unknown: Battery porn, but idd, solder seems quite unhelpfull here
[2021-09-10T11:50:10] Happy Giraffe: 300€, I wonder what kind of pack and motor could be put there🤔
[2021-09-10T11:50:39] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't have copper anymore
[2021-09-10T11:50:46] Face de Pin Sucé: And I need the battery for tonight
[2021-09-10T11:50:52] Unknown: You could put some serious outrunner with high kv there 😂
[2021-09-10T11:51:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Planning on 250-300A continuuous on this one
[2021-09-10T11:51:02] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-10T11:51:16] Face de Pin Sucé: So double nickel + soldering is good
[2021-09-10T11:51:18] Happy Giraffe: Then copper would be a must?👀
[2021-09-10T11:51:37] Face de Pin Sucé: About 40-45A per parallel, there are 10 parallels, so it's okay
[2021-09-10T11:51:53] Happy Giraffe: 250A is entering portable nuclear power plant territory
[2021-09-10T11:52:03] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-09-10T11:52:13] Happy Giraffe: Im not joking😂

[2021-09-10T12:00:43] Unknown: And do you perhaps know diameter with cst tyre on?
[2021-09-10T12:01:04] Happy Giraffe: 235mm I would say once you step on it
[2021-09-10T12:01:12] Happy Giraffe: Try that and measure vs gps
[2021-09-10T12:01:29] Unknown: Aight perfect, i will later this is testing phase atm haha
[2021-09-10T12:01:53] Happy Giraffe: I used 105a on it and almost overheated
[2021-09-10T12:02:06] Happy Giraffe: 90A is what I settle on I think
[2021-09-10T12:02:20] Unknown: Will fit nice and tight when wrapped
[2021-09-10T12:02:24] Artem Bulashev: Your 1000w motor?

[2021-09-10T12:03:24] Happy Giraffe: London bridge there
[2021-09-10T12:03:49] Unknown: Offcourse, it was just for easy fix, and for wiring haha. 5 wires for adc 6 for throttle and brake. And if anything breaks i can open up the top to fix
[2021-09-10T12:04:18] Happy Giraffe: I put everything inside deck
[2021-09-10T12:04:24] Unknown: Safety first, you never know something might blow 😂 batt at the door ready to be kicked out
[2021-09-10T12:04:40] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I end up doing adc inside the tube 👀
[2021-09-10T12:04:55] Happy Giraffe: So nothing lands on it
[2021-09-10T12:05:10] Happy Giraffe: Lol, I do batt stuff in my bedroom
[2021-09-10T12:05:14] Unknown: Tought about that too, but would be a pain in the ass to fix if anything breaks on adc or throttle/ brake
[2021-09-10T12:05:22] Unknown: I mostly do to 😂
[2021-09-10T12:05:42] Happy Giraffe: Yes same I have

[2021-09-10T12:10:19] Unknown: Ouch painfull
[2021-09-10T12:10:40] Unknown: Is it normal that my throttle and brake don't go to 100% over adc?
[2021-09-10T12:10:45] Unknown: <photos/photo_1025@10-09-2021_12-10-45.jpg>

[2021-09-10T12:11:37] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi 0.5-2.8v
[2021-09-10T12:11:52] Happy Giraffe: Should be 95% anyways I think
[2021-09-10T12:21:47] Unknown: Ooh ok :D so do i need to change anything else? I'd like to change amps but can't freaking find in app

[2021-09-10T12:35:31] Happy Giraffe: Thats correct
[2021-09-10T12:35:57] Unknown: I use xiaomi throttle and brake only
[2021-09-10T12:36:20] Happy Giraffe: Maybe not this much regen, depends on the batt size
[2021-09-10T12:36:32] Unknown: <photos/photo_1032@10-09-2021_12-36-32.jpg>

[2021-09-10T12:37:22] Unknown: I will get calipers later :D
[2021-09-10T12:37:25] Happy Giraffe: Then use like 10A regen to be safe
[2021-09-10T12:37:38] Happy Giraffe: 20A phase 10A batt regen until Artem says otherwise
[2021-09-10T12:37:45] Unknown: Aight thx
[2021-09-10T12:38:22] Mirono escooters: Me running 50a 🙂

[2021-09-10T12:41:55] Unknown: I just don't really care for this batt
[2021-09-10T12:42:14] Unknown: It's old, untill bms and nickel arrived it'll be this ol' thing
[2021-09-10T12:44:03] Artem Bulashev: Don’t use battery regen more than your Ah unless you want it dead by in 1y time
[2021-09-10T12:45:19] Artem Bulashev: Controller regen needs to = to battery regen + about 15amps to begin with (those 15amps will be given out by the fets to the heat sink)
[2021-09-10T12:46:39] Artem Bulashev: 80 controller regen (30a technically) from 2 vesc motors or on single ?
[2021-09-10T12:50:11] Happy Giraffe: Oh shit you used uart
[2021-09-10T12:50:17] Happy Giraffe: My bad sry m8

[2021-09-10T12:54:37] Happy Giraffe: Haha, thats good to know😂
[2021-09-10T13:51:32] Unknown: @Mirono_escooters you can print a bottom extender for m365 (non pro) right? :D
[2021-09-10T13:51:54] Unknown: I would like to buy one, 310mm lower
[2021-09-10T13:57:19] Happy Giraffe: Shiiii

[2021-09-10T14:36:22] Artem Bulashev: Not necessarily I don’t see any blown / shorted components
[2021-09-10T14:36:37] Artem Bulashev: Clean the balls though

[2021-09-10T14:37:41] Happy Giraffe: Im getting mad if the solder balls are a systematic issue with spintend
[2021-09-10T14:38:02] Unknown: Its annoying ….
[2021-09-10T14:39:28] Happy Giraffe: Its beta but still, durable hardware is first step
[2021-09-10T14:45:33] Unknown: Yhh cause i even tried it in my room with wheels in air and it all worked nothink wrong i then went to take it out to give it a test then boom green light wouldent come on
[2021-09-10T14:46:23] Artem Bulashev: Honestly
[2021-09-10T14:46:26] sombre_enfant: Brush it with alchool when u receive it😂
[2021-09-10T14:46:29] Artem Bulashev: Your case is not warrenty man
[2021-09-10T14:46:33] Artem Bulashev: You burned it
[2021-09-10T14:46:59] Artem Bulashev: Because you didn’t isolate power cable and plugged in power button to the wrong port god knows how
[2021-09-10T14:47:26] Artem Bulashev: But I also don’t think it is dead yet
[2021-09-10T14:47:33] Artem Bulashev: Disconnect battery
[2021-09-10T14:47:39] Artem Bulashev: Clean the solder balls
[2021-09-10T14:47:42] Unknown: Naa bro it wasent i took that before i even set it all up i had it in the right port
[2021-09-10T14:50:17] Happy Giraffe: But the connector got shorted atleat hence it melted a bit
[2021-09-10T14:52:48] Artem Bulashev: And order new button
[2021-09-10T14:52:48] Artem Bulashev: I believe it will work

[2021-09-10T15:17:13] Unknown: Got to love wiring
[2021-09-10T15:24:55] Happy Giraffe: Why so long lol
[2021-09-10T15:25:43] Unknown: Made them long enough to fit vesc in the back soon, that way i can keep phase wires as short as possible when placing motor in the back
[2021-09-10T15:25:53] Unknown: I will cut them to perfect size later
[2021-09-10T15:28:01] Happy Giraffe: Aah, makes sense then
[2021-09-10T15:38:58] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-09-10T15:39:34] Artem Bulashev: Battery discharge need to be as short as possible as well, charging cables don’t care as low current
[2021-09-10T15:55:49] Unknown: Will be, i have a temporairy cable, just long enough for my temporairy batt
[2021-09-10T15:57:02] Unknown: I will have the xt90 on the side of vesc when motor comes in the back, and phase wires will go trough the back licht port so just next to vesc aswell
[2021-09-10T15:57:40] Unknown: Phase will probably be max 15-20cm discharge probably something like 10, 15cm top
[2021-09-10T16:33:41] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2021-09-10T16:33:50] Mirono escooters: 310??🥴

[2021-09-10T16:36:46] Happy Giraffe: If I had welding equipment, I would make xiaomi scooter to have fork so long it will have 28" fatbike tires
[2021-09-10T16:37:11] Unknown: Loll, i have a welder, but a shitty spotwelder.. only goes up to .15
[2021-09-10T16:37:21] Happy Giraffe: Then step number two, 20cm spacer and 16s20p battery
[2021-09-10T16:37:51] Happy Giraffe: Imagine the sight
[2021-09-10T16:37:54] Unknown: Then one miscalculation and the thing goes boom with you on it 😂
[2021-09-10T16:38:01] Unknown: I'd be scared to jump off
[2021-09-10T16:38:34] Happy Giraffe: Not that high, about 40cm
[2021-09-10T16:39:01] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-09-10T16:39:24] Unknown: I am 185cm, so my sight would be up at around 220-230cm, pretty high for me 😂

[2021-09-10T16:40:50] Happy Giraffe: High version
[2021-09-10T16:41:43] Unknown: More like this then
[2021-09-10T16:41:50] Unknown: Loads of batt space 😂

[2021-09-10T16:45:55] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2021-09-10T16:54:11] Unknown: Hahaha
[2021-09-11T01:43:02] Unknown: Ves reads very misplaced speeds, i'm doing 40kmh when i am barley doing like 25-30 would seem weird that this would be "diameter issue" since it's at 235mm, gonna measure diameter tomorrow
[2021-09-11T01:44:48] Unknown: According kroxne it's 250mm, but this would only increse speed 🤔
[2021-09-11T01:48:23] Happy Giraffe: Tire size goes down when you hop on scooter
[2021-09-11T11:32:37] Artem Bulashev: Magnet count
[2021-09-11T11:35:21] Mirono escooters: Ampere?
[2021-09-11T11:43:17] Artem Bulashev: Speed is mesurer by converting erpm to rpm, for that system needs to know Magnets count, my motor has 30 magnets so I need to enter 30 in the addition Info -> motor poles Gear ratio 1 Wheel dia mesure from hub center to the ground when scooter is leveled (not tilted)
[2021-09-11T13:06:29] Unknown: So i need to enter 30 as motor poles if i have 30 magnets?
[2021-09-11T13:06:48] Unknown: I toucht poles was magnets divided by 2 or 3
[2021-09-11T13:39:32] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-09-11T13:39:38] Artem Bulashev: Not motor pairs

[2021-09-12T15:59:21] Mirono escooters: Not good
[2021-09-12T15:59:28] Unknown: No clue what is it?
[2021-09-12T16:02:04] Mirono escooters: Nop sorrt
[2021-09-12T16:02:30] Mirono escooters: What happend before it
[2021-09-12T16:11:21] Unknown: Well, nothing actually i stopped to put on music
[2021-09-12T16:11:45] Unknown: I think giraffe knows xd, just disconnected hall port and ran foc detection again

[2021-09-12T16:14:09] Artem Bulashev: Any one knows enough about motor building? I wonder what will be the effects of swapping for n52 grade magnets (same size same dimensions same positioning)
[2021-09-12T16:14:20] Artem Bulashev: 40x10x3 30pcs = 45€
[2021-09-12T16:14:36] Artem Bulashev: Not bad but would it be better ? And if so how?
[2021-09-12T16:15:37] Mirono escooters: I know it would b a pain in tha ass
[2021-09-12T16:15:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-09-12T16:15:58] Mirono escooters: Another failed sensor??? This group is cursed
[2021-09-12T16:17:31] Unknown: <video_file>
[2021-09-12T16:17:33] Unknown: Wheelway sensor life 🤦‍♂️😂
[2021-09-12T16:19:49] Happy Giraffe: I think its about to give them bad reviews
[2021-09-12T16:30:46] Unknown: Indeed, did you have the same problem or did it happen different? Drove about 25km max
[2021-09-12T16:33:41] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2021-09-12T16:34:04] Happy Giraffe: 20km fine, after that on smooth road motor went brrrrr
[2021-09-12T16:34:51] Happy Giraffe: Impossible to be my fault as I used their controllers and stuff at that time😂
[2021-09-12T16:35:12] Unknown: Loll i might just replace them, probably cheap ass sensors
[2021-09-12T16:35:43] Happy Giraffe: Yeah...I think that aswell
[2021-09-12T16:35:54] Happy Giraffe: Or I ride sensorless as its quite good
[2021-09-12T16:58:36] Unknown: Doing so right now, does'nt seem like much difference, braking was less powerfull
[2021-09-12T16:59:03] Unknown: And starting point is kind off wrecked as it shocks a bit
[2021-09-12T16:59:20] Happy Giraffe: You gotta kick it forward
[2021-09-12T16:59:36] Happy Giraffe: And not too much throttle
[2021-09-12T16:59:38] Mirono escooters: Dude 2 motors now? Wow
[2021-09-12T16:59:47] Unknown: I felt that haha felt bad for the throttle
[2021-09-12T16:59:53] Unknown: Motor*
[2021-09-12T17:00:39] Unknown: And yes 2 motors.. unbelievable, but will probably just be bad sensors in their motor's, im going to redo them and see if it works out longer after xd
[2021-09-12T17:02:01] Happy Giraffe: I bet they will send me same cheap shit sensors
[2021-09-12T17:03:31] Unknown: Probably 😂
[2021-09-12T17:12:24] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_994@08-09-2021_12-39-07.jpg>
[2021-09-12T17:12:30] Happy Giraffe: I would say it's N60
[2021-09-12T17:13:17] Unknown: Same, but i was wondering if i can put other, better sensors in place, i bet if i search n60 hall sensor i will only find them on ali, thus i will only have chinesium snesors
[2021-09-12T17:13:35] Happy Giraffe: 🤔
[2021-09-12T17:13:41] Unknown: And it's not a problem to replace sensors, but it's no fun and games either 😅😂😂
[2021-09-12T17:14:03] Happy Giraffe: @artBula Could we put different sensors then?
[2021-09-12T17:14:15] Unknown: Imo i think it just needs to be bipolar same voltage, but this might be incorrect, i have no clue
[2021-09-12T17:14:36] Mirono escooters: I opened my motor 10 times to try diff shit If u find good sensors send me too
[2021-09-12T17:14:42] Unknown: Yes please wise old arthem aknowledge us with your mindfull motor powers 😂
[2021-09-12T17:15:02] Mirono escooters: Isnt 41f just easiest
[2021-09-12T17:15:09] Unknown: Exactly, had to replace mine on m365 motor to, 4 times before i had some descent ones
[2021-09-12T17:15:14] Unknown: I have ss41f
[2021-09-12T17:15:23] Unknown: No clue what the F difference is
[2021-09-12T17:15:23] Mirono escooters: Well ye alie ones suck
[2021-09-12T17:15:34] Happy Giraffe: Haha, I would buy blade motor but the guy selling it doesnt even bother to measure how far the disc sits
[2021-09-12T17:15:43] Unknown: And true, but where on earth will we find them 😂
[2021-09-12T17:15:49] Happy Giraffe: Mordor
[2021-09-12T17:16:01] Unknown: Mordor?
[2021-09-12T17:16:26] Unknown: And lol, sucks to have sellers with high air's feeling better then one another
[2021-09-12T17:16:32] Happy Giraffe: Yup, but one does not simply walk into Mordor
[2021-09-12T17:16:58] Unknown: If it be fixed im rpg'ing it to mordor 😂
[2021-09-12T17:17:20] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-12T17:18:37] Happy Giraffe: Ebikes seem so much more simple

[2021-09-12T17:19:04] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-12T17:19:23] Unknown: True, and not true, a friend made a conversion bike once 😂 he had 10 times more problems, wich he knew about vesc back then
[2021-09-12T17:19:34] Unknown: E bikes where not even known then
[2021-09-12T17:19:39] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2021-09-12T17:19:43] Unknown: Like 8-9 years ago xd
[2021-09-12T17:20:26] Happy Giraffe: Now you can just buy 3000w rear hub motor and then fly to moon with it
[2021-09-12T17:20:27] Unknown: Perfect place to crack one open and light one up though 😂
[2021-09-12T17:20:43] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2021-09-12T17:20:57] Unknown: Hahaha to the moon, anyone into crypto who understands the joke in that sentence? 😂
[2021-09-12T17:21:18] Happy Giraffe: Cries in gtx 1070
[2021-09-12T17:22:13] Unknown: 😂😂 i don't mine though, i short out high and buy low, lost around 2k on the last big drop though
[2021-09-12T17:22:27] Unknown: Should have mined 😂
[2021-09-12T19:26:11] Mirono escooters: To the mooon
[2021-09-13T02:12:08] Happy Giraffe: Should I buy another vesc to make a sexy rear motor for old bike?😂
[2021-09-13T02:14:35] Happy Giraffe: I already got 13s7p battery, throttle and two brake handles
[2021-09-13T02:14:50] Happy Giraffe: Only vesc and cheapo motor needed🤔
[2021-09-13T02:17:37] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if vesc works with some pedal assist sensors🤔
[2021-09-13T07:44:57] Mirono escooters: Think so
[2021-09-13T09:42:21] Unknown: I tought about this too, i was planning to make an e- go cart for my sister's kid. I'll make it out of the old m365 parts
[2021-09-13T09:42:40] Unknown: <photos/photo_1049@13-09-2021_09-42-40.jpg>
[2021-09-13T09:43:05] Unknown: Will not be needing these anymore anyway 😂 later upgrade the esc to 20s tops so she can go faster as she gets older 😂
[2021-09-13T10:00:58] Happy Giraffe: Oh you talked about it in the vesc groups on FB?😂
[2021-09-13T10:01:11] Happy Giraffe: Oof, thats fast
[2021-09-13T15:13:05] Unknown: No i did not, wivh vesc group i wonder 😇😂 And yes fast, but i will limit it to some descent speeds for a kid.. easy for xiaomi esc haha, i just had to walk all the way home, my phone died and my scoot did'nt want to work. No throttle or brake, when i connect my phone poof al ok, no probs 🤦‍♂️ gotta take my phone charger to work 😂
[2021-09-13T15:24:30] Happy Giraffe: Vesc trouble?
[2021-09-13T15:36:23] Unknown: No i think it has to be connected to my phone i tried it just now did the same
[2021-09-13T15:36:35] Unknown: Did not work till connected and boom
[2021-09-13T15:39:51] Happy Giraffe: Is there some setting its locked but bluetooth proximity?
[2021-09-13T15:57:51] Unknown: No clue
[2021-09-13T15:57:57] Unknown: Will look into it later
[2021-09-14T23:54:01] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow gonna measure my bike rear axle width, seems 10mm bolt to my naked eye. Im gonna put vesc + wheelway motor here and take pedals and normal backwheel off😂
[2021-09-14T23:54:30] Happy Giraffe: Then I go back to Finland and just put vesc and wheelway motor to another cheapo 50€ bike😂
[2021-09-14T23:54:36] Happy Giraffe: Fucking bonkers
[2021-09-15T00:01:33] Mirono escooters: Smort ppl Does vesc have filtering on throttle as it seems like it accelerates smoothly. I dont want that :) my m365 pro with 350w motor and 1000w controller shoots off. (Lightdr frame but it reacts instantly) and g30 at 80 phase amps is smoothly. I'd like it to be more aggressive
[2021-09-15T00:01:56] Happy Giraffe: There is a setting for throttle filtering in ADC set to "true"
[2021-09-15T00:02:24] Happy Giraffe: But I'm also wondering how to make it more aggressive
[2021-09-15T00:02:55] Mirono escooters: That's filtering for unwanted voltage noise I think
[2021-09-15T00:03:41] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, yeah xiaomi levers + adc board gives some of that
[2021-09-15T00:03:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: more agressive a low speed means more phase current. so, 80a isn't enought for you.
[2021-09-15T00:04:00] Mirono escooters: Poor flipsky
[2021-09-15T00:04:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: filtering won't change anything to that.
[2021-09-15T00:04:09] Mirono escooters: jolan de drone is designing me a fan mount
[2021-09-15T00:04:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2021-09-15T00:04:37] Mirono escooters: Will allow for 100-120 :)
[2021-09-15T00:04:44] Mirono escooters: It's still quick, but I want more
[2021-09-15T00:04:53] Happy Giraffe: Even 105A didnt make it aggressive
[2021-09-15T00:05:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: in 'single' motor, it's difficult to make a beast. big current flow & big motor needed.
[2021-09-15T00:05:27] Happy Giraffe: But...I get 1200w motor 50mm magnets and see again😂
[2021-09-15T00:07:06] Mirono escooters: 1200w i got too
[2021-09-15T00:07:30] Happy Giraffe: But this is blade motor 👀
[2021-09-15T00:07:42] Mirono escooters: I got awd gen1 350w motors and must say, I'm very afraid it will win in my dragrace 😳 "cheap" side project vs state of art g30
[2021-09-15T00:07:45] Mirono escooters: Hot
[2021-09-15T00:07:58] Artem Bulashev: Normal contorller doesn’t limit phase amps so at the very first puch you will fill it more (square wave contributes there when you slam to max throttle from 0) You would have to set phase current like 135 amps and than would have to switch to BLDC to get that Difference is that after that punch there is basically nothing and vesc starts to gain and wins from about 7kmh
[2021-09-15T00:08:03] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1051@15-09-2021_00-08-03.jpg>

[2021-09-15T00:08:37] Artem Bulashev: May be I have trust issues
[2021-09-15T00:08:52] Happy Giraffe: Why? 😂
[2021-09-15T00:09:07] Artem Bulashev: In Russian we say - made on your knees
[2021-09-15T00:09:58] Artem Bulashev: Meaning quick solution just to make it work/fit = not reliable to use but good to test an idea
[2021-09-15T00:10:29] Happy Giraffe: My idea of putting scooter motor on bike is great then?
[2021-09-15T00:10:37] Artem Bulashev: 😄
[2021-09-15T00:10:53] Happy Giraffe: Need to make some waterproof bag/case for vesc
[2021-09-15T00:11:01] Artem Bulashev: I don’t see why not but def mot direct fit haha
[2021-09-15T00:11:27] Happy Giraffe: We will see tomorrow I go there with a caliper
[2021-09-15T00:11:31] Mirono escooters: Will see in drag race 🤌
[2021-09-15T00:11:45] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-09-15T00:12:21] Mirono escooters: Not me that bended xiaomi frame to fit 1200w
[2021-09-15T00:12:27] Mirono escooters: Even better solution🤌😌
[2021-09-15T00:12:58] Happy Giraffe: It will fit my monorim inverted with spacer well

[2021-09-15T20:36:42] Unknown: If i charge up to 51.5 and i go full throttle, 45A motor amps i drop from "57%" battery down to 14-18% 😂
[2021-09-15T20:36:55] Unknown: Hope my nickel arrives fast

[2021-09-15T20:59:18] Unknown: My 250w m365 motor is 3x 41f, pro has 41, 43, 41f if i'm not mistaking
[2021-09-15T20:59:34] Unknown: No clue if it has anything to do with it at all
[2021-09-15T21:00:48] Unknown: I know shit about hall sensors, guy even made fun of me for thinking i would "upgrade" my motor by upgrading sensors 😭🤣 he tought i was that dumb
[2021-09-15T21:01:47] Unknown: It's just.. efficienty, i'm used to nearly pushing my scoot forward and having a smooth acceleration instead of a stalling old car
[2021-09-15T21:14:29] Happy Giraffe: Whaaat?
[2021-09-15T21:14:52] Happy Giraffe: I already paid for Blade motor😂

[2021-09-16T03:10:49] Happy Giraffe: @lBabacar What was the name of the 3-pin XT style connector?
[2021-09-16T03:12:48] Happy Giraffe: I think Im gonna use that with my pimped ebike so I leave nothing for thieves, controller (with power button) and battery on the rear rack in a bag. This way I only gotta plug two plugs and off I go

[2021-09-16T16:33:58] Happy Giraffe: No way to pull 120A on these😂
[2021-09-16T16:34:08] Happy Giraffe: 95A makes it warm
[2021-09-16T16:34:30] Artem Bulashev: What set up?
[2021-09-16T16:34:43] Happy Giraffe: I meant the garbage motor in general
[2021-09-16T16:34:49] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2021-09-16T16:34:53] Artem Bulashev: I though battery
[2021-09-16T16:34:55] Happy Giraffe: Push* would be right verb
[2021-09-16T16:35:10] Happy Giraffe: I ordered blade 10 1200w motor now
[2021-09-16T16:35:17] Happy Giraffe: Real thicc 50mm magnet
[2021-09-16T16:37:49] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1054@16-09-2021_16-37-49.jpg>
[2021-09-16T16:38:01] Mirono escooters: 100a phase. At end of ride it had less torque. Mosfets 70* lol
[2021-09-16T16:38:51] Mirono escooters: 1200w motor is quite good. It wasnt even warm. Educated guess i say 40*. Love it. Torque is insane and fully charged is so good. Rode 30km and lost 30%. So 100km effective range
[2021-09-16T16:42:03] Artem Bulashev: What vesc is that?
[2021-09-16T16:42:10] Mirono escooters: Flipsky. 🙈
[2021-09-16T16:42:19] Mirono escooters: Jolan is designing me a 40mm fan mount :)
[2021-09-16T16:42:29] Mirono escooters: And winter will help a lot. Love the torque
[2021-09-16T16:42:48] Artem Bulashev: 😊😊✅
[2021-09-16T16:43:09] Artem Bulashev: I was surprised it got that hot, thinking it was Spintend
[2021-09-16T16:43:25] Happy Giraffe: Flipshit
[2021-09-16T16:43:56] Artem Bulashev: Mine on 30a battery and 90a phase - all fets 32c max
[2021-09-16T16:44:01] Happy Giraffe: Are you sure mosfets make good contact with heatsink first?
[2021-09-16T16:44:26] Happy Giraffe: Adding fan is useless if everything before that is not optimal
[2021-09-16T16:45:20] Mirono escooters: Well that heatsink is smol af
[2021-09-16T16:45:26] Mirono escooters: Designed for skateboard
[2021-09-16T16:45:30] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-09-16T16:45:34] Mirono escooters: Heatsink gets hot
[2021-09-16T16:45:44] Artem Bulashev: Spintend - interesting to compare design solution and how vastly different temp is with similar settings
[2021-09-16T16:45:44] Happy Giraffe: Oof
[2021-09-16T16:46:06] Happy Giraffe: I used no thermal paste on 105A phase lmao
[2021-09-16T16:46:08] Happy Giraffe: Was all good
[2021-09-16T16:46:51] Mirono escooters: Big heatsink
[2021-09-16T16:46:55] Mirono escooters: Bigger
[2021-09-16T16:47:03] Mirono escooters: Let winter come quick lol
[2021-09-16T16:47:14] Artem Bulashev: Me too mine just lies in scooter, not even screwed to the deck 😅
[2021-09-16T16:47:20] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁👍👍
[2021-09-16T17:40:39] Happy Giraffe: I screwed to deck so vesc wont bounce and break adc module
[2021-09-16T17:41:02] Mirono escooters: I cant screw flipsky easily
[2021-09-16T17:41:09] Mirono escooters: Big frame big heatsink in my eyes
[2021-09-16T17:49:54] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1055@16-09-2021_17-49-54.jpg>

[2021-09-16T17:50:58] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2021-09-16T17:50:58] Mirono escooters: Wa.. watercooling??
[2021-09-16T17:51:12] Happy Giraffe: Flipsky design is really shitty😂
[2021-09-16T17:51:18] Happy Giraffe: Not sure why I'm surprised
[2021-09-16T17:51:23] Happy Giraffe: They continue to amaze me
[2021-09-16T17:51:41] Mirono escooters: Not easy to add cooling
[2021-09-16T17:51:46] Mirono escooters: And i dont wanna f it up
[2021-09-16T17:51:49] Mirono escooters: Best is fan no
[2021-09-16T17:51:50] Mirono escooters: W
[2021-09-16T17:52:17] Mirono escooters: This is nice
[2021-09-16T17:52:21] Happy Giraffe: Pour some LN2 on it
[2021-09-16T17:52:32] Mirono escooters: 😆
[2021-09-16T17:52:52] Mirono escooters: How did mine at 150a survive
[2021-09-16T17:52:56] Happy Giraffe: They literally put a condom above it to prevent all cooling happening
[2021-09-16T17:53:06] Mirono escooters: Yep mongols
[2021-09-16T17:53:46] Mirono escooters: This is best option , i can easily add fan
[2021-09-16T17:54:24] Mirono escooters: But i direct soldered instead of using connectors as they didnt include em💀
[2021-09-16T17:57:06] Happy Giraffe: I would add an industrial noctua 3000rpm facing to heatsink and board😂
[2021-09-16T17:57:21] Happy Giraffe: Makes lot of noise but its like a tornado
[2021-09-16T17:57:56] Mirono escooters: My plan
[2021-09-16T17:58:02] Mirono escooters: But idk how to mount it (safely)
[2021-09-16T17:58:12] Mirono escooters: Will look when i have energy
[2021-09-16T17:58:27] Mirono escooters: But im gonna seal it soon so needs to be permanent 💀
[2021-09-16T18:02:29] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1061@16-09-2021_18-02-29.jpg>
[2021-09-16T18:03:00] Happy Giraffe: You would need somethinh like a C shape bracket to bolt it into frame
[2021-09-16T18:03:24] Happy Giraffe: Then some support on both sides so it wont fall or twist too much
[2021-09-16T18:07:52] Mirono escooters: I still consider replacing original flipsky heatsink but risky
[2021-09-16T18:09:54] Happy Giraffe: Sell flipsky and buy spintend
[2021-09-16T18:10:00] Mirono escooters: 😆
[2021-09-16T18:10:01] Mirono escooters: No
[2021-09-16T18:10:06] Happy Giraffe: If some idiot buys it
[2021-09-16T18:10:20] Mirono escooters: It works, and with fan should b good
[2021-09-16T18:10:25] Mirono escooters: Its a nice little thing
[2021-09-16T18:18:06] Luis Magalhaes: Would like mine at that temperature 😂😂
[2021-09-16T18:19:27] Luis Magalhaes: X2 😂😂
[2021-09-16T18:22:23] Luis Magalhaes: Mine can go to hot temperatures but is very easy to get it again on 50 55 °c under heavy aceleration it goes above 60 easy
[2021-09-16T18:23:02] Luis Magalhaes: But im using 16S at 70A battery and 130A phase
[2021-09-16T18:23:11] Mirono escooters: 🤌
[2021-09-16T18:23:17] Luis Magalhaes: So.. i think its normal 😂
[2021-09-16T18:25:06] Mirono escooters: If u look at their relativr small heatsink compared to commercial normal. Yes
[2021-09-16T18:25:47] Mirono escooters: @Happy_Giraffe also someone here said interest8ng shit about we thinking vesc has smooth start He said bldc has more aggressive spikes, so i tested Bldc starts agressivee then foc
[2021-09-16T18:26:40] Happy Giraffe: Bldc without sensors? 👀
[2021-09-16T18:27:18] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, but with Blade motor I got hall😎
[2021-09-16T18:27:50] Luis Magalhaes: 👀
[2021-09-16T18:28:02] Happy Giraffe: 👀
[2021-09-16T18:28:33] Luis Magalhaes: 👀👀👀
[2021-09-16T18:28:36] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-09-16T18:29:11] Happy Giraffe: Wont FOC usually use BLDC anyways to start?
[2021-09-16T18:29:24] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-16T18:29:26] Mirono escooters: No, i dont think so
[2021-09-16T18:29:30] Mirono escooters: Bldc was super loud
[2021-09-16T18:29:33] Mirono escooters: Foc. Smooth
[2021-09-16T18:29:50] Luis Magalhaes: I like the foc controll, very manegable at start and if i push it full throttle it starts fast even sensorless
[2021-09-16T18:29:51] Mirono escooters: Still with fully charged 13s and 100a phase im happy. Until vesc overheats
[2021-09-16T18:30:04] Mirono escooters: I raced a small pocketbike and won. Lmao
[2021-09-16T18:30:22] Luis Magalhaes: 🛴🔥🔥🔥
[2021-09-16T18:32:04] Mirono escooters: My dumbass ordered 3000 fish papers 💀
[2021-09-16T18:33:08] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-09-16T18:33:27] Happy Giraffe: I think shity motor was my issue
[2021-09-16T18:33:55] Happy Giraffe: Next time I test, everything is upgraded in motor and got also bt module😂
[2021-09-16T18:33:58] Mirono escooters: Thibk too
[2021-09-16T18:34:13] Mirono escooters: Bt module nice af

[2021-09-16T18:36:50] Happy Giraffe: Gotta dremel the small clips out inside and then put metal clamp with padlock hole to it
[2021-09-16T18:37:37] Happy Giraffe: Silicone edges a little bit and put Lidl bag around it 😎
[2021-09-16T18:38:17] Mirono escooters: 😆
[2021-09-16T18:39:17] Happy Giraffe: Then I can even put thermal paste and use this as a heatsink lol
[2021-09-16T18:39:54] Happy Giraffe: Asked a question in a law group if my diy scooter would be super illegal or not😅
[2021-09-16T18:39:56] Mirono escooters: Also
[2021-09-16T18:40:03] Mirono escooters: Super duper
[2021-09-16T18:40:06] Mirono escooters: Catch me first

[2021-09-16T18:40:48] Happy Giraffe: Haha, old bike with 10" rear wheel😅 Im gonna limit it to 20kmh cruising, and when I wanna wheelie I load another profile

[2021-09-16T18:41:39] Happy Giraffe: I got curved handlebars already
[2021-09-16T18:41:48] Mirono escooters: Now with winter sales go down, i will have time to rebuild mirono a bit and restock. And finally work on my projects
[2021-09-16T18:41:52] Mirono escooters: +10% wheelies
[2021-09-16T18:41:54] Happy Giraffe: Gotta tilt the seat only a bit and Im good to go😅
[2021-09-16T18:42:01] Mirono escooters: Add red lines
[2021-09-16T18:42:04] Mirono escooters: For speed
[2021-09-16T18:42:20] Happy Giraffe: It will be as casual as possible
[2021-09-16T18:42:35] Happy Giraffe: All black/gray parts etc to blend in
[2021-09-16T18:42:42] Mirono escooters: Yea a bike with 10" tires will be casual
[2021-09-16T18:42:47] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>

[2021-09-16T19:27:13] Artem Bulashev: 55c is ideal cpu temp so no deal, anything bellow 68 is ideal
[2021-09-16T19:27:22] Artem Bulashev: Don’t ask me why 68
[2021-09-16T19:27:29] Artem Bulashev: 70 every one says is limit
[2021-09-16T19:27:44] Unknown: Mosfet temp you mean or?
[2021-09-16T19:27:51] Artem Bulashev: Neh
[2021-09-16T19:27:56] Artem Bulashev: Electronics generally
[2021-09-16T19:27:58] Mirono escooters: 69 best
[2021-09-16T19:29:02] Artem Bulashev: 38- 68c rule is from pc world - like ideal system temp
[2021-09-16T19:29:15] Artem Bulashev: 45-55 is cpu ideal range
[2021-09-16T19:29:33] Unknown: Lol
[2021-09-16T19:42:15] Mirono escooters: When vesc regens and bms cuts out, it doesnt kill itself. Nice
[2021-09-16T19:44:27] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2021-09-16T19:57:14] Unknown: Lol
[2021-09-16T20:49:38] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅😅
[2021-09-16T20:50:16] Artem Bulashev: Sounds like you could use the regen assistance device
[2021-09-16T20:51:05] Mirono escooters: I just use mechanical until i drain batt
[2021-09-16T20:51:13] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-09-16T22:55:13] Luis Magalhaes: Im using only mechanical
[2021-09-16T22:56:10] Luis Magalhaes: I tryed the regen but it was not right and i was thinking i burned the ubox 🤣
[2021-09-16T22:56:32] Luis Magalhaes: Someday i will try it again but using a tumb throtlle
[2021-09-16T22:57:09] Mirono escooters: Thumb throttle 🥰
[2021-09-16T23:24:00] Happy Giraffe: Intel laptop CPU 102°c and starts to throttle
[2021-09-16T23:26:21] Mirono escooters: Macbooks. O boy
[2021-09-16T23:27:01] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-09-16T23:59:48] Luis Magalhaes: But for brake 🤣
[2021-09-17T00:10:05] Mirono escooters: I do that
[2021-09-17T00:10:08] Mirono escooters: It's awesom
[2021-09-17T00:32:49] Happy Giraffe: Oh shite thats genius
[2021-09-17T00:49:24] Mirono escooters: It's Awesome precise
[2021-09-17T00:56:29] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I should get one aswell🤔
[2021-09-17T01:00:13] Luis Magalhaes: I would like to have it all in the brake lever but mine is just a switch so i will try it that way some day
[2021-09-17T01:00:29] Luis Magalhaes: I like the electric brake
[2021-09-17T01:01:01] Luis Magalhaes: 2 things that i would like to use on the ubox is the electric brake and cruise control 😂😂
[2021-09-17T01:21:08] Happy Giraffe: Cruise is gay👀 Change my mind
[2021-09-17T01:30:14] Luis Magalhaes: Do a ride off 100km without stopping 😂
[2021-09-17T01:30:40] Luis Magalhaes: At 30kmh 😜
[2021-09-17T01:31:59] Happy Giraffe: I did 60
[2021-09-17T01:32:01] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2021-09-17T01:32:25] Happy Giraffe: Was comfy on the throtte side, my freezing face not so much
[2021-09-17T02:40:11] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-09-17T02:40:58] Luis Magalhaes: You have to try it with cruise controll, if you don't have to maintain the finger on the throttle is even more comfortable
[2021-09-17T09:03:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: loooool
[2021-09-17T11:53:24] Unknown: I tought this was well known 😂ninebot has a few models like that
[2021-09-17T12:34:19] Happy Giraffe: Yes, usually its in brake lever but when proportional lever is not usable its nice😂
[2021-09-17T15:42:47] Unknown: True 😂
[2021-09-17T17:53:44] Luis Magalhaes: Yes nothing new 😂

[2021-09-17T18:42:23] Artem Bulashev: - Vibrationally isolated - quick drop in and release without screwing - right above stem cap at the center 🙃
[2021-09-17T18:43:08] francois schempers: thats neat
[2021-09-17T18:47:22] Artem Bulashev: Hate when “after market look” - crowded handle bar / stem. Want everything to be stealthy or looking sort of like original accessories
[2021-09-17T19:01:55] Unknown: Im staying full stock look m365 beside bottom extender, shocks and motor

[2021-09-17T19:19:57] sombre_enfant: What y'all think ? Could do better with more Discharge ? This is with 20s4p 12.8ah 10A cells, and 2x20A fw...
[2021-09-17T19:23:51] Artem Bulashev: 68kmh?
[2021-09-17T19:24:09] Artem Bulashev: What is the set up? Motors ? Dual ? Battery?
[2021-09-17T19:24:34] Artem Bulashev: 20s
[2021-09-17T19:24:38] Artem Bulashev: Ok no wonder

[2021-09-17T19:25:03] Artem Bulashev: What battery and phase amp settings ?
[2021-09-17T19:26:35] sombre_enfant: Stock controller 20Abatand 65phase per motor, actually its even lower then 20 since real amps dont match with ninebot fw...
[2021-09-17T19:26:50] sombre_enfant: Like 65A bat pull around 40A...
[2021-09-17T19:27:21] Luis Magalhaes: Nice

[2021-09-17T23:22:40] Mirono escooters: I heard clonks when accel or decel hard, think axle nuts unloosened
[2021-09-17T23:22:46] Happy Giraffe: Exactly why I didn't solder😅
[2021-09-17T23:22:57] Happy Giraffe: I change the motor this early
[2021-09-17T23:23:09] Mirono escooters: And my fork is getting wobbly but getting to the nut to tighten is a pain.. with brake cables idk if itd even possible
[2021-09-17T23:23:29] Happy Giraffe: Show us where
[2021-09-17T23:24:42] Mirono escooters: Its g30 rental, i know where it is but its so tight i had to hammer it on, getting it off is pain and requires force
[2021-09-17T23:25:03] Mirono escooters: And brake cables are tight so idk if i have enough spare to get pole lifted. Fml
[2021-09-17T23:25:09] Mirono escooters: I mean its ridable💀
[2021-09-17T23:30:19] Happy Giraffe: You need to use washers and a little bit of locktite in bolts
[2021-09-17T23:30:35] Happy Giraffe: When you want it off then heat up locktite
[2021-09-17T23:38:40] Mirono escooters: Yea they used red loctitz💀
[2021-09-17T23:38:47] Mirono escooters: I had to use heatgun
[2021-09-17T23:38:56] Mirono escooters: My dumbass didny use locktite
[2021-09-17T23:39:20] Happy Giraffe: ....
[2021-09-17T23:39:21] Mirono escooters: I will try to tighten it as it will be super stable. But what a hell. Pole wrapped in carbon too
[2021-09-17T23:39:28] Mirono escooters: Swowy
[2021-09-17T23:39:31] Mirono escooters: That's how we learn
[2021-09-17T23:39:35] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-18T09:15:06] sombre_enfant: Finally u get it from paolo wu ? How much ?
[2021-09-18T11:56:52] Mirono escooters: Evening smort guys
[2021-09-18T11:57:08] Mirono escooters: Can i steal 5v from throttle for front led?
[2021-09-18T11:57:17] Mirono escooters: Or will the small v drop interfere?
[2021-09-18T12:35:40] francois schempers: on what ? spinted ?
[2021-09-18T12:36:43] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 🙈
[2021-09-18T12:45:11] francois schempers: hum, too bad you don't have spinted x) if you take from throttle you'll have to re configure with light on to have the proper scale, you loose some definition on the throttle curve, all thise supposing that the dc/dc converter has some margin Amps wise
[2021-09-18T12:45:21] Happy Giraffe: 150€+30€ shipping
[2021-09-18T12:47:24] Mirono escooters: Stop bullying me for not having spintend 🥲 Just joking
[2021-09-18T12:47:52] Mirono escooters: But i mean its ok to draw such smol current ? Realised its 3.3v too so will step it up. Just smol front led
[2021-09-18T12:48:03] Mirono escooters: And cables are silicon and kinda thic for its purpose
[2021-09-18T12:48:24] Mirono escooters: The reason y i just not get new cable throuch is the sheer difficulty with g30 rental frame
[2021-09-18T12:52:48] Artem Bulashev: It doesn’t
[2021-09-18T12:53:41] Mirono escooters: I already have dead points. Ig it will be even worse
[2021-09-18T12:53:48] Artem Bulashev: It is 0.5amp pulled from 3amp 12v And it has 3.3v pulled from those 5v by LDO if I’m not mistaken
[2021-09-18T12:53:59] sombre_enfant: You will do pic of magnet and coil with size ?
[2021-09-18T12:54:11] Artem Bulashev: You will likely burn out 5v
[2021-09-18T12:54:20] Artem Bulashev: And with that 3.3 will stop working
[2021-09-18T12:54:29] Artem Bulashev: May short 12v than as well
[2021-09-18T12:54:47] sombre_enfant: Get 5v bec
[2021-09-18T12:54:52] Artem Bulashev: Not sure it would worth it. And almost any light will pull more than 0.3a on 5v
[2021-09-18T12:55:07] Artem Bulashev: Unless it is like button light up led
[2021-09-18T12:55:25] Mirono escooters: Oof so i prob burn it?
[2021-09-18T12:55:25] Artem Bulashev: Agree not worth the risk
[2021-09-18T12:55:42] Mirono escooters: Problemo i cant wire another wire through frame. Im at my max 🥲
[2021-09-18T12:56:23] Artem Bulashev: Don’t than
[2021-09-18T12:56:29] Artem Bulashev: Do you have vbat up front ?
[2021-09-18T12:56:36] Artem Bulashev: Where light is?
[2021-09-18T12:56:45] Mirono escooters: No, i used daly bms display to monitor batt v
[2021-09-18T12:56:58] Mirono escooters: I cant steal power from anywhere :/
[2021-09-18T12:57:09] Artem Bulashev: Where is light?
[2021-09-18T12:57:16] Artem Bulashev: Up on steering ?
[2021-09-18T12:57:25] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-09-18T12:57:29] sombre_enfant: Drill that pole if u always busy remove it
[2021-09-18T12:57:31] Mirono escooters: Shit all sealed too, fml
[2021-09-18T12:57:37] Mirono escooters: How drill??
[2021-09-18T12:57:48] Artem Bulashev: And there is not a single line that has battery voltage ??
[2021-09-18T12:57:56] sombre_enfant: Theres spot it wont do damage
[2021-09-18T12:57:58] Mirono escooters: Removing pole fuckin difficult it requires such great force
[2021-09-18T12:58:04] Artem Bulashev: Or 12v at least to step it down
[2021-09-18T12:58:07] Mirono escooters: Im afraid, no
[2021-09-18T12:58:10] Mirono escooters: Maybe from daly bms
[2021-09-18T12:59:05] sombre_enfant: Take it from 3s of your bat then step down so u have 12v and 5v line or from 1s then powerbank board for 5v
[2021-09-18T12:59:34] Mirono escooters: How will i wire it up there
[2021-09-18T12:59:52] Mirono escooters: Another option is to just ram a li ion in pole lmao
[2021-09-18T12:59:55] Artem Bulashev: What power you have up by steering ?
[2021-09-18T12:59:57] sombre_enfant: Take your time its not impossible to remove it
[2021-09-18T13:00:07] Mirono escooters: I have throttle, brake, daly display
[2021-09-18T13:00:19] Artem Bulashev: Daly display uses what?
[2021-09-18T13:00:23] Artem Bulashev: Not vbat?
[2021-09-18T13:00:24] Mirono escooters: Ive done 2 times already , but now pole wrapped in carbon😭
[2021-09-18T13:00:37] Mirono escooters: I honeslty dont know, it uses same port as Bluetooth device
[2021-09-18T13:00:43] Mirono escooters: So not vbat, prob 12v or 5v
[2021-09-18T13:00:55] sombre_enfant: Then pull from this
[2021-09-18T13:01:20] Mirono escooters: But my stem is wobbly too so ill bite the dust and remove pole and try to jam 2 more cables throufh. I got 12v5a stepdown in frame so that solves problems
[2021-09-18T13:01:37] Mirono escooters: My dumbass didnt use threadlocker
[2021-09-18T13:01:59] Mirono escooters: @lBabacar u know the nut size? Think it was 24? I will order the correct one so i can tighten shit out of it
[2021-09-18T13:02:01] sombre_enfant: Dont use red blue is enough if u let it dry
[2021-09-18T13:02:35] Mirono escooters: Rental used red i needed a lot of heat lol
[2021-09-18T13:02:38] Mirono escooters: Will use blue
[2021-09-18T13:02:42] sombre_enfant: Na idek ive done it one time to tighten it and put handlebar voltmeter
[2021-09-18T13:03:13] sombre_enfant: Green is better than blue or ?
[2021-09-18T13:03:37] Mirono escooters: Ionno
[2021-09-18T13:03:49] Mirono escooters: Fak so i have to open scoot and measure then order
[2021-09-18T13:03:58] Mirono escooters: Or i use regular pliers but bad idea i think
[2021-09-18T13:04:09] Mirono escooters: I will file the pole abit so it slides on off better
[2021-09-18T13:04:47] Artem Bulashev: Show me Daly screen

[2021-09-18T13:40:27] Happy Giraffe: I would like to measure weight of my scooter but I got no scale at home

[2021-09-18T16:40:46] Happy Giraffe: Having said this, I hope my replacement spintend works well lol
[2021-09-18T16:40:58] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise I have no chance but to try flipsky single😂
[2021-09-18T16:41:13] sombre_enfant: Ye join flipsky 🙏🏾
[2021-09-18T16:41:27] sombre_enfant: With the dollar tree controller design
[2021-09-18T16:42:57] Happy Giraffe: I should buy the flipsky for my bike projects
[2021-09-18T16:43:29] sombre_enfant: As u should king
[2021-09-18T16:44:53] Happy Giraffe: Lol, I mean the case of flipsky is better
[2021-09-18T16:45:16] Happy Giraffe: Could be made waterproof and bolted into the frame🤔
[2021-09-18T16:45:23] Mirono escooters: Defenitely
[2021-09-18T16:46:34] sombre_enfant: Im pretty sure they already put a shit ton off resin like g30
[2021-09-18T16:46:43] Happy Giraffe: Ubox doesnt have any protection and if I make diy case it will be worse than Flipsky
[2021-09-18T16:46:57] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2021-09-18T16:47:12] sombre_enfant: But well if its sy8502 buck and to 220 size mosfet it will be really easy to fix...
[2021-09-18T16:47:50] Happy Giraffe: Do you think flipsky has same quality components than Spintend?👀
[2021-09-18T16:48:27] sombre_enfant: Spinted not really know at all..
[2021-09-18T16:48:49] Happy Giraffe: They have list of all the components used mosfets etc
[2021-09-18T16:49:43] sombre_enfant: Dont worry i trust this flipsky by the look it will be easy to fix
[2021-09-18T16:50:13] Artem Bulashev: In electronics it is less about components quality but about how you design things on pcb - trace layout - noise management logics - hw design to prevent cross contamination - general correct use of support components like resistors and caps to create stable working IC for example
[2021-09-18T16:50:26] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I'm just a little careful as the spintend failed on me
[2021-09-18T16:50:27] Mirono escooters: Thats super close to its limits of sy8502.. i hope not
[2021-09-18T16:51:07] Happy Giraffe: Lets see how they do it
[2021-09-18T16:52:53] sombre_enfant: No its ok never burned one on 20s, its only when u put 20s fully charged on dumbass ppl hand

[2021-09-19T11:40:08] Mirono escooters: 75v. 20s? Something doesnt add up lmao
[2021-09-19T12:20:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol. yes. I think it's simply a 75V architecture. the 20s is bulshit
[2021-09-19T12:21:06] Mirono escooters: I think too, idk at this point
[2021-09-19T12:21:09] Mirono escooters: Sad. I wanted 20s
[2021-09-19T12:21:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I'd be curious to know which archecture they copied this time 🤣🤣
[2021-09-19T12:21:26] Mirono escooters: Maybe. Hear me out Based on, but improved
[2021-09-19T12:21:32] Mirono escooters: I'd open 1 up for ya
[2021-09-19T12:22:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😍😜
[2021-09-19T12:22:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you already ordered ?
[2021-09-19T12:22:52] Mirono escooters: No, I need to convince myself
[2021-09-19T12:23:00] Mirono escooters: 🥴😆
[2021-09-19T12:24:37] Mirono escooters: Would there be customs I wonder
[2021-09-19T12:26:35] Mirono escooters: FedEx will have customs right
[2021-09-19T12:30:07] Artem Bulashev: 20s - LiFe4 not li-ion I guess 😅
[2021-09-19T12:30:28] Artem Bulashev: 3.2*20= 64
[2021-09-19T12:30:28] Mirono escooters: That's very logical!
[2021-09-19T12:30:48] Mirono escooters: Still good price for 75v
[2021-09-19T12:31:05] Mirono escooters: But no, it says 84v max
[2021-09-19T12:35:05] francois schempers: must be without regen, like absolute no headroom for Vspike
[2021-09-19T12:37:26] sombre_enfant: Nah because theres no in between 80v 100v component and they wouldnt put 80v for 84v+
[2021-09-19T12:38:49] sombre_enfant: Based on 75100 fw but with 84v capable so should be 100v ic, mosfet, caps, resistor...
[2021-09-19T12:39:30] sombre_enfant: And how it look im pretty sure its 6mos to 220 size not direct mount
[2021-09-19T12:41:04] Mirono escooters: 1 way to find out
[2021-09-19T12:46:30] sombre_enfant: Ye u will be our tester

[2021-09-19T16:10:31] Unknown: You can try but you will need someone to balance it out
[2021-09-19T16:10:37] Unknown: It will give vibrations

[2021-09-19T16:13:51] Artem Bulashev: Than it will be like new
[2021-09-19T16:13:59] Artem Bulashev: It is done to cars
[2021-09-19T16:14:03] Artem Bulashev: No difference

[2021-09-19T17:05:50] Mirono escooters: But what about motor w magnets
[2021-09-19T17:10:44] Unknown: No clue, i know that some places have these "rollers" that flatten it back down slowly but no clue about cost
[2021-09-19T17:34:07] francois schempers: i like how he meticulously put the wood on, hammer two time, and then, fuck it,fuck the wood, it's hammer time 🤣🤣
[2021-09-19T17:41:54] Unknown: True 🤣🤣
[2021-09-19T19:49:53] Mirono escooters: If I do silicon at it, would it seal
[2021-09-19T19:50:00] Mirono escooters: Next option is new tire
[2021-09-19T19:52:08] Happy Giraffe: How it got that bent?

[2021-09-19T19:52:59] Happy Giraffe: Oof
[2021-09-19T19:53:03] Mirono escooters: Or new motor or I try to repair this one .
[2021-09-19T19:53:12] Mirono escooters: New tire is almost no option

[2021-09-19T19:57:11] sombre_enfant: Blade can half rim ?
[2021-09-19T19:57:42] Mirono escooters: Any negative points of split rim?

[2021-09-20T11:56:02] Happy Giraffe: That adc board is brittle, I had it one second on 3.3v and it went kaboom😂
[2021-09-20T11:56:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: does 'value' increase when you press.the throttle ?
[2021-09-20T11:56:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳
[2021-09-20T11:56:42] Happy Giraffe: Tru story, luckily I ordered 2
[2021-09-20T11:57:31] Artem Bulashev: I think they die if you switch switches Hot (while plugged in and powered on)
[2021-09-20T11:57:55] Happy Giraffe: I miked it
[2021-09-20T11:58:01] Unknown: They do but just a little bit

[2021-09-20T11:59:27] Unknown: But the brake does not do it 🤔 it did this morning
[2021-09-20T12:05:43] Unknown: My speed does not read also, i did a motor check and motor is fine
[2021-09-20T12:07:27] Happy Giraffe: That's weird, did scooter work tho?
[2021-09-20T12:07:42] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-09-20T12:07:51] Mirono escooters: Broken scooter gang
[2021-09-20T12:07:59] Mirono escooters: Silicon doesnt fix tire
[2021-09-20T12:08:00] Happy Giraffe: +1
[2021-09-20T12:08:12] Mirono escooters: So now I have to cut off 50€ tire
[2021-09-20T12:08:23] Mirono escooters: And hope I can put on tube
[2021-09-20T12:08:26] Happy Giraffe: If motor fucked
[2021-09-20T12:08:30] Mirono escooters: I motor oi
[2021-09-20T12:08:31] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2021-09-20T12:08:36] Mirono escooters: I rode tubeless flat to school mmao
[2021-09-20T12:08:44] Happy Giraffe: 😅
[2021-09-20T12:08:54] Mirono escooters: Next step kugoo motor. Fml
[2021-09-20T12:09:00] Mirono escooters: It would give more speed doe
[2021-09-20T12:09:02] Unknown: Yes it did, i braked turned into a street, gave throttle and like 5m further poof stopped
[2021-09-20T12:09:33] Happy Giraffe: Weird stuff, mine died when accelerating from red light
[2021-09-20T12:09:55] Happy Giraffe: I did gentle acceleration and was stopped for 20sec so no overheating
[2021-09-20T12:10:15] Mirono escooters: Shitend
[2021-09-20T12:10:16] Happy Giraffe: Was really early on my trip aswell, I hope its not a design flaw ...
[2021-09-20T12:10:42] Happy Giraffe: Because Im not gonna fucking pay 30€ tax and my own money to send it back
[2021-09-20T12:10:52] Unknown: I hope not, i guess ill check adc after work
[2021-09-20T12:11:01] Mirono escooters: I'll just keep 12v throttle wired to 3.3v and have deapoints
[2021-09-20T12:11:07] Unknown: Lol
[2021-09-20T12:11:37] Happy Giraffe: And I would keep adc inside anti static bag
[2021-09-20T12:11:54] Happy Giraffe: Letting it touch metal objects could be bad
[2021-09-20T12:12:24] Unknown: I completely wrapped it in heat shrink and electrical tape
[2021-09-20T12:13:02] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-20T12:22:56] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/mDC-NDJKZFM
[2021-09-20T12:23:08] Happy Giraffe: When I finally get scooter working again
[2021-09-20T12:28:12] Mirono escooters: Haha catch me first
[2021-09-20T14:17:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: adc are really sensitive. i wonder if only motor phase perturbations couldn't induce voltage spikes to adc (aboce 3.7v) and fry it. i already observed the spikes... and fried 2 stm32 adc (not while accelerating, just plug it in)
[2021-09-20T14:18:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i started to add uart power control to remove the adc line on smart for vesc. it works for 1 motor for now. i'll try with both when i can.
[2021-09-20T14:19:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also, use shielded wires 😅😅
[2021-09-20T14:20:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: my learnings for a succesful vesc usage :
[2021-09-20T14:20:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1/ never plug anything on the vesc with battery plugged
[2021-09-20T14:21:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 2/ never use 5v throttle directly on adc
[2021-09-20T14:21:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 3/ use shielded cables for adc and uart 4/ put 3.3v lines only on uart (even if 5v tolerant on IO)
[2021-09-20T14:22:03] Artem Bulashev: Man I finally have mine fixed
[2021-09-20T14:22:03] Artem Bulashev: Tire was fucked
[2021-09-20T14:22:03] Artem Bulashev: Now replacent arrived and its sooo smooth, no more vibrations and shit and no pressure loss 🙂🙂
[2021-09-20T14:22:03] Artem Bulashev: And I finally got perfect set up on my motor without crazy oscillation / getting stuck at 5-15kmh
[2021-09-20T14:25:44] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2021-09-20T14:26:15] Artem Bulashev: So smoooth
[2021-09-20T14:26:37] Artem Bulashev: I have 80a phase and 15a battery set
[2021-09-20T14:27:25] Mirono escooters: Vroom
[2021-09-20T14:27:27] Artem Bulashev: Top speed 47.5kmh because of low battery current, but even that is amazingly smooth and quick
[2021-09-20T14:27:30] Mirono escooters: I prefer to shoot away
[2021-09-20T14:28:50] Artem Bulashev: That scroll wheel throttle is so enjoyable at this power 🥰 gliding like on a cloud ☁️
[2021-09-20T14:29:02] Artem Bulashev: Perfect eco mode
[2021-09-20T14:29:32] Artem Bulashev: Lol though 47kmh on such low power is awesome
[2021-09-20T14:30:03] Artem Bulashev: And that will be 55kmh once I finish 60v mod
[2021-09-20T14:30:29] Artem Bulashev: Will probably have to reduce even more for eco mode
[2021-09-20T14:32:07] Artem Bulashev: What people say about vsett 10+ lol 🤣🤣 too much power😅 motors are f awesome
[2021-09-20T14:32:07] Artem Bulashev: When you set the P12 (start strenght) to 5 you will be barely able to hold on this scooter, thats how brutal it is. Mine P12 is set to 2 at 180 weight with gear and I strugle to keep the wheels from spinning, and I never even tried the 3 level for P12. The only issue you might get is the range .. which is not so great
[2021-09-20T14:32:21] Mirono escooters: Hahaha yep p12 to 5 is craaazy
[2021-09-20T14:32:25] Mirono escooters: Its fun
[2021-09-20T14:32:29] Mirono escooters: On my offroad thing it's on 5
[2021-09-20T14:32:39] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2021-09-20T14:32:55] Mirono escooters: With it i just wanna go vroom. No range
[2021-09-20T14:36:10] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2021-09-20T14:54:40] Happy Giraffe: No such thing exist
[2021-09-20T14:54:53] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-20T15:51:19] Artem Bulashev: Oh wow
[2021-09-20T15:51:36] Artem Bulashev: Got range test
[2021-09-20T15:51:40] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1091@20-09-2021_15-51-40.jpg>
[2021-09-20T15:56:42] Artem Bulashev: 52v 13ah Chinese batter Dual motor 20km it did full speed 48kmh 6km it did 40-42kmh 2km 30kmh 1.5km 20->10kmh
[2021-09-20T15:57:38] Happy Giraffe: Not bad at all
[2021-09-20T15:58:00] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi esc 48v20A gives 40-45km range 30-35kmh avg speed
[2021-09-20T15:58:38] Happy Giraffe: Havent been able to go even 50% batt with vesc as the piece of shit died
[2021-09-20T15:58:54] Artem Bulashev: On vsett square wave Sinewave modulated controllers I did 26kmh before it stopped on single motor 23a. Vesc would do 30km but also it is dual 15a*2 🙃🙃 very nice
[2021-09-20T16:00:07] Happy Giraffe: I used 40A batt for these😂
[2021-09-20T16:00:56] Artem Bulashev: 676wh /26km = 26w per km on stock 676wh /30km = 22.533w per km on vesc
[2021-09-20T16:01:02] Artem Bulashev: Max speed?
[2021-09-20T16:01:24] Happy Giraffe: Max speed about 40kmh, I rode 30-35 usually
[2021-09-20T16:03:42] Artem Bulashev: Ok so lower than mine by 25% even at 30% higher current Hard to compare, but 48v*20=960w battery / 42.5km = 22.588w per km
[2021-09-20T16:04:23] Artem Bulashev: So similar to my current set up with vesc, but get it from dual motor and at 25% higher speed.
[2021-09-20T16:07:17] Artem Bulashev: On vsett i did range test 25-35kmh and got to 39.5km range (that’s closer to your speed, also was single motor, closer to your set up) 676wh/39.5 km=17.11w per km ❤️ Some wave modulated controller ☺️☺️
[2021-09-20T16:25:05] Unknown: I read not to connect anything with vesc powerd, and what you mean shielded cable?
[2021-09-20T16:27:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not even 'not powered but connected to the battery'. i fried mine like that. even.not fully powered, a part is under power.
[2021-09-20T16:27:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1092@20-09-2021_16-27-03.jpg>
[2021-09-20T16:27:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: shielded cable
[2021-09-20T16:27:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for ANY manipulation, disconnect the battery
[2021-09-20T16:31:32] Artem Bulashev: Yeah so many people told me heh it works 🎯 5v is all ok 😂
[2021-09-20T16:35:09] Artem Bulashev: EMI come from High CURRENT, not high voltage So if you don’t put signal cables along battery wires or Phase wires or battery at all! Than no need ✅ careful planning is needed should be possible to run phase wires on one side and signal wires on other side
[2021-09-20T16:40:01] Mirono escooters: Me just yeeting it in
[2021-09-20T17:01:56] Unknown: This is not the case, battery wires and phase wires are all below deck, my adc comm wires go straight trough steering wheel
[2021-09-20T17:02:23] Unknown: Does do some weird shit now anyway
[2021-09-20T17:02:36] Unknown: But not as it should work, not gonna drive this 😂
[2021-09-20T17:02:55] Unknown: <video_file>
[2021-09-20T17:03:07] Unknown: My brake does not sense, only throttle and throttle senses from 2.88 to 2.91v
[2021-09-20T17:07:59] Unknown: I see there is an rc remote option, anyone ideas about this? 😂 might just ruin an old rc controller and fix throttle/brake on 1 side with it then
[2021-09-20T17:08:28] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't lol. It's for using throttle on skateboards
[2021-09-20T17:09:17] Unknown: I know, but same prinipal right? I know poeple who use adc type on skateboards
[2021-09-20T17:09:42] Mirono escooters: No its not adc
[2021-09-20T17:09:51] Mirono escooters: I know, as I firstly connected throttle to it
[2021-09-20T17:11:26] Artem Bulashev: Looks like adc board dead
[2021-09-20T17:11:55] Artem Bulashev: Did you do any re connections on it while scooter is on, or did you flip any of the switches on it ?
[2021-09-20T17:12:10] Artem Bulashev: This is exactly how it looks when ADC board dies
[2021-09-20T17:12:40] Artem Bulashev: After all I recommend just using dedicated 3.3v throttle and brake.
[2021-09-20T17:13:31] Mirono escooters: Good kwolity then
[2021-09-20T17:13:36] Artem Bulashev: I’m super glad I got my Spintend with wireless remote 😅😅😅 my life is so much easier - charge and zip tie it lol
[2021-09-20T17:35:44] Unknown: I did not, i just turned into a street. Braking, turning, throttle and 2 sec later it quit on me
[2021-09-20T17:35:47] Unknown: And dang
[2021-09-20T17:36:20] Unknown: Where did you get that wireless remote? Could i use it for trampa? 😂 i have trampa bt module though :/
[2021-09-20T20:35:58] Mirono escooters: Not me using 8mm banana plug on 500w motor
[2021-09-20T20:36:08] Mirono escooters: Its clearly not as powerful as 1200w, but I hope its still ok
[2021-09-20T20:36:13] Mirono escooters: That tire Is thin😭
[2021-09-20T20:45:49] Artem Bulashev: 8mm banana is used in xt150
[2021-09-20T20:45:53] Artem Bulashev: So yeah
[2021-09-20T20:46:52] Artem Bulashev: Over kill, probably for like 150amps phase considering they are rated DC
[2021-09-20T20:49:25] Mirono escooters: Nothing better locally
[2021-09-20T20:49:29] Mirono escooters: I use 100a phase so
[2021-09-20T20:49:37] Mirono escooters: Pls let this motot work
[2021-09-20T20:52:00] Mirono escooters: Sensorless detected but hall sensors with foc selected in setup🥴
[2021-09-20T20:54:11] Mirono escooters: Seems like motor works. hoorai
[2021-09-20T20:54:22] Mirono escooters: Disk adaptor thing bent so no rear brake for now. Lmao
[2021-09-20T20:54:27] Artem Bulashev: More is better in this case
[2021-09-20T21:01:31] Mirono escooters: Oki so If it clonks at 0 start and then moves. Signs of no hall sensor ig
[2021-09-20T21:07:08] Mirono escooters: Best cheap motors Looking for 45-50kmh on 13s 100a phase
[2021-09-20T21:08:21] Artem Bulashev: Even with configured hall mine used to get sort of stuck in between 05-15kmh I think aprox
[2021-09-20T21:08:44] Artem Bulashev: I re did my motor config again and again
[2021-09-20T21:08:53] Artem Bulashev: Now I have perfect set up
[2021-09-20T21:09:15] Artem Bulashev: Alway do it on fullll battery
[2021-09-20T21:09:31] Artem Bulashev: And be able to test drive it right after
[2021-09-20T21:09:35] Mirono escooters: A
[2021-09-20T21:09:43] Mirono escooters: But its like clonk and then it perfectly accels from 0
[2021-09-20T21:09:45] Artem Bulashev: So I did in undergrad garage at night
[2021-09-20T21:09:46] Mirono escooters: 🤷‍♂️
[2021-09-20T21:09:58] Artem Bulashev: Make video
[2021-09-20T21:10:04] Mirono escooters: Ypmor
[2021-09-20T21:10:05] Mirono escooters: Tomorrow
[2021-09-20T21:10:12] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-09-20T21:10:19] Artem Bulashev: Mine used to twitch
[2021-09-20T21:11:06] Artem Bulashev: Now it’s perfect from 0, so it’s possible (some how settings effect it that mulch) I think I did hall detection at 70amps manually
[2021-09-20T21:11:22] Mirono escooters: U can manually detect hall?
[2021-09-20T21:11:25] Mirono escooters: I try tomorrow again
[2021-09-20T21:14:09] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-09-20T21:14:42] Artem Bulashev: Basically what motor tab has one type of motor wizard - it does process differently
[2021-09-20T21:15:07] Artem Bulashev: And than there is wizard at first tab on top which does motor detection in its own way.
[2021-09-20T21:15:34] Artem Bulashev: Also it seems like doing motor confit on well warmed up motor is better idea than room temp motor
[2021-09-20T21:15:39] Mirono escooters: Whot ._.
[2021-09-20T21:15:41] Mirono escooters: Can u show tabs
[2021-09-20T21:15:45] Artem Bulashev: But that is speculation
[2021-09-20T21:15:50] Artem Bulashev: From pc
[2021-09-20T21:16:06] Mirono escooters: I always used on first tab
[2021-09-20T21:16:16] Artem Bulashev: See there is other
[2021-09-20T21:16:27] Artem Bulashev: But I think first one gives better results over all
[2021-09-20T21:16:44] Artem Bulashev: But different every time you try run it 😊
[2021-09-20T21:18:01] Mirono escooters: Ye true xd
[2021-09-20T21:18:13] Mirono escooters: But y it says sensorless detected
[2021-09-20T21:18:19] Mirono escooters: And then hall sensors in motor setup lmao
[2021-09-20T21:38:49] Happy Giraffe: Yes...
[2021-09-20T21:40:20] Mirono escooters: U have same problem
[2021-09-20T21:40:41] Mirono escooters: ?*
[2021-09-20T21:41:22] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2021-09-20T21:41:48] Happy Giraffe: First time I manually ran hall sensor detection it gave me results
[2021-09-20T21:42:07] Happy Giraffe: Second time nothing, but my hall is fucked so
[2021-09-20T21:42:28] Mirono escooters: I will run again tomorrow
[2021-09-20T21:42:32] Mirono escooters: First test ride to school
[2021-09-20T21:42:36] Mirono escooters: It sounds faster
[2021-09-20T21:42:43] Mirono escooters: 37kmh on 1200w was just sad
[2021-09-20T21:42:50] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-09-20T21:42:57] Mirono escooters: I mean I like wheelie torque but speed is allowed too
[2021-09-20T21:42:57] Happy Giraffe: 1200w blade 65
[2021-09-20T21:43:15] Happy Giraffe: I think faster kv more efficient with foc
[2021-09-20T21:43:42] Happy Giraffe: We got torque and efficiency then
[2021-09-20T21:44:36] Mirono escooters: Tru tru
[2021-09-20T21:44:53] Mirono escooters: Hence y I want higher kv motor not
[2021-09-20T21:44:54] Mirono escooters: Now
[2021-09-20T21:45:10] Mirono escooters: What to do w 1200w lmao
[2021-09-20T21:45:24] Mirono escooters: High v scoot ig
[2021-09-20T22:04:36] Mirono escooters: 11" rear 10" front, bad idea?
[2021-09-20T22:06:16] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt matter imo
[2021-09-20T22:06:31] Happy Giraffe: I ran 8.5" front 10" in back before
[2021-09-20T22:06:33] Mirono escooters: I think with rear suspension I'm a bit lower now
[2021-09-20T22:07:09] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1093@20-09-2021_22-07-09.jpg>
[2021-09-20T22:07:10] Mirono escooters: :)
[2021-09-20T22:07:28] Happy Giraffe: If you buy motor, get blade
[2021-09-20T22:07:35] Mirono escooters: How much
[2021-09-20T22:07:41] Mirono escooters: Wich specs
[2021-09-20T22:07:46] Happy Giraffe: These Pirate hyped scooters can be shitty
[2021-09-20T22:07:50] Happy Giraffe: 150€
[2021-09-20T22:07:57] Mirono escooters: 😀
[2021-09-20T22:07:59] Happy Giraffe: 50mm magnet 1200w
[2021-09-20T22:08:04] Happy Giraffe: 65kmh 13s

[2021-09-20T22:16:11] Mirono escooters: But 60v 85kmh How I calculate for 48v Still should b high
[2021-09-20T22:16:54] Happy Giraffe: 48:60=0.8
[2021-09-20T22:17:04] Happy Giraffe: So your speed is 80% of the 60v
[2021-09-20T22:17:14] Mirono escooters: A
[2021-09-20T22:17:16] Mirono escooters: Fast
[2021-09-20T22:17:28] Happy Giraffe: But it's probably on air

[2021-09-20T22:24:44] Artem Bulashev: Mine does 55-58 if you give it 15-17a both motors at full charge 14s
[2021-09-20T22:25:36] Happy Giraffe: 13s blade motor should be 50kmh on empty batt, or with full batt and low throttle
[2021-09-20T22:26:04] Mirono escooters: It's interesting

[2021-09-20T23:13:43] Mirono escooters: It's a replacement motor for a reason
[2021-09-20T23:13:51] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁😁
[2021-09-20T23:13:56] Mirono escooters: I will try to fix 1200w, I figured out I don't need a new motor Im just broke
[2021-09-20T23:14:22] Mirono escooters: 1200w is electronically all fine, it's damn tire. It's leaking but not as much as before. So second layer off silicon; next step is tube tire
[2021-09-20T23:14:27] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1098@20-09-2021_23-14-27.jpg>

[2021-09-20T23:14:52] Mirono escooters: Its a damn good tire, me no wanna burn it off
[2021-09-20T23:15:11] Happy Giraffe: I never liked the idea of tubeless haha, maybe on cars but scooters...😅
[2021-09-20T23:15:19] Mirono escooters: Yea highfive
[2021-09-20T23:15:26] Mirono escooters: But atleast use tire until its gone
[2021-09-20T23:15:35] Mirono escooters: Anddd I suck at placing new tire
[2021-09-20T23:15:50] Happy Giraffe: Blade 10 split rim👀
[2021-09-20T23:15:54] Mirono escooters: No split rim with tubeless is fucked
[2021-09-20T23:16:01] Happy Giraffe: With actually proper looking 6 bolts
[2021-09-20T23:16:13] Mirono escooters: As tubeless goes even more around it so it seals itself
[2021-09-20T23:16:24] Happy Giraffe: Yes, but buy motor with tube place and be happy😎
[2021-09-20T23:16:33] Mirono escooters: If I had money
[2021-09-20T23:16:56] Mirono escooters: 1200w good for me, I will just use it
[2021-09-20T23:17:08] Mirono escooters: Now fix it first🥴
[2021-09-21T01:31:13] Happy Giraffe: This guy's battery fucked up so thought I could wire the light to 18650, measured charge output 4.5v😅😂 maybe not then....
[2021-09-21T01:31:48] Artem Bulashev: On single cell??
[2021-09-21T01:32:19] Happy Giraffe: Normally this has 220mA batt
[2021-09-21T01:32:35] Happy Giraffe: If it outputted 4.2v then 18650 would be insanely good
[2021-09-21T01:32:53] Happy Giraffe: Would have been like 3 day batt life
[2021-09-21T07:39:48] Mirono escooters: Will still give light no
[2021-09-21T09:06:56] Happy Giraffe: Can be USB/5v powered without batt
[2021-09-21T09:07:08] Happy Giraffe: Possible rear light contender but lets see
[2021-09-21T10:33:00] francois schempers: xD

[2021-09-21T17:57:59] Mirono escooters: Split rim could get new tire in 20 mins depending on environment
[2021-09-21T17:58:12] Mirono escooters: I want big heavy tire but can't get on

[2021-09-21T18:01:12] Happy Giraffe: Motorcycle / gasoline scooter workshop would be even better
[2021-09-21T18:01:24] Happy Giraffe: But the same press they use for tires should do the job
[2021-09-21T18:03:11] Happy Giraffe: Or if not, they propably can guide you where to go or what equipment is best for mounting these yourself
[2021-09-21T18:03:29] Mirono escooters: I got tire levers but nothing more
[2021-09-21T18:03:32] Happy Giraffe: If I charged 25€ for mounting scooter tires I would be a rich man😂
[2021-09-21T18:03:52] Mirono escooters: For that money i will keep on dying inside

[2021-09-21T20:54:44] Happy Giraffe: Yes...
[2021-09-21T20:55:09] Artem Bulashev: Because 10k rpm of 1kg of tire is a lot specially at that thickness
[2021-09-21T20:55:17] Artem Bulashev: Only one way to find out
[2021-09-21T20:55:24] Happy Giraffe: I had one bolt out of 5 removed from Monorim sideplate and pumping from 2-4 bar made the side bend already😂 (ofc I didn't ride it)
[2021-09-21T20:55:45] Happy Giraffe: Scooter 1.5k rpm luckily
[2021-09-21T21:08:48] Artem Bulashev: What??
[2021-09-21T21:08:53] Artem Bulashev: Really damm
[2021-09-21T21:09:07] Artem Bulashev: I’m so glad I simply bought vsetg haha
[2021-09-21T21:09:29] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-21T21:09:52] Happy Giraffe: Monorim motor made for solid tire
[2021-09-21T21:10:00] Artem Bulashev: I was considering m365 pro2 and g30 as a platform before… but bought Aerlang from Alibaba for 250€
[2021-09-21T21:10:06] Artem Bulashev: Than sold it for 500€
[2021-09-21T21:10:20] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-21T21:10:25] Artem Bulashev: And got vsett 9 for my birthday adding 450€
[2021-09-21T21:10:47] Artem Bulashev: Yeap was pretty sweet move
[2021-09-21T21:12:38] sombre_enfant: I would start another scoot on a chinese frame on alibaba who can fit around 200 18650 but idk wich one... Or is it really hard to create a frame ?
[2021-09-21T21:15:49] Happy Giraffe: There are ready ones👀
[2021-09-21T21:15:56] Mirono escooters: You guys select ebike hub motor too in motor setuo?
[2021-09-21T21:16:11] Mirono escooters: Im going 35-40
[2021-09-21T21:16:11] Happy Giraffe: Medium outrunner
[2021-09-21T21:16:13] Mirono escooters: And its mm
[2021-09-21T21:16:15] Mirono escooters: 1
[2021-09-21T21:16:17] Mirono escooters: A*
[2021-09-21T21:16:32] Mirono escooters: Only 750g??
[2021-09-21T21:16:37] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt matter
[2021-09-21T21:16:47] sombre_enfant: Wym brotha
[2021-09-21T21:18:41] Mirono escooters: All works
[2021-09-21T21:18:44] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1104@21-09-2021_21-18-44.jpg>
[2021-09-21T23:15:12] Happy Giraffe: I saw earlier some frames sold for 250€ ish
[2021-09-21T23:34:53] Face de Pin Sucé: Use your foot to push on this part of the tyre and it will be easier to pull it like you started
[2021-09-21T23:40:01] Happy Giraffe: Pro tip: Double check tire rotation😅😂
[2021-09-21T23:49:07] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1106@21-09-2021_23-49-07.jpg>
[2021-09-21T23:49:09] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2021-09-22T10:52:35] francois schempers: well it you take the price of a good frame, both front and back suspension, disque adaptors, good handle bar, the price os suddenly not that expensive for a all in one ready to play product ^^
[2021-09-22T11:01:37] Face de Pin Sucé: If you forget it's a really shitty frame, yeah
[2021-09-22T11:32:07] Happy Giraffe: I can get proper moto frame for same 1.2k€ with shipping😂
[2021-09-22T11:50:33] sombre_enfant: Wich frame is good to start a dual 72v?
[2021-09-22T11:53:18] Happy Giraffe: Dual 72v would be like Vsett 10
[2021-09-22T11:53:21] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-22T11:53:49] Happy Giraffe: But you don't need the last voltages as nobody wants to ride 100kmh, except Face
[2021-09-22T11:53:55] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-22T11:54:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Weped, Thunder, Ultra, DT2 (and equals, like new, eagle, EX,..) DT3
[2021-09-22T11:54:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Vsett 10 maybe, but small battery possible regarding size of the frame
[2021-09-22T11:55:32] Happy Giraffe: G30 with extension😂
[2021-09-22T11:56:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Speedway leger, but you need custom front fork
[2021-09-22T11:57:46] sombre_enfant: Any scheme to make a frame ? As i'll need around 200-240 18650 cells and 2 controller
[2021-09-22T11:58:54] Happy Giraffe: I think you would want an alu frame
[2021-09-22T11:59:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Look at st2060 (copy of dualtron ultra with longer deck)
[2021-09-22T12:00:17] sombre_enfant: We in the same city u kno, do u have any spare frame with nothing on it ?
[2021-09-22T12:06:01] Mirono escooters: Woops
[2021-09-22T12:06:25] Mirono escooters: Will get longer levers
[2021-09-22T12:06:32] Mirono escooters: And softer tire
[2021-09-22T13:13:26] Happy Giraffe: You did oopsie?😂😂😂
[2021-09-22T13:16:26] Mirono escooters: I will drive backwards
[2021-09-22T13:16:50] Happy Giraffe: I have also 2.5" mounted wrong way due to disc adapter
[2021-09-22T13:17:02] Happy Giraffe: Its more like X than V pattern so its ok
[2021-09-22T13:25:17] Luis Magalhaes: Its better to buy the actualy scooter 😂
[2021-09-22T13:28:48] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1107@22-09-2021_13-28-48.jpg>
[2021-09-22T13:28:58] Luis Magalhaes: Im europe ti30 😂
[2021-09-22T13:30:46] Luis Magalhaes: A friend of mine had built a 72v with ykz 80A dual he get is frame for 400€ a tne frame was a good deal
[2021-09-22T15:10:06] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2021-09-22T15:39:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Not really xD I have a DT2 EX Frame that might be available for 500€, I planned on working on it, but I have no time
[2021-09-22T15:47:07] Mirono escooters: Flj being useful
[2021-09-22T15:47:11] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1108@22-09-2021_15-47-11.jpg>
[2021-09-22T15:47:16] Mirono escooters: Split rim video
[2021-09-22T15:48:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Split rim is good
[2021-09-22T15:49:01] Face de Pin Sucé: But tubeless is even better
[2021-09-22T15:49:06] Mirono escooters: I kbo i dont have it
[2021-09-22T15:49:14] Mirono escooters: I have tubeless without split rim..
[2021-09-22T15:49:17] Mirono escooters: And my tubeless sucked
[2021-09-22T15:49:22] Mirono escooters: Prob seller related
[2021-09-22T15:49:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Rip
[2021-09-22T15:50:07] Mirono escooters: Cant seem to lever new tire on
[2021-09-22T15:50:12] Mirono escooters: Maybe brand tire Maybe brand motor
[2021-09-22T15:58:51] sombre_enfant: Too poor to buy the rest (motor who fit) 😅
[2021-09-22T16:06:29] Mirono escooters: Apperanrly tire is off rim at the "tsjoepap" where ur air goes in
[2021-09-22T16:06:32] Mirono escooters: Not where i cutted
[2021-09-22T16:09:54] Face de Pin Sucé: X)
[2021-09-22T18:18:00] Luis Magalhaes: Tubless i think is always without split ring
[2021-09-22T18:18:16] Mirono escooters: Somewhere logical
[2021-09-22T18:18:19] Luis Magalhaes: I like the split ring but i like more the tubless
[2021-09-22T18:18:23] Mirono escooters: Altough this is
[2021-09-22T18:18:34] Mirono escooters: I cant get tubeless on lmao i hate it
[2021-09-22T18:19:02] Luis Magalhaes: Only problem in tubless is if you had to remove the tyre
[2021-09-22T18:19:20] Luis Magalhaes: But i had more problems with the tube then in tubless
[2021-09-22T18:19:39] Luis Magalhaes: It was easier to resolve but had to do it more times
[2021-09-22T18:20:26] Luis Magalhaes: In my last cst road tyres i had 3 flats but the rubber was almost gone it 😂😂 so i think its normal
[2021-09-22T20:53:39] Mirono escooters: Ig im weak
[2021-09-23T05:40:09] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1109@23-09-2021_05-40-09.jpg>
[2021-09-23T05:40:11] Artem Bulashev: Well
[2021-09-23T05:40:37] Artem Bulashev: Soldering 2x 3mm to the pack is not easy and not fan 😄😄
[2021-09-23T05:41:10] Artem Bulashev: Disgusting
[2021-09-23T05:41:43] Artem Bulashev: Need to buy like 120w soldering iron to give it enough juice
[2021-09-23T05:42:35] Artem Bulashev: May be 80 will do
[2021-09-23T05:46:49] Artem Bulashev: Other wise getting close, all wires all inside grooves, only one place crosses a cell from lower row, but that has 3 layer of isolation + this side won’t be against hard wall of the scooter All wires to exact length, no loose ends 👌
[2021-09-23T05:50:45] Artem Bulashev: All high risk spots have triple isolation at least. Main power negative has 4 layers on cells, and doubles shrink-tube (and even more at the corner where it bends around)
[2021-09-23T07:05:39] Artem Bulashev: Now need re-solder negative with proper iron and solder positive bus and wire the the plug 8wg should be enough for 6
[2021-09-23T07:05:49] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1112@23-09-2021_07-05-49.jpg>
[2021-09-23T08:05:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seems nice !
[2021-09-23T08:05:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-09-23T08:37:58] Artem Bulashev: Still have enough space for gps tracker of BMS
[2021-09-23T08:38:52] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1113@23-09-2021_08-38-52.jpg>
[2021-09-23T08:39:04] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1114@23-09-2021_08-39-04.jpg>
[2021-09-23T08:40:41] Artem Bulashev: Remote BMS shut off 🤪 and SIM card is supplier 😅 wonder if it works in Eu
[2021-09-23T08:42:49] Artem Bulashev: This BMS has some odd way. - before plugging in, find 5v battery and put positive to Bat- of BMS and negativ to power- of BMS. This will lock set it into protective mod - connect wiring - place it on charger to activate Any one saw anything like this before? Seems smart but unusual
[2021-09-23T09:21:03] Face de Pin Sucé: I have tubeless split rim 😁
[2021-09-23T09:21:20] Artem Bulashev: 🧐
[2021-09-23T09:23:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Weped and Bronco are tubeless split rim
[2021-09-23T09:24:23] Happy Giraffe: Thats weird af, the rim has some sort of rubber between the parts?
[2021-09-23T09:24:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes exactly

[2021-09-23T09:26:16] Face de Pin Sucé: If you zoom, you'll see the separation
[2021-09-23T09:26:52] Happy Giraffe: Only held by 6 bolts?
[2021-09-23T09:27:39] Happy Giraffe: Valve pretty interesting too, I never had tubeless
[2021-09-23T09:28:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes and then another 6 bolts for motors that also hold rim
[2021-09-23T09:28:39] Face de Pin Sucé: I replaced those valves when I made the new bigger motors
[2021-09-23T09:29:02] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1116@23-09-2021_09-29-02.jpg>
[2021-09-23T09:29:17] Face de Pin Sucé: I use those ones now because motor is laaaarge AF
[2021-09-23T09:35:17] Happy Giraffe: What motor was that?
[2021-09-23T11:04:10] Mirono escooters: Those cables🥰

[2021-09-23T11:11:21] Face de Pin Sucé: With 7AWG phases
[2021-09-23T11:11:50] Face de Pin Sucé: For wattage I can't say, factory where I made those told me their tools can't measure xD
[2021-09-23T11:13:55] Mirono escooters: Hot
[2021-09-23T11:52:14] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2021-09-23T11:52:29] Happy Giraffe: Are you pulling a train with that?
[2021-09-23T11:53:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a weped, kind of train 🤣
[2021-09-23T11:53:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha yes
[2021-09-23T11:53:42] Face de Pin Sucé: @koxx3 did you try it when you were here ?
[2021-09-23T11:53:46] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't remember
[2021-09-23T11:54:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hummm. this one, not sure. only tried the one with 'square' tires.
[2021-09-23T11:54:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah, mine then, the one on the pic isn't ready yet
[2021-09-23T11:55:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeap
[2021-09-23T11:55:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Torque is amazing with those motors and square tires
[2021-09-23T11:55:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: did you retry the vesc on it ?
[2021-09-23T11:56:12] Face de Pin Sucé: The only working one I have is in my Spider and I'm goin to put it inside the DT Mini for my customer
[2021-09-23T11:56:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-09-23T11:57:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the dt mini will fly with dual vesc/motor ! 😁
[2021-09-23T11:57:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: will he change the battery too ?
[2021-09-23T11:57:57] Face de Pin Sucé: It used to work well before my customer destroyed his motor cables 😂
[2021-09-23T11:58:01] Face de Pin Sucé: 60V21Ah
[2021-09-23T11:58:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-09-23T12:21:42] Luis Magalhaes: Nice, not usually 👌
[2021-09-23T12:57:29] sombre_enfant: Flipsky vesc 75100 aparently have this mos
[2021-09-23T12:57:49] Mirono escooters: Nice !
[2021-09-23T12:58:34] sombre_enfant: Seems to be the best 100v mos out there
[2021-09-23T12:58:47] Mirono escooters: Seems good indeed
[2021-09-23T12:59:00] Mirono escooters: Magnachip is used in v3 xiaomi too
[2021-09-23T13:00:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: mosfet seems good, but if thermal dissipation is shit, it will be useless 😅
[2021-09-23T13:00:25] Mirono escooters: It has a nice casing
[2021-09-23T13:00:28] Mirono escooters: I will test it
[2021-09-23T13:00:37] Mirono escooters: Will be listed on alie nex week
[2021-09-23T13:00:55] sombre_enfant: Remove the case screw it to frame and good
[2021-09-23T13:01:05] sombre_enfant: Inchallah
[2021-09-23T13:01:14] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-09-23T13:01:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: dirty but right !
[2021-09-23T13:01:20] Mirono escooters: Will see if possible
[2021-09-23T13:07:05] sombre_enfant: It look like a random ahh controller to me, probably in too part case
[2021-09-23T13:07:39] sombre_enfant: Mosfet screwed to heatsink and heatsink screwed to the case...
[2021-09-23T15:06:52] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂😂😂
[2021-09-23T15:06:56] Artem Bulashev: Damm

[2021-09-23T16:54:46] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1118@23-09-2021_16-54-46.jpg>
[2021-09-23T16:55:47] Mirono escooters: How is it your brand? So cool
[2021-09-23T16:56:24] sombre_enfant: Nice would be glad to visit your workshop a day...
[2021-09-23T16:56:24] Face de Pin Sucé: It's kind of new
[2021-09-23T16:56:53] sombre_enfant: U will do scooter or only motor ?
[2021-09-23T16:57:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Motor, controllers, batteries
[2021-09-23T16:58:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe someday a scooter, we'll see
[2021-09-23T17:00:27] sombre_enfant: Cool anyway u will get motor with like 155mm axle ?
[2021-09-23T17:03:30] francois schempers: how much you're planning on selling them ?
[2021-09-23T17:04:26] Mirono escooters: Prob out of my budget lol
[2021-09-23T17:05:27] sombre_enfant: Once i get 3 salary i build a good scoot like this
[2021-09-23T17:06:06] Face de Pin Sucé: I have to look haha
[2021-09-23T17:06:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Too much for now, will depend how many I order from the factory (for now it's 650€ the motor)
[2021-09-23T17:06:42] Mirono escooters: Jeeeeeeeezus
[2021-09-23T17:06:55] Mirono escooters: That was my whole scooter budgrt
[2021-09-23T17:07:07] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-09-23T17:07:31] francois schempers: can we see how it look inside ? :3
[2021-09-23T17:08:07] sombre_enfant: I dont know about high end scoot, is it too expensive or normal price for this kind of motor ?
[2021-09-23T17:08:49] Face de Pin Sucé: I didn't took pictures :/
[2021-09-23T17:08:58] Face de Pin Sucé: But when I open one, I'll take some
[2021-09-23T17:09:19] Face de Pin Sucé: It is and it is not 😂
[2021-09-23T17:09:21] francois schempers: 👌
[2021-09-23T17:09:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Way more powerful than TunExtrem motors and same price including VAT
[2021-09-23T17:10:04] francois schempers: thats a 6kw motor no ?
[2021-09-23T17:10:30] Face de Pin Sucé: But comparing to Weped FS Motors (which are already more powerfull than TunExtrem) it is hell expensive (Weped FS are 300€/each)
[2021-09-23T17:10:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Honestly I can't tell, factory wasn't able to measure, their tool stops at 40nm torque

[2021-09-23T17:12:23] Mirono escooters: 10kw???
[2021-09-23T17:12:26] Mirono escooters: Jeezus
[2021-09-23T17:13:05] Face de Pin Sucé: 20Kw is what it takes to run more than 120Kmh apparently
[2021-09-23T17:13:26] Mirono escooters: That's so much jezus

[2021-09-23T18:16:05] Happy Giraffe: @artBula do I need spintend remote to control the 12v output from vesc?
[2021-09-23T18:17:11] Happy Giraffe: Light would go into the fan port?
[2021-09-23T18:37:38] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-09-23T18:38:02] Artem Bulashev: Fan port? Light into light, horn into horn
[2021-09-23T18:38:44] Artem Bulashev: You can use it as 2.5amps 12v supply and just run any normal switch and device like horn or light without remote than
[2021-09-23T18:38:55] Happy Giraffe: I already have the power button there in Led1/2 port🤔
[2021-09-23T18:39:06] Artem Bulashev: What are you talking about
[2021-09-23T18:39:12] Happy Giraffe: Power button
[2021-09-23T18:39:48] Artem Bulashev: There is remote controls dedicated outputs for headlamp and horn - they are named so
[2021-09-23T18:39:55] Happy Giraffe: Isnt this the only source of 12v?

[2021-09-23T18:42:33] Happy Giraffe: "cries in single esc"
[2021-09-23T18:42:48] Artem Bulashev: Fan is enabled based on temp sensor and not controlled by user I think
[2021-09-23T18:43:16] Happy Giraffe: So I need to put step down from batt 48v -> 12v?

[2021-09-23T18:46:00] Happy Giraffe: Cooler master lmao, it might perform worse than a lower powered noctua
[2021-09-23T18:46:22] Artem Bulashev: we are taking about Spintend intended fan haha not mining rig

[2021-09-26T16:52:35] Mirono escooters: Soc sucks on daly. No accurate
[2021-09-26T19:07:03] Unknown: No clue, i do know daly is quality overall
[2021-09-26T19:09:39] Happy Giraffe: Daly basic bms are great
[2021-09-26T19:09:55] Happy Giraffe: Never had any issue
[2021-09-26T19:10:53] Unknown: +1 :D
[2021-09-26T19:11:21] Happy Giraffe: Too many features=unreliability
[2021-09-26T19:11:53] Unknown: True
[2021-09-26T20:06:23] Mirono escooters: Daly is good but dissapointed me
[2021-09-26T20:06:35] Mirono escooters: With my daly I cant switch discharge on off. ._.
[2021-09-26T20:06:38] Happy Giraffe: Never failed me on 4000km
[2021-09-26T20:06:48] Mirono escooters: Well not that but stupid design solutions
[2021-09-26T20:06:56] Happy Giraffe: Don't buy the retarded models
[2021-09-26T20:07:19] Mirono escooters: I got smart bms one with that display.. :)
[2021-09-26T20:07:21] Unknown: Previous daly 5000+km no probs
[2021-09-26T20:07:29] Mirono escooters: Anyway daly.is indeed 1 of the best options
[2021-09-26T20:07:29] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-09-26T20:07:54] Unknown: Can i connect bms to vesc over uart btw?
[2021-09-26T20:08:12] Mirono escooters: Sadly I cant turn it on off So when it protections. I cant turn on manually So I need to run with scooter and regen so it turns on😆
[2021-09-26T20:08:59] Unknown: Lol, never had that prob, and my cutoff was at 38v at 13s
[2021-09-26T20:09:21] Mirono escooters: I mean w the display
[2021-09-26T20:09:30] Mirono escooters: I had to ask them so they could program it or smth
[2021-09-26T20:09:32] Mirono escooters: Weird story
[2021-09-26T20:09:37] Unknown: Oh lol
[2021-09-27T10:05:19] Mirono escooters: I hope bad spotwelds but All cells drop 0.2v 1 drops to 3v Xd
[2021-09-27T10:05:27] Mirono escooters: Will check I got spare cells in case needed
[2021-09-27T11:13:24] Mirono escooters: Is attaching heatsinn on heatsinn worthless? I mean yea there's less thermal transfer as it only.rests on the fins But would it do something?
[2021-09-27T11:13:33] Mirono escooters: Tryna fix my flipKy overheating
[2021-09-27T11:17:28] Artem Bulashev: I just tested my pack. I’m almost finished. Cell 2 balance is open circuit. No other flaws found 👌 looks like solder didn’t flow too well due to copper heat dissipation
[2021-09-27T11:57:52] Mirono escooters: Will have to see. Maybe bad spotweld
[2021-09-27T11:58:04] Mirono escooters: But they discharge together so capacity well
[2021-09-27T11:58:37] Artem Bulashev: 80w beast with pure copper 8mm tip for best heat transfer and large heat mass 😁😁 now that negative wire solder will flow 👍👍
[2021-09-27T11:58:59] Unknown: 🔥
[2021-09-27T11:59:10] Unknown: <photos/photo_1136@27-09-2021_11-59-10.jpg>
[2021-09-27T11:59:56] Unknown: 60w solder, was'nt really good enough, took a while to get it on nicely
[2021-09-27T12:00:10] Mirono escooters: Cries in 45
[2021-09-27T12:00:33] Artem Bulashev: I have 25mm x 130mm x 0.1mm copper and 0.1mm pure nickel
[2021-09-27T12:01:20] Artem Bulashev: and I need to dual 3mm solid copper bus on top
[2021-09-27T12:01:46] Artem Bulashev: So heat just runs away from my 55w soldering iron with tiny tip
[2021-09-27T12:01:48] Unknown: Mine are 0.15 thick, not sure bout the other dimensions anymore and haven't tested if it's pure or not
[2021-09-27T12:01:53] Unknown: Should be pure nickel
[2021-09-27T12:02:11] Unknown: I feel you 😂
[2021-09-27T12:02:28] Artem Bulashev: It also has to do with thermal mass of the iron tip
[2021-09-27T12:02:43] Artem Bulashev: Small will give heat away and become cool
[2021-09-27T12:03:08] Mirono escooters: Bigger tip helps too
[2021-09-27T12:03:11] Artem Bulashev: Hope this one will manage haha
[2021-09-27T12:03:22] Unknown: I hope for you :p
[2021-09-27T12:03:39] Artem Bulashev: This
[2021-09-27T12:04:50] Unknown: Why so big and thick? Would'nt it be better to have smaller stacking to the middle?
[2021-09-27T12:12:38] Artem Bulashev: This solid comes in the between 3-4. Solid copper IR is a lot lower than stranded wire of the same dia. So cells 1-3 are covered by single bus, 4-8 are covered by double bus. That’s huge over kill for 60amps max draw pack, but should reduce sag under load (reduce losses)
[2021-09-27T12:13:26] Mirono escooters: Overkill is nice
[2021-09-27T12:47:02] Happy Giraffe: Sexxy
[2021-09-27T12:53:14] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1138@27-09-2021_12-53-14.jpg>
[2021-09-27T12:53:19] Face de Pin Sucé: For those who wanted to see
[2021-09-27T12:53:39] Mirono escooters: Thicc
[2021-09-27T12:54:15] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1139@27-09-2021_12-54-15.jpg>
[2021-09-27T12:54:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Normal weped at left Rage mechanics at right
[2021-09-27T12:54:58] Artem Bulashev: Right one makes a lot more sense considering the width of the axle
[2021-09-27T12:55:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Could do even larger (100mm magnets, but wanted to try 75mm first)
[2021-09-27T12:57:57] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1140@27-09-2021_12-57-57.jpg>
[2021-09-27T12:58:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Normal weped motor vs Etwow motor
[2021-09-27T12:58:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Just so you can have a comparison
[2021-09-27T12:59:07] Luis Magalhaes: Dam thats big 😂
[2021-09-27T13:01:00] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1141@27-09-2021_13-01-00.jpg>
[2021-09-27T13:01:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Etwow stator vs Rage Stator
[2021-09-27T13:03:46] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2021-09-27T13:04:00] Luis Magalhaes: Huge difference 👌
[2021-09-27T13:05:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Almost died 😂
[2021-09-27T13:05:39] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2021-09-27T13:24:25] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2021-09-27T13:24:40] Mirono escooters: Wow
[2021-09-27T13:24:42] Mirono escooters: Love it
[2021-09-27T13:32:02] Artem Bulashev: Way to brake magnets 😅😅 also magnets loose strength on direct impact ✅
[2021-09-27T13:32:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Was trying to film, didn't happened like I wanted 😂
[2021-09-27T13:32:45] Artem Bulashev: I would be more gentle ;-)
[2021-09-27T13:32:51] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅
[2021-09-27T13:33:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't worry, I reopened after, and it's okay ;)
[2021-09-27T13:33:16] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-09-27T13:34:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-09-27T13:34:51] Artem Bulashev: Had once magnetic bits flying/ rolling around with magnetic field switching (ended up braking other magnets and motor parameters were fluctuating)
[2021-09-27T13:36:06] Mirono escooters: How else
[2021-09-27T13:37:13] Mirono escooters: It's so strong lol
[2021-09-27T18:10:56] Mirono escooters: Smort ppl Motor cutoff with a 2 wire brake Does it "short" gnd and signal together or 5v and signal My best bet is 5v and signal?
[2021-09-27T18:11:48] Unknown: I think it depends, does it brake or not?
[2021-09-27T18:12:12] Mirono escooters: Well I used 3 wire brake
[2021-09-27T18:12:19] Mirono escooters: But greentime programmer sucks
[2021-09-27T18:12:28] Mirono escooters: And just decided It will be 0 brake or 10p brake
[2021-09-27T18:12:29] Mirono escooters: 100
[2021-09-27T18:12:35] Mirono escooters: Even with linear xiaomi brake
[2021-09-27T18:12:43] Mirono escooters: So I wanna switch to 2 wire brake as it doesnt even mattee
[2021-09-27T18:12:56] Mirono escooters: So I just wonder what 2 I use of the 3
[2021-09-27T18:13:00] Mirono escooters: I think + and signal wire
[2021-09-27T18:13:03] Mirono escooters: Seems logical
[2021-09-27T18:14:06] Unknown: Ooh like that, not sure about that but idd connection seems ch and + imo
[2021-09-27T18:14:15] Unknown: Where would it get power otherwise
[2021-09-27T18:14:42] Unknown: Or the brake should work on + as channel and get power that way
[2021-09-27T18:15:43] Mirono escooters: True
[2021-09-27T18:16:01] Unknown: Maybe paolo knows
[2021-09-27T18:16:06] Unknown: In the other group
[2021-09-27T18:16:34] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1142@27-09-2021_18-16-34.jpg>
[2021-09-27T18:16:37] Mirono escooters: I was confused as
[2021-09-27T18:16:40] Mirono escooters: Here its black and white
[2021-09-27T18:16:44] Mirono escooters: Black is gnd universal
[2021-09-27T18:16:46] Mirono escooters: White signal
[2021-09-27T18:17:13] Mirono escooters: Butt logical thinking a ebrake workss with linear going up in v
[2021-09-27T18:17:46] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi ebrave gives out how much v when braking full?
[2021-09-27T18:17:57] Unknown: 4.8-4.95
[2021-09-27T18:18:33] Unknown: I was thinking about ordering some 3.3v sensors and replace sensors to maybe get it to work on vesc withiut adc
[2021-09-27T18:18:39] Unknown: But can't find sensors
[2021-09-27T18:18:53] Mirono escooters: Oh nice, so the controllers isn't max 3.3v
[2021-09-27T18:19:07] Mirono escooters: Hpmp
[2021-09-27T18:19:08] Mirono escooters: Hmmm
[2021-09-27T18:19:09] Mirono escooters: Good ifea
[2021-09-27T18:19:48] Unknown: Not even sure if i'd work, but i,ve looked into it and it really is just a sensor and a magned
[2021-09-27T18:20:28] Unknown: So hall sensor for sure, but seems hard to find 3.3v sensors.. or sketchy sensors wich don't have any specs and go from 0.5-36v etc
[2021-09-27T18:23:34] Unknown: I've read it's possible to do with a resistor, but not the best option
[2021-09-27T18:25:44] sombre_enfant: 5v+signal on brake hall wire and it brake to max
[2021-09-27T18:31:07] Unknown: Think there might not be 3.3v output sensors
[2021-09-27T18:34:41] Mirono escooters: Ok thanks
[2021-09-27T18:34:48] Mirono escooters: Y? :(
[2021-09-27T18:35:18] Mirono escooters: stupid Chinese solution is under lets say 4.8v it just cuts motor Above it brakes full
[2021-09-27T18:35:32] Mirono escooters: Stupid design. It's not like it isn't measuring v bcs it cuts motor way before
[2021-09-27T18:36:51] Mirono escooters: What is pdd? For example 115pdd
[2021-09-27T18:36:53] Mirono escooters: For brakes
[2021-09-27T18:37:55] sombre_enfant: On my lil bro scoot i used a brainpower controller with hall brake and e49 sensor it works fine
[2021-09-27T18:38:09] Mirono escooters: I used shitty greentime

[2021-09-27T18:38:57] sombre_enfant: Its an avao scoot stock controller never stopped to burn on ebrake
[2021-09-29T16:48:25] Unknown: I just kicked off a nice mirror.. guy almoast ran over me so i started shouting at him, had the balls to open hes window and shout back.. not many options left, kicked it off turned around and got the hell out of there
[2021-09-29T16:48:44] Mirono escooters: On a bad day someone's mirror will go
[2021-09-29T16:48:49] Mirono escooters: Fucking car drivers.
[2021-09-29T16:48:49] Unknown: My motor so freaking hot rn 😭😂
[2021-09-29T16:48:55] Unknown: So true
[2021-09-29T16:49:07] Mirono escooters: He deserved it
[2021-09-29T16:49:50] Unknown: He really did, some old ass guy in hes fancy bmw, think it was a z4 idk, cabrio model in any matter don't know if there's other Z models
[2021-09-29T16:50:04] Mirono escooters: Fakik bmw
[2021-09-29T16:50:19] Mirono escooters: Car Always aggressive against scooters, think they are right and we are bad
[2021-09-29T16:51:48] Unknown: Idd, i had to turn left, i clearly made notices that i was going to do that, he was standing behind me and then just accelerates past me as i start turning
[2021-09-29T16:52:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i had a z4, but i wasn't agressive 😅😁
[2021-09-29T16:52:18] Unknown: Bc u got scootscoot now
[2021-09-29T16:52:26] Unknown: It has always been inside of you 😂😂
[2021-09-29T16:53:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: since 5 years, yes 😁
[2021-09-29T16:53:04] Mirono escooters: Only way to teach em idiots is to cost em money
[2021-09-29T16:53:09] Mirono escooters: Or insurance or like this
[2021-09-29T16:53:34] Unknown: Haha, yes it's just some drivers.. not brand related, but usually the "badasses" drive merc, bmw, audi
[2021-09-29T16:53:56] Unknown: Well i always think damnn should've just ran into him
[2021-09-29T16:54:06] Unknown: But then again, scoot might break
[2021-09-29T16:54:18] Unknown: Don't feel like driving a bicycle to work 😂
[2021-09-29T16:55:41] Mirono escooters: Hahaha same
[2021-09-29T16:55:44] Mirono escooters: Backup scootscoot
[2021-09-29T17:01:48] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-09-29T17:03:15] Happy Giraffe: I never had problems here haha, they just rev up their RS6 audis and I give them thumbs up
[2021-09-29T17:03:58] Happy Giraffe: Guy with open exhaust (toggleable Akrapovich?) motorbike did same, was best exhaust sounds I heard in a long time
[2021-09-29T17:04:28] Happy Giraffe: So many nice outlaws here to have some fun on the road😂
[2021-09-29T17:12:35] Unknown: German is awesome for that, and i can appreciate such things really, but don't go and pass a scoot after he clearly sticks up hes arm for 5 secs to indicate hes going left
[2021-09-29T17:13:26] Unknown: As i take off he wants to pass by.. less then 20cm in front of me, really lucky i saw him coming in the corner of my eye
[2021-09-29T17:20:45] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, idiots happen. Sadly they don't realize how dangerous this is for us

[2021-09-29T19:16:00] Luis Magalhaes: The sun was shining so i had to ride 😂
[2021-09-29T19:16:06] Mirono escooters: Beast
[2021-09-29T19:18:38] Luis Magalhaes: I put the battery amps of the controllers to 35A each so it won't sag too much, and i was thinking of not pass 40kmh +-
[2021-09-29T19:19:39] Luis Magalhaes: It rides fine like that 😂 but was doing 75A each
[2021-09-29T19:20:20] Luis Magalhaes: Reallly love to be able to switch this things in software 👌
[2021-09-29T19:21:55] Mirono escooters: Yess same
[2021-09-29T19:35:13] Artem Bulashev: 35a each is still a lot
[2021-09-29T19:35:23] Mirono escooters: Big scoot
[2021-09-29T19:35:27] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-09-29T19:35:35] Mirono escooters: When I will go to sea I will lowa powa
[2021-09-29T19:35:55] Artem Bulashev: Bigger motor produce more torque from same amps
[2021-09-29T19:37:37] Unknown: I'm on 30a bat amps, 80 amp motor, motor heats up drasticly if i go to 40 batt 😂
[2021-09-29T19:38:18] Luis Magalhaes: From 160A max from battery 70A total is a good value for the cells 😂
[2021-09-29T19:50:06] Happy Giraffe: Time to test it out soon, hopefully Spintend doesnt use 0.99$ shipping to me
[2021-09-29T19:50:55] Happy Giraffe: There seems to be multiple custom clearances in China, stuck now in second after a week😅
[2021-09-29T21:23:42] Luis Magalhaes: Bangood was delaying some scooters that they cant sent to Portugal now 😅

[2021-09-30T12:26:05] sombre_enfant: Say walahi
[2021-09-30T12:26:12] Mirono escooters: My nerdy ass likes the black casing, it's efficienter heat dissipation
[2021-09-30T12:26:15] Mirono escooters: If I had money I'd buy it
[2021-09-30T12:35:12] sombre_enfant: Why its not a 98$ tho ?
[2021-09-30T12:35:31] Mirono escooters: Taxes
[2021-09-30T19:12:28] Mirono escooters: Hy team. I wanna bolt down my plexiglass plate so in combination with a rubber gasket it's pretty much waterproof

[2021-09-30T19:12:46] Mirono escooters: Recommendations how to make a groove so I can get a bolt?
[2021-09-30T19:12:53] Mirono escooters: Don't worry it won't be tightened hard
[2021-09-30T19:12:59] Mirono escooters: Just don't fancy breaking my plexiglass
[2021-09-30T19:13:11] Mirono escooters: Just a dremel and slowly dremel away?
[2021-09-30T19:24:44] Happy Giraffe: If plexi was wider you could just drill a hole👀
[2021-09-30T19:31:38] Mirono escooters: I know :/
[2021-09-30T19:31:45] Mirono escooters: Its tight tolerances
[2021-09-30T19:32:17] Mirono escooters: But I hope bolting it down on silicon rubber thing will make it waterproof
[2021-09-30T19:32:21] Mirono escooters: It should🤔
[2021-09-30T19:32:30] Mirono escooters: Custom silicon fitting mold with soaped plexiglass plate
[2021-09-30T20:54:49] Happy Giraffe: Lol, get stanley screw clamp to hold them😂
[2021-09-30T20:55:10] Mirono escooters: Stanley?
[2021-09-30T20:55:11] Happy Giraffe: 1 in each corner, sticking upwards😂
[2021-09-30T20:55:48] Mirono escooters: Let's keep it abit clean

[2021-09-30T22:49:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: let's hope they can repair it. curious to see how they procees such after sale
[2021-09-30T22:50:11] Mirono escooters: I hope good Dont expect much
[2021-09-30T22:50:27] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I am wondering what is the design flaw that they have. I hope it doesn't come again with the same issue.
[2021-09-30T22:51:04] Happy Giraffe: But as it sparked like hell when I connected battery in, does it seem like a short somewhere?
[2021-09-30T22:53:05] Artem Bulashev: You don’t have anti spark xt90?
[2021-09-30T22:53:18] Artem Bulashev: Mine on 52v has 0 spark - UBOX
[2021-09-30T22:53:52] Happy Giraffe: I have
[2021-09-30T22:54:03] Happy Giraffe: It sparked inside with some smoke
[2021-09-30T22:55:03] Happy Giraffe: Connecting battery is normal spark, this came through the case I think😅
[2021-09-30T22:58:06] Artem Bulashev: With anti-spark connector there can not be spark …
[2021-09-30T22:58:11] Artem Bulashev: That’s the whole point
[2021-09-30T22:58:24] Artem Bulashev: I would show you mine but I’m away
[2021-09-30T22:58:40] Artem Bulashev: I would argue that your anti spark plug is defective most likely
[2021-09-30T22:58:56] Artem Bulashev: Check resistance of the plug with multi meter
[2021-09-30T22:59:14] Artem Bulashev: Specially considering you have lower voltage
[2021-09-30T22:59:40] Artem Bulashev: Spark increases as voltage difference increases - mine is 14s
[2021-09-30T23:14:34] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1155@30-09-2021_23-14-34.jpg>
[2021-09-30T23:14:42] Mirono escooters: Lets see if my weak ass can do it now, otherwise the other 3" i know i can
[2021-09-30T23:27:45] Happy Giraffe: Bro I said it smoked and burned inside😂
[2021-09-30T23:27:54] Happy Giraffe: It sparked inside with some smoke
[2021-09-30T23:28:59] Happy Giraffe: And I never got spark when connecting the batt to esc so I guess antispark worked 100%, until vesc shorted itself inside on some design shit
[2021-09-30T23:32:45] Luis Magalhaes: Mine was simple.. they send me a new one, just need some photos to see what burned 😅
[2021-09-30T23:34:52] Luis Magalhaes: Mine i think it desolder the positive wire inside 😅
[2021-09-30T23:35:55] Happy Giraffe: My antispark worked perfect until the vesc failed on traffic lights and burned itself inside😂
[2021-09-30T23:36:20] Happy Giraffe: But we will see what John says, I dont like their lack of insulation in batt wires etc
[2021-10-01T10:51:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: spintend arriving in france for me. 9€ VAT & custom fees. 😁
[2021-10-01T10:52:21] Artem Bulashev: Dual?

[2021-10-01T11:46:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yep !
[2021-10-01T11:56:18] Happy Giraffe: For me 9+20€ then😂
[2021-10-01T11:56:43] Happy Giraffe: How long did it take in total to arrive?
[2021-10-01T12:25:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: still not arrived
[2021-10-01T12:26:54] Mirono escooters: Fair pricing. Belgium 25€ administration costs
[2021-10-01T12:31:20] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-01T14:01:22] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2021-10-01T14:08:44] Artem Bulashev: No it is not :-) that’s rate for Courier :-) Postal custom clearing doesn’t ever vost more than 5-10euro
[2021-10-01T14:09:02] Artem Bulashev: It is same EU wide regulation
[2021-10-01T14:09:14] Artem Bulashev: Couriers charge 15-25euro
[2021-10-01T14:14:43] Happy Giraffe: Yeap
[2021-10-01T14:14:45] Happy Giraffe: Scam
[2021-10-01T14:15:10] Happy Giraffe: But now I order everything from Ali with VAT prepaid so they can fk themselves😂
[2021-10-01T14:23:48] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-10-01T14:24:48] Artem Bulashev: Only works if you select Ali Express shipping or saver
[2021-10-01T14:25:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh ?! i didn't know !
[2021-10-01T14:25:25] Artem Bulashev: Now you do 😎
[2021-10-01T14:25:40] Artem Bulashev: Another trick
[2021-10-01T14:26:53] Artem Bulashev: If you order 3-4 orders all with standard AliExpress Standard or AliExpress saver They will collect those orders in china and ship all together as AliExpress Standard (even though some or all of them you paid as Saver)
[2021-10-01T14:27:32] Artem Bulashev: This can help get goods as fast as Standard and save you few more $ from each order
[2021-10-01T14:28:23] Happy Giraffe: Wow, it has prepaid VAT already🌚
[2021-10-01T14:29:01] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2021-10-01T14:29:13] Happy Giraffe: Smart boi move
[2021-10-01T14:31:53] Mirono escooters: Bpost🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
[2021-10-01T14:34:19] Artem Bulashev: Neh highly highly unlikely
[2021-10-01T14:34:46] Artem Bulashev: Have any previous package customs invoice like @koxx3 sent above ?
[2021-10-01T14:35:56] Artem Bulashev: Goods over 150€ can not be pre paid. So AliExpress will not have Vat included for those.
[2021-10-01T14:36:59] Artem Bulashev: Wow
[2021-10-01T14:37:03] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1157@01-10-2021_14-37-03.jpg>
[2021-10-01T14:38:27] Artem Bulashev: In Austria there is no 0€ (5€ is minimal fee even on 2$ package) - which is why pre paid tax on AliExpress is awesome (pay 20% from 2$ and no 5€ fee)
[2021-10-01T14:38:53] Artem Bulashev: But yeah 15€ for up to 150€ and 32€ fee for above that is nuts
[2021-10-01T14:38:59] Happy Giraffe: On large packages I think they would open it up anyway and see👀
[2021-10-01T14:39:07] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2021-10-01T14:39:36] Happy Giraffe: But theres maybe a chance when you might be lucky and dont have to pay😅
[2021-10-01T14:42:34] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1158@01-10-2021_14-42-34.jpg>
[2021-10-01T14:42:38] Artem Bulashev: Here is Austrian
[2021-10-01T14:43:55] Happy Giraffe: Not bad
[2021-10-01T14:43:57] Artem Bulashev: 6€ under 150€ 12€ for over 150€
[2021-10-01T14:44:11] Artem Bulashev: Yeah better than 15 and 32 in bpost
[2021-10-01T14:44:18] Happy Giraffe: Is this applied everytime?
[2021-10-01T14:44:44] Artem Bulashev: That’s the fee if documents were missing
[2021-10-01T14:44:59] Artem Bulashev: And they have to store and contact you in person and request docs from you manually
[2021-10-01T14:45:23] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-01T14:45:25] Artem Bulashev: For example they suspect that item value is fake and lowered so they will ask you for invoice
[2021-10-01T14:45:38] Artem Bulashev: This was always like that
[2021-10-01T14:46:50] Artem Bulashev: There is though 45€ value for no-VAT if items is from person to person and is a gift (value incl shipping cost 😕)
[2021-10-01T14:51:25] Happy Giraffe: Thats why its "esc from china" instead of esc based on vesc project. If they google that we are fucked😂
[2021-10-01T14:51:51] Artem Bulashev: They write usually toy speed controller yeah
[2021-10-01T15:31:03] Mirono escooters: Fck em

[2021-10-01T15:36:06] Happy Giraffe: Prime ministers luxus yacht of course
[2021-10-01T17:25:14] Mirono escooters: Our minister had a affair with a spanish pornhub woman, wouldnt be surprised

[2021-10-02T00:17:28] Mirono escooters: I first planned on getting 500, but too expensive. Ended up with tesla 3 cells 🙃
[2021-10-02T00:18:26] Luis Magalhaes: I was thinking of upgrade to 18S but using my 16S battery's and adding 2S
[2021-10-02T00:18:38] Mirono escooters: Possible
[2021-10-02T00:18:49] Luis Magalhaes: But don't know of its not better to get more parallels and have more ah
[2021-10-02T00:19:03] Luis Magalhaes: Would have less voltage saf too

[2021-10-02T10:41:32] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-10-02T10:41:35] Artem Bulashev: Why
[2021-10-02T10:41:48] Mirono escooters: I measured cst vs other tire Inner of cst 15.5cm Tuovt 15cm Guess that makes a difference
[2021-10-02T10:41:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: they are bankrupt
[2021-10-02T10:41:54] Mirono escooters: Huh??
[2021-10-02T10:42:02] Mirono escooters: They bankrupt??
[2021-10-02T10:42:03] Artem Bulashev: Where is that info comming from?

[2021-10-02T11:29:31] Unknown: @Happy_Giraffe you still use your wheelway? I push 40A batt 50A motor, i get up to 48kmh but i feel like i'm burning my motor. Seems sad for only 50A motor 🤔😂 how is your vsett compared to your wheelway?
[2021-10-02T11:37:12] Mirono escooters: Y u feel like ur burning it
[2021-10-02T11:46:02] Artem Bulashev: How old is it?
[2021-10-02T11:46:12] Mirono escooters: Very old
[2021-10-02T11:46:19] Mirono escooters: I started disassembling now
[2021-10-02T11:46:37] Mirono escooters: It was my friends first pack, he went 15s so I got it, and let's say he is still learninh
[2021-10-02T11:46:38] Mirono escooters: Or was
[2021-10-02T11:46:59] Mirono escooters: It worked fine for the time being but hotglue and 0 isolation (apart from loose welds ) weren't going to laqt
[2021-10-02T11:47:08] Artem Bulashev: I get to 48kmh with 17a rear and 13a front battery current lol. Vsett 9+
[2021-10-02T11:47:26] Mirono escooters: I just pushed summer through and now in winter I can revisit it and build properly with holders and shi
[2021-10-02T11:48:06] Artem Bulashev: I use to have it as single motor 28a battery current - did 55kmh
[2021-10-02T11:56:56] Unknown: I'm only on 12s arthem 😂 and i feel like i'm buring it bc no temp sensor yet, and the closer i get to home, the less powerfull it seems, as in acceleration, but the top goes from lets say 44 cold to 46-48 after driving a while. Just accelerates less fast
[2021-10-02T11:58:08] Unknown: I was thinking maybe to upgrade the phase wires, but i don't think that's gonna make my motor heat up less 🤔😂
[2021-10-02T12:15:12] Artem Bulashev: That won’t :)) windings heat up
[2021-10-02T12:15:33] Artem Bulashev: Step up voltage
[2021-10-02T12:15:38] Artem Bulashev: Or re wind motor
[2021-10-02T12:15:41] Artem Bulashev: Or change motor
[2021-10-02T12:15:50] Artem Bulashev: If you need more or faster acceleration
[2021-10-02T12:16:52] Unknown: Acceleration is'nt really the prob, i like speed, i can't step up in voltage bc trampa vesc (12s max) and i got no single clue about how to correctly re wind a motor 😂
[2021-10-02T12:34:42] Face de Pin Sucé: That's really nice
[2021-10-02T12:35:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Actually, it helps, but it's not magic
[2021-10-02T12:37:27] Unknown: I know, i feel like i would waste time on a motor wich i will probably still replace in a while because of the heat
[2021-10-02T12:37:54] Unknown: I feel like it drains my batt too much for the power it gives out
[2021-10-02T12:38:15] Unknown: So i'm looking to maybe get a new motor 250 price ranged
[2021-10-02T12:38:21] Unknown: And a good one this time 😂
[2021-10-02T12:38:55] Unknown: I drain 40% of 16.800mah batt doing like idk 15-20 km
[2021-10-02T12:55:02] Artem Bulashev: 12s? Going max speed all the time / slamming to full throttle every time you star going?
[2021-10-02T12:56:04] Artem Bulashev: Your battery is about 748wh mine is 52v 13ah = 676wh And I never got less than 26km from mine even with stock controller 23amps and now with dual motor 80a phase both and 13a front / 17a rear batter limit and UBOX controller I get 30km
[2021-10-02T12:59:09] Artem Bulashev: So yeah 12s 16.8ah battery should be getting you a lot further! (10% larger than mine china cells 676wh battery) I would expect 29-33km range from your battery 😕 full to empty
[2021-10-02T13:00:31] Artem Bulashev: Yea oh wait! 40% battery in 15-20km is perfectly normal!! I get 40km range if I let off and go 25-35kmh max = for your battery 44km should be
[2021-10-02T13:10:41] Mirono escooters: I go 80km realistically on 25ah 13s
[2021-10-02T13:17:53] Unknown: Yes i go full throttle basicly at takeoff, my settings are 60 phase -40 phase 80 max phase 40 batt -10 batt batt's is 12s4p molicel. At full throttle i get voltage drops wich is weird because molicel p42a 🤔 and the welds are ok 🤷‍♂️ 10awg wire, wich still needs to be shortend, also my phase wire is still too long, gotta order a rear suspention to fit it in the back later on
[2021-10-02T13:18:23] Mirono escooters: How much Screzn record bluetooth app
[2021-10-02T13:18:52] Unknown: It's charging, i was planning to do so when charged and go for like a 10km ride orso
[2021-10-02T13:20:13] Unknown: It's almoast full tho 😂
[2021-10-02T13:20:16] Unknown: <photos/photo_1164@02-10-2021_13-20-16.jpg>
[2021-10-02T13:21:16] Unknown: Should i just record the vesc dash on speed parameters etc? Just wondering 🤔
[2021-10-02T13:23:19] Artem Bulashev: Oh that a bit more than I would expect, whatsettings type of driving / speed? In my calculation 25ah 13s would do 71km going easy 25-35kmh
[2021-10-02T13:24:27] Unknown: I do like around 45 flat but i live in a place with lots of hills and drops
[2021-10-02T13:24:51] Unknown: Oops
[2021-10-02T13:24:54] Unknown: Nvm 😂
[2021-10-02T13:25:55] Artem Bulashev: Than yeah 15km 40% is even better than expected
[2021-10-02T13:36:57] Unknown: Dang sad haha

[2021-10-02T15:57:33] Happy Giraffe: Mine did 90A phase on a rainy day fine, on sunny day it might be less
[2021-10-02T15:58:33] Happy Giraffe: And I don't have vsett, its a blade motor
[2021-10-02T16:02:05] Unknown: Oh, well anyone good suggestions? When i ran away after kicking off that mirror it was on 75a phase, i drove like 7km and then fully pushed it for like 4 more km, was hot af when i got home
[2021-10-02T16:02:22] Mirono escooters: How hot
[2021-10-02T16:02:23] Mirono escooters: Poor moror
[2021-10-02T16:02:48] Unknown: Idk i dont have a temp sensor in it yet
[2021-10-02T16:02:58] Unknown: I could still hold it for like 2 mins
[2021-10-02T16:03:03] Happy Giraffe: Maybe overheated, I didnt pust it to max ever
[2021-10-02T16:03:06] Unknown: But it was fckn hot
[2021-10-02T16:03:14] Happy Giraffe: Then it should be fine
[2021-10-02T16:03:22] Unknown: Oh aight
[2021-10-02T16:03:40] Mirono escooters: If u cant touch for 3 sec its too hot
[2021-10-02T16:03:43] Happy Giraffe: Motor cover is not the same as temperature inside but if you can hold our hand on 30sec it should be ok
[2021-10-02T16:04:09] Happy Giraffe: Or you have insane heat pain tolerance 😂
[2021-10-02T16:54:57] Unknown: Well that's the thing 😂 i used to be a baker, my heat pain tolerance is very high 😂😂
[2021-10-02T16:59:15] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-02T17:15:50] Unknown: So just drove about 20km full throttle, had 24% batt left
[2021-10-02T17:40:15] Happy Giraffe: Wheelway motor isnt made for full throttle😂
[2021-10-02T17:40:47] Mirono escooters: I wonder how (in)efficient it is?
[2021-10-02T17:41:06] Happy Giraffe: 2000 wattgallon / 1km
[2021-10-02T17:42:12] Happy Giraffe: For real wheelway (almost) overheated on me 105A phase and just 4km more aggressive riding
[2021-10-02T17:42:47] Happy Giraffe: No hills and I stopped at lights also so it had time to cool
[2021-10-02T17:45:19] Mirono escooters: Im happy with 1200w if i hear these stories
[2021-10-02T18:58:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: burnt dualtron mini motor

[2021-10-02T18:59:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it is 😅😅
[2021-10-02T18:59:07] Face de Pin Sucé: take more pics
[2021-10-02T18:59:18] Face de Pin Sucé: but looks like you replace phases and it can work 😆
[2021-10-02T18:59:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 20 kmh max, weird noise, controller changed
[2021-10-02T19:04:00] Luis Magalhaes: Using what controller?
[2021-10-02T19:23:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: dt mini shunted at 35a battery
[2021-10-02T19:24:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and the brake was stuck

[2021-10-02T19:28:02] Mirono escooters: U cant test for short circuit as i mean. A motor is
[2021-10-02T19:43:06] sombre_enfant: Prob here is the plastic between stator and winding
[2021-10-02T19:43:51] sombre_enfant: What magnet size is dt mini motor
[2021-10-02T19:46:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: new motor mounted. works fine.
[2021-10-02T19:47:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no idea
[2021-10-02T19:52:57] Luis Magalhaes: Oh ok 😂
[2021-10-02T19:55:03] Luis Magalhaes: Whats the width of that stator?
[2021-10-02T19:55:48] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2021-10-02T20:50:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i didn't mesure..sorry.

[2021-10-02T21:23:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: may be ... but too tired. don't care 😅
[2021-10-02T21:24:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: changed the controller. had to re-wire the motor (trashed cables), resinstall evenrything. pfffff
[2021-10-02T21:24:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Completely understand
[2021-10-02T21:26:04] Mirono escooters: If i were smorter id rewind motots

[2021-10-03T12:15:19] Mirono escooters: What has impair to do w it
[2021-10-03T12:15:29] Mirono escooters: I have a lot of 15s stuff so it would only be logifal
[2021-10-03T12:15:38] Mirono escooters: Instead of getting another charger and bms
[2021-10-03T12:17:46] sombre_enfant: 10,13,16,20 all other are joke

[2021-10-03T12:19:32] Mirono escooters: Opinion based on nothing lol
[2021-10-03T12:19:41] sombre_enfant: Exact
[2021-10-03T18:19:31] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 15s is very common Lon series install top to tail because you can fit 3 layers of 5 series 👌 Also 17s very common because 6, 6 layers and 5 layers on top with BMS in place of last series.
[2021-10-03T18:20:20] Artem Bulashev: 12s also because many skates use 6s + 6s set up
[2021-10-03T18:23:07] Artem Bulashev: I don’t see how one s count can favourite, it depends on nothing but making the best of what you can My drone s are 1s 3s 4s 6s, rc cars 8s Many scooters 10,11,12s what ever fits the space the best

[2021-10-04T13:13:18] Happy Giraffe: I see you are an EVGA fan🤪
[2021-10-04T13:14:39] Happy Giraffe: My cpu temps on Cinebench R23 dropped from 85°c to 69°c after 20 mins vs stock AMD cooler haha (and this while maintaining higher overclock)
[2021-10-04T13:14:58] Happy Giraffe: Much more quieter aswell
[2021-10-04T13:15:42] Happy Giraffe: Almost week now and no news from Spintend even when they received my old vesc🌚
[2021-10-04T13:27:21] Face de Pin Sucé: EVGA 🥰🥰 had a lot of graphic cards from them 680(Tri SLI), 770, 780, 780Ti (SLI), 980 (had a quad SLI), 980Ti (SLI), 1080 (current one), 1080Ti

[2021-10-04T20:39:30] Happy Giraffe: My piss is starting to boil up slowly
[2021-10-04T20:39:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: still not arrived after 25 days
[2021-10-04T20:46:28] Happy Giraffe: How long did it take from them to ship it towards you? Im thinking if me sending an email would accelerate the process
[2021-10-04T21:50:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 2/3 days
[2021-10-04T21:50:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but they are out of stock on the website now
[2021-10-04T21:55:57] Happy Giraffe: Do you think they are out of stock or if they are fixing some of the designs (that killed our units perhaps?)
[2021-10-04T23:33:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no idea 😅

[2021-10-07T18:19:29] Happy Giraffe: Sent them an email, I hope they dont fuk me now and try to refuse warranty
[2021-10-07T21:33:10] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1175@07-10-2021_21-33-10.jpg>

[2021-10-07T21:33:39] Happy Giraffe: Flipsky has ADC input support, would that mean 3.3v , 5v or both?👀
[2021-10-07T21:34:07] Mirono escooters: Ask em; they helpful
[2021-10-07T21:35:05] Happy Giraffe: I think I might buy this if spintend wont work or takes too much time🌚
[2021-10-07T21:35:20] Mirono escooters: I want to if I have money
[2021-10-07T21:35:33] Mirono escooters: But I got no project nor mone to make it lol
[2021-10-07T21:37:04] Happy Giraffe: This could be my ebike vesc if everything goes as planned, I think this box is better for that stuff as I can bolt and lock it into a metal box in the frame
[2021-10-07T21:37:28] Mirono escooters: Prob mine too when I build it
[2021-10-07T21:37:38] Mirono escooters: Again when I have money
[2021-10-07T21:37:54] Happy Giraffe: More weatherproof design than spintend, I will still silicone it around haha
[2021-10-07T21:38:36] Mirono escooters: Defo
[2021-10-08T02:31:38] Artem Bulashev: All vesc have adc 1 / 2 (and 3 some times but not working) Adv is always 3.3v on vesc
[2021-10-08T02:33:42] Happy Giraffe: Would be cool to use the spintend ADC board on Flipsky aswell
[2021-10-08T02:34:09] Artem Bulashev: Sure you can, it is simple logic converter 👌
[2021-10-08T02:34:18] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-08T02:35:43] Happy Giraffe: Next step for me is to wait for the light to arrive and plan the cabling, I got so much stuff inside and outside handlebar already. Maybe I could do some awg16 wiring inside. If not, then heatshrink and run it outside😅
[2021-10-08T02:36:22] Happy Giraffe: With a fuse ofcourse as some turd could cut or short the wires etc
[2021-10-08T09:49:43] Happy Giraffe: From them: yes, we received your controller. right now , have no time to check on it, but we will speed up in this two days , will update you more detail . thanks!
[2021-10-08T09:50:16] Happy Giraffe: 10 days and they haven't even looked at it, will be chrisrmas until I have it back😅
[2021-10-08T10:45:56] Unknown: I use spinted adc on trampa vesc 👍
[2021-10-08T10:52:49] Happy Giraffe: That's cool👍
[2021-10-08T10:53:14] Happy Giraffe: Has your Trampa been working good?
[2021-10-08T11:55:26] Unknown: 0 issue's, but adc broke though 😂 gotta order a new one, using ppm at the moment
[2021-10-08T11:56:15] Unknown: Ppm almoast got me crash this morning, battery's died of the throttle and my scoot went full brake 🤦‍♂️😂 i was NOT prepared for that to happen
[2021-10-08T12:00:36] Happy Giraffe: Keep the adc in its antistatic bag inside scooter
[2021-10-08T12:00:53] sombre_enfant: Why ?
[2021-10-08T12:00:57] Happy Giraffe: Its very fragile stuff
[2021-10-08T12:01:22] Happy Giraffe: Has also all pins exposed etc
[2021-10-08T12:02:15] Unknown: It was wrapped in crimping cable and fully packed with electrical tape though 😂 but yes i should get antistatic bag for it
[2021-10-08T12:02:34] Happy Giraffe: It comes in one already
[2021-10-08T12:02:44] Unknown: <photos/photo_1177@08-10-2021_12-02-44.jpg>
[2021-10-08T12:02:44] Unknown: <photos/photo_1178@08-10-2021_12-02-44.jpg>
[2021-10-08T12:02:54] Unknown: I'll use the bag next time 😂
[2021-10-08T12:03:00] Happy Giraffe: This should have done the job aswell tho
[2021-10-08T12:03:52] Happy Giraffe: I fucked one also
[2021-10-08T12:04:52] Unknown: Oh well, it's not that expensive, gonna order 2 instead of 1 haha spare just in case
[2021-10-08T12:05:17] Happy Giraffe: Yes, thats what I did and was lucky
[2021-10-08T12:13:40] sombre_enfant: Flipsky one dont seems to need adc
[2021-10-08T12:20:30] Happy Giraffe: What do you mean?
[2021-10-08T12:20:36] Happy Giraffe: It only accepts 3.3v input
[2021-10-08T15:45:28] Mirono escooters: Hy The xiaomi brake lever Is it linear? Or does it increase in parts Let's say. 0v 0.5 1 And so on Or is it rlly linear
[2021-10-08T15:46:14] Mirono escooters: As my aftermarket does brake in parts with it, but like 0% 50% 100% Not much play in between So wonder if a throttle brake would fix it (I know those are perfectly linear)
[2021-10-08T15:48:00] Happy Giraffe: Linear
[2021-10-08T15:49:38] Mirono escooters: Damnit
[2021-10-08T15:50:01] Happy Giraffe: Should be like throttle
[2021-10-08T15:50:12] Happy Giraffe: If you use it with vesc
[2021-10-08T15:50:15] Mirono escooters: The Chinese programmed this like shit
[2021-10-08T15:50:34] Mirono escooters: And cant get mechanical on without a custom xtech adaptor
[2021-10-08T17:01:44] Mirono escooters: Antispark isn't anti sparking anymore
[2021-10-08T17:01:46] Mirono escooters: Constantly on
[2021-10-08T17:01:57] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-08T17:01:59] Mirono escooters: Will anything ever work on my scoots
[2021-10-08T17:02:20] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1179@08-10-2021_17-02-20.jpg>
[2021-10-08T17:02:25] Mirono escooters: Poor liitokala cells
[2021-10-08T17:02:32] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-08T17:03:18] Happy Giraffe: Lets see who gets scooter up and running quicker, Spintend will take atleast 3 weeks. You will build 10 new batteries in that time😂
[2021-10-08T17:03:25] sombre_enfant: Wich cell from them ?
[2021-10-08T17:15:19] Mirono escooters: 26650 lo
[2021-10-08T17:15:30] Mirono escooters: G30 technically rides 🙂
[2021-10-08T17:15:38] Mirono escooters: Ignore flat tire and a failing cell row
[2021-10-08T17:28:14] sombre_enfant: Do 60x 18650 can fit in wildman 2L?
[2021-10-08T17:31:23] Mirono escooters: Nah 2L so smal
[2021-10-08T17:34:40] Happy Giraffe: 13s4p max I think if it's really tight
[2021-10-08T17:38:17] Mirono escooters: I never succeeded in that lol
[2021-10-08T17:38:21] Mirono escooters: 3L for me
[2021-10-08T17:38:28] Mirono escooters: Max 60 cells in 3L I think, no?
[2021-10-08T17:43:40] sombre_enfant: 3l u can go 80cell
[2021-10-08T17:44:01] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-10-08T17:44:03] Mirono escooters: How
[2021-10-08T17:44:35] Mirono escooters: Looking at physical space that sounds too good to be true Considering internal space and "tiny" bag
[2021-10-08T17:59:22] Happy Giraffe: Albert does 13s4p
[2021-10-08T17:59:39] Happy Giraffe: 18650
[2021-10-08T18:01:34] Mirono escooters: In 3l
[2021-10-08T18:04:19] Happy Giraffe: 2
[2021-10-08T18:04:29] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2021-10-08T18:04:50] Happy Giraffe: https://scootermode.eu/pl/p/Dodatkowa-bateria-13800mAh-13s4p-48V-do-montazu-w-torbie-/147
[2021-10-08T18:04:55] Happy Giraffe: Normal stuff
[2021-10-08T18:05:13] Mirono escooters: Cool
[2021-10-08T18:06:27] Mirono escooters: 330€. Decent
[2021-10-08T19:38:00] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, 35E once welded
[2021-10-08T20:16:39] Artem Bulashev: This is fire starter
[2021-10-08T20:16:57] Mirono escooters: Why?
[2021-10-08T20:19:00] Artem Bulashev: One hit on non protected balance wires and they short
[2021-10-08T20:19:05] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1180@08-10-2021_20-19-05.jpg>
[2021-10-08T20:19:50] Artem Bulashev: I would not trust such build quality
[2021-10-08T20:21:07] Artem Bulashev: Also seems like xt30?
[2021-10-08T20:21:25] Artem Bulashev: And super thine battery wires
[2021-10-08T20:22:25] Mirono escooters: Fair
[2021-10-08T20:22:32] Mirono escooters: I always add some layers
[2021-10-08T20:22:43] Mirono escooters: 2 times fish paper 2 normal tape 1 kapton 1 wrap
[2021-10-08T20:22:50] Artem Bulashev: I can be wrong, no way to know without them showing process of building
[2021-10-08T20:22:54] Mirono escooters: True
[2021-10-08T20:23:08] Mirono escooters: If customers want, I can always send build pictures My way of proving kwolity
[2021-10-08T20:23:29] Artem Bulashev: All I know is that every time scooter catches flames it is alway « recently bought custom pack »
[2021-10-08T20:23:40] Artem Bulashev: Hope so
[2021-10-08T20:24:00] Mirono escooters: Yep I've seen some posts recently
[2021-10-08T20:24:07] Mirono escooters: Always u can see no isolation
[2021-10-08T20:28:14] Happy Giraffe: I can ask him how its done, he will surely reply👍
[2021-10-08T20:38:35] sombre_enfant: Stop the cap
[2021-10-08T20:38:53] Mirono escooters: Don't believe me then
[2021-10-08T20:39:05] Mirono escooters: As said customers can ask for pictures when I build 😂
[2021-10-08T20:39:23] sombre_enfant: This u ?
[2021-10-08T20:39:40] Mirono escooters: Made by collegue jolan yes, improved design now
[2021-10-08T20:39:54] Mirono escooters: :)
[2021-10-08T20:42:38] sombre_enfant: U still forgor that diode and use the trash bms...
[2021-10-08T20:42:53] Mirono escooters: It's not finished yet And yes, I've ordered 100a bms
[2021-10-08T20:43:07] Mirono escooters: We gonna bitch around on a 100€ battery inclusive bag and shit? Rlly?
[2021-10-08T20:43:10] Artem Bulashev: Why are you picking on him?
[2021-10-08T20:43:17] Mirono escooters: I have no idea..
[2021-10-08T20:43:33] Mirono escooters: Diode was removed and the bms handles 25a with that heatsink easily..
[2021-10-08T20:43:45] Mirono escooters: But for 3€ more I got the 100a bms yes. Its on its way
[2021-10-08T20:43:52] sombre_enfant: Im not picking or anything 🤨just need to humble him...
[2021-10-08T20:44:06] Mirono escooters: I'm improving 😂
[2021-10-08T20:44:17] Happy Giraffe: Soldering looks better, +10EXP gained
[2021-10-08T20:44:24] Artem Bulashev: Surely sounded like he touched your balls 😄
[2021-10-08T20:44:26] Mirono escooters: Customers can ask for build pictures and I try my best.. :)
[2021-10-08T20:44:31] Mirono escooters: Jaj
[2021-10-08T20:44:41] Mirono escooters: I builded a battery for the lord francois
[2021-10-08T20:44:49] Mirono escooters: He trusts my work, hope he happy
[2021-10-08T20:45:08] Unknown: Not again..

[2021-10-08T20:45:22] Mirono escooters: It's going better so
[2021-10-08T20:45:27] sombre_enfant: 🙏🏾🙏🏾
[2021-10-08T20:45:28] Mirono escooters: What wrong now..
[2021-10-08T20:45:39] Mirono escooters: Is this a shit on Mr bomb group?
[2021-10-08T20:45:39] Unknown: Please put something between BMS and cells
[2021-10-08T20:45:43] Mirono escooters: I did
[2021-10-08T20:45:46] Mirono escooters: Kapton
[2021-10-08T20:45:57] Mirono escooters: On the tracks that were visible
[2021-10-08T20:46:11] Unknown: Not enough use something solid and heatproof
[2021-10-08T20:46:18] Mirono escooters: Kapton is heatproof
[2021-10-08T20:46:26] Mirono escooters: Don't think it will exceed 300+ degrees 😄
[2021-10-08T20:46:32] sombre_enfant: Not solid need fish here
[2021-10-08T20:46:42] Artem Bulashev: This is flat bottom (SMD single sided BMS)
[2021-10-08T20:46:45] Unknown: Bullshit
[2021-10-08T20:46:55] Unknown: Anyway
[2021-10-08T20:47:03] Mirono escooters: Yea it shouldn't even short And with kapton it's safe
[2021-10-08T20:47:05] sombre_enfant: Then what
[2021-10-08T20:47:14] Happy Giraffe: *slowly backs off from conversation*
[2021-10-08T20:47:24] Mirono escooters: You guys aren't my customers, I shouldn't try to explain myself to yall 😅 They trust my work, so all is good 😄
[2021-10-08T20:47:25] Unknown: Use fireproof filament
[2021-10-08T20:47:31] Unknown: Or kraftplex
[2021-10-08T20:47:53] Mirono escooters: I used silicon before but it requires waiting and eh. This works fine
[2021-10-08T20:48:01] sombre_enfant: Whatever u need to do the best if u sell
[2021-10-08T20:48:03] Artem Bulashev: There is nothing that will happen if BMS rubbed through cells gnd (they are all single p assembly)
[2021-10-08T20:48:14] Artem Bulashev: No fire starters there
[2021-10-08T20:48:15] Mirono escooters: I do.
[2021-10-08T20:48:20] Mirono escooters: Thanks artem
[2021-10-08T20:48:32] sombre_enfant: I do ton of shit too but only for myself
[2021-10-08T20:48:32] Mirono escooters: Finally someone not shitting for nothing
[2021-10-08T20:48:43] Mirono escooters: Everyone can find "faults " if u search hard enough
[2021-10-08T20:48:59] Mirono escooters: If I build for myself I don't even do it so nicely lol
[2021-10-08T20:48:59] Unknown: +1 cell shells are gnd, as long as they dont short series it should'nt matter at all
[2021-10-08T20:49:08] Mirono escooters: Thanks kenny
[2021-10-08T20:49:09] Artem Bulashev: Any added isolation is fine there, fireproof filament 😁?
[2021-10-08T20:49:21] Mirono escooters: For 20€ money made per battery 3s bag; let's not shit around
[2021-10-08T20:49:35] Mirono escooters: Kapton added; Doublle layer
[2021-10-08T20:49:43] Artem Bulashev: People get shot they pay for with honest builders
[2021-10-08T20:49:59] Mirono escooters: I dont understand that sentence
[2021-10-08T20:50:08] Artem Bulashev: Perfectly enough for this build and this location
[2021-10-08T20:50:44] Mirono escooters: 💚

[2021-10-08T20:54:01] Mirono escooters: Also a option
[2021-10-08T20:54:07] Happy Giraffe: Fancy
[2021-10-08T20:54:19] Unknown: Use Thermospray paint
[2021-10-08T20:54:45] Unknown: Takes hella time to make sich a pack though :o
[2021-10-08T20:54:50] Unknown: But what a beauty
[2021-10-08T20:54:53] Mirono escooters: Ye xd that must take time
[2021-10-08T20:55:16] Unknown: <photos/photo_1189@08-10-2021_20-55-16.jpg>
[2021-10-08T20:55:17] Mirono escooters: For more expensive builds I print for example guards that hold the m365 rails, but for these small batteries I mean..
[2021-10-08T20:55:48] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2021-10-08T20:56:01] Artem Bulashev: But not when you have 20€ profit per pack :))
[2021-10-08T20:56:05] Unknown: Cages are the best for impact recycling etccc
[2021-10-08T20:56:09] sombre_enfant: Too fancy
[2021-10-08T20:56:31] sombre_enfant: I prefer mirono tbh
[2021-10-08T20:56:36] Mirono escooters: I only build with holders; when ppl ask me build small without I refuse Honeycomb is next to nothing
[2021-10-08T20:56:41] Unknown: I just got hexagonal strips 13 cells long
[2021-10-08T20:56:41] Mirono escooters: 😂
[2021-10-08T20:56:41] Unknown: If you only make 20 you should stop doing it
[2021-10-08T20:57:01] Mirono escooters: I like doing it; its a small earning to sponsor my expensive scoots
[2021-10-08T20:57:05] Unknown: Honeycomb*
[2021-10-08T20:57:06] Unknown: ???
[2021-10-08T20:57:12] sombre_enfant: U dissing on 4 kebab ???
[2021-10-08T20:57:21] Mirono escooters: I dont build without holders
[2021-10-08T20:57:29] Mirono escooters: Need structural integrity
[2021-10-08T20:57:48] Unknown: And breathing space for the batts
[2021-10-08T20:57:52] Unknown: Whattt
[2021-10-08T20:58:04] Mirono escooters: Also!

[2021-10-08T20:58:32] Unknown: That's why i build layered cages
[2021-10-08T20:58:44] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2021-10-08T20:59:01] Happy Giraffe: I have what Albert built me and never an issue
[2021-10-08T20:59:07] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-08T20:59:08] Unknown: I just used strips and adjusted them to be perf for my batt
[2021-10-08T20:59:35] Unknown: I needed smoll space etc i wanted 21700 cells to fit my xiaomi
[2021-10-08T21:00:14] Mirono escooters: It fits
[2021-10-08T21:00:23] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi frame so smol

[2021-10-08T21:40:26] Happy Giraffe: What kind of fuse is best for lights cable cable coming straight from battery?
[2021-10-08T21:40:52] Happy Giraffe: Im thinking 10A fuse to not break on its own but burn fast if something shorts etc
[2021-10-08T21:41:00] Mirono escooters: Thin cables😂

[2021-10-08T21:41:16] Mirono escooters: Lights draw what. 1a? I'd use a z fuse on pcb or a small fast blow glass fuse
[2021-10-08T21:41:44] Mirono escooters: I have glass fuses for powerwall 3a Can get in all A Really nice things If u run it close to blow power it acts as a light aswell!
[2021-10-08T21:41:52] Happy Giraffe: That light should 20-25w 48v, so maybe 0.6A lol
[2021-10-08T21:42:17] Mirono escooters: 1a glass fuse I say
[2021-10-08T21:42:30] Happy Giraffe: But adding that into awg16 wire?

[2021-10-08T21:47:55] Mirono escooters: I fly away
[2021-10-08T21:48:00] Artem Bulashev: Battery voltage ?

[2021-10-08T21:48:55] Mirono escooters: And vesc
[2021-10-08T21:48:56] Artem Bulashev: 1200w nominal should not be able to handle that
[2021-10-08T21:49:03] Mirono escooters: After 15km ride it was barely hot
[2021-10-08T21:49:08] Mirono escooters: Like 45* educated guess
[2021-10-08T21:49:09] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-10-08T21:49:27] sombre_enfant: @Happy_Giraffe any new about blade motor on vesc ?
[2021-10-08T21:49:33] Mirono escooters: I am light tho And it's only for some peak seconds; I'm super quick at top speed (42klh on full % lmao)
[2021-10-08T21:49:38] Artem Bulashev: Wonder what kind of winding it has
[2021-10-08T21:49:51] Mirono escooters: Not planning on opening soon
[2021-10-08T21:49:52] Mirono escooters: Xd

[2021-10-08T21:50:15] Artem Bulashev: Can you share log from your 0 to max acceleration please
[2021-10-08T21:50:24] Artem Bulashev: Really want to see it
[2021-10-08T21:50:38] Happy Giraffe: Vesc I will have to wait, Spintend doesnt give a fuck about hurrying up🙈
[2021-10-08T21:50:43] sombre_enfant: I beg you sir, would u kindly share dimension of axle and some other spec
[2021-10-08T21:50:53] Happy Giraffe: Absolutely
[2021-10-08T21:51:03] Mirono escooters: Sure :) where do I find it Will need to wait 2 weeks as I need to give it maintenance 1 cell row weird and flatty tire
[2021-10-08T21:51:20] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-10-08T21:52:03] Happy Giraffe: 3Amp this style it is😎 Does the voltage matter much? Mine will be 48v
[2021-10-08T21:52:22] Artem Bulashev: No it doesn’t
[2021-10-08T21:52:26] Mirono escooters: Nicr

[2021-10-08T23:13:52] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-08T23:14:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a lot 😁😁
[2021-10-09T00:28:54] Artem Bulashev: My 5amp 67.2v charger uses 0.5mm2 * 2 wires inside dc output - again, 5amps - 0.5mm2 = 20AWG 🙂 So running 16awg for 1amp is insane :) try more like 22-24awg - that’s usual signal wire. But it should handle bellow 1 amp without any heating up at all
[2021-10-09T00:31:26] Artem Bulashev: Voltage drop % of your battery voltage / wire resistance in circuite both ways = max amps of the conductor Divide by 2 for long term or divide by 3 for nominal That’s the estimation one can quickly use 👌
[2021-10-09T00:39:23] Happy Giraffe: 0.75mm
[2021-10-09T00:39:29] Happy Giraffe: Should do the job
[2021-10-09T00:40:54] Happy Giraffe: Not the best insulation material but its so thin I might be able to get it inside the stem. Then also the 3A fuse for protection as light would go directly to batt🤯
[2021-10-09T00:46:25] Happy Giraffe: One of these to battery, one to lights and one to rita charge output👀
[2021-10-09T00:49:36] Artem Bulashev: Conductor dia 0.75 is about 20-21 awg = should hold 3amps no problemo
[2021-10-09T00:50:09] Happy Giraffe: And if the lamp is 20w with 48v ~ 0.5A
[2021-10-09T00:50:18] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁
[2021-10-09T00:50:24] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-09T00:50:33] Artem Bulashev: That’s signal line level
[2021-10-09T00:50:45] Happy Giraffe: Whats that?😂
[2021-10-09T00:50:49] Artem Bulashev: 24awg or less
[2021-10-09T00:50:55] Happy Giraffe: Aaah
[2021-10-09T00:51:28] Artem Bulashev: Diameter bellow 0.5mm of the conductor
[2021-10-09T00:51:34] Happy Giraffe: I thought I fucked up thinking how the light functions, it supposedly has that chip inside what regulates power etc etc so all good I think
[2021-10-09T00:51:52] Happy Giraffe: I still have the truck power cable😂
[2021-10-09T00:52:02] Happy Giraffe: 13 core
[2021-10-09T00:54:10] Artem Bulashev: When you want to be safe running 20w led 🤣
[2021-10-09T00:54:21] Artem Bulashev: Awg 0000
[2021-10-09T00:54:29] Happy Giraffe: Thats almost what I have
[2021-10-09T00:54:34] Happy Giraffe: But divided in 13
[2021-10-09T00:54:36] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-09T00:55:22] Artem Bulashev: It is sooo American to creat system that counts oddly … the smaller the value the thicker the conductor 🤣
[2021-10-09T00:56:01] Happy Giraffe: It makes perfect sense
[2021-10-09T00:56:21] Happy Giraffe: Atleast they dont count football fields

[2021-10-09T16:21:21] Unknown: Line*
[2021-10-09T16:26:11] sombre_enfant: Im lazy to remove all glue desolder all wire to resolder everything
[2021-10-09T16:26:48] Unknown: Why would you even do it then 😂
[2021-10-09T16:27:09] sombre_enfant: Add 3 phase wire
[2021-10-09T16:27:35] Unknown: Like thicker phase you mean?
[2021-10-09T16:30:23] sombre_enfant: Ye kinda
[2021-10-09T16:33:21] Unknown: Then you should desolder the phase wires and make it out of one wire, would'nt be too good to add a wire on top of another to make it better, you should just redo the entire wire and make it a single thicker wire then
[2021-10-09T16:37:28] sombre_enfant: No i need to do it that way beacause its for the second phase group
[2021-10-09T16:56:39] sombre_enfant: @Happy_Giraffe hey any new about the motor ?
[2021-10-09T17:03:25] Happy Giraffe: Had more important stuff to do today and the shity UPS place is closed by now
[2021-10-09T17:03:41] sombre_enfant: Damn, get well
[2021-10-09T17:04:51] Happy Giraffe: Haha, nothing bad. Just other things I cant fuck up😂
[2021-10-09T17:05:18] Happy Giraffe: Ive got no hurry for motor as Spintend isnt doing anything rn
[2021-10-09T17:05:51] sombre_enfant: I rly need the dimension 🦾
[2021-10-09T17:07:53] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow😂
[2021-10-09T17:11:25] sombre_enfant: 🦾🦾🦾
[2021-10-09T17:44:17] Artem Bulashev: https://media.suzakugiken.jp/ec/AMASS/AMASS_Catalogue_2020.pdf
[2021-10-09T17:49:28] Artem Bulashev: This is amazing document of Amass them self ! It has even equilibrium temp for each connector at 60c and 85c and against different AWG attached as it heat dissipation and lowers equilibrium temp as you increase crossection Read it carefully there is lots of info Look at continuous current - we don’t care peak / mixed current because that is for like drones where current jumps without control or limits (for us we set top current and it is archived slowly as speed increases and it stays at that max speed level) 10awg seems minimal needed for 60a
[2021-10-09T17:50:07] Mirono escooters: Oof me with 12
[2021-10-09T17:50:18] Artem Bulashev: Also interateing to see how actually those connectors really not made for currents above 70a at all as they heat up alot
[2021-10-09T17:51:08] Artem Bulashev: Study that pdf abit guys I found it really awesome info and how as120 is superior for us than as150 for example but new as150u is the best
[2021-10-09T19:29:34] Happy Giraffe: Yes👀
[2021-10-09T19:29:43] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-09T19:31:33] Happy Giraffe: I suppose they tested these at 22°c ambient
[2021-10-09T19:31:56] Artem Bulashev: Exactly
[2021-10-09T19:32:00] Artem Bulashev: And open air
[2021-10-09T19:35:15] Happy Giraffe: My peak currents last very short amount of time so Im not that worried haha. Usually cant ride more than 1 minute full throttle at a time, especially in city
[2021-10-09T19:36:49] Happy Giraffe: 4mm bullet connector in Spintend is similiar to something like xt90 for motor connectors😅
[2021-10-09T19:37:07] Happy Giraffe: Not sure why they didnt go for 6mm but I might change that later on, will see

[2021-10-09T21:54:49] Face de Pin Sucé: We can now separate, I finally can change the phase wires 🥰
[2021-10-09T21:56:16] sombre_enfant: U will use this on your monster ? Or its not enough to remplacer les kelly
[2021-10-09T21:56:30] Face de Pin Sucé: It's not enough ^^
[2021-10-09T21:56:37] Face de Pin Sucé: But I have another Weped monster
[2021-10-09T21:56:44] Face de Pin Sucé: And I'll try this one inside
[2021-10-09T21:56:52] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1204@09-10-2021_21-56-52.jpg>
[2021-10-09T21:57:06] Face de Pin Sucé: She waits it and we will see what performance we can get out of it
[2021-10-09T21:57:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Does someone here have the 300A firmware for USB C version ?
[2021-10-09T22:07:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ohhhhh ! awesome ! and change only the logic board if fried 😊
[2021-10-09T22:07:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-10-09T22:07:20] Face de Pin Sucé: They also made some changes in the case
[2021-10-09T22:09:17] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1205@09-10-2021_22-09-17.jpg>
[2021-10-09T22:09:21] Face de Pin Sucé: New ones
[2021-10-09T22:10:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: quand tu visses, tu ecrases plus la board ?
[2021-10-09T22:10:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope
[2021-10-09T22:22:46] Happy Giraffe: Did they change components?
[2021-10-09T22:23:01] Happy Giraffe: From photo looks identical
[2021-10-09T22:31:38] Face de Pin Sucé: No they didn't
[2021-10-09T22:33:21] Luis Magalhaes: Spintend have it but if they send we loose warranty 😅
[2021-10-09T22:33:53] Face de Pin Sucé: I know they have but I'd like to have it tonight xD
[2021-10-09T22:34:00] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-10-09T22:34:03] Face de Pin Sucé: I have version for Micro USB not for USB C
[2021-10-09T22:34:51] Luis Magalhaes: They where talking about firmware in the other day in the Russian group but dont know where they come from 😅
[2021-10-09T22:36:30] Luis Magalhaes: They say the max fase amps you can go is 150A so not a lot more amps
[2021-10-09T22:37:09] sombre_enfant: But lot more risk, so its great
[2021-10-09T22:40:12] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂

[2021-10-09T22:41:48] Luis Magalhaes: what was in the russian group
[2021-10-09T22:42:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: did they change something ?
[2021-10-09T22:43:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Thank youuu
[2021-10-09T22:43:02] Luis Magalhaes: i think one of was talking about the pad to cool it more
[2021-10-09T22:43:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I meant in the firmwares ;)
[2021-10-09T22:44:42] Luis Magalhaes: oh dont know, just know it does not have the limits the 100A has
[2021-10-09T22:49:02] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1206@09-10-2021_22-49-02.jpg>
[2021-10-09T22:49:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha made a thread with screw
[2021-10-09T22:49:21] Face de Pin Sucé: 12.9 steel vs Aluminum
[2021-10-09T22:50:46] Artem Bulashev: Are you cooling Ubox with a fan?
[2021-10-09T22:51:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes I am
[2021-10-09T22:51:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Ubox is shit on cooling
[2021-10-09T22:52:02] Happy Giraffe: Warranty has become really useful in single ubox lately....
[2021-10-09T22:52:14] Artem Bulashev: 99% didn’t even need cooling haha
[2021-10-09T22:52:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Because they don't pull much out of it for real
[2021-10-09T22:52:47] Artem Bulashev: I don’t think it over heats at all unless you have it set above 120/90a phase 60/40a battery Saw many people riding throes setting without any heating problem. Just some past between metal deck and UBOX. (Not even every one puts paste 😅)
[2021-10-09T22:52:50] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2021-10-09T22:53:05] Happy Giraffe: I dont even have space for 90mm fan inside the deck
[2021-10-09T22:53:32] Happy Giraffe: If you bolt it to frame with paste it should do quite well I think
[2021-10-09T22:54:00] Happy Giraffe: But for continuous 130A a fan might be good
[2021-10-09T22:54:04] Face de Pin Sucé: I use it at 130A phase/35A batt on my dualtron Spider High KV, it does overheat with big ride using electric brake
[2021-10-09T22:54:26] Face de Pin Sucé: And I weight 76Kg (always with 15/20Kg bag)
[2021-10-09T22:54:28] Artem Bulashev: Same on both motors ?
[2021-10-09T22:54:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-10-09T22:54:40] Artem Bulashev: No wonder than
[2021-10-09T22:54:52] Artem Bulashev: Considering it is 200a total max :)
[2021-10-09T22:54:57] Artem Bulashev: Rated
[2021-10-09T22:55:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Also, I'm running 16S
[2021-10-09T22:55:33] Happy Giraffe: What fan do you use there?
[2021-10-09T22:55:34] Artem Bulashev: It’s amazing how much more it can do than Ubox advertises it to be
[2021-10-09T22:55:50] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-10-09T22:56:02] Happy Giraffe: Yet here I used single 50% load and blew up🌚
[2021-10-09T22:56:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Shitty small fans
[2021-10-09T22:56:10] Artem Bulashev: That’s a lot of power 😅😅
[2021-10-09T22:56:13] Happy Giraffe: 👀
[2021-10-09T22:57:21] Artem Bulashev: 16s8p Samsung 35e new 28ah total
[2021-10-09T22:57:24] Artem Bulashev: I’m only prepping my battery and spacer these days

[2021-10-09T22:58:07] Happy Giraffe: This is a Boeing 747 turbine inside your scooter
[2021-10-09T22:59:18] Happy Giraffe: https://www.amazon.de/NF-A9-PWM/dp/B00RUZ059O/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=noctua+industrial+90&qid=1633813137&sr=8-5
[2021-10-09T22:59:24] Happy Giraffe: 90mm option
[2021-10-09T23:00:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't worry, I have those ones
[2021-10-09T23:00:41] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1208@09-10-2021_23-00-41.jpg>
[2021-10-09T23:00:46] Face de Pin Sucé: 16500rpm
[2021-10-09T23:00:47] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-09T23:00:50] Face de Pin Sucé: 12W
[2021-10-09T23:00:52] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2021-10-09T23:01:04] Face de Pin Sucé: I'll put those to create airflow inside scooter
[2021-10-09T23:01:09] Face de Pin Sucé: I have two of those
[2021-10-09T23:01:24] Happy Giraffe: 40mm doesnt even have place for the air to move, maybe 1mm3
[2021-10-09T23:02:21] Face de Pin Sucé: 45.5m2/h
[2021-10-09T23:02:32] Happy Giraffe: But then afterall there's no open heatsink so blowing air to surface is not that effective
[2021-10-09T23:03:14] Happy Giraffe: That must sound like jet turbine?
[2021-10-09T23:04:42] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1209@09-10-2021_23-04-42.jpg>
[2021-10-09T23:04:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Those are beasts

[2021-10-09T23:09:12] Happy Giraffe: 100db😂
[2021-10-09T23:11:26] Happy Giraffe: 57 in reality lmao
[2021-10-09T23:11:36] Happy Giraffe: Being a logharitmic scale😂
[2021-10-09T23:14:16] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-10-09T23:14:37] Luis Magalhaes: i would need 🤣
[2021-10-09T23:14:46] Luis Magalhaes: but its manegeble
[2021-10-09T23:15:42] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb will want more then that lolol
[2021-10-09T23:15:59] Luis Magalhaes: with ubox now i have 😂
[2021-10-09T23:17:06] Luis Magalhaes: im using 75A battery and 130A motors 16s too
[2021-10-09T23:18:14] Luis Magalhaes: should try that too but was thinking of puting the ubox outside the deck too
[2021-10-09T23:18:19] Luis Magalhaes: like in the wolf Gt
[2021-10-09T23:19:12] Face de Pin Sucé: You don't overheat ?
[2021-10-09T23:21:15] Happy Giraffe: Dont put it outside, its not a waterproof design, would need to be put in 100% water pressure tight box
[2021-10-09T23:21:18] Luis Magalhaes: i get 85ºc easy lolol
[2021-10-09T23:21:46] Luis Magalhaes: im using the front deck open to air flow LOL
[2021-10-09T23:24:33] Happy Giraffe: 👀
[2021-10-09T23:25:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes but it needs to be cooled when you stop
[2021-10-09T23:25:10] Happy Giraffe: If you put it in a metal box outside that is sealed and it bolted tightly to it with thermal paste I think thats as good as it can get
[2021-10-09T23:25:58] Happy Giraffe: Heat goes from fets>ubox case>whatever its bolted into
[2021-10-09T23:26:21] Happy Giraffe: If the material it is bolted into doesnt heat up anymore you have used all your possible cooling power
[2021-10-09T23:27:10] Happy Giraffe: Then idk how to improve it anymore, would need to redesign whole thing
[2021-10-09T23:27:16] Luis Magalhaes: when im not pushing it cools down fast even stoped
[2021-10-09T23:27:31] Face de Pin Sucé: With a fan it would help a lot
[2021-10-09T23:27:59] Luis Magalhaes: yes thats true
[2021-10-09T23:28:04] Happy Giraffe: Fan is useful to cool down the part of the ubox body thats not touching the frame
[2021-10-09T23:28:49] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't forget, those Fets cool better through PCB than top and there's nothing to cool the PCB
[2021-10-09T23:28:50] Happy Giraffe: But yeah...kinda hard to improve it more
[2021-10-09T23:29:11] Face de Pin Sucé: That's why I put fans so I can try to cool down between the two PCBs
[2021-10-09T23:29:59] Luis Magalhaes: where do you put the fan?
[2021-10-09T23:30:10] Face de Pin Sucé: On sides
[2021-10-09T23:30:31] Luis Magalhaes: inside the box closed ?
[2021-10-09T23:31:11] Face de Pin Sucé: I create a airflow for the deck
[2021-10-09T23:31:18] Happy Giraffe: Inside a water and dust protected frame, you could cut the case bit from side and install fan with some tube to force the air in and other to pull out
[2021-10-09T23:31:21] Face de Pin Sucé: And I put fans ON Spintend
[2021-10-09T23:31:40] Luis Magalhaes: ok so its not a closed deck ?
[2021-10-09T23:31:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Not anymore
[2021-10-09T23:31:57] Luis Magalhaes: you have air inlets to keep it cool inside
[2021-10-09T23:32:17] Luis Magalhaes: nice
[2021-10-09T23:33:25] Luis Magalhaes: will need to test the fans but have to test before that some good paste 🤣
[2021-10-09T23:33:53] Happy Giraffe: And you need to bolt it hard to the surface for optimal heat transfer
[2021-10-09T23:34:15] Happy Giraffe: But if fets are cooled better through pcb then you are fucked😂
[2021-10-09T23:35:17] Face de Pin Sucé: That's it
[2021-10-09T23:54:38] Artem Bulashev: J christ
[2021-10-09T23:56:47] Luis Magalhaes: i had the ubox directly to the deck and it was overheating a lot
[2021-10-09T23:56:47] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-10-09T23:57:45] Luis Magalhaes: then i used 2 blocks of aluminium that was from the minimotors to bolt on and bolt on deck and it cooled a lot beter
[2021-10-09T23:57:48] Luis Magalhaes: better
[2021-10-09T23:57:55] Artem Bulashev: Did you try replacing thermal pad of the fets with the copper spacer + best past for cpu on the market ? Considering all fets are equal higher you could get one long copper bar of exact thickness needed
[2021-10-09T23:58:38] Luis Magalhaes: no did not replace anything in the ubox
[2021-10-09T23:59:23] Luis Magalhaes: i saw them doing that but did not do it 🤣
[2021-10-09T23:59:57] Luis Magalhaes: im a lazy men 😅🙈🤣
[2021-10-10T00:00:13] Artem Bulashev: It’s not hard and results should be really good
[2021-10-10T00:03:48] Luis Magalhaes: have to see where i can get the copper bar 👌
[2021-10-10T00:04:19] Luis Magalhaes: what i was thinking is, if i had no air flow inside the deck it will over heat any way
[2021-10-10T00:13:53] Happy Giraffe: Copper bar on the other side of fet?
[2021-10-10T00:18:30] Luis Magalhaes: above the fets
[2021-10-10T00:18:37] Luis Magalhaes: under in this case
[2021-10-10T00:46:56] Artem Bulashev: Just mesure how much copper needed - 0.2 for past application on both sides and order it from AliExpress for cheap. Than get a paste - ProlimaTech PK-3 Nano Aluminum
[2021-10-10T00:52:42] Artem Bulashev: Paste between bar and fets (it is not conductive), between bar and vesc case, case directly to scooter base
[2021-10-10T00:55:25] Artem Bulashev: Remove paint from scooter frame where you attach controller with super fine sandpaper if you are really going for the best possible improvement
[2021-10-10T00:56:30] Artem Bulashev: Attach copper heat sink on the bottom of the scooter that’s better than controller on outside 😂 (wires like to be short)
[2021-10-10T01:13:48] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌 tks
[2021-10-10T01:47:59] Happy Giraffe: Are you putting copper directly to the fets?👀 Arent they gonna short each other?
[2021-10-10T01:49:40] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2021-10-10T01:49:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, I'm done for today, going to sleep
[2021-10-10T01:55:10] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1210@10-10-2021_01-55-10.jpg>
[2021-10-10T02:01:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't think speed was true, I didn't put the settingd
[2021-10-10T02:02:21] Happy Giraffe: I can see it spinning really fast, atleast 80kmh
[2021-10-10T02:02:43] Face de Pin Sucé: It's more than 100Kmh, but how much exactly, can't say
[2021-10-10T02:03:00] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, exactly. Unlimited power😂
[2021-10-10T02:03:09] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-10-10T02:03:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Already hitted a little more than 120Kmh with those motors in 60V
[2021-10-10T02:03:38] Face de Pin Sucé: We'll see how much I can hit with Spintend
[2021-10-10T02:11:31] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-10T02:16:20] Luis Magalhaes: dam that display 👌
[2021-10-10T02:31:19] Happy Giraffe: Does it have G-sync tho? Im suspecting bit of a ghosting on the panel. Will wait for HardwareUnboxed review
[2021-10-10T02:32:48] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-10-10T02:32:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Only freesync :'(
[2021-10-10T02:34:00] Happy Giraffe: Not even premium? Its a hard pass for me
[2021-10-10T02:47:31] Luis Magalhaes: 🙈💪
[2021-10-10T10:21:10] Artem Bulashev: Gets black part is not conductive. Paste also not conductive
[2021-10-10T10:23:28] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 display? :D
[2021-10-10T10:51:39] Face de Pin Sucé: 😁
[2021-10-10T11:33:16] Mirono escooters: Oooof
[2021-10-10T11:47:33] Artem Bulashev: That’s expected :)
[2021-10-10T11:48:10] Artem Bulashev: 50$ more than one side of dual 👍
[2021-10-10T12:00:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: twice the price of the new flipsky... let hope it's really better.
[2021-10-10T12:00:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for now, I'm really happy with the single core VESC. no trouble at all. it remains pretty cool (~50°C), but I can't push too much on my motor.
[2021-10-10T12:04:14] Face de Pin Sucé: You really need new motors
[2021-10-10T12:07:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I'll wait to see if in dual it have time to cool down
[2021-10-10T12:10:51] Artem Bulashev: Not really, new dual Flipsky cost more than ubox
[2021-10-10T12:11:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'm talking about the 100$ single

[2021-10-10T12:15:25] Artem Bulashev: Which new single are talking about?
[2021-10-10T12:17:19] Artem Bulashev: Abit cheaper than 200$ but not much
[2021-10-10T12:18:41] sombre_enfant: 75100
[2021-10-10T12:18:52] Artem Bulashev: All single flipsky i found are only 12s capable
[2021-10-10T12:20:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this one
[2021-10-10T12:20:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/flipsky-75100-foc-75v-100a-single-esc-base-on-vesc-for-electric-skateboard-scooter-ebike-speed-controller
[2021-10-10T12:20:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: still 99$
[2021-10-10T12:21:29] sombre_enfant: Its on ali 110€ with shipping
[2021-10-10T12:21:32] Artem Bulashev: Considering more flipsky design that follows vesc 6.6 or 6.7 those are a lot cheaper
[2021-10-10T12:21:51] Artem Bulashev: Wonder where are such cost savings come from
[2021-10-10T12:22:59] Artem Bulashev: Considering specs in this one is also higher
[2021-10-10T12:23:08] Artem Bulashev: 🤔
[2021-10-10T12:24:19] sombre_enfant: To 220 mosfet are cheaper than direct mount, the case is straight out 10€ ebike controller so no need to pay designer or sum
[2021-10-10T12:24:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr1_g-IQzTU
[2021-10-10T12:25:13] Mirono escooters: 💚
[2021-10-10T12:25:38] Mirono escooters: Looks so good. Flipsky stepping up game
[2021-10-10T12:25:42] Mirono escooters: When I saved up I'll test it
[2021-10-10T12:26:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but TO220 with "Continuous Current : 100A" in such frame, I'd really like to see that 😅
[2021-10-10T12:27:01] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't believe it
[2021-10-10T12:27:19] sombre_enfant: It wont be more than 60A continus
[2021-10-10T12:28:08] Mirono escooters: Continuous ofcourse not
[2021-10-10T12:28:11] Mirono escooters: Need extra coolin
[2021-10-10T12:28:14] sombre_enfant: This format of mosfet cant handle it or need 9/12/15/18 to get less stress
[2021-10-10T12:28:29] sombre_enfant: Even with cooling it wont 😂
[2021-10-10T12:29:59] Artem Bulashev: So end result while spintend is 20% underspeced flip sky is 40% over speced 120a vs 60a in reality
[2021-10-10T12:31:08] sombre_enfant: 100A phase and 40A bat it will handle it fosho
[2021-10-10T12:32:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: bronco controller looks fat, doesn't it ? 🤪
[2021-10-10T12:33:53] sombre_enfant: Le cimetière de contro
[2021-10-10T12:35:24] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1218@10-10-2021_12-35-24.jpg>
[2021-10-10T12:37:10] Mirono escooters: Donate me ill show
[2021-10-10T12:37:31] sombre_enfant: 🤨🤨
[2021-10-10T12:40:54] Artem Bulashev: Btw vsett display and rfid communicate via UART 😎
[2021-10-10T12:41:19] Mirono escooters: Cant we make them displays compatible w vesc 🤤🤤
[2021-10-10T12:41:33] Artem Bulashev: Looks like rfid tiny assembly has some tiny MCU
[2021-10-10T12:41:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ah ok !
[2021-10-10T12:42:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I am waiting for the vsett harnest. It will be easier to test ;) @SibClimb found one and ordered it.
[2021-10-10T12:42:51] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 already made zero display and that one and vsett are exchangeable directly on zero / vsett controllers
[2021-10-10T12:43:09] Artem Bulashev: I can send you man 😄
[2021-10-10T12:43:21] Artem Bulashev: It’s pain to get it out though as it is isolated in foam and silicon
[2021-10-10T12:45:07] Mirono escooters: I mean them red gt100 displays for example Rlly cheap and good
[2021-10-10T12:45:22] sombre_enfant: Its uart too
[2021-10-10T13:39:27] Artem Bulashev: Gt100? What I meant is that @koxx3 already got Zero displays working, and since Vsett diaplay can replace zero display plug and play and fully work this means that vsett and zero run same commends over UART, just Vsett has few extras. So technically it is already job done 90%, but he can’t test it
[2021-10-10T13:40:02] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2021-10-10T13:40:23] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1219@10-10-2021_13-40-23.jpg>
[2021-10-10T13:40:27] Mirono escooters: These u mean?
[2021-10-10T14:06:18] Artem Bulashev: Yes qs-s4
[2021-10-10T14:06:46] Artem Bulashev: Same plug even
[2021-10-10T14:07:13] Artem Bulashev: Older once use 5pin plug, newer once also use 6 pin plugs
[2021-10-10T14:09:01] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1220@10-10-2021_14-09-01.jpg>
[2021-10-10T14:19:48] Mirono escooters: Damn so it works on vesc??
[2021-10-10T14:24:25] Artem Bulashev: With @koxx3 smart board it will 👌🙃
[2021-10-10T14:24:34] Mirono escooters: ❤
[2021-10-10T14:24:38] Mirono escooters: How much will it be
[2021-10-10T14:25:15] Artem Bulashev: Will be integral part of keeping oem look so that police doesn’t suspect modifications on the checkup
[2021-10-10T14:25:26] Artem Bulashev: It’s under development still
[2021-10-10T14:25:46] Artem Bulashev: Hope to test it soon 🥰🥰 @koxx3 😁
[2021-10-10T14:31:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so many thing to do 🤪🤪

[2021-10-10T15:45:36] Happy Giraffe: I wonder hows the torque then on really high kv?
[2021-10-10T15:45:36] sombre_enfant: And if axle hole for wire is big enough to make it delta
[2021-10-10T15:46:02] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-10T15:46:33] Happy Giraffe: That could be 100kmh with 13s

[2021-10-10T15:47:33] Happy Giraffe: Delta gave what, like +40% voltage?
[2021-10-10T15:48:07] Unknown: What on earth do you guys mean by delta? Sorry i completely missed that train 😂
[2021-10-10T15:48:22] Happy Giraffe: 65kmx1.4=91kmh single motor. But then theres this wind resistance😅
[2021-10-10T15:48:36] Happy Giraffe: Star and delta motor windings

[2021-10-10T15:49:08] Happy Giraffe: Backemf could be brutal
[2021-10-10T15:49:10] sombre_enfant: Controller most likely
[2021-10-10T15:49:13] Mirono escooters: U can never push through or need a thic ass motor

[2021-10-11T18:45:37] Happy Giraffe: Saw that lol
[2021-10-11T18:45:48] Mirono escooters: Love it kinda
[2021-10-11T18:46:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-10-11T18:46:36] Happy Giraffe: I would rather have it above the wheel or on top of rear deck
[2021-10-11T18:46:47] Happy Giraffe: However deck not long enough for that
[2021-10-11T18:47:14] Mirono escooters: Ye true
[2021-10-11T18:47:49] sombre_enfant: U will need some spacer job nah ?
[2021-10-11T18:47:58] sombre_enfant: Can u check rq
[2021-10-11T18:48:06] Happy Giraffe: I can check later
[2021-10-11T18:48:12] Happy Giraffe: Not at home anymore
[2021-10-11T18:48:17] sombre_enfant: Ig max fork is bigger in withd
[2021-10-11T18:48:50] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, I have swapped forks but also additional spacers. I will measure later

[2021-10-11T18:57:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Wtf
[2021-10-11T21:10:38] Happy Giraffe: I could get this for 100€
[2021-10-11T21:10:54] Mirono escooters: DO
[2021-10-11T21:11:25] Happy Giraffe: Nope, no space and the ground clearance is too little
[2021-10-11T21:11:35] Happy Giraffe: Its sold 275€ new in belgium
[2021-10-11T21:12:30] Happy Giraffe: Would also need to weld disc brake mounts

[2021-10-12T12:11:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 2x45A battery, 2x120A phase.
[2021-10-12T12:11:25] Mirono escooters: Jeeezus
[2021-10-12T12:11:29] Mirono escooters: That will fly
[2021-10-12T12:11:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: my arms have some difficulities to stand on the beast 🤣🤣😔
[2021-10-12T12:13:32] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-10-12T12:16:03] Artem Bulashev: What are your the motors?
[2021-10-12T12:16:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: original boosted motors.
[2021-10-12T12:16:35] Unknown: Thanks :D
[2021-10-12T12:16:40] Artem Bulashev: Will check them out
[2021-10-12T12:16:46] Artem Bulashev: Gréât project
[2021-10-12T12:17:07] Artem Bulashev: Wish it had dual suspention and dual disk brakes
[2021-10-12T12:17:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: After some 30min crazy tests and 10 kms, they were at 80°
[2021-10-12T12:17:26] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2021-10-12T12:17:43] Artem Bulashev: Have sensors inside both?
[2021-10-12T12:17:44] Mirono escooters: I will (try to) mount v brake of bike on it 😂
[2021-10-12T12:17:50] Mirono escooters: I cant possibly get disk on
[2021-10-12T12:17:56] Mirono escooters: For rear
[2021-10-12T12:18:02] Mirono escooters: Front i need a custom adaptor too fml
[2021-10-12T12:18:04] Mirono escooters: Monoshit
[2021-10-12T12:23:39] sombre_enfant: Just need some mt5 and 203mm
[2021-10-12T12:24:06] Artem Bulashev: So those are 750w nominal each motor it seems ?
[2021-10-12T12:26:05] Artem Bulashev: 120 phase and 45 battery should over heat them rather quickly specially if you go into slightly up hill part of town
[2021-10-12T12:29:22] Artem Bulashev: I managed to get to 90c going 5km long up hill (just 2 degrees on average) my set up - 26c outside - 90amps phase both - 20amps battery both - 650w motor nominal both - lots of stop and go due to trafic lights - max throttle most of the time
[2021-10-12T12:30:21] Artem Bulashev: Can’t wait to test out the board as looks like police is getting all about speed testing this days 😅😅
[2021-10-12T12:31:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. but 25mm width magnets
[2021-10-12T12:31:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i can very quickly reduce power with a button press for such case 😉
[2021-10-12T12:32:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: anyway, with the integrated temp sensors, the vesc limit itself if it raise above 85
[2021-10-12T12:36:20] Mirono escooters: But thatz wibding temps right
[2021-10-12T12:38:56] Artem Bulashev: Yeah mine did limit
[2021-10-12T12:39:02] Artem Bulashev: Very nice and soft
[2021-10-12T12:39:13] Artem Bulashev: Similar to low battery gradual power reduction
[2021-10-12T12:39:17] sombre_enfant: 25mm but the rotor is large in diameter or common size ? Its odd 750w rated but 25mm
[2021-10-12T12:40:15] Artem Bulashev: I think it’s more about winding turns and thickness - because length and wire thickness create resonance = heat
[2021-10-12T12:41:04] Artem Bulashev: Magnets count vs width is more about design decision and back emf tunning
[2021-10-12T12:41:20] Artem Bulashev: I’m no motor expert though unfortunately
[2021-10-12T12:42:01] Artem Bulashev: It’s amazing that they hooded such power for that long no problem :) no with colder days should be even easier ;-)

[2021-10-12T12:43:38] Artem Bulashev: Where is the temp sensor ? Placed? Right on Winding it self?
[2021-10-12T12:43:55] Artem Bulashev: I placed mine on winding it self and not suspended in the air
[2021-10-12T12:45:16] Artem Bulashev: Considering that main problem is temp for the Magnets, and that heat transfer happens via convection, I now think it would be better to place sensor in the air - so that if air gets to 85c we reduce power (most magenta don’t like to warm up above 80c)

[2021-10-12T12:48:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: interesting ! ~95mm diamter vs 125mm !
[2021-10-12T12:48:41] Artem Bulashev: Mine magnets 40mm x 10mm x 3mm
[2021-10-12T12:49:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this is a vsett motor ?
[2021-10-12T12:50:15] Artem Bulashev: Winding is 0.5mm vs your is 0.6mm Startor 92mm startor vs 125mm startor
[2021-10-12T12:50:30] Artem Bulashev: Yes vsett 9 650w 8.5 inch tire
[2021-10-12T12:51:04] Artem Bulashev: So my motor is about 2 times thicker but smaller diameter
[2021-10-12T12:51:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and i get 62 km/h at 57v.
[2021-10-12T12:51:28] Artem Bulashev: I need to pick up few book on brushless motor design
[2021-10-12T12:51:40] Artem Bulashev: In the air?
[2021-10-12T12:51:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope, riding
[2021-10-12T12:51:57] Artem Bulashev: Dope
[2021-10-12T12:51:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 75kg
[2021-10-12T12:52:05] Artem Bulashev: I’m about same
[2021-10-12T12:52:20] Artem Bulashev: My top speed is about 55-58 I think it was
[2021-10-12T12:52:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: really interesting
[2021-10-12T12:52:35] Artem Bulashev: But that’s because my battery current
[2021-10-12T12:52:37] Artem Bulashev: Is low
[2021-10-12T12:52:47] Artem Bulashev: It is 20amps rear and 10 amps front
[2021-10-12T12:52:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it shouldn't affect max speed
[2021-10-12T12:52:55] Artem Bulashev: Yes it does
[2021-10-12T12:53:04] Artem Bulashev: As phase amps are limited by it at top speed
[2021-10-12T12:53:10] sombre_enfant: How do y'all solder phase then protect it ?
[2021-10-12T12:53:10] Artem Bulashev: Abs hence the top speed it self
[2021-10-12T12:53:27] Artem Bulashev: I show you

[2021-10-12T12:55:53] Artem Bulashev: - twist nicely and cleanly - glow solder through out - cut the end clean - heatshrink - household wiring isolation - fold it the way it stays safe on its own And add zip tie
[2021-10-12T13:46:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: my test ride
[2021-10-12T13:46:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1266@12-10-2021_13-46-07.jpg>
[2021-10-12T13:46:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the cut off is I make a very hard start (full gas at start seems to come from abs max current going up to 160A).
[2021-10-12T13:46:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I raised it to 180A, will see.
[2021-10-12T13:55:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: single acceleration

[2021-10-12T19:22:31] Happy Giraffe: The stock 4mm from Spintend is a joke
[2021-10-12T19:24:06] Luis Magalhaes: Im using i think 5mm bullet
[2021-10-12T19:24:15] Luis Magalhaes: Was from the minimotors 😂
[2021-10-12T19:24:56] Luis Magalhaes: The battery im using the Xt90 that came with ubox
[2021-10-12T19:30:15] Happy Giraffe: Yeah xt90 is suitable but not 4mm
[2021-10-12T19:30:27] Happy Giraffe: 4mm motor phase is actually worse than XT90 (4.5mm)

[2021-10-12T21:58:47] Mirono escooters: Nah that impossivl
[2021-10-12T21:58:54] Mirono escooters: They say to equal battery voltage
[2021-10-12T21:59:02] Mirono escooters: So ig if u connect 50% 15s and 69%
[2021-10-12T21:59:21] Happy Giraffe: They are not same voltage
[2021-10-12T21:59:31] Happy Giraffe: 51v and 51v they mean I think
[2021-10-12T21:59:37] Mirono escooters: Why tf
[2021-10-12T21:59:45] Mirono escooters: Would they make such a big heatsink shit then
[2021-10-12T21:59:53] Mirono escooters: Some Chinese must be explaining it wrong
[2021-10-12T21:59:59] Happy Giraffe: Idk, Chinese people and their product description
[2021-10-12T22:00:10] Mirono escooters: Max output 30 or 40a
[2021-10-12T22:00:20] Mirono escooters: They don't kno Just try It's smth around that
[2021-10-12T22:00:33] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, maybe it's like Rita but only for similar S

[2021-10-13T19:38:29] Mirono escooters: Monoshit adaptor didnt work with the 350w in front, not enough space And this does I'm happy. I need brakes
[2021-10-13T19:39:47] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-14T11:04:49] Ralf Halbknapp: Hi, good I found this group and hello to everyone. Been invited by @artBula
[2021-10-14T11:05:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hello !
[2021-10-14T11:05:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: do you already have a vesc ? which one ?
[2021-10-14T11:05:47] Ralf Halbknapp: I have a flipsky FSESC 7550
[2021-10-14T11:06:07] Ralf Halbknapp: And want to implement it on a 60V single motor scooter
[2021-10-14T11:06:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-10-14T11:07:52] Ralf Halbknapp: I sure will come up with some questions but it will take some time until I have all set up
[2021-10-14T11:08:15] Ralf Halbknapp: And maybe I will already get some things answered by the discussion of others 😁
[2021-10-14T11:33:26] S1m 0n: That one?
[2021-10-14T11:34:27] S1m 0n: does it fit in the Pro2 if the original battery is still there?
[2021-10-14T11:37:42] Happy Giraffe: Im not sure if 7550 is good for reliability. Spintens will now send me my replacement single Ubox after a capacitor failed on my old one👀
[2021-10-14T11:42:07] Ralf Halbknapp: No clue.
[2021-10-14T11:43:52] Happy Giraffe: Spintend single ubox fits with 13s6p custom made internal, I think will also fit with stock battery
[2021-10-14T11:45:13] Happy Giraffe: https://spintend.com/collections/frontpage/products/75v-100a-single-esc-single-ubox-based-on-vesc
[2021-10-14T12:28:32] S1m 0n: So that one will be better for me?
[2021-10-14T12:30:32] Mirono escooters: Why use stock battery? Xd
[2021-10-14T12:41:41] S1m 0n: I live in Germany and in a big city. the police hates scooters .. everything has to look as original as possible
[2021-10-14T12:42:20] Mirono escooters: Stock controller (reinforced) is really good if u dont go out super
[2021-10-14T12:42:33] Mirono escooters: Vesc u wont hzve the display (not original looking then)🥴
[2021-10-14T12:42:50] S1m 0n: I have Stock battery (36V/12,8Ah) and a little extra Back 3s (12V/12.8Ah) I can Drive with 42kmh but my Goal is 50
[2021-10-14T12:43:05] S1m 0n: Oh :/
[2021-10-14T12:43:11] Mirono escooters: Vesc wont help Topspeed is determinzd by v Not controller
[2021-10-14T12:43:17] Mirono escooters: Controller has little to do with ih
[2021-10-14T12:43:22] Mirono escooters: Oh and motor kv
[2021-10-14T12:43:33] S1m 0n: what other options do I have?
[2021-10-14T12:43:46] Mirono escooters: Add a 5s instead of 3s
[2021-10-14T12:43:59] Mirono escooters: Need new reinforced controller
[2021-10-14T12:44:07] S1m 0n: With a reinforced Controller?
[2021-10-14T12:44:32] S1m 0n: how much for everything together? 5s and controller?
[2021-10-14T12:44:32] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2021-10-14T12:44:44] Mirono escooters: Ill send u wait
[2021-10-14T12:44:48] Mirono escooters: (A 7s is also option lol)
[2021-10-14T13:08:53] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 😂
[2021-10-14T13:13:58] sombre_enfant: U will buy again a battery from him even after dissed him in every scoot chat about his battery ? U a weirdo fr
[2021-10-14T13:14:12] Mirono escooters: You like to throw oil on fire
[2021-10-14T13:14:26] Mirono escooters: Hes happy with his new battery and kept old one for free (he fixed it)
[2021-10-14T13:14:50] Mirono escooters: So please; keep out of things ur not involved in Thanks!
[2021-10-14T13:17:27] sombre_enfant: I seen him dissing u in every chat for your battery thats why i said this he didnt keep this story private as long as i know, thats why i said its weird to complain then buy again
[2021-10-14T13:17:49] Mirono escooters: He asked for help, he didnt "diss" me
[2021-10-14T13:18:15] Mirono escooters: I gave new battery; and he kept old and repaired for free He happy now :)
[2021-10-14T13:18:31] sombre_enfant: He did somehow
[2021-10-14T13:18:49] Mirono escooters: It was a broken trace 🥴🥴
[2021-10-14T13:19:20] sombre_enfant: Whatever its cool, but its still a weird behavior
[2021-10-14T13:19:35] Mirono escooters: Why bother with what he does :)
[2021-10-14T14:10:38] S1m 0n: show me a chat where I dissed it 🤣🤣 .. I asked for help to understand, nothing more. and like i told you yesterday i'm okay with that I'm just a hobbyist myself. But I don't have the material for it ... and what to buy if I only want to use it once? So yes, I think it's okay to pay another hobbyist for the work that you could do yourself;) .. as long as nothing explodes and works, I'm happy
[2021-10-14T14:11:49] Happy Giraffe: I would get vesc
[2021-10-14T14:11:59] S1m 0n: It seems to me as if you keep getting it up again .. just like yesterday. I didn't say a word that Mirono built the battery .. but who threw Mirono's name into the chat ?! 🤔🤔🤔
[2021-10-14T14:16:45] Happy Giraffe: But for that I wouldnt use any 10s+3s frankenstein stuff
[2021-10-14T14:18:49] Mirono escooters: Yea rather a good battery Stock controller works fine with those things
[2021-10-14T14:19:17] Mirono escooters: Still in my eyes if u dont go all out stock works sl good
[2021-10-14T14:20:46] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, Im just not a fan of these 10s+3s bombs😂
[2021-10-14T14:21:11] Mirono escooters: Its cheap and works
[2021-10-14T14:50:12] S1m 0n: true. and I am not a professional user. I just want to get to work and back quickly .. 11km there and 11km back. Otherwise I don't use the scooter much
[2021-10-14T16:25:33] S1m 0n: can someone help me understand this? some say it uses the same or less power as it is more efficient workers, others say it draws a lot of power. I've also heard several times that 7A (Imin) and 2500x (Imult) should be optimal for the g30d .. How do I find out which settings are good for the Pro2 or where do I know if I have good settings?
[2021-10-14T16:25:33] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_1275@14-10-2021_16-25-33.jpg>
[2021-10-14T16:25:33] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_1276@14-10-2021_16-25-33.jpg>
[2021-10-14T16:33:34] Mirono escooters: As far as i kno field weakening always draws more power as its more inefficient
[2021-10-14T16:34:03] Mirono escooters: Also to find out most efficient Do tests W continuous for wich speed
[2021-10-14T17:11:44] S1m 0n: How? With m365 Tools or Dashboard? but what should i watch out for? whether the consumption increases / sings? the performance? Speedboost implies to me that the speed is increased .. that means I always have to reach the top speed? hotter again in order to get valid results, I would always have to try under the same conditions with different variables .. the battery sinks .. the wind blows. On a straight road, I sometimes achieved 1kmh more with a stick 10s battery. Small hills or bridges down can give up to 40. Maybe I think too complicated
[2021-10-14T17:12:49] Mirono escooters: Well u would need for best testing a big room like a fitness thing
[2021-10-14T17:12:53] Mirono escooters: I dont know name
[2021-10-14T17:12:58] Mirono escooters: Difficult for us anyways
[2021-10-14T17:14:52] Mirono escooters: Anyone kind enough to say pros/ cons of hydraulic vs regular cable w xtech? Cons Maintenance? Price? Pros?
[2021-10-14T17:29:18] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_1277@14-10-2021_17-29-18.jpg>
[2021-10-14T17:29:19] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_1278@14-10-2021_17-29-19.jpg>
[2021-10-14T17:29:23] S1m 0n: that sounds like rocket science to me. nevertheless I would like to understand it, because it sounds interesting
[2021-10-14T17:29:46] Mirono escooters: I understand most
[2021-10-14T17:35:32] S1m 0n: I would like to have the efficient one, as I value a balanced profile. This is the only reason why the speed booster has become interesting for me again. I am not really interested in whether one or 2 kmh faster. you know before 36V / 25A now 48V / 19A
[2021-10-14T17:36:33] Mirono escooters: W=v×A
[2021-10-14T17:36:37] S1m 0n: i want to be able to drive very fast, but mainly it is just supposed to get me to work and back quickly
[2021-10-14T17:36:40] Mirono escooters: So higher v lower A same W
[2021-10-14T17:37:26] S1m 0n: Aroud 900W is fine for me
[2021-10-14T18:30:10] Happy Giraffe: Xtech is shit, regular cable disc brake is ok for backup in rear, full hydro overkill in rear
[2021-10-14T18:30:45] Mirono escooters: Xtech works fine for me
[2021-10-14T18:30:57] Happy Giraffe: Then get higher voltage battery
[2021-10-14T18:31:08] Happy Giraffe: Forget these party tricks
[2021-10-14T18:31:16] Mirono escooters: I only have 1 brake in front lol Ebrake sucks rear no option
[2021-10-14T18:31:19] Mirono escooters: +1
[2021-10-14T18:31:46] Happy Giraffe: Full hydro in front and mechanical in back seems best for me
[2021-10-14T18:32:15] Mirono escooters: Back w g30 motors no option sadly
[2021-10-14T18:32:22] Mirono escooters: Hydro i see for 60€ Wonder if its good
[2021-10-14T18:32:28] Happy Giraffe: Power and reliability, best of both worlds. Then e-brake connected to xiaomi lever. So either of the levers can make me stop quickly
[2021-10-14T18:32:28] Mirono escooters: What pros and cons?
[2021-10-14T18:32:38] Happy Giraffe: Get Magura at that point
[2021-10-14T18:32:47] Happy Giraffe: 40€ difference not much
[2021-10-14T18:32:54] Mirono escooters: Ye sadly these controllers ebrake suck dick
[2021-10-14T18:32:58] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-10-14T18:33:04] Mirono escooters: Endless money pit
[2021-10-14T18:33:11] Happy Giraffe: Then you wanna front and rear hydro
[2021-10-14T18:33:18] Happy Giraffe: But rear hydro has to be slim
[2021-10-14T18:33:23] Happy Giraffe: Magura wont fit
[2021-10-14T18:33:52] Happy Giraffe: Maybe they have some slimmer calipers but yeah
[2021-10-14T18:36:01] Happy Giraffe: Metallic pads, 140/160mm discs
[2021-10-14T18:40:41] Mirono escooters: Bigger then xtech no option
[2021-10-14T18:42:39] Happy Giraffe: Yep, need slim hydro
[2021-10-14T18:51:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vesc with analog brakes is really awesome. i've driven 30kms today with mainly electric brake (with top speed at 60km/h). i've use hydro brake only twice.
[2021-10-14T18:56:15] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2021-10-14T18:56:20] Mirono escooters: But not shitrt random aoie controller xd
[2021-10-14T18:56:43] Happy Giraffe: Dont swear on that poor little Ali esc
[2021-10-14T18:56:46] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-14T18:57:14] Mirono escooters: Sowwy i hurt its feelings
[2021-10-14T18:57:20] Mirono escooters: Cant even disable ebrake fully 😂
[2021-10-14T18:57:23] Mirono escooters: 1-5
[2021-10-14T18:57:52] Happy Giraffe: 65kmh in air, 32kmh on street = Ali esc
[2021-10-14T18:58:12] Happy Giraffe: 20A beast
[2021-10-14T18:58:12] Mirono escooters: 😂
[2021-10-14T18:58:21] Mirono escooters: I got dual 40a
[2021-10-14T20:34:39] Unknown: @Happy_Giraffe when do you recieve new vesc? I wanna know your top speed compared to wheelway 😂
[2021-10-14T20:34:55] Unknown: I need a higher kv motor :l
[2021-10-14T20:44:55] Mirono escooters: Paolo new stock

[2021-10-14T21:20:03] Happy Giraffe: That aint gonna happen
[2021-10-14T21:20:10] Unknown: Would i be able to burn the xiaomi motor hotter and go faster then wheelway on 12s? 😂😂
[2021-10-14T21:20:10] Happy Giraffe: I gotta pay tax I think
[2021-10-14T21:20:25] Unknown: Oh snap yea idd it's from outter europe
[2021-10-14T21:22:36] Happy Giraffe: Nope
[2021-10-14T21:22:49] Happy Giraffe: Wheelway higher kv I think than xiaomi stock
[2021-10-14T21:26:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but why are we talking about xiaomi controllers here ? isn't it a vesc group ? there are so much xiaomi groups to find help or simply discuss
[2021-10-14T21:30:38] Unknown: Motor not controller 😂😂
[2021-10-14T21:31:42] Unknown: And no clue happy, might try it out this weekend 😂 let's see how much i can torture that little fucker 😂
[2021-10-14T21:33:20] Happy Giraffe: I mean motor😅
[2021-10-14T21:34:07] Unknown: Yes me to 🤦‍♂️ 😂 why do you guys keep on thinking i'm talking about the esc 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
[2021-10-14T21:34:13] Unknown: Shame on you guys 😂
[2021-10-14T21:34:56] Happy Giraffe: I think he meant what was discussed before idk😂
[2021-10-14T21:35:07] Unknown: My xiaomi esc is somewhere in my desk waiting to be a project for my sisters kid like gocart orso 😂
[2021-10-14T21:35:15] Unknown: And ooh lol idk 😂😂
[2021-10-14T22:48:02] Artem Bulashev: Agree. I love remote - it has reverse as brake (very moth)
[2021-10-15T17:51:27] Happy Giraffe: How fast is DHL ecommerce?
[2021-10-15T17:51:33] Mirono escooters: Slow
[2021-10-15T17:51:37] Happy Giraffe: Fuck
[2021-10-15T17:51:39] Mirono escooters: Mine never arrived😂😂😂
[2021-10-15T17:51:46] sombre_enfant: Like 2-3 buisness months
[2021-10-15T17:51:53] Mirono escooters: @koxx3 had shipping method tat too I rememjer
[2021-10-15T17:52:17] Mirono escooters: I had it It tracked until Germany Then "will b delivered in couple of days" Yea 4 months later I want my brake levers
[2021-10-15T17:53:25] Happy Giraffe: I sent email to spintend
[2021-10-15T17:53:47] Happy Giraffe: They are retarded if they expect me to wait because of 15€
[2021-10-15T17:54:01] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-10-15T17:54:06] Mirono escooters: It will take a horrible long time
[2021-10-15T17:54:20] Happy Giraffe: Fedex was fast last time
[2021-10-15T17:54:20] Mirono escooters: Spintend I like em less and less Not the most professional service
[2021-10-15T17:54:25] Mirono escooters: FedEx ofc
[2021-10-15T17:54:35] Happy Giraffe: Me too
[2021-10-15T17:54:47] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 8 days🤭🥴
[2021-10-15T17:55:19] Happy Giraffe: If the vesc fails from capacitor once again I will tell everyone not to buy them lol
[2021-10-15T17:55:38] Happy Giraffe: Like, why not pay 0.5€ per cap more for better quality
[2021-10-15T17:56:09] Mirono escooters: 🤷‍♂️
[2021-10-15T17:56:32] Mirono escooters: We should have a eu vesc maker Like the xiaomi upgraded controllers Get rid of China crap
[2021-10-15T17:56:39] Mirono escooters: If I had brains I'd do it. But yea
[2021-10-15T17:58:57] Happy Giraffe: Now I pray they didnt send it yet
[2021-10-15T17:59:17] Mirono escooters: Check trackin
[2021-10-15T18:03:13] Happy Giraffe: Haven't received it, that's why I can still pray
[2021-10-15T18:12:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah.. very slow (5 weeks for me)
[2021-10-15T18:12:11] Happy Giraffe: Oh shit!
[2021-10-15T18:12:32] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow we see what's going on
[2021-10-15T18:12:46] Happy Giraffe: Did your vesc work after repair?
[2021-10-15T18:13:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I didn't repair or send it for repair yet.
[2021-10-15T18:13:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I wonder if i'm not gonna try to repair it myself. I bought a STM32F405
[2021-10-15T18:14:27] Happy Giraffe: Oh, you had some other warranty with Spintend then?
[2021-10-15T18:14:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: never tried Spintend warranty (of flipsky)
[2021-10-15T18:14:49] sombre_enfant: The flipsky u tried to repair ago how it went ?
[2021-10-15T18:15:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I didn't manage to repair the directfet. a friend repaired it. in fact, the mosfet driver was dead too ... it's the reason why I continued to blow mosfets
[2021-10-15T18:16:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: normally, it works now, but I did get it back yet
[2021-10-15T18:16:30] Mirono escooters: Sounds logical
[2021-10-15T18:16:40] Mirono escooters: Was it 4.2?
[2021-10-15T18:16:45] Happy Giraffe: Could we upgrade the small capacitors on single Ubox to something better? Would it need other mods alongside with it?
[2021-10-15T18:16:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope, a flipsky 7550
[2021-10-15T18:16:50] Mirono escooters: Wich directfet was it?
[2021-10-15T18:17:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_709@08-08-2021_19-36-28.jpg>
[2021-10-15T18:17:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1280@15-10-2021_18-17-59.jpg>

[2021-10-15T18:17:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1282@15-10-2021_18-17-59.jpg>
[2021-10-15T18:19:21] Mirono escooters: Cool shit
[2021-10-15T18:19:31] Mirono escooters: Idk what flipsky 4.2 uses but not this😂😂😂
[2021-10-15T18:19:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: android vesctool piss me off. I'll make a wifi gateway to be able to configure the VESC with the VESCTool desktop app in Wifi 😊
[2021-10-15T18:19:42] Mirono escooters: I will mod my 4.2 to death and give everything maintenance
[2021-10-15T18:19:50] Mirono escooters: For me works fine
[2021-10-15T18:21:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: menus are a really crap. when you switch between VESC, if you don't wait for the data to refresh, it overrides your VESC config. never seen such crappy app. It's a QT app, it's really not adapted for mobile phone.
[2021-10-15T18:21:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but, yes, it works ... pretty badly
[2021-10-15T18:23:04] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2021-10-15T18:24:23] Happy Giraffe: Oh shiet, for me it will be just for speedometer and temp monitoring. And police mode🤪
[2021-10-15T18:25:06] Artem Bulashev: Yeah … at lest it doesn’t over ride settings that it can’t even control or see as the only okey app for iPhone does.. Xmatic
[2021-10-15T18:25:32] Artem Bulashev: Xmatic is only ok for monitoring, has all data
[2021-10-15T18:26:41] Artem Bulashev: I do agree, setting should be done via pc. Forwarding with TCP should be safe as no packages will be lost, it repeats most package until delivered before going to next one, unlike UDP
[2021-10-15T18:27:22] Artem Bulashev: If I remember correctly from my 4g FPV drone developing times 8 years ago 🤣
[2021-10-15T18:31:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly
[2021-10-15T19:01:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahaha ... it's already working
[2021-10-15T19:01:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1283@15-10-2021_19-01-29.jpg>
[2021-10-15T22:21:28] Mirono escooters: Why wheelway 1000w doesn't work on xiaomi esc? It has a reason? Halls diff?
[2021-10-15T22:26:32] francois schempers: foc is not compatible
[2021-10-15T22:28:11] francois schempers: yes halls are too far from original Xiaomi motor to work, @koxx3 has a repo for custom FOC algo on Xiaomi but it's not for everyone to meddle with
[2021-10-15T22:31:52] Mirono escooters: Fuck
[2021-10-15T22:31:53] Mirono escooters: Fuck
[2021-10-15T22:32:04] Mirono escooters: Lucky my 1200w worked
[2021-10-15T22:43:09] francois schempers: funny thing is, the 1000w, is just not right enough to make field weakening happen with Xiaomi esc 🤣 got 120km/h out of 13s
[2021-10-15T22:44:49] francois schempers: <video_file>
[2021-10-15T22:45:21] Mirono escooters: So no way to make it compatible
[2021-10-15T22:46:00] francois schempers: with Kox's github, but I didn't manage it myself, switched to Vesc instead
[2021-10-15T23:56:19] Happy Giraffe: I got the Blade motor if you saw it already👀
[2021-10-15T23:56:39] Happy Giraffe: Go kart would be awesome from those😂
[2021-10-15T23:56:50] Happy Giraffe: 2x Dual Ubox
[2021-10-15T23:57:22] Mirono escooters: I got a frame now need time and money
[2021-10-16T00:21:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vesc powaaaaaa
[2021-10-16T00:52:53] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-16T00:53:12] Happy Giraffe: But I'm happy for you😊
[2021-10-16T02:09:34] Artem Bulashev: Nice :)
[2021-10-16T02:11:02] Artem Bulashev: Enjoy :))
[2021-10-16T02:11:37] Artem Bulashev: You received your UBOX right?
[2021-10-16T10:39:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes 😉
[2021-10-16T11:04:33] Artem Bulashev: Sweet :) did you open it up and clean from debris?
[2021-10-16T11:04:48] Artem Bulashev: How are the temperatures or fête holding up?
[2021-10-16T11:05:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope !
[2021-10-16T11:05:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: VERY well !
[2021-10-16T11:06:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not more than 55° with my setup.
[2021-10-16T11:10:45] Artem Bulashev: Should do it man :-)
[2021-10-16T11:15:21] Artem Bulashev: People reported that Ubox has also bunch of metal shaving inside from threading holes, and usually 1-2 solder balls on power side on the bottom
[2021-10-16T11:15:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but only on the single, no ?
[2021-10-16T11:15:54] Artem Bulashev: No on UBOX
[2021-10-16T11:16:24] Artem Bulashev: I had in mine as well one solder ball and one shaving
[2021-10-16T11:16:39] Artem Bulashev: Was lucky I opened before plugging
[2021-10-16T11:16:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you know both are called 'ubox' 😉
[2021-10-16T11:16:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1285@16-10-2021_11-16-51.jpg>
[2021-10-16T11:16:54] Artem Bulashev: Really?
[2021-10-16T11:16:56] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-10-16T11:16:59] Artem Bulashev: Dual UBOX
[2021-10-16T11:17:06] Artem Bulashev: Thanks didn’t spot it
[2021-10-16T11:17:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, i'll open it next time i'll open the deck
[2021-10-16T11:17:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no pb 😉
[2021-10-16T12:38:57] Mirono escooters: Anyone fitted different then original tires on g30? Maybe if I ditch the tubeless and go tube?
[2021-10-16T12:39:05] Mirono escooters: I need bigger 😂😂 I need grip
[2021-10-16T12:52:31] Artem Bulashev: Tubeless is better
[2021-10-16T12:53:02] Mirono escooters: I only had problems until now😂
[2021-10-16T12:53:07] Mirono escooters: And they are almost out of thread
[2021-10-16T12:53:12] Mirono escooters: So looking at my options
[2021-10-16T12:53:29] Mirono escooters: Are tubeless rims universal? No one mods these g30 stuff ._.
[2021-10-16T12:58:06] Ralf Halbknapp: Tubeless rims are universal for a given size of tires
[2021-10-16T12:58:17] Mirono escooters: Thanks!
[2021-10-16T12:58:38] Mirono escooters: There must be someone who has already tried bigger on g30
[2021-10-16T12:58:59] Ralf Halbknapp: So most 10" tires would work. Those rated as tubeless however are meant to be used without a tube and may seal better to the rim
[2021-10-16T12:59:18] Ralf Halbknapp: Probably not many as the tires would not fit under the fenders
[2021-10-16T13:00:02] Ralf Halbknapp: 11" are typically also wider and will therefore fit even less.
[2021-10-16T13:01:23] Ralf Halbknapp: And 11" tires would need bigger rims (6,5" rim diameter, I assume the Max has 6")
[2021-10-16T13:12:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2021-10-16T13:30:54] Mirono escooters: Don't need 11"
[2021-10-16T13:31:08] Mirono escooters: Haha yea But I mean m365 they literally file rim G30 I haven't seen anything
[2021-10-16T13:31:17] Mirono escooters: I'm using g30 motor on pro

[2021-10-16T13:47:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you might be right for the remote. i'll dig on that
[2021-10-16T16:35:01] Happy Giraffe: And opening ruins warranty😂
[2021-10-16T16:35:52] Happy Giraffe: They said to me they already sent it with DHL and told me its been very slow lately? Like wtf you know its slow and still send....
[2021-10-16T16:42:33] Mirono escooters: Fuck them
[2021-10-16T16:43:56] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, if I have to correct their errors and be fucked with their slow returns (I paid for the package to arrive there) I search a new company
[2021-10-16T16:44:19] Happy Giraffe: Hopefully Lacroix or someone else makes working single esc
[2021-10-16T16:44:27] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 🙂😂

[2021-10-16T23:46:12] sombre_enfant: Ask @SibClimb he know about kelly
[2021-10-17T00:46:32] Artem Bulashev: That’s Dual UBOX size but fat fat fat
[2021-10-17T00:48:10] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1286@17-10-2021_00-48-10.jpg>
[2021-10-17T00:49:02] Artem Bulashev: Boost functions gives it an advantage of Square wave like punch I suppose
[2021-10-17T00:49:38] Artem Bulashev: But 100 continues is really shit for that size
[2021-10-17T01:02:04] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I will never need more than 20sec of 100A anyways
[2021-10-17T02:02:24] Happy Giraffe: But maybe it doesnt fail like single ubox😂
[2021-10-17T02:21:22] Artem Bulashev: guys
[2021-10-17T02:21:34] Artem Bulashev: "AmySpintend can only wait for one more month. we’re producing the ubox v2.0 and 100v esc sample now. "
[2021-10-17T02:22:13] Artem Bulashev: UBOX v2 and also 100v version is comming, sound like there will be 2 new version!
[2021-10-17T02:22:41] Artem Bulashev: not that I care as UBOX dual already is more than my motors should need haha
[2021-10-17T02:25:32] Happy Giraffe: Hopefully they fix their old issues first before making new products👀🌚
[2021-10-17T02:37:23] Artem Bulashev: will see
[2021-10-17T02:37:28] Artem Bulashev: what issues?
[2021-10-17T02:42:56] Happy Giraffe: Blowing capacitors and failing vescs
[2021-10-17T02:43:33] Artem Bulashev: I did not see many dual UBOX blown, barely any actually
[2021-10-17T02:43:33] Happy Giraffe: And cleaning their mess😅
[2021-10-17T02:43:53] Artem Bulashev: but I did see derbis inside dual ubox being common
[2021-10-17T02:44:40] Artem Bulashev: but that is inevetable for small scale manual assembly line
[2021-10-17T02:44:43] Happy Giraffe: I will look for that and clean it up, thanks👍
[2021-10-17T02:45:22] Artem Bulashev: to avoid solder balls need leaded solder or untrosonic automated soldering line
[2021-10-17T02:45:28] Happy Giraffe: Denis said instantly that those capacitors are shit after I sent him a picture😂
[2021-10-17T02:45:37] Artem Bulashev: where?
[2021-10-17T02:45:48] Happy Giraffe: In our admin group
[2021-10-17T02:45:49] Artem Bulashev: I missed something it sounds
[2021-10-17T02:46:56] Happy Giraffe: these capacitors are shorted by design
[2021-10-17T02:47:00] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-17T02:47:22] Artem Bulashev: which capasitors?
[2021-10-17T02:47:36] Happy Giraffe: One I burned, one sec
[2021-10-17T02:48:06] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1287@17-10-2021_02-48-06.jpg>
[2021-10-17T02:48:59] Happy Giraffe: And I still don't like this design
[2021-10-17T02:49:47] Artem Bulashev: those capasitors are normal
[2021-10-17T02:49:50] Happy Giraffe: This can make the whole battery short if things go bad lmao
[2021-10-17T02:49:51] Artem Bulashev: nothign special
[2021-10-17T02:50:01] Artem Bulashev: nothing bad
[2021-10-17T02:50:03] Artem Bulashev: but
[2021-10-17T02:50:09] Artem Bulashev: alot of dust and dirt
[2021-10-17T02:50:27] Happy Giraffe: Yes from the explosion
[2021-10-17T02:50:28] Artem Bulashev: they shorted because solder ball got in between it looks like
[2021-10-17T02:51:06] Artem Bulashev: no I remmebr your vesc I found many issues and solder balls on it
[2021-10-17T02:51:13] Happy Giraffe: I will clean the vesc when I get it, I didnt do it last time as I dkdnt want to fun it up😅
[2021-10-17T02:51:39] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, some solder could be from the cap blowing up
[2021-10-17T02:52:18] Artem Bulashev: solder ball right here
[2021-10-17T02:52:18] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_906@29-08-2021_18-19-18.jpg>
[2021-10-17T02:52:32] Happy Giraffe: Cleaning will make sure it won't happen. I will also do my own insulation of the batt +-
[2021-10-17T02:52:52] Artem Bulashev: an other one here
[2021-10-17T02:52:52] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_907@29-08-2021_18-33-18.jpg>

[2021-10-17T18:20:03] Happy Giraffe: Its starting to be cold here, I dont wanna use water heating so I just mine crypto with my free electricity I guess😂
[2021-10-17T18:20:43] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-10-17T18:48:02] Unknown: 😂😂 and nice, way better phase wires compared to wheelway

[2021-10-18T16:44:01] Artem Bulashev: And deep connections with many distributors
[2021-10-18T16:44:15] Mirono escooters: Donate 😂😂😂
[2021-10-18T16:44:16] Artem Bulashev: I provide them with fail rates and online reports of all sorts
[2021-10-18T16:44:18] Happy Giraffe: This is true 1200w that survives 150A phase
[2021-10-18T16:44:27] Mirono escooters: Mine survives 150a phase too
[2021-10-18T16:44:29] Happy Giraffe: 13s 65kmh
[2021-10-18T16:44:31] Mirono escooters: Flipsky I will mod to shit
[2021-10-18T16:44:37] Mirono escooters: Aa
[2021-10-18T16:44:40] Artem Bulashev: It should, but again, quality ?
[2021-10-18T16:45:10] Happy Giraffe: Blade is good quality, I can open the cover for ya
[2021-10-18T16:45:22] Happy Giraffe: It has nothing to do with that video
[2021-10-18T16:56:57] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1294@18-10-2021_16-56-57.jpg>
[2021-10-18T16:58:32] Happy Giraffe: Winding thickness 0.7mm Magnet 50mm x 11 x 3mm
[2021-10-18T17:00:48] Mirono escooters: Nice windings
[2021-10-18T17:01:02] Artem Bulashev: That’s nice
[2021-10-18T17:01:11] Mirono escooters: I think I'll open up the 1200w for you all :)
[2021-10-18T17:01:14] Mirono escooters: (Flj)
[2021-10-18T17:02:21] Artem Bulashev: On startor should be writen with marker
[2021-10-18T17:02:26] Artem Bulashev: The set up
[2021-10-18T17:02:28] Artem Bulashev: Like 9x7
[2021-10-18T17:02:30] Happy Giraffe: I will seal motor cover not with silicone
[2021-10-18T17:02:43] Mirono escooters: With what should you seal it?
[2021-10-18T17:03:09] Happy Giraffe: I can't see anything, wont take stator out tho😂
[2021-10-18T17:03:25] Artem Bulashev: How do you know magnet length than?
[2021-10-18T17:03:35] Happy Giraffe: Other people checked that
[2021-10-18T17:03:39] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok
[2021-10-18T17:04:50] Happy Giraffe: I think I just put some silicone here, thin layer so it wont spread
[2021-10-18T17:05:03] Happy Giraffe: Then some lithium grease on bearing
[2021-10-18T17:05:25] Happy Giraffe: Bearing type 6202 (RS) in stock
[2021-10-18T17:06:45] Happy Giraffe: This rubber is actually a bearing sealer, cool to see
[2021-10-18T17:11:06] Artem Bulashev: Called simmering
[2021-10-18T17:11:12] Artem Bulashev: Yeah good to have
[2021-10-18T17:11:20] Artem Bulashev: Vsett also uses those
[2021-10-18T17:11:38] Artem Bulashev: They do help specially if you apply water resistive grease on it
[2021-10-18T17:12:05] Happy Giraffe: So lithium grease on that?
[2021-10-18T17:12:28] Happy Giraffe: So far Im impressed by this, looks like it wants to eat wheelway 1000w for breakfast
[2021-10-18T17:23:21] sombre_enfant: U sure its not 45?
[2021-10-18T17:23:53] Happy Giraffe: I saw a message where people confirmed it was 50
[2021-10-18T17:26:07] Happy Giraffe: But yeah, I cant confirm it personally. Dont wanna risk damaging rotor if I take it out alone without proper equipment
[2021-10-18T17:28:32] sombre_enfant: How u would damage it
[2021-10-18T17:29:11] Happy Giraffe: Im a retard afterall, I opened monorim as it doesnt matter for me anymore
[2021-10-18T17:29:28] Mirono escooters: 😂
[2021-10-18T17:43:15] Ralf Halbknapp: I have checked one of the 800W motors used on the Blade Scooters, also looked nice and had measured 35mm stator and magnet width.
[2021-10-18T17:44:42] Ralf Halbknapp: Original motor should have a glue here, 2 component slow curing epoxy is common I think. But harder to open up again then if only sealed with silicone
[2021-10-18T18:47:35] Artem Bulashev: Vsett does yes
[2021-10-18T18:50:06] Happy Giraffe: This (Blade motor) didnt, so I will put thin layer of motor sealant silicone there
[2021-10-18T19:08:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: by the way, some interesting pieces of code from a VESC-like firmware

[2021-10-18T19:09:42] Happy Giraffe: Thats interesting, but not really useful for a muggle like me
[2021-10-18T19:10:01] Mirono escooters: I only understood the numbers
[2021-10-18T19:10:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol... it wasn't for this group, but lol
[2021-10-18T19:11:15] Happy Giraffe: Haha, but thats cool anyways as Im atm practicing basic coding👀
[2021-10-18T19:11:59] Mirono escooters: Same
[2021-10-18T21:54:59] Mirono escooters: Im problably dumb

[2021-10-18T21:55:22] Mirono escooters: What do these 6 screws hold in?
[2021-10-18T21:55:30] Mirono escooters: They are tight af
[2021-10-18T21:56:05] Mirono escooters: Tubeless Maybe split rim? Still cant see where it would sliit
[2021-10-18T21:56:07] Mirono escooters: Split
[2021-10-18T21:56:13] Mirono escooters: Motor fully corroded needs a clean
[2021-10-18T21:56:59] Happy Giraffe: They hold the bearing no?
[2021-10-18T21:57:22] Mirono escooters: All that to hold a bearing??
[2021-10-18T21:57:30] Mirono escooters: Sick

[2021-10-18T21:58:51] Mirono escooters: The black thing around it is the stator i guess?
[2021-10-18T22:10:34] Happy Giraffe: I mean usually its pulled out Im lil confused
[2021-10-18T22:11:54] Mirono escooters: Yea its screwed down normally
[2021-10-18T22:11:57] Mirono escooters: Yhis shit rusted
[2021-10-18T22:12:38] Happy Giraffe: That looks quite hideous, what motor is that?😅
[2021-10-18T22:12:55] Mirono escooters: 11" minimotors
[2021-10-18T22:12:59] Mirono escooters: And a lot of W
[2021-10-18T22:13:11] Mirono escooters: Tire wider then a hand
[2021-10-18T22:14:13] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1302@18-10-2021_22-14-13.jpg>
[2021-10-18T22:17:28] Mirono escooters: Sshh it has seen abit of wotter
[2021-10-18T22:54:22] Mirono escooters: Almost lost 3 fingers and my sanity
[2021-10-18T22:54:28] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1303@18-10-2021_22-54-28.jpg>
[2021-10-18T22:54:39] Mirono escooters: Its lzes say pretty rust
[2021-10-18T22:54:54] Mirono escooters: I wanna use it on a wheelbarrow lmao so not looking for the best performance
[2021-10-18T22:55:05] Mirono escooters: Fun thing It doesnt have halls It has 3 slots for it But no halls installed
[2021-10-18T22:56:54] Mirono escooters: Double stacked magnets
[2021-10-18T22:56:58] Mirono escooters: Tommorrow ill measurz
[2021-10-18T23:02:37] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1304@18-10-2021_23-02-37.jpg>
[2021-10-18T23:03:46] Mirono escooters: I need more then that
[2021-10-19T10:43:02] Ralf Halbknapp: About the Minimotors motor they don't use hall sensors as their controller does not need or use them (trapezoid without hall). The motors have a detachable rim so you can separate the tubeless rim from the motor, that is what the screws are for
[2021-10-19T10:44:16] Ralf Halbknapp: And the rust and stuck screws seem to be a very common problem here
[2021-10-19T11:59:44] Mirono escooters: How to clean magnets from rust without damaging it more?😂
[2021-10-19T11:59:59] Mirono escooters: Aaa so split rim?
[2021-10-19T12:00:10] Mirono escooters: Nice!
[2021-10-19T12:00:14] Mirono escooters: Thanks
[2021-10-19T12:00:39] Unknown: My guess would be having it laserd, or very carefully sanding
[2021-10-19T12:01:14] Mirono escooters: Rust cleaner?😂
[2021-10-19T12:11:41] Unknown: I don't know if that's gpod for your windings if it gets on them
[2021-10-19T12:13:12] Mirono escooters: Hmm
[2021-10-19T12:13:23] Mirono escooters: I'll try just sand papper
[2021-10-19T12:32:44] Ralf Halbknapp: No, detachable rim, not split rim
[2021-10-19T12:33:07] Mirono escooters: Cons/Pros?
[2021-10-19T14:24:12] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1305@19-10-2021_14-24-12.jpg>
[2021-10-19T14:24:35] Mirono escooters: The blue ish thing on magnets Is it just whats under the "shining " coating?
[2021-10-19T14:24:43] Mirono escooters: It's after rust is cleaned off
[2021-10-19T16:41:58] Happy Giraffe: Double magnets lul
[2021-10-19T16:44:44] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-10-19T16:44:47] Mirono escooters: This shit thicc
[2021-10-19T16:44:58] Mirono escooters: It's taking a bath in vinegar now
[2021-10-19T16:45:16] Mirono escooters: Even if it lost significantly power it will still be fokin good lol
[2021-10-19T16:45:26] Mirono escooters: Will install hall sensors tho I think If I can y not
[2021-10-19T16:50:30] Artem Bulashev: Damm double 🤣🤣 haha
[2021-10-19T16:52:10] Mirono escooters: Yea this shit big and good I'll measure them for yall tomorrow
[2021-10-19T16:52:21] Mirono escooters: Idk the W rating but enough xd
[2021-10-19T16:52:39] Happy Giraffe: Big, good and rusty as fuck😂
[2021-10-19T16:52:49] Mirono escooters: It's only the top layer
[2021-10-19T16:52:52] Mirono escooters: They seem ok
[2021-10-19T16:53:08] Mirono escooters: They were strong enough to keep me shitting on it for 2h
[2021-10-19T16:53:10] Mirono escooters: Not kidding
[2021-10-19T16:53:38] Mirono escooters: In the end had to hit on ground with all force it popped out and quickly grab Almosh Lost 3 fingers that dat
[2021-10-19T16:53:54] Mirono escooters: Wont even fit monorim inverted fork😂😂
[2021-10-19T16:56:15] Happy Giraffe: Damn 😅
[2021-10-19T16:56:36] Mirono escooters: Spit ideas Otherwise it will go on shelf problably :/
[2021-10-19T16:56:43] Mirono escooters: I need torque washers lmao
[2021-10-19T18:36:01] Unknown: You don't need torque washers if your rusty magnets slow you down bro 😂 just spitting it out haha
[2021-10-19T18:36:23] Unknown: I don't know maybe there s a topic about this on reddit orso? :o
[2021-10-19T18:36:26] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1306@19-10-2021_18-36-26.jpg>
[2021-10-19T18:36:36] Mirono escooters: Vinegar power
[2021-10-19T18:36:41] Mirono escooters: Y would they
[2021-10-19T18:37:03] Unknown: Noicee and well if it's rusted it might give friction wich would slow you down
[2021-10-19T18:37:14] Unknown: Washers would'nt be the prob then 😂
[2021-10-19T18:37:44] Unknown: If there's no friction then washers is idd the only friction, you should hear the sound of my backwheel
[2021-10-19T18:38:05] Unknown: Washers have over 6000km on them and i don't really care for water, mud and dust haha
[2021-10-19T18:38:28] Unknown: Should replace them, but might replace the rim since xtech bearly fits
[2021-10-19T18:38:36] Unknown: And i need a descent brake
[2021-10-19T18:42:03] Mirono escooters: Rusted gone now
[2021-10-19T18:43:38] Mirono escooters: Anyone know where to order torque washers?
[2021-10-19T18:44:13] Mirono escooters: Xtech fits here barely too :)
[2021-10-19T18:44:35] Unknown: Not really, i did for my skateboard but i guess they won't fit.. i'd say you want some vacuum titanium orso
[2021-10-19T18:45:10] Unknown: And yes but might upgrade to hydraulic brakes later, better safe then sorry
[2021-10-19T18:47:13] Mirono escooters: Yea same but for now xtech fine
[2021-10-19T18:48:29] Unknown: I feel you, but my fitment is ruined.. i cant screw it on 🤦‍♂️ so i really don't even have a mech brake atm 😅😂 only motor brake, i can NOT go lower then 10A regen since i need to be able to brake 😂
[2021-10-19T18:49:36] Mirono escooters: Ooof
[2021-10-19T18:49:53] Mirono escooters: Lucky ebraje on vesc is so good
[2021-10-19T18:50:11] Mirono escooters: These greentime controllers suck😂😂😂😂
[2021-10-19T18:51:05] Unknown: Indeed, but if i go lower then 10a i really start brakin when i go like 15-20kmh.. and sometimes with these asshole drivers i really gotta brake hard i almoast hit poeple like atleast 3 times last month
[2021-10-19T18:51:27] Unknown: And then this asshole who almoast hit me.. kicked his damn mirror off
[2021-10-19T18:51:59] Unknown: Was a bmw z4 (m or not idk atleast he had the package and looks) matte gray, was a damn sexy car
[2021-10-19T18:52:18] Unknown: But F that old guy FR almoast ran me over fo no reason at all
[2021-10-19T18:53:20] Mirono escooters: Hahahah xd
[2021-10-19T18:53:23] Mirono escooters: Good
[2021-10-19T18:54:53] Unknown: Oh well, i'll be happy if the scoot is complete 😂 wanna get monorim rear suspension, or some other one if anyone knows some firm descent quality? 😂
[2021-10-19T18:58:12] Mirono escooters: Alie one works fine forcme

[2021-10-19T19:04:14] Mirono escooters: Idk never had problems
[2021-10-19T21:04:47] Happy Giraffe: You could also drill a smaller hole for washer with different arm type
[2021-10-19T21:05:01] Happy Giraffe: No maybe no need to cut the frame either
[2021-10-19T21:11:17] Mirono escooters: Rusty motor follow up #69 All rust is gone Now there's a paste thing on the groove between magnets My best bet is its tiny magnets pieces that corroded Don't want in motor No idea how I will remove them all😂😂 It's a paste sticking kinda wel
[2021-10-19T21:11:24] Mirono escooters: Patience and beer

[2021-10-19T23:31:30] Happy Giraffe: Maybe project for Francois D.
[2021-10-20T07:59:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it would cost more than buying one. and without the proper material, high fail chance 😅
[2021-10-20T17:06:26] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-20T17:07:25] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-10-20T17:07:43] Mirono escooters: Considering flipsky was 60€ before anything happened That's quite unbeatabel
[2021-10-20T17:07:49] Mirono escooters: And still working 😂
[2021-10-20T17:08:01] Mirono escooters: After I fix my other scoot I will mod that vesc
[2021-10-20T17:08:22] Happy Giraffe: That 2 month warranty scares me
[2021-10-20T17:08:41] Mirono escooters: 🤷‍♂️
[2021-10-20T17:08:51] Happy Giraffe: As they sell from china, eu laws dont apply I guess
[2021-10-20T17:08:54] Mirono escooters: Yeps
[2021-10-20T17:09:06] Mirono escooters: Even your spintend could say go fck urself
[2021-10-20T17:09:33] Artem Bulashev: Yet there is not a single case we heard of
[2021-10-20T17:10:13] Artem Bulashev: Apple is US based company with best customer support, but even they will say fuck or if there is any reason to do that
[2021-10-20T17:10:30] Artem Bulashev: I have experienced that personally
[2021-10-20T17:10:48] Artem Bulashev: And I have experienced them being amazing many more times
[2021-10-20T17:11:03] Artem Bulashev: So thats universal, not China based thing
[2021-10-20T17:11:09] Mirono escooters: I kno
[2021-10-20T17:11:27] Artem Bulashev: If you prepare your argument correctly you can get out of jail almost every time with. Any decent company
[2021-10-20T17:11:48] Artem Bulashev: Apple failed me because I failed to prep my device correctly to match the story
[2021-10-20T17:11:49] Mirono escooters: Sadly yep
[2021-10-20T17:11:53] Mirono escooters: Too powerful
[2021-10-20T17:12:20] Artem Bulashev: All I had to do is clean it well and not run to apple store with pc under light rain
[2021-10-20T17:12:42] Mirono escooters: 😂🙈
[2021-10-20T17:12:47] Mirono escooters: Fuck apple
[2021-10-20T17:12:52] Artem Bulashev: Even rain had no effect on it
[2021-10-20T17:13:14] Artem Bulashev: Issue came half a year before and accured multiple times over that period
[2021-10-20T17:13:29] Artem Bulashev: 🤷‍♂️ neh it was my mistake
[2021-10-20T17:14:46] Mirono escooters: Still fck apple
[2021-10-20T17:14:51] Mirono escooters: Apart from story
[2021-10-20T17:22:40] Happy Giraffe: Apple will sell you a 1000€ motherboard swap repair when your display cable is broken😂
[2021-10-20T17:23:38] Happy Giraffe: Did you guys hear EU administration listened directly to Louis Rossmann?
[2021-10-20T17:24:05] Mirono escooters: 💚
[2021-10-20T17:24:07] Happy Giraffe: Thats a win for every nerd in this chat
[2021-10-20T17:24:14] Mirono escooters: Finally listiening
[2021-10-20T17:24:35] Happy Giraffe: Finally EU does something useful
[2021-10-20T17:24:37] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-20T17:27:23] Mirono escooters: 😂
[2021-10-20T17:33:47] Artem Bulashev: Lol haha
[2021-10-20T17:34:41] Artem Bulashev: True they may will sell you what ever replacement will fix the issue. Even if it is entire motherboard when technically ribbon cable could be fixed :))
[2021-10-20T17:40:42] Happy Giraffe: And in all laptops + macs cpu is soldered in...
[2021-10-20T17:41:11] Happy Giraffe: I yesterday upgraded my CPU in my PC, plug and play lmao
[2021-10-20T18:18:58] Artem Bulashev: Do you know why?
[2021-10-20T18:21:41] Artem Bulashev: Because - mount for it would take another 3mm of hight - would move integrated memory about 200% further away - would abstracts the airflow - increase price substantially - potentially take away space for other components like better speakers and bigger battery That is why apple new m1 pro and max now can add all those ports and decrease Battery size by 20%, while archiving longer battery life - all thanks for shrinkage of every computer parts footprint ✅
[2021-10-20T18:38:56] Happy Giraffe: I mean in iMacs its soldered aswell😂
[2021-10-20T18:39:14] Mirono escooters: Dell for the win
[2021-10-20T18:39:16] Happy Giraffe: M1 is SoC so not comparable to PC world anyways
[2021-10-20T18:39:25] Happy Giraffe: The shittiest company ever😂
[2021-10-20T18:39:34] Mirono escooters: Why?
[2021-10-20T18:39:55] Mirono escooters: I've always been happy with em
[2021-10-20T18:39:56] Happy Giraffe: Nothing good has ever come from them
[2021-10-20T18:40:06] Happy Giraffe: But this is too off topic
[2021-10-20T18:40:16] Mirono escooters: My dad's job had them for 3 years Now hp They Say noticable more proboemos
[2021-10-20T18:40:22] Mirono escooters: Got 3 dell laptops AlL 3 so good

[2021-10-20T18:41:00] Happy Giraffe: Build your own desktop and you never have problems

[2021-10-20T21:03:14] Mirono escooters: Mostly overpriced
[2021-10-20T21:03:14] Happy Giraffe: Think again after seeing that video

[2021-10-20T21:42:07] Happy Giraffe: Is DHL eCommerce and 4px the same or?
[2021-10-20T21:43:10] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2021-10-20T21:43:22] Mirono escooters: 4px is a collab of something
[2021-10-20T21:45:07] Happy Giraffe: Spintend said they send DHL eCommerce but I see 4px...😅
[2021-10-20T21:45:34] Mirono escooters: I hope for u
[2021-10-21T09:26:01] Artem Bulashev: And new MacBook Pro with m1 max 64gb is more powerful and faster than almost any full size PC even with top processor and 3080 ti graphic cars if I did my math correctly based of apples numbers are close to the truth when they measured the compare vs Radeon Pro 5600M (if true than real world compare will be M1 max being similar to about level of Radeon 3080 PC 🤣 but in 17mm and 2.2 kg 😂 that is bloody insane

[2021-10-21T10:54:13] Mirono escooters: Not mine sadly 🙈
[2021-10-21T10:54:21] Mirono escooters: Im still trying to find a project
[2021-10-21T10:54:23] Artem Bulashev: 👍
[2021-10-21T10:54:34] S1m 0n: The next Speedrunner ? 😬
[2021-10-21T10:54:42] Artem Bulashev: I didn’t want to say but that battery looks like fire starter
[2021-10-21T10:54:44] Artem Bulashev: 🤪
[2021-10-21T10:54:55] Mirono escooters: Not mine ;)
[2021-10-21T10:54:58] Artem Bulashev: Since it is not yours will say :))
[2021-10-21T10:55:34] Artem Bulashev: Nami, front wheel looks so small?
[2021-10-21T10:56:16] S1m 0n: Yes 🤣.. its a hot wheel 🏎️
[2021-10-21T10:56:27] Artem Bulashev: I mean this looks stupid to me 😂
[2021-10-21T10:56:36] Happy Giraffe: Bomb battery
[2021-10-21T10:57:25] Mirono escooters: 😂 looks sketchy the very least
[2021-10-21T10:57:32] Mirono escooters: Wtf is thuis

[2021-10-21T10:58:17] Happy Giraffe: Pls no😂
[2021-10-21T10:59:58] Artem Bulashev: Also his steering is like lower than his belt line !
[2021-10-21T11:00:20] Artem Bulashev: Is that even a nami ? Surely looks like it is
[2021-10-21T11:00:57] Artem Bulashev: Oh it is not!!
[2021-10-21T11:02:24] Mirono escooters: Those ppl ruin it for us lol
[2021-10-21T11:02:28] S1m 0n: What is Nami? Cant translate this

[2021-10-21T11:04:46] Artem Bulashev: Yeap. Intensity roads are 90kmh -100kmh limit, drive there 😕 but not on highway lol
[2021-10-21T11:05:47] Artem Bulashev: Nami use VESC controllers as well of their own design 👌 so not an off topic ;-)
[2021-10-21T11:06:09] Mirono escooters: 💚
[2021-10-21T11:06:50] S1m 0n: in Germany such a scooter will remain an eternal dream
[2021-10-21T11:07:46] Happy Giraffe: Would love to get on hand of those vescs
[2021-10-21T11:09:07] Mirono escooters: Catch me first
[2021-10-21T11:09:34] Ralf Halbknapp: It is a Nami but with modofied front parts
[2021-10-21T11:09:59] Happy Giraffe: This was good tactic until we are judged by the laws as 15/16 yo
[2021-10-21T11:10:14] Artem Bulashev: Unlikely - stem is double - front suspention is different
[2021-10-21T11:10:26] Ralf Halbknapp: I have them here. And I would love to be able to get to the settings inside, only a fraction is available in the settings of the display used
[2021-10-21T11:11:02] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1312@21-10-2021_11-11-02.jpg>
[2021-10-21T11:11:17] Happy Giraffe: That's cool! Do you have any pictures?
[2021-10-21T11:11:17] Artem Bulashev: Not sure why would any one modify Nami that way :)
[2021-10-21T11:11:19] Ralf Halbknapp: Modified front parts. That is a one of a kind modding project of fluid freeride new York
[2021-10-21T11:11:31] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok
[2021-10-21T11:11:33] Artem Bulashev: Thanks
[2021-10-21T11:11:42] Ralf Halbknapp: To check if that is any better or not
[2021-10-21T11:12:00] Artem Bulashev: Ok :) front wheel looks stupid this way 😅😅
[2021-10-21T11:12:02] Ralf Halbknapp: It probably has benefits and drawbacks
[2021-10-21T11:12:28] Ralf Halbknapp: You can come over and try the original 😉
[2021-10-21T11:12:37] Happy Giraffe: Front mudguard definitely serves no purpose haha
[2021-10-21T11:12:58] Artem Bulashev: Wonder what’s the point, isn’t Nami like nearly perfect as it is ?
[2021-10-21T11:13:28] Ralf Halbknapp: I could tell you in detail but not sure if that is of interest for all others here
[2021-10-21T11:14:34] Artem Bulashev: 😜😜 I had 39.5 fiver last night so need to get better first and than would love to absolutely to meet up 😊
[2021-10-21T11:14:38] Mirono escooters: Fuk
[2021-10-21T11:14:39] Ralf Halbknapp: In short the original suspension and stem Design is very comfortable and also a bit flexible. Double stem fork would be a bit less of both. Original with better tires and steering damper is really almost perfect.
[2021-10-21T11:15:05] Mirono escooters: I know good small roafs they cant follow Knowing my scooter it will prob die the moment i flee awat
[2021-10-21T11:15:47] Artem Bulashev: Understood 👌👍
[2021-10-21T11:15:57] Ralf Halbknapp: That is my impression as well. Not sure if I would want to risk dying 😄

[2021-10-21T11:33:08] Happy Giraffe: 12volt 3 amp...manufacturer had to loan it to him as its only 500mm fan in the world atm😂
[2021-10-21T11:41:29] Ralf Halbknapp: I assume it is just uncommon for computer fans but may not be uncommon for industry fans
[2021-10-21T11:52:41] Mirono escooters: so now i have the wheelway sensors lol, is it bcs of sensors or bcs of motor it doesnt work w xiaomi contoller? if i put the sensors in for example 350w gen1?
[2021-10-21T11:52:43] Happy Giraffe: I think this size is closer to air condition fans haha
[2021-10-21T11:53:09] Happy Giraffe: Sensor angle maybe, idk
[2021-10-21T11:53:40] Happy Giraffe: Not possible to drive without vesc
[2021-10-21T11:53:41] Mirono escooters: I dont have a 1000w to check
[2021-10-21T11:55:45] Unknown: The new flipsky? How does it work out let us know 😂
[2021-10-21T11:56:59] Mirono escooters: Not mine
[2021-10-21T11:58:06] Unknown: Damn
[2021-10-21T12:11:24] Mirono escooters: Dont have a scooter for it
[2021-10-21T12:29:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Wait, where does it come from ? Nami uses VESC controller ? Are you sure ?
[2021-10-21T12:34:53] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-10-21T12:34:58] Artem Bulashev: Of their own design
[2021-10-21T12:35:08] Artem Bulashev: But it is on VESC software
[2021-10-21T12:50:41] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1313@21-10-2021_12-50-41.jpg>
[2021-10-21T13:00:51] Happy Giraffe: 40A version of this type controller would be nice
[2021-10-21T13:01:27] Mirono escooters: Flipsky one ig :)
[2021-10-21T13:01:31] Artem Bulashev: There is but 2 times bigger
[2021-10-21T13:01:36] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-10-21T13:01:39] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-21T13:02:09] Happy Giraffe: Single ubox Vesc really compacy for its power then
[2021-10-21T13:02:16] Artem Bulashev: Also why if you have FlipSky VESC almost exactly like that but 40amp capable
[2021-10-21T13:02:52] Mirono escooters: Yesss
[2021-10-21T13:03:02] Mirono escooters: And flipsky display or the one from lord @koxx3
[2021-10-21T13:03:15] Artem Bulashev: Oh yea of course try find even one normal square wave controller in that size and capable of such currents
[2021-10-21T13:04:39] Mirono escooters: Anyone kno other vesc comatible displats?
[2021-10-21T13:05:51] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 display is best and adds a lot of options
[2021-10-21T13:06:02] Artem Bulashev: Also looks best for scooters
[2021-10-21T13:06:24] Mirono escooters: But 150€?🙈
[2021-10-21T13:06:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Damn, I had a Nami, if only I knew :/
[2021-10-21T13:07:33] Artem Bulashev: you can’t use VESC tool to set up. It is proprietary. They took VESC code and designed custom code and custom hardware
[2021-10-21T13:07:56] Artem Bulashev: It’s not your timypical VESC, but it was built on VESC code originally

[2021-10-21T14:42:54] Mirono escooters: When i get mine i will
[2021-10-21T14:45:49] Artem Bulashev: 😆
[2021-10-21T15:21:16] Ralf Halbknapp: How do you know that?
[2021-10-21T15:24:19] Ralf Halbknapp: For me the only clue about Nami was that it has field weakening for higher possible top speed as an option and normal sinewave controllers can't do that as far as I know, only FOC capable ones.
[2021-10-21T15:25:23] Ralf Halbknapp: But did not know it was based on Vesc (and I can tell you that the designer of the Nami also does not know - but he is not the designer of the Controller itself).
[2021-10-21T15:31:30] Artem Bulashev: First of all Nami state that is FOC on website
[2021-10-21T15:33:24] Artem Bulashev: And about VESC based code it came up long time ago when it was in development stage way before releases.
[2021-10-21T15:36:28] Artem Bulashev: There was huge thread on one of the forums that went on for long time about it and after all in chat it came up one or so that it will go into Nami. I think it has been pulled since than and no really disclosed. They modified VESC code substantially from what I see, and just like VESC next update (available in Beta) supports field weakening
[2021-10-21T16:42:42] Unknown: What can cause vesc to randomly shut off at throttle?
[2021-10-21T16:44:29] Mirono escooters: Batt cutting off
[2021-10-21T16:47:06] Unknown: It's def not the batt cutting off
[2021-10-21T16:47:11] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2021-10-21T16:47:15] Mirono escooters: Temperature?
[2021-10-21T16:47:36] Unknown: It just stops.. and when i stop it shutts off after like 3 seconds
[2021-10-21T16:47:44] Unknown: Temp impossible, cold start
[2021-10-21T16:49:27] Mirono escooters: Bad contact?
[2021-10-21T16:50:06] Unknown: No clue i'm gonna open the bottom in like half an hour fuck this shit 😒tired as hell and need it for work tomorrow
[2021-10-21T16:50:41] Mirono escooters: Maybe wotter
[2021-10-21T16:51:25] Unknown: I hope not but then again, with water should'nt it completely quit instead of just being able to start and go again
[2021-10-21T19:29:37] Artem Bulashev: Def not temp temp cut off is very gradual and soft
[2021-10-21T20:30:07] Unknown: <video_file>
[2021-10-21T20:30:10] Unknown: Wiring is all good idk
[2021-10-21T20:30:11] Unknown: Pff
[2021-10-21T20:34:00] Mirono escooters: Cool powa button
[2021-10-21T20:38:48] Unknown: Cooler if it'd work :l came with vesc btw T from trampa
[2021-10-21T20:44:33] Artem Bulashev: What is that remote? 😅😅
[2021-10-21T20:44:49] Artem Bulashev: How is it controlling VESC?
[2021-10-21T20:45:05] Unknown: Ppm
[2021-10-21T20:45:11] Artem Bulashev: Does received use 3.3 or 5v ?
[2021-10-21T20:45:17] Artem Bulashev: Logic
[2021-10-21T20:45:22] Unknown: 5 max
[2021-10-21T20:45:37] Unknown: It has worked like this over 2 months
[2021-10-21T20:45:39] Unknown: No probs
[2021-10-21T20:46:10] Unknown: Started using it when adc broke on me and adc broke after like 100km almoast got 500 now
[2021-10-21T20:46:13] Artem Bulashev: If ppm than it is not relavent
[2021-10-21T20:46:28] Artem Bulashev: 1 Ppm is 1mv from 2.5v
[2021-10-21T20:46:33] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-10-21T20:46:33] Unknown: Oh
[2021-10-21T20:46:37] Artem Bulashev: No problem there
[2021-10-21T20:46:55] Artem Bulashev: Some people use adc 5v line when you can’t use above 3.3v
[2021-10-21T20:46:56] Unknown: I placed new sensors recently
[2021-10-21T20:47:08] Artem Bulashev: Try to log to your phone
[2021-10-21T20:47:15] Unknown: Where can i log?
[2021-10-21T20:47:16] Artem Bulashev: Or computer even over usb
[2021-10-21T20:47:21] Unknown: I het no fault codes
[2021-10-21T20:47:30] Unknown: Since it shuts off and disconnecr
[2021-10-21T20:49:15] Unknown: Oh think i found it, i'll log it
[2021-10-21T21:05:14] Unknown: <files/2021-10-21_21-01-15.csv>
[2021-10-21T22:35:05] Artem Bulashev: I’m on my phone can’t look at it
[2021-10-21T22:35:14] Artem Bulashev: Did you find something ?
[2021-10-21T22:35:32] Unknown: No faults or anything
[2021-10-21T22:35:40] Artem Bulashev: Does connection you phone get lost when your button shuts off?
[2021-10-21T22:36:04] Unknown: Yes because vesc resets
[2021-10-21T22:36:32] Unknown: If im driving the light keeps on burning, but vesc shuts off for a very small second
[2021-10-21T22:36:45] Unknown: So i lose connection indeed
[2021-10-21T22:37:26] Artem Bulashev: It does it only on regen?
[2021-10-21T22:37:51] Unknown: Might try and disconnect the sensors tomorrow and rerun foc, last thing happening to it was replacing hall board, last weekend
[2021-10-21T22:37:53] Artem Bulashev: Which VESC is it?
[2021-10-21T22:38:01] Unknown: Trampa mk6 and no
[2021-10-21T22:38:06] Unknown: Throttle or regen
[2021-10-21T22:38:12] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-10-21T22:38:19] Artem Bulashev: Sucks
[2021-10-21T22:38:27] Artem Bulashev: Not cheap one as well
[2021-10-21T22:38:28] Unknown: If i drive over a bump sometimes it happens, sometimes it does not
[2021-10-21T22:38:41] Artem Bulashev: Sounds like solder ball short circuite
[2021-10-21T22:38:48] Unknown: If i give alot of throttle it dies out
[2021-10-21T22:39:00] Artem Bulashev: Try to replicate it at home
[2021-10-21T22:39:06] Artem Bulashev: Without throttle or breaking
[2021-10-21T22:39:18] Artem Bulashev: Just like jump and hit scooter around
[2021-10-21T22:39:31] Unknown: Doesnt happen then
[2021-10-21T22:39:32] Artem Bulashev: Kick it in different directions
[2021-10-21T22:39:37] Artem Bulashev: Drive it into the wall
[2021-10-21T22:39:41] Unknown: Lol
[2021-10-21T22:39:43] Artem Bulashev: Joking
[2021-10-21T22:39:47] Unknown: Hahaha
[2021-10-21T22:39:47] Artem Bulashev: But you get the point
[2021-10-21T22:40:03] Unknown: Yes i tried that, didnt do anything
[2021-10-21T22:40:06] Artem Bulashev: Try down hill off-road without throttle or break
[2021-10-21T22:40:13] Artem Bulashev: That’s last resort
[2021-10-21T22:40:42] Artem Bulashev: If nothing than it is not mechanical and electrical issue (noise contamination) likely
[2021-10-21T22:40:52] Artem Bulashev: How are your breaks connected ?
[2021-10-21T22:40:57] Unknown: Only when driving, its somewhere on current orso since i have to be driving, and if i get it to got and build up really slow it works almoast
[2021-10-21T22:41:04] Unknown: Also over ppm
[2021-10-21T22:41:07] Artem Bulashev: Break is 3 wire version
[2021-10-21T22:41:09] Unknown: Its 2way
[2021-10-21T22:41:11] Artem Bulashev: Oh not adc
[2021-10-21T22:41:20] Unknown: No need a new adc board haha
[2021-10-21T22:41:29] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-10-21T22:41:41] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-10-21T22:41:48] Artem Bulashev: I’m puzzled
[2021-10-21T22:41:55] Happy Giraffe: Dont...dont...
[2021-10-21T22:42:06] Unknown: Might just contact trampa, gonna try sensorless tommorow and hook it up the laptop
[2021-10-21T22:42:07] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1221@10-10-2021_15-33-31.jpg>
[2021-10-21T22:42:08] Artem Bulashev: Already established it is unlikely
[2021-10-21T22:42:21] Unknown: See if i get something that way
[2021-10-21T22:42:25] Happy Giraffe: Haha, I was reading older messages first
[2021-10-21T22:42:43] Artem Bulashev: Yeah try remove hall connectors and any other you don’t need like light and horn if you are using it
[2021-10-21T22:43:04] Unknown: Nope it's really basic for the moment haha
[2021-10-21T22:43:13] Unknown: Lights will get a seperate batt
[2021-10-21T22:51:04] Unknown: <photos/photo_1319@21-10-2021_22-51-04.jpg>

[2021-10-21T22:51:15] Unknown: <photos/photo_1321@21-10-2021_22-51-15.jpg>
[2021-10-21T22:51:27] Unknown: Thats one list
[2021-10-21T22:51:44] Unknown: <photos/photo_1322@21-10-2021_22-51-44.jpg>
[2021-10-21T22:51:44] Unknown: <photos/photo_1323@21-10-2021_22-51-44.jpg>
[2021-10-21T22:51:44] Unknown: <photos/photo_1324@21-10-2021_22-51-44.jpg>
[2021-10-21T22:52:46] Unknown: There's neg currents as i pushes myself backwards to get higher throttles
[2021-10-22T19:30:54] Artem Bulashev: I see max draw 5amps
[2021-10-22T19:30:58] Artem Bulashev: Nothing crazy
[2021-10-22T19:31:05] Artem Bulashev: Nothing out of the ordenary
[2021-10-22T19:31:52] Unknown: Idd no faults either, tomorrow i'll redo foc just in case and check, if not disconnect halls and see, if not i will hookup to laptop and hope it can find an error that way
[2021-10-22T19:32:00] Artem Bulashev: And phase amps 35-44a at most. Odd a bit. If you give full throttle it should give max phase amps set in settings. Unless you give too short of a throttle bleep
[2021-10-22T19:32:35] Unknown: I only gave short throttle bleeps as it cuts out inmeadietly most of the time then
[2021-10-22T19:32:50] Unknown: As you see sometimes it does not quit, but then the next jump it poof gone
[2021-10-22T19:35:14] Artem Bulashev: Yeah go for disconnecting hall sensing wires and try again
[2021-10-22T19:35:59] Artem Bulashev: I bet it is a mess up in hall wiring that send MCU reset
[2021-10-22T19:44:00] Unknown: I connected my halls exactly the same way it was before, maybe it too far away from the stator and rubbed some short on the motor shell orso i'll check in case disconnecting helps
[2021-10-22T21:45:27] Happy Giraffe: Took week to leave china lol, thats fast on their scale it seems
[2021-10-22T21:46:26] Unknown: Lol
[2021-10-22T22:48:48] Artem Bulashev: Holly shit m1 max out performed 3080 laptop version almost in every test, while it is not even running native bench testing software 😂 and all of that consuming using about half the watts and not even having fans on 😄😄😄 fckn magic no less
[2021-10-22T22:49:41] Happy Giraffe: Its technically very impressive but it costs the same😅
[2021-10-22T22:50:15] Artem Bulashev: Actually cost less than similar spec windows lap top :))
[2021-10-22T22:50:30] Happy Giraffe: 3-4k€
[2021-10-22T22:50:37] Mirono escooters: Finally innovating not copying 5 y later and calling it new
[2021-10-22T22:51:10] Happy Giraffe: But this is good news so I get my next AMD cpu cheaper as competition goes again
[2021-10-22T22:51:23] Artem Bulashev: Also cpu test put perform almost all server grade cpus on the market so there is no cpu windows alternative for laptop or even deck top 🤣🤣 it beat all intel abs and deck top cpus 😂😂😂😂
[2021-10-22T22:51:51] Happy Giraffe: I will wait for proper tests
[2021-10-22T22:51:53] Artem Bulashev: INSANE 😄😄 fun year ahead lol
[2021-10-22T22:52:25] Artem Bulashev: Imagine what stress is happening now in headquarters of intel and amd
[2021-10-22T22:52:34] Happy Giraffe: It will be a beast in final cut rendering
[2021-10-22T22:52:49] Happy Giraffe: Yep lol
[2021-10-22T22:53:34] Happy Giraffe: I hope apple doesnt try hard to make it useless like iPad pros
[2021-10-22T22:53:43] Happy Giraffe: All the power but limited by software
[2021-10-22T22:53:55] Happy Giraffe: And disabling functions
[2021-10-22T22:56:01] Artem Bulashev: Watched this video of guy playing all different games through emulation and fps is not bad for 13 inch m1 laptop 😅 https://youtu.be/Gz8Aj-6nb08 if any one is interested (main limitation is that emulator can only use 50% of ram, and max is 8gb, so 4gb) So m1 pro even cheapest will perform amazing for very good price relatevely speaking to pc laptops in same price category :))
[2021-10-22T22:56:19] Artem Bulashev: I know off topic :)) but tech savvy had to share 😂
[2021-10-22T22:58:08] Artem Bulashev: 3080 graphic card in 2.2kg laptop and power draw of 80w vs 165w 😆 jjjj
[2021-10-22T22:58:32] Happy Giraffe: M1 was 1030-1050 performance
[2021-10-22T22:58:59] Happy Giraffe: New chips beef up the gpu multiple times so let's see
[2021-10-23T14:38:35] Unknown: Turns out to be a sensor problem 🤷‍♂️
[2021-10-23T14:38:53] Unknown: Vesc could'nt even finish foc with sensor plugged
[2021-10-23T14:41:52] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2021-10-23T14:42:06] Happy Giraffe: Wheelway 10/10 would buy again
[2021-10-23T14:55:46] Mirono escooters: Again??
[2021-10-23T15:05:15] Happy Giraffe: Wheelway never sent their sensors to me either
[2021-10-23T15:05:25] Mirono escooters: .._.
[2021-10-23T15:05:26] Happy Giraffe: Promised but didn't do shit
[2021-10-23T15:05:39] Happy Giraffe: Scam store, never ever buy from them
[2021-10-23T15:05:46] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-10-23T15:05:48] Mirono escooters: I wont
[2021-10-23T15:55:26] Artem Bulashev: Check wiring to be correct
[2021-10-23T15:55:26] Artem Bulashev: At be you have phase sensor signal wire going into wrong pin for example
[2021-10-23T15:55:26] Artem Bulashev: Or ground and sensor swapped
[2021-10-23T18:52:01] Unknown: Nope checked the connections twice, connected phase in the right order, wich should not even matter that much for vesc, but it was all good
[2021-10-23T18:52:13] Unknown: Worked for like 20km fine though 😂
[2021-10-23T18:52:36] Unknown: Said it before, they sent 10 boards with shitsensors to make sure i do 200km
[2021-10-23T18:52:40] Unknown: Fuck halls
[2021-10-23T18:52:52] Unknown: I'll get a new motor in a while haha
[2021-10-23T20:38:30] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2021-10-23T20:39:43] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2021-10-23T20:47:47] Unknown: I can try them out bur you would mean that for example Yellow yellow phase A Blue blue phase B Green green phase C Pos and neg connected corrent correct. But could be for example Yellow blue A Blue green B Green yellow C?
[2021-10-23T20:48:01] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-10-23T21:24:53] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know what you mean by color of wire. It’s irrelevant. I mean that A hall signal line is connected to Can line or ADC pin or Ic2 pin instead of hall sensor signal line pin on VESC
[2021-10-23T21:56:23] Unknown: Oh, no the wires are directly connected to a seperate hallport
[2021-10-23T21:57:19] Unknown: <photos/photo_1327@23-10-2021_21-57-19.jpg>
[2021-10-23T21:57:49] Unknown: Blue is hall port red is comm port
[2021-10-23T22:23:00] Happy Giraffe: There you only have to figure H1-3
[2021-10-23T22:23:14] Happy Giraffe: Red and black is same everywhere I hope😅
[2021-10-23T22:23:39] Happy Giraffe: Put hall in same order and done
[2021-10-23T22:27:07] Happy Giraffe: If this pic helps anything
[2021-10-23T22:27:57] Unknown: I did in the same order
[2021-10-23T22:28:08] Happy Giraffe: Black=middle Red=right Yellow=left side of middle sensor Blue=left side of left sensor Green=left side of right sensor
[2021-10-23T22:30:28] Unknown: Yea i see what you mean but the hall board has A B C +- And i connected it as Green Blue Yellow Red Black While phase is connected as A green B blue C yellow
[2021-10-23T22:30:52] Unknown: So it lines up from A to A, B to B and C to C
[2021-10-23T22:31:02] Happy Giraffe: Thats good
[2021-10-23T22:31:13] Happy Giraffe: And you put colored in the left pin of 3?
[2021-10-23T22:31:28] Happy Giraffe: Middle pin is ground and right is 5v
[2021-10-23T22:31:38] Unknown: Of the sensors?
[2021-10-23T22:31:48] Happy Giraffe: Yes, 3 pins
[2021-10-23T22:32:02] Unknown: I did not change sensors yet
[2021-10-23T22:32:12] Unknown: I placed an entire hall board
[2021-10-23T22:32:22] Unknown: <photos/photo_1329@23-10-2021_22-32-22.jpg>
[2021-10-23T22:32:23] Happy Giraffe: It didnt come witt sensors?
[2021-10-23T22:32:39] Happy Giraffe: Then you replaced everything
[2021-10-23T22:32:51] Mirono escooters: Change sensors
[2021-10-23T22:32:52] Unknown: The complete board yup
[2021-10-23T22:32:56] Unknown: And i will haha
[2021-10-23T22:33:00] Happy Giraffe: If you didnt cut the sensor away lol
[2021-10-23T22:34:36] Unknown: Try a diff board with 41FF 43FF 41FF And if it does'nt work i try otherwise 43 / 41 / 43 Or tripple 41/43 (with i 180° flipped in the middle)
[2021-10-23T22:35:08] Happy Giraffe: It should work if you pull out board with wires and sensor and replace everything
[2021-10-23T22:35:15] Happy Giraffe: Its what they sent to you lol
[2021-10-23T22:36:18] Unknown: Yup, well it did not
[2021-10-23T22:37:28] Happy Giraffe: Oh shit lmao
[2021-10-23T22:37:46] Happy Giraffe: Are the sensors even same?😅
[2021-10-23T22:38:08] Happy Giraffe: Maybe you have broken sensor and I have broken board then😂
[2021-10-23T22:40:53] Unknown: No the sensors are different named then i posted originally on the wheelway sensor biard
[2021-10-23T22:40:59] Unknown: Board*
[2021-10-23T22:41:38] Unknown: But same coloured i did notice the original had 60 on the back and this one has 90 on the back
[2021-10-23T22:42:15] Unknown: Tought it would've been degrees but it worked perfectly
[2021-10-23T22:43:25] Unknown: If it was a different degree sensor it should'nt work i think? Or work but sound like its getting raped by ele ctricity
[2021-10-23T23:06:30] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-23T23:07:19] Happy Giraffe: 5kg lasagna going into oven😎 (Having no vesc gives depression to fight against)

[2021-10-24T12:07:44] Artem Bulashev: Sure problem I not the VESC ? 😅
[2021-10-24T12:08:09] Happy Giraffe: That's been working good for him?
[2021-10-24T12:09:42] Mirono escooters: Worked fine :)
[2021-10-24T12:14:02] Happy Giraffe: That's cool
[2021-10-24T16:03:20] Unknown: Can xiaomi stock chargeport/ wiring handle 3.2- 3.3 amp max?
[2021-10-24T16:03:35] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-10-24T16:03:57] Unknown: 👌
[2021-10-24T16:26:06] Artem Bulashev: GX16 is 5amp rated
[2021-10-24T16:27:18] Mirono escooters: Yea I run 4
[2021-10-24T16:27:21] Artem Bulashev: I decided to switch it for GX16 4 pin version and use 2 for power and 2 for ground (pin size is same diameter as 2 and 3 pin versions) This should allow use single plug for 6-8amp charging safely
[2021-10-24T16:27:26] Mirono escooters: I went with thiccer cables tho. Poor jst
[2021-10-24T16:27:33] Mirono escooters: That's smart!!
[2021-10-24T16:40:15] Happy Giraffe: You might wanna test the temp of the connector before, or change to xt30
[2021-10-24T16:41:16] Happy Giraffe: Problem is not connector outside and not the wires. Its the thin jst
[2021-10-24T16:41:32] Mirono escooters: I replaced jst
[2021-10-24T16:41:37] Mirono escooters: It's not too good xd
[2021-10-24T16:42:10] Happy Giraffe: He has to do aswell, jst becomes hot at 2.5A already
[2021-10-24T16:42:30] Mirono escooters: Yepq
[2021-10-24T16:42:35] Mirono escooters: Xt30 gang
[2021-10-24T16:42:39] Happy Giraffe: If it doesn't melt it's still unnecessary heat and electricity loss
[2021-10-24T16:42:44] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2021-10-24T16:42:51] Mirono escooters: Same why I use xt60 on 30a things
[2021-10-24T16:43:24] Artem Bulashev: Problem is very much a connector
[2021-10-24T16:43:36] Artem Bulashev: It is a hollow thin tin metal
[2021-10-24T16:43:45] Happy Giraffe: Exactly, dog shit
[2021-10-24T16:43:55] Artem Bulashev: It has high resistance and heats up like heater with little amp
[2021-10-24T16:44:32] Mirono escooters: I tested 1 at 4a
[2021-10-24T16:44:36] Mirono escooters: (Ok a cheap China one)
[2021-10-24T16:44:41] Mirono escooters: Started melting
[2021-10-24T16:45:03] Mirono escooters: My minidrones flew on this🙈🙈
[2021-10-24T16:45:11] Happy Giraffe: Yes, this is why I say 3A absolute max with stock port. And prefer changing xt30
[2021-10-24T16:45:44] Happy Giraffe: Enjoy a vesc build of a YouTuber
[2021-10-24T16:46:21] Happy Giraffe: Horrible welding job with frame and horrible battery making
[2021-10-24T16:46:42] Mirono escooters: Waste of batteries
[2021-10-24T16:46:52] Mirono escooters: What the fok is that wheel
[2021-10-24T16:46:54] Mirono escooters: 2 tires???
[2021-10-24T16:47:15] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, dual tire lmao
[2021-10-24T16:56:57] Artem Bulashev: Dual wheel welded I suppose
[2021-10-24T16:57:29] Happy Giraffe: Two rims welded together lol
[2021-10-24T16:57:56] Happy Giraffe: Ill give ya link
[2021-10-24T16:58:32] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/L_6SOl4uT8k
[2021-10-24T16:58:35] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-24T17:00:17] Happy Giraffe: Welding job is worse than when I welded for first time in school, doesn't even clean surfaces before weld🙈🙈🙈🙈
[2021-10-24T17:00:35] Mirono escooters: Smol motor
[2021-10-24T17:01:07] Happy Giraffe: All flipsky build aswell, so everything in this is fucked😂
[2021-10-24T17:04:49] Mirono escooters: My flipsly works fine :)
[2021-10-24T20:39:19] Unknown: I cut off the jst, i bridged the wires close to my pos and neg on bms/batt
[2021-10-24T20:39:35] Unknown: Works fine, it's temporairy
[2021-10-24T20:55:00] Happy Giraffe: Why not just put xt30 there?👀
[2021-10-24T20:56:18] Unknown: Because i dont have a way to make it fit that hole yet and i have to work all week 😂 so i'll be doing that possibly next week
[2021-10-24T20:56:35] Happy Giraffe: Nooooo
[2021-10-24T20:57:15] Happy Giraffe: The charge port has two wires coming to inside, put xt30 on them and then another xt30 on the cable leading to bms/batt
[2021-10-24T20:57:56] Happy Giraffe: Male port on charge port and female on batt cable
[2021-10-24T20:58:18] Happy Giraffe: Exactly same than the jst but xt30
[2021-10-24T20:59:45] Unknown: Oh i could do that too, the plan was more to use like idk 14-16 awg and make an xt30 fit nicely in the chargeport directly and put an xt30 on my charger aswell
[2021-10-24T21:01:46] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, awg 16/18 will be nice for that
[2021-10-24T21:02:05] Happy Giraffe: 14 is overkill as you will never need more charging speed than that😅
[2021-10-24T21:02:26] Unknown: Idd i dont need thick wires at all
[2021-10-24T21:02:28] Happy Giraffe: My bottleneck is the charging cable wire coming from wall now lol
[2021-10-24T21:02:39] Unknown: My 3a charger goes up to 3.3
[2021-10-24T21:02:58] Happy Giraffe: My 3A goes 2.4 😂
[2021-10-24T21:03:06] Unknown: Lol 😂
[2021-10-24T21:04:06] Unknown: I drive from work to my house, about 10km, go to the store and back home wich would be about 7km and back to work the day after
[2021-10-24T21:04:28] Unknown: Then i charge it and at my lunchtime 3 hr later its charged
[2021-10-24T21:05:07] Artem Bulashev: Vsett standard wire for charging is silicon 16awg
[2021-10-24T21:07:09] Artem Bulashev: https://dronelab.se/siliconewire.html
[2021-10-24T21:07:13] Artem Bulashev: Drone
[2021-10-24T21:07:16] Unknown: They use higer amps i though fastchargers up to 4 or 5?
[2021-10-24T21:07:29] Artem Bulashev: Some charts show it over 20cm length
[2021-10-24T21:07:39] Artem Bulashev: 7amps is ok for 28ah
[2021-10-24T21:07:52] Artem Bulashev: But than port is rated 5amp :))
[2021-10-24T21:08:07] Artem Bulashev: But there are 2 ports but each has 16awg
[2021-10-24T21:08:10] Artem Bulashev: Over kill
[2021-10-24T21:12:19] Happy Giraffe: I normally charge 13s6p 35E with 2.4A haha
[2021-10-24T21:12:46] Happy Giraffe: Free electricity and charging overnight in bike cellar
[2021-10-24T21:14:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Already charged for hours at 15A on GX16 😁
[2021-10-24T21:14:42] Unknown: Poor batts
[2021-10-24T21:15:05] Happy Giraffe: I bet he has a crazy batt
[2021-10-24T21:15:07] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂🙃
[2021-10-24T21:15:20] Unknown: What setup?
[2021-10-24T21:15:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Depends, I have many
[2021-10-24T21:15:39] Unknown: For the 15a charging 😂
[2021-10-24T21:15:50] Face de Pin Sucé: But 16S6P 50E, used to charge at 15-20A very often
[2021-10-24T21:16:00] Happy Giraffe: Oof
[2021-10-24T21:16:12] Happy Giraffe: F
[2021-10-24T21:16:15] Unknown: F
[2021-10-24T21:16:39] Face de Pin Sucé: And 16S10P molicel, was charging at 20-25 and already did 50A on it, never reached more than 48°C (starting at 23°)
[2021-10-24T21:16:40] Mirono escooters: Does gx16 fit xiaomi port
[2021-10-24T21:16:48] Unknown: 🙈👀
[2021-10-24T21:17:01] Face de Pin Sucé: But wasn't using gx16 on those ones
[2021-10-24T21:17:22] Unknown: I charge molicel 12s4p at 3.2A
[2021-10-24T21:17:25] Face de Pin Sucé: (well I used 15A on Dualtron Thunder also on one GX16, always fine)
[2021-10-24T21:17:31] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂😂😂😂 why ?
[2021-10-24T21:17:34] Unknown: Regen at max 10A
[2021-10-24T21:17:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahahahaha
[2021-10-24T21:18:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Why having molicel and use it like poor chinese cells ?
[2021-10-24T21:19:05] Unknown: Because molicel makes me feel safe 😂 i know i can torture thel and they'lle like it, but meh, i do 50a discharge 10a charge
[2021-10-24T21:19:06] Artem Bulashev: 15amps through GX16?
[2021-10-24T21:19:17] Artem Bulashev: 3 pin version with one pin not used?
[2021-10-24T21:19:22] Unknown: Bms max at 60a
[2021-10-24T21:19:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-10-24T21:19:33] Happy Giraffe: Slow charging overnight is nice,also balances cells nicely
[2021-10-24T21:19:34] Face de Pin Sucé: And have many friends who does that
[2021-10-24T21:19:46] Face de Pin Sucé: For almost 2 years now
[2021-10-24T21:19:53] Artem Bulashev: Hm interesting why manufacturer rate it 5amps
[2021-10-24T21:20:16] Unknown: I do feel sad that i get voltage drops on the molicels
[2021-10-24T21:20:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Because, maybe for more than 24h it's too much, more than 5A
[2021-10-24T21:20:48] Face de Pin Sucé: But when you charge 35Ah at 15A, well it's only 3h
[2021-10-24T21:21:01] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-10-24T21:21:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe your battery design ? Weird you have voltage drop pulling only 50A on 4P
[2021-10-24T21:21:31] Artem Bulashev: What 0.5c is fast but if you did it like once a two weeks I don’t think you would notice reduction in life cycle
[2021-10-24T21:21:33] Happy Giraffe: Man in a hurry I see
[2021-10-24T21:22:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Never charged less than 10A this battery
[2021-10-24T21:22:11] Face de Pin Sucé: And it has a year now
[2021-10-24T21:22:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Already charged it at 30A
[2021-10-24T21:22:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Can't wait it to charge
[2021-10-24T21:22:40] Unknown: <photos/photo_1129@24-09-2021_22-04-41.jpg>
[2021-10-24T21:23:10] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, looks okay
[2021-10-24T21:23:22] Artem Bulashev: Have discharger - watt count ? Would be interesting to discharge it at 0.1c to check capasity
[2021-10-24T21:23:42] Artem Bulashev: What thickness?
[2021-10-24T21:23:56] Unknown: Think it might be bad nickel idd, 0.15
[2021-10-24T21:24:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes we checked capacity, at 20A, we got 29Ah x)
[2021-10-24T21:24:18] Unknown: Might have to let someone redo that with a descent welder
[2021-10-24T21:24:29] Artem Bulashev: How many mm between series ?
[2021-10-24T21:24:44] Unknown: Hold 1 min
[2021-10-24T21:24:55] Artem Bulashev: No no
[2021-10-24T21:25:19] Unknown: <photos/photo_1334@24-10-2021_21-25-19.jpg>
[2021-10-24T21:25:29] Artem Bulashev: Width of that sections
[2021-10-24T21:26:20] Artem Bulashev: 7.6*4 =30.4mm * 0.15mm=4.56mm2 is the crosssection
[2021-10-24T21:27:32] Unknown: What the hell do you mean by that my best man? 😅
[2021-10-24T21:29:25] Artem Bulashev: This pack is built to carry about 20amps
[2021-10-24T21:29:44] Artem Bulashev: Without voltage sag due to conductor between series
[2021-10-24T21:29:45] Unknown: Oh
[2021-10-24T21:29:58] Artem Bulashev: If it is pure nickel and 0.15mm
[2021-10-24T21:30:12] Unknown: No clue i hope it is
[2021-10-24T21:30:39] Artem Bulashev: How much you pull through?
[2021-10-24T21:31:08] Unknown: I pull 30a max on vesc settings 75a current
[2021-10-24T21:31:25] Unknown: And i dont drive full throttle mostly
[2021-10-24T21:31:28] Artem Bulashev: 75a phase and 30a battery?
[2021-10-24T21:31:39] Unknown: Sincr motor can't really take over 40a 😂
[2021-10-24T21:31:46] Unknown: Yes
[2021-10-24T21:31:49] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-10-24T21:32:00] Happy Giraffe: Are the sensors working?
[2021-10-24T21:32:06] Unknown: Well they where
[2021-10-24T21:32:06] Happy Giraffe: Or do you go sensorless?
[2021-10-24T21:32:26] Unknown: <video_file>
[2021-10-24T21:32:27] Unknown: Then this started happening 2 days later
[2021-10-24T21:32:47] Unknown: So without sensors 🤷‍♂️
[2021-10-24T21:32:59] Artem Bulashev: You are in Acceptable range But not in optimal range for sure, that’s why you see more sag than you could have :) but you are safe
[2021-10-24T21:33:07] sombre_enfant: U use a rc recevier ?
[2021-10-24T21:33:23] Unknown: I said it when i got em, they sent 10 boards to make sure id go 200km 😂 and yup
[2021-10-24T21:33:30] Unknown: Gotta get a new adc haha
[2021-10-24T21:33:47] Unknown: But hey, i can my my scoot drive backwards now 😂
[2021-10-24T21:34:14] Unknown: Im just gonna remove the sensor board and upgrade the phase wires
[2021-10-24T21:34:28] Unknown: See how well the motor holds out
[2021-10-24T21:34:34] Artem Bulashev: Me yes
[2021-10-24T21:35:33] Unknown: Thanks :p gonna have to find someone with a good spotwelder to weld my next battery later then :p
[2021-10-25T20:27:15] Happy Giraffe: @artBula
[2021-10-25T20:27:17] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1336@25-10-2021_20-27-17.jpg>
[2021-10-25T20:27:25] Happy Giraffe: Some rendering times for you
[2021-10-25T20:27:47] Artem Bulashev: Jesus
[2021-10-25T20:27:50] Happy Giraffe: Yep
[2021-10-25T20:28:24] Artem Bulashev: I think every single person in video / photo editing business will switch for sure
[2021-10-25T20:28:40] Artem Bulashev: Imagine saving like 3h every day 😄😄
[2021-10-25T20:29:33] Artem Bulashev: Also corporations replace PC with m1 air - because 21h battery and working in office will use 20 times less battery than normal desktop PC
[2021-10-25T20:29:45] Happy Giraffe: I overclocked my R5 3600 to 4.5ghz and it consuming only 80w on rendering load amazed me. But afterall that was 120€ chip only😂
[2021-10-25T20:30:39] Happy Giraffe: While intel cpus need 150w for same lol
[2021-10-25T20:31:22] Artem Bulashev: Well from what I see max is equal to 3080 mobile or in between 3060-3070 desktop but those consume 180w - 300w
[2021-10-25T20:32:19] Artem Bulashev: Yeah and cpu as well that’s why typical power supply in any desktop PC is 450w minimum 600w commonly and 800-1000w for people with extreme video cards like 3080
[2021-10-25T20:35:08] Happy Giraffe: I cant wait to afford it in 10 years😂
[2021-10-25T20:35:19] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-10-25T20:35:27] Artem Bulashev: In reality 3 years
[2021-10-25T20:35:31] Artem Bulashev: Will sell for 1k
[2021-10-25T20:35:37] Artem Bulashev: Vs 3.5k now
[2021-10-25T20:36:57] Artem Bulashev: I have now late 2018 i9, 32gb ddr4, 1tb SSD, Radeon 560 and i will be selling it 1500€ (it was the max spec you could get around 3700€)
[2021-10-25T20:42:43] Happy Giraffe: I built my pc 4 years ago and still can upgrade it haha, I got dual core i5 MacBook only as a backup and for music stuff when in need of a portable machine
[2021-10-25T20:43:41] Happy Giraffe: You gotta sell it fast, but you still need to pay some extra to even get base model of the 14"👀😂
[2021-10-25T21:53:32] Artem Bulashev: Well some people sold my pc for 1800€ so not bad over all
[2021-10-25T22:14:23] Happy Giraffe: Sometimes Im pissed off 1300€ ipad can't even download a pdf file normally from internet 🙈
[2021-10-25T22:15:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, I'd really love to see a comparison with a i9 series 11 (tiger lake) or i7 same serie on 16inch
[2021-10-25T22:16:32] Happy Giraffe: That would be on windows then
[2021-10-25T22:17:25] Happy Giraffe: But as its cpu for Apple, this is the most apples to apples comparison (Dat pun)
[2021-10-25T22:19:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Damn I didn't understood it was mac only comparison
[2021-10-25T22:20:13] Face de Pin Sucé: Would have been very interesting to see the difference of performance using premiere pro for example
[2021-10-25T22:25:58] Artem Bulashev: It can
[2021-10-25T22:26:07] Artem Bulashev: For like past 5 years
[2021-10-25T22:26:10] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-10-25T22:26:49] Artem Bulashev: Massive will see soon
[2021-10-25T22:46:34] Happy Giraffe: I need to zoom out of the pdf and click download button with other hand lol
[2021-10-25T22:47:10] Happy Giraffe: But yeah, hardware excellent. Software trash
[2021-10-25T23:54:19] Happy Giraffe: M1 max has about 20% more cpu performance than my 6-core R5 3600
[2021-10-25T23:54:33] Happy Giraffe: Not as fast as I thought
[2021-10-25T23:54:54] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1337@25-10-2021_23-54-54.jpg>
[2021-10-25T23:55:40] Mirono escooters: Nerds
[2021-10-25T23:56:12] Happy Giraffe: I paid 120€ for my cpu, apple macbooks costs 3k to get that🌚
[2021-10-25T23:56:40] Mirono escooters: 🤣 fair
[2021-10-25T23:56:47] Happy Giraffe: "Says the guy who has Scooter on his profile pic"🌚
[2021-10-25T23:58:43] Mirono escooters: Touche
[2021-10-25T23:59:48] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-26T00:02:08] Artem Bulashev: What test?
[2021-10-26T00:02:19] Happy Giraffe: Cinebench R23
[2021-10-26T00:02:35] Happy Giraffe: Measures raw power in cpu rendering
[2021-10-26T00:04:38] Artem Bulashev: I think you are forgetting you are comparing desktop vs notebook :)) entire computer with battery and monitor and keyboard weight as much as your cpu radiator 😂
[2021-10-26T00:04:42] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1338@26-10-2021_00-04-42.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:04:43] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1339@26-10-2021_00-04-43.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:04:46] Artem Bulashev: That’s m1
[2021-10-26T00:05:25] Happy Giraffe: Nah, this is my bread and butter I know this stuff and was just talking about raw power
[2021-10-26T00:05:27] Artem Bulashev: Max is faster than ryzen 9
[2021-10-26T00:05:44] Happy Giraffe: You would be surprised how 8-core Ryzen laptops perform haha
[2021-10-26T00:06:09] Happy Giraffe: Thats last gen to start with...
[2021-10-26T00:06:54] Artem Bulashev: Also cpu side is same in m1 pro and max
[2021-10-26T00:07:37] Happy Giraffe: And yeah, having single rank 1x16x memory modules etc can interfere memory bandwidth in laptops
[2021-10-26T00:10:27] Happy Giraffe: Ryzen 9 5900hx gets around 14,000 points from multi and 1500 single core
[2021-10-26T00:10:45] Happy Giraffe: So single core is same and thats impressive
[2021-10-26T00:12:03] Happy Giraffe: Hard to make accurate comparisons as two different Ryzen laptops could have 20% cpu performance difference from ram, cooling, power targets and bios settings alone
[2021-10-26T00:13:26] Artem Bulashev: Yeah also don’t forget that’s archived on just 30w of power 😅😂
[2021-10-26T00:13:48] Artem Bulashev: And tests are not in Turbo mode
[2021-10-26T00:14:24] Artem Bulashev: And I’m not sure if test is run through emulation software or if cinabench already made native app
[2021-10-26T00:16:39] Artem Bulashev: And cost of 10 core m1 pro 14inch is 2100 euro if you get it from switzerland at least
[2021-10-26T00:17:57] Happy Giraffe: In summary, new macs are insane in apples own apps like Final Cut. However on Non-native apps from Adobe iex. the performance is similar to (much cheaper) windows laptops.
[2021-10-26T00:19:35] Artem Bulashev: Unlikely
[2021-10-26T00:19:44] Artem Bulashev: You compared it to Desktop cpu
[2021-10-26T00:20:08] Happy Giraffe: Your eyes are blinded by apple my friend😂
[2021-10-26T00:20:14] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-10-26T00:20:18] Happy Giraffe: 5900hx is Zen3 laptop cpu
[2021-10-26T00:20:36] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok
[2021-10-26T00:21:34] Artem Bulashev: So what laptop has it and similar other spec in this price catagoty?
[2021-10-26T00:21:40] Artem Bulashev: Or cheaper
[2021-10-26T00:21:53] Happy Giraffe: 5800H also similar performance for 1000€ with 3060
[2021-10-26T00:22:13] Happy Giraffe: But yeah you get my point
[2021-10-26T00:32:00] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1340@26-10-2021_00-32-00.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:32:32] Artem Bulashev: Here 5900hx in laptop vs m1 pro
[2021-10-26T00:33:33] Artem Bulashev: 50% faster in geekbench which is not even running native
[2021-10-26T00:34:55] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1341@26-10-2021_00-34-55.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:34:55] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1342@26-10-2021_00-34-55.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:34:55] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1343@26-10-2021_00-34-55.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:35:00] Face de Pin Sucé: She looks innocent
[2021-10-26T00:35:11] Face de Pin Sucé: But has Spintend inside and high kV motors 🥰
[2021-10-26T00:35:29] Mirono escooters: Hot
[2021-10-26T00:36:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Not done yet but my friend takes it for testings tomorrow for one week in Paris, if he likes, I finish it and he buys 2000€
[2021-10-26T00:37:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Bought it dead 300€ (motors and controllers burnt) with 16S7P Mj1 almost new inside (200Kms)
[2021-10-26T00:37:27] Artem Bulashev: Some of those laptops with this CPU is just total trash can :) (this Lenovo is 1.2k euro and 3 times worse performer in cpu, gpu don’t even want to know) So it is only good to compare specific computer to specific computer, but in the end of the day non of 2.2kg laptops will come even close today and price 2.1euro is absolutely fair
[2021-10-26T00:37:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Added 2 Nutt bought 80€ and my customs motors + Spintend
[2021-10-26T00:37:42] Artem Bulashev: Niiice
[2021-10-26T00:38:33] Artem Bulashev: Damm that battery alone cost about 700€
[2021-10-26T00:38:39] Artem Bulashev: If lucky
[2021-10-26T00:39:25] Mirono escooters: Ooox
[2021-10-26T00:39:27] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-10-26T00:39:36] Mirono escooters: Lucky
[2021-10-26T00:39:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-10-26T00:39:43] Mirono escooters: Why batteries so expensive 🙈
[2021-10-26T00:39:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Was very lucky on this one
[2021-10-26T00:40:04] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1345@26-10-2021_00-40-04.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:40:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Also bought this DT2 with dead LCD
[2021-10-26T00:40:13] Face de Pin Sucé: 500€
[2021-10-26T00:40:17] Mirono escooters: Do you guys know of any hydraulic brake same size or smaller then xtech. I have maybe 1mm left
[2021-10-26T00:40:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Sold both motors 450€
[2021-10-26T00:40:34] Mirono escooters: How yall find deals like yjis
[2021-10-26T00:40:37] Face de Pin Sucé: And controller 100€ 😂
[2021-10-26T00:41:03] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1346@26-10-2021_00-41-03.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:41:07] Face de Pin Sucé: And still have a frame and a working 60V20.3Ah inside 😂
[2021-10-26T00:41:10] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2021-10-26T00:41:11] Mirono escooters: Lucky
[2021-10-26T00:41:21] Face de Pin Sucé: And DT2 is fucking rock solid
[2021-10-26T00:41:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Owning a scooter shop 😁
[2021-10-26T00:42:57] Happy Giraffe: Geekbench😂
[2021-10-26T00:44:50] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-10-26T00:45:13] Face de Pin Sucé: If someone wants the battery, I sell for 250€ 😁😁
[2021-10-26T00:45:30] Mirono escooters: Good price
[2021-10-26T00:45:37] Happy Giraffe: Xtech🤮
[2021-10-26T00:46:06] Happy Giraffe: Thats cool
[2021-10-26T00:48:58] Mirono escooters: I kno
[2021-10-26T00:49:06] Mirono escooters: I'm searching for a better one🤣
[2021-10-26T00:49:20] Mirono escooters: But needs to be smaller and that sounds difficult to say the least
[2021-10-26T00:50:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Xtech is huge
[2021-10-26T00:50:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Nutt is definitely smaller
[2021-10-26T00:50:48] Mirono escooters: The hydraulic that happy recommended was abit bigger
[2021-10-26T00:50:56] Mirono escooters: What's the price of 1?
[2021-10-26T00:51:06] Mirono escooters: I only have 1 brake rather get a good one
[2021-10-26T00:51:24] Face de Pin Sucé: I can't say
[2021-10-26T00:51:34] Happy Giraffe: Magura MT5e
[2021-10-26T00:51:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Never bought one, the only I bought was from my friend, 80€ both
[2021-10-26T00:51:52] Happy Giraffe: Even more wider than xtech lol
[2021-10-26T00:52:09] Mirono escooters: Yea :////
[2021-10-26T00:52:12] Mirono escooters: I need smoller
[2021-10-26T00:52:24] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1347@26-10-2021_00-52-24.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:52:35] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1348@26-10-2021_00-52-35.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:52:36] Mirono escooters: Wtf sick
[2021-10-26T00:52:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Nutt vs Xtech
[2021-10-26T00:52:47] Happy Giraffe: This is the way to go then
[2021-10-26T00:52:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Xtech is big for nothing honestly
[2021-10-26T00:53:03] Mirono escooters: I think I will just mishandle xtech until it starts leaking
[2021-10-26T00:53:08] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-10-26T00:53:16] Mirono escooters: Guess I'll order it :)
[2021-10-26T00:53:30] Happy Giraffe: Bigger pile of trash
[2021-10-26T00:53:34] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-26T00:53:39] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-10-26T00:53:40] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-10-26T00:53:44] Mirono escooters: But cheap
[2021-10-26T00:54:03] Happy Giraffe: Cheap as the life depending on it
[2021-10-26T00:54:10] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1349@26-10-2021_00-54-10.jpg>
[2021-10-26T00:54:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Got some new
[2021-10-26T00:54:18] Mirono escooters: I guess I will see
[2021-10-26T00:56:25] Happy Giraffe: For high speeds xtech is dangerous
[2021-10-26T00:56:34] Mirono escooters: 40kmh!-
[2021-10-26T00:56:36] Mirono escooters: +-
[2021-10-26T00:56:40] Mirono escooters: Gen1 g30🤷‍♂️
[2021-10-26T00:56:52] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, too much speed for poor xtech
[2021-10-26T00:57:04] Mirono escooters: No ebrake bcs alie controller sucks
[2021-10-26T00:57:10] Mirono escooters: Will see
[2021-10-26T00:57:15] Mirono escooters: I will prob go hydraulic
[2021-10-26T00:57:23] Mirono escooters: It's not too expensive for a good brake
[2021-10-26T00:57:24] Happy Giraffe: Just dont have xtech as only option😅
[2021-10-26T00:57:48] Mirono escooters: Wooms
[2021-10-26T00:57:50] Mirono escooters: Woops
[2021-10-26T00:58:56] Happy Giraffe: Then wear durable shoes for braking😂
[2021-10-26T00:59:06] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-10-26T01:22:39] Artem Bulashev: Partially why nutt is standard on vsett - not much room to 3 inch tire.
[2021-10-26T08:03:23] sombre_enfant: Ain't no way, where u find deal like that ?
[2021-10-26T08:06:39] sombre_enfant: I also got the poor model of nutt
[2021-10-26T08:13:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Rich customer, when you say him he has to change both motors and controllers, he doesn't want to wait and buy another brand new Dualtron Spider then sells you the dead one for 300€ 😂
[2021-10-26T08:14:13] Face de Pin Sucé: I also have a Dualtron Mini 13Ah almost new (350Km) with a dead BMS, bought 80€ 😂😂😂
[2021-10-26T08:14:19] sombre_enfant: I want that type of deal too 😭
[2021-10-26T08:14:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Have to take off the battery to change the BMS then let's ride xD
[2021-10-26T08:16:03] sombre_enfant: So on big scoot world people dont care or bother to repair they just throw it away 😂
[2021-10-26T08:16:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, it's not a common situation, but when it happens, it's really cool
[2021-10-26T08:18:12] sombre_enfant: Aight for your custom motor,its one from your own brand or just modified one ?
[2021-10-26T08:35:01] Face de Pin Sucé: One from my own brand
[2021-10-26T08:35:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Those 2 were prototypes before Rage Mechanics
[2021-10-26T08:35:54] Face de Pin Sucé: But last design so same as I sell for Rage :D
[2021-10-26T08:37:00] sombre_enfant: Cool too bad u dont have a website or sum
[2021-10-26T08:37:15] Face de Pin Sucé: I will soon ☺️
[2021-10-26T13:13:13] Happy Giraffe: Oh shit the light is massive
[2021-10-26T13:18:35] Mirono escooters: How many w
[2021-10-26T13:18:41] Artem Bulashev: Have same one but flat version, it’s a lot smaller but does true 15-17w
[2021-10-26T13:18:42] Mirono escooters: I got 2 of those Must say I see well now
[2021-10-26T13:23:04] Happy Giraffe: They say 20w, I will test myself
[2021-10-26T13:24:34] Mirono escooters: I have a 100w build into a hardware store case thing Lights up a whole street. Love it
[2021-10-26T13:29:03] Happy Giraffe: Thats gonna hurt range a lot haha
[2021-10-26T13:41:26] Mirono escooters: 100w I don't use in scoot
[2021-10-26T13:41:29] Mirono escooters: It was just for fun
[2021-10-26T16:32:09] Unknown: Anyone know a good bms brand for 2s?
[2021-10-26T16:32:28] Mirono escooters: Broodio?
[2021-10-26T17:18:18] Unknown: No clue, it's for an rc boat to go fishing for a friend
[2021-10-26T17:25:22] Mirono escooters: Broodio bms good enoygh
[2021-10-26T17:34:27] Happy Giraffe: Rc boat pulling his boat? 😂
[2021-10-26T17:38:26] Mirono escooters: https://youtu.be/HFhsh4V8SZA
[2021-10-26T17:38:28] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2021-10-26T17:40:39] Happy Giraffe: I watched that 2 days ago lol
[2021-10-26T17:42:15] Mirono escooters: Love lt
[2021-10-26T17:43:45] Happy Giraffe: I would build vesc canoe in a heartbeat if I had one laying around
[2021-10-26T17:45:03] Mirono escooters: I dont even have wotter I could go on
[2021-10-27T14:15:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1352@27-10-2021_14-15-43.jpg>
[2021-10-27T14:15:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Working to improve water resistance (TPU ring for cables) If you have better ideas, let me know 😉
[2021-10-27T14:16:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1353@27-10-2021_14-16-11.jpg>
[2021-10-27T14:16:13] Liam: Oo just the man I wanted to talk to!
[2021-10-27T14:17:06] Liam: I just wanted to check with you that all the info on your git repo is up to date @koxx3 before I start ordering parts :)
[2021-10-27T14:18:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's the open source project. I only fix bugs on this project now (if requested). I can control only a single VESC (not dual) I work on the pro version now.
[2021-10-27T14:19:26] Liam: All I want to do is have the throttle input into the vesc, and use the original vsett display.
[2021-10-27T14:19:41] Liam: Happy to set params and stuff via metr
[2021-10-27T14:20:16] Liam: So that should be fine right?
[2021-10-27T14:23:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I don't know. I haven't tested the Vsett for now. normally, it works like QS-S4 of Zero scooter.
[2021-10-27T14:24:02] Liam: Yeah, but in theory. Happy to get the Xero display if it doesn't workout with the vsett.
[2021-10-27T14:24:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but if you don't know how to code and modify the code, AND solder SMD components, I don't advise to launch such project yourself.
[2021-10-27T14:25:18] Liam: I can code, I've a friend that will help me out with the soldering.
[2021-10-27T14:25:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok ;)
[2021-10-27T14:26:24] Liam: I am not expecting it to be easy, but easier than starting from scratch which was my plan up until yesterday evening.
[2021-10-27T14:27:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: or I can sell you a board. You'll have to make the cables. :D
[2021-10-27T14:27:35] Liam: I don't as looking at interpreting the UART comms between controller and display and was getting out of my depth quite quickly!
[2021-10-27T14:28:09] Liam: This would be fantastic, how much would you be selling for?
[2021-10-27T14:28:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 2 min. I'll look at the price table
[2021-10-27T14:29:07] Liam: I am in the UK btw just so you are aware of the customs complications that brings.
[2021-10-27T14:29:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, I know 😅
[2021-10-27T14:29:37] Artem Bulashev: zero and vsett displays and controllers are cross compatable - zero controler + vsett display work fully and vsett controller with zero display also works fully
[2021-10-27T14:29:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: currently, what I can't prepare is full SmartDisplay
[2021-10-27T14:29:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but for SmartController, I have board waiting :D
[2021-10-27T14:30:02] Liam: That's fine, I only want to controller.
[2021-10-27T14:30:14] Artem Bulashev: same here haha 🙂
[2021-10-27T14:30:14] Liam: I want to use the vsett display for now.
[2021-10-27T14:30:22] Artem Bulashev: same here lol 🙂
[2021-10-27T14:30:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you have a 3D printer for buttons ?
[2021-10-27T14:30:41] Artem Bulashev: time to start fun page hehe
[2021-10-27T14:30:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh ! ok ! I thought you wanted the SmartDisplay !
[2021-10-27T14:30:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hehehe
[2021-10-27T14:31:18] Liam: I have a 3d printer, but would prefer to repurpose existing buttons.
[2021-10-27T14:32:04] Artem Bulashev: you can vsett 10+ has almost identical design dual button assembly
[2021-10-27T14:32:21] Liam: Mines a 9+ but I think it's the same.
[2021-10-27T14:32:37] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1354@27-10-2021_14-32-37.jpg>
[2021-10-27T14:33:11] Liam: Yeah I have that, but for horn and DDM neither feature are useful to me.
[2021-10-27T14:33:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for electronic only, without any assembly (motherboard + Smart shield) and some JST cables, it's 60€ without shipping. You'll have to solder it yourself.
[2021-10-27T14:34:11] Artem Bulashev: I'm just showing for non vsett people 🙂
[2021-10-27T14:34:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it needs to be momentary buttons. not latching.
[2021-10-27T14:35:09] Artem Bulashev: they are removable re placable 🙂 I love your buttons though

[2021-10-27T14:35:33] Artem Bulashev: so single motro control only at the moment ?
[2021-10-27T14:36:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on the open source, yes. when I'll sell the complete/finished project, it will have the pro firmware (dual moto & co ...).
[2021-10-27T14:36:35] Artem Bulashev: I though vesc re transmits data automatically to second part of UBOX, guess not
[2021-10-27T14:36:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the pro firmware already handle dual motors
[2021-10-27T14:36:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not so simple ;)
[2021-10-27T14:36:55] Artem Bulashev: great man!
[2021-10-27T14:37:15] Artem Bulashev: I'm ready when ever you tell me to send money 😘
[2021-10-27T14:39:48] Liam: I am bit confused about the dual.
[2021-10-27T14:39:57] Liam: Vesc only needs one throttle input.
[2021-10-27T14:40:16] Liam: Data comes out via UART.
[2021-10-27T14:40:46] Liam: Unless you are trying to program dual vescs, it would work fine right?
[2021-10-27T14:46:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: to limit speed (modes) and/or power (eco modes), you need to drive the 2nd VESC with specific UART commands
[2021-10-27T14:47:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for ADC, yes, it can be forwareded automatically to the second VESC
[2021-10-27T14:49:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also, to compute some datas (currents, power ...), you need request datas to the second VESC
[2021-10-27T14:50:40] Liam: Okay, so for the time being I am better off putting 54a through the rear motor rather than splitting 27a across the front and rear.
[2021-10-27T15:28:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I don't think so. motor will be overheating
[2021-10-27T15:28:30] Mirono escooters: Fip
[2021-10-27T15:28:31] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2021-10-27T15:29:12] Liam: Someone else in the Vsett group said he runs his motors way above OEM and they are fine.
[2021-10-27T19:31:57] Artem Bulashev: VESC foc is much more efficient in motor driving so you can safely add 20% i would say.
[2021-10-27T19:32:57] Mirono escooters: Vesc 🥰
[2021-10-27T19:35:03] Artem Bulashev: Yeah again I can base it off my knowledge of tolerances and quality of parts selection on vsett. Other motors and controllers may be matched / miss-matched differently. Hence temp sensor is golden to have
[2021-10-27T19:35:45] Artem Bulashev: Also increasing voltage will increase motor output without almost any rise in temp as you can keep same amps
[2021-10-27T19:36:04] Artem Bulashev: So consider higher voltage battery if possible
[2021-10-27T19:40:16] Unknown: I wish i could 😥 i need more kv
[2021-10-27T19:48:20] Liam: Higher voltage also means more expensive escs
[2021-10-27T19:48:50] Liam: I am trying to use what I have which is either og focbox or zenith.
[2021-10-27T20:01:28] Mirono escooters: 20s gang
[2021-10-27T20:19:31] Happy Giraffe: Buy blade motor👀

[2021-10-27T21:07:39] Happy Giraffe: On wheelway I got 50kmh, Blade should go 65

[2021-10-27T21:37:18] Happy Giraffe: M365 frame size is too small to be useful, Pro is good for portability and G30 is best for tanky non-portable haha
[2021-10-27T21:37:38] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I even get G30 and go awd, who knows🌚
[2021-10-27T21:37:44] Mirono escooters: Its good for me

[2021-10-28T16:42:37] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-10-28T16:42:45] Mirono escooters: If only I knew how fuel motors work

[2021-10-28T23:53:03] Artem Bulashev: Agree
[2021-10-28T23:53:30] Happy Giraffe: Check that helmet has good ventilation if possible, nobody wants to sweat during summer, you can also open visor a bit also
[2021-10-28T23:53:34] Mirono escooters: Shit self discharging cells+ 8 months of storagr

[2021-10-29T00:00:40] Artem Bulashev: You will have to dig in
[2021-10-29T00:00:48] Mirono escooters: Someone should make Bluetooth xiaoxiang bms compatible like xiaomi
[2021-10-29T00:01:00] Mirono escooters: Or low kv owners Kuch

[2021-10-29T00:01:54] Happy Giraffe: Fuck yeah
[2021-10-29T00:02:40] Happy Giraffe: This horn is bonkers for those who dont have dual ubox
[2021-10-29T00:02:40] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1367@29-10-2021_00-02-40.jpg>
[2021-10-29T00:03:12] Mirono escooters: 30€ for a horn oempf
[2021-10-29T00:04:26] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-29T00:06:00] Artem Bulashev: ? What you mean ? Why for those who don’t have dual ubox?
[2021-10-29T00:06:22] Happy Giraffe: Single ubox only has fan port 12v
[2021-10-29T00:06:58] Happy Giraffe: Idk how much Amps it can take, maybe enough for horn
[2021-10-29T00:07:09] Mirono escooters: Hmmm
[2021-10-29T00:07:14] Mirono escooters: Maybe short pulse
[2021-10-29T00:07:23] Mirono escooters: Test w power supply
[2021-10-29T00:07:27] Mirono escooters: A horn.draws a lot.tho
[2021-10-29T00:07:29] Happy Giraffe: But if you have fan already you cant use horn🌚
[2021-10-29T00:07:57] Artem Bulashev: Just use a mosfet
[2021-10-29T00:08:04] Mirono escooters: +1
[2021-10-29T00:08:18] Artem Bulashev: Use port to open it and put vbat to the horn
[2021-10-29T00:08:23] Mirono escooters: Flipsky future fan lol this will be fun
[2021-10-29T00:09:05] Happy Giraffe: I don't mess too much with circuits 😅
[2021-10-29T00:33:11] Happy Giraffe: Has there been any testing of 75100 by anyone?
[2021-10-29T00:57:55] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 found some info on Uart, it is appears as if it is very well developed for error correction algorithms correcting up to 25%. Also people from Atmel advised to pull up resistor on rx pin if Iread it correctly - 20.4 Frame Formats … When a complete frame is transmitted, it can be directly followed by a new frame, or the communication line can be set to an idle (high) state. … IDLE - No transfers on the communication line (RxDn or TxDn). An IDLE line must be high. I don’t know if it is usefull info but decided to share, may some bits will be https://forum.arduino.cc/t/solved-lots-of-noise-on-hardware-serial-line/286515/4 Seems like a lot better than plain adc that also has tendencies to burn out and generally very sensitive ass
[2021-10-29T01:00:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: can be intersting. but difficult on both sides. once new pcb arrive, i'll focus on can bus interface. i just need to find a 2nd single vesc (for dual testing). my dual is in the boosted and the single... well... is a single 🤣
[2021-10-29T09:36:20] Unknown: Depends 😂 gotta do 3 for around 4500
[2021-10-29T10:55:40] Mirono escooters: No use for it
[2021-10-29T10:55:46] Mirono escooters: Sponsor me🤣
[2021-10-29T10:56:38] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅 I would love to send you vesc as welll haha but that would leave me with no scooter at this point 😅
[2021-10-29T10:57:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, a dual could help ? How long do you need it ? 😏
[2021-10-29T11:00:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a working one, yes, perfect.
[2021-10-29T11:00:55] Face de Pin Sucé: How long ? :P
[2021-10-29T11:02:00] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1368@29-10-2021_11-02-00.jpg>
[2021-10-29T11:02:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Like this little baby ? 😏
[2021-10-29T11:03:13] Mirono escooters: You just have that laying around?🤣🤣
[2021-10-29T11:03:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes 😂
[2021-10-29T11:03:38] sombre_enfant: Kugoo g booster is an ok base to go on vesc ? I got a neighbord who might sell his broke one
[2021-10-29T11:04:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't like the look, but have to say, it's pretty solid. Had a 120Kg customer who asked me to add 48V40Ah inside deck and original 40V24Ah on column
[2021-10-29T11:05:05] Face de Pin Sucé: And it was okay, no wobble, no break
[2021-10-29T11:06:19] sombre_enfant: Nice what about motor its sturdy ? Could it handle 72/96v at like 30a? Since it cant really be upgraded bc of the axle
[2021-10-29T11:09:00] sombre_enfant: 48v40ah, so around 160pcs 18650 cells ?
[2021-10-29T11:09:22] Mirono escooters: Jezus
[2021-10-29T11:17:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ♥️♥️
[2021-10-29T11:22:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Never opened the motors
[2021-10-29T11:22:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't remember, was a year ago 😂
[2021-10-29T11:23:36] sombre_enfant: It was with 18650 or 21700? If you know this then i can know around how many cell there was inside 😂
[2021-10-29T11:42:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Lemme check if I can find the invoice of battery for customer
[2021-10-29T11:53:40] sombre_enfant: Thx
[2021-10-29T11:59:55] Face de Pin Sucé: 13S12P Samsung 35E inside deck
[2021-10-29T12:00:06] Face de Pin Sucé: And original 24ah on column
[2021-10-29T12:00:06] sombre_enfant: Damn
[2021-10-29T12:00:32] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1369@29-10-2021_12-00-32.jpg>
[2021-10-29T12:00:43] Face de Pin Sucé: And he added a small bag on it for his stuff 😂
[2021-10-29T12:00:53] Face de Pin Sucé: The guy weights 120Kg
[2021-10-29T12:01:06] sombre_enfant: Hope mon voisin still has it so i can finesse it and go 20s8p
[2021-10-29T12:01:44] Face de Pin Sucé: He reached 62Kmh with those 2 batteries
[2021-10-29T12:01:54] Face de Pin Sucé: So lot of speed for you, if running 20S
[2021-10-29T12:02:19] Mirono escooters: Vroom
[2021-10-29T12:02:42] Mirono escooters: Y 20s?
[2021-10-29T12:03:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Y not ? 😂😏

[2021-10-29T12:06:01] Mirono escooters: I kno
[2021-10-29T12:06:15] Mirono escooters: I was But it requires so good batteries and I'm cheap
[2021-10-29T12:06:19] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2021-10-29T12:06:29] Mirono escooters: And 20s on a xiaomi mjehh. It was fun butttt.. 🤣
[2021-10-29T12:06:53] sombre_enfant: I used to collect rental scoot cell isnt a prob here
[2021-10-29T12:23:47] Mirono escooters: I cant find much anymore
[2021-10-29T12:34:01] sombre_enfant: Here too, we still got hardcased 13s5p with Panasonic ncr18650bd, but u need to be dedicated to remove all the cell from the silicone and holder
[2021-10-29T12:34:10] Mirono escooters: Oee
[2021-10-29T12:34:12] Mirono escooters: How u get them
[2021-10-29T12:34:14] Mirono escooters: I want😀🤣
[2021-10-29T12:35:04] sombre_enfant: From rental
[2021-10-29T12:35:25] Mirono escooters: U get it legal Or borrow and don't return
[2021-10-29T12:36:58] sombre_enfant: U slap the jucier and take his ebike and all his battery, easy
[2021-10-29T12:37:15] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-10-29T13:14:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha
[2021-10-29T13:15:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Dott time
[2021-10-29T13:26:23] sombre_enfant: Yup they nice to put in ninebot max or repack if u got time
[2021-10-29T13:39:09] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1370@29-10-2021_13-39-09.jpg>
[2021-10-29T14:21:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what's new ?
[2021-10-29T14:44:04] Artem Bulashev: Not sure
[2021-10-29T14:44:10] Artem Bulashev: There will be 2 comming out
[2021-10-29T14:44:13] Artem Bulashev: V2
[2021-10-29T14:44:15] Artem Bulashev: And Pro
[2021-10-29T14:44:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Nothing new on V2
[2021-10-29T14:44:21] Artem Bulashev: Pro should be 100v
[2021-10-29T14:44:45] Artem Bulashev: V2 is updated design which should allow to get 150amps phase
[2021-10-29T14:44:59] Artem Bulashev: Without running into issue with EMI getting to the logic side
[2021-10-29T14:45:09] Artem Bulashev: Will see soon
[2021-10-29T14:45:16] Face de Pin Sucé: ??
[2021-10-29T14:45:28] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm running 250A phase without problems
[2021-10-29T14:45:35] Artem Bulashev: 150a each
[2021-10-29T14:45:43] Face de Pin Sucé: 250A each
[2021-10-29T14:45:49] Artem Bulashev: On ubox ?
[2021-10-29T14:45:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Yea
[2021-10-29T14:46:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i confirm 😁
[2021-10-29T14:46:05] Artem Bulashev: How old is your unit?
[2021-10-29T14:46:15] Face de Pin Sucé: I did on all units
[2021-10-29T14:46:20] Face de Pin Sucé: First unit, a year ago
[2021-10-29T14:46:26] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-29T14:46:28] Artem Bulashev: And what happened to it?
[2021-10-29T14:46:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Worked like a charm
[2021-10-29T14:46:47] Artem Bulashev: How about cooling
[2021-10-29T14:46:49] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-10-29T14:46:55] Face de Pin Sucé: (until I killed it with a short circuit 🤣)
[2021-10-29T14:46:56] Artem Bulashev: And abs limit ?
[2021-10-29T14:47:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Abs limit 420A no problem
[2021-10-29T14:47:06] Artem Bulashev: 300a fW?
[2021-10-29T14:47:10] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-10-29T14:47:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-10-29T14:47:23] Mirono escooters: 250a??🥰
[2021-10-29T14:47:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, needs improvement of course 🤣
[2021-10-29T14:47:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: always pushing the limits 🤣
[2021-10-29T14:47:41] Artem Bulashev: That’s insane value for ubox
[2021-10-29T14:47:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Those are the parameters I putted on the Weped you tried Asgar have
[2021-10-29T14:47:53] Happy Giraffe: I've come to conclusion french guys are crazy😂
[2021-10-29T14:47:57] Artem Bulashev: Did you do any mods like better fets?
[2021-10-29T14:48:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i know 😉
[2021-10-29T14:48:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope
[2021-10-29T14:48:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope
[2021-10-29T14:48:25] Artem Bulashev: France has no power limit lol 😂
[2021-10-29T14:48:37] Artem Bulashev: So what did you do to it
[2021-10-29T14:48:45] Face de Pin Sucé: We can do better, trust me 🤣
[2021-10-29T14:48:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we are all crazy here 🤣🤣🤤
[2021-10-29T14:49:12] Artem Bulashev: Thermal paste? Copper heat plate ?
[2021-10-29T14:49:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Pushed some fresh air in it and let's ride
[2021-10-29T14:49:16] Mirono escooters: Accel must be craazy
[2021-10-29T14:49:21] Mirono escooters: Wich mosfets do they have
[2021-10-29T14:49:34] Artem Bulashev: Far from best
[2021-10-29T14:49:42] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-10-29T14:50:05] Artem Bulashev: I see open air install, that makes sense. I was thinking closed deck install would not be able to take it
[2021-10-29T14:50:20] Artem Bulashev: They are average, nothing AMAZIGN
[2021-10-29T14:51:16] Artem Bulashev: I remember seeing their 1k resistance at around 6mOhm vs one of common upgrade fets is like 2mOhm or something
[2021-10-29T14:51:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, closed deck with very little holes and small fans
[2021-10-29T14:51:37] Artem Bulashev: Has been a while so I may haves values off, but difference was huge
[2021-10-29T14:51:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for the price of 0.2 nucular 12f 🤣🤣
[2021-10-29T14:51:57] sombre_enfant: With 300a fw its better than kelly or ?
[2021-10-29T14:51:59] Artem Bulashev: Oh I remember those loud ass suckers
[2021-10-29T14:52:07] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2021-10-29T14:52:21] Face de Pin Sucé: No no, not those ones 😂
[2021-10-29T14:52:29] Artem Bulashev: Good 🤣
[2021-10-29T14:52:44] Face de Pin Sucé: It's difficult to have more power than a Kelly 7218S tbh
[2021-10-29T14:52:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i've read the nucular screen settings. few interesting things. i'll certainly add some options to the smartdisplay 😁😁
[2021-10-29T14:52:53] Face de Pin Sucé: But I need to do the comparison
[2021-10-29T14:53:02] Mirono escooters: For that price I'd expect those
[2021-10-29T14:53:08] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 150a phase lol
[2021-10-29T14:53:13] Artem Bulashev: Hahahaha nice man
[2021-10-29T14:53:21] Artem Bulashev: What are you thinking ?
[2021-10-29T14:53:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Nucular is hell expansive and not that amazing, it's only about the impossibility to get one
[2021-10-29T14:53:49] Artem Bulashev: Agree
[2021-10-29T14:53:49] sombre_enfant: Phase work with batt amps too ? U cant go 150phase if only 30a bat
[2021-10-29T14:54:13] Happy Giraffe: Fake shortage
[2021-10-29T14:54:31] Artem Bulashev: You can, just for very short time - like a punch at the beginning similar to usual controllers
[2021-10-29T14:54:50] Face de Pin Sucé: I know
[2021-10-29T14:55:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes like 1ms you can get 150A 😂
[2021-10-29T14:55:32] Happy Giraffe: Im gonna try 40/120A😂
[2021-10-29T14:55:41] sombre_enfant: Worthless then
[2021-10-29T14:55:48] Artem Bulashev: Careful with motors
[2021-10-29T14:56:03] sombre_enfant: Fwd will go crazy
[2021-10-29T14:56:07] Artem Bulashev: Also I would advice not to try above 130amps phase on stock FW
[2021-10-29T14:56:36] Artem Bulashev: Yeah front wheel above 90-110a is out of control depending on motor torque 🤣
[2021-10-29T14:56:42] Happy Giraffe: It wasnt crazy with 35/95A either
[2021-10-29T14:56:49] Mirono escooters: Ieuw front wheel
[2021-10-29T14:56:52] Happy Giraffe: But this was shitty wheelway motor
[2021-10-29T14:57:06] Happy Giraffe: Time to test lol
[2021-10-29T14:57:07] Mirono escooters: Love rwd Fwd awd just slips and shit
[2021-10-29T14:57:09] Artem Bulashev: Yeah depends on motor
[2021-10-29T14:57:37] sombre_enfant: Atm at 20 fake amps i got my front wheel sliding on acceleration...
[2021-10-29T14:57:52] Mirono escooters: Haha front loses grip instantly
[2021-10-29T14:57:59] Artem Bulashev: I just have front 80amps phase and it allows to stress rear motor a lot less, ends efficiency on top end and it give a lot better acceleration than single rear
[2021-10-29T14:58:11] Mirono escooters: Yea I have that too
[2021-10-29T14:58:16] Mirono escooters: Just to help
[2021-10-29T14:58:20] Artem Bulashev: Nylon tires also may be shit
[2021-10-29T14:58:29] Mirono escooters: Oempf
[2021-10-29T14:58:49] Artem Bulashev: PMT italian rubber tires are awesome or at least CST softer nylon are amazing
[2021-10-29T14:58:50] sombre_enfant: Cst idk the model idrc about tyre
[2021-10-29T15:39:29] sombre_enfant: What yall would use to grind this edge ? Its in aluminium but idk wich disk i need to use
[2021-10-29T15:52:10] Artem Bulashev: V2 features: 1. All the 12V,5V,vcc external ports are recoverable fused 2. Independent external VCC, isolate the MCU's VCC. 3. Ignite key and meter supported，for e-scooter/e-bike application. 4. Three 12V control ports: front light, horn, and brake light! these ports are separated 2pin sockets. 5. Cooling fan socket with 12V power source. 6. CAN bus insert power on supported, easy for 4WD configuration. 7. External NRF(BT) socket, to replace the former internal BT module, independent from main uart ports, also A/B switchable. 8. VCC is 3.44V, 100% complaint with VESC original FW, costume FW no more. 9. External 2.4G receiver antenna.
[2021-10-29T15:53:47] Happy Giraffe: This for dual?
[2021-10-29T15:53:51] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 ignition key / meter port 😍 fused independent vcc 3.3v seperate from MCU 3.3v Brake light output 😃 External 2.4ghz antenna! No more BT built in though, probably for same reason of signal reception
[2021-10-29T15:53:56] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-10-29T15:54:16] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-29T15:56:09] Luis Magalhaes: 250A phase for one motor?
[2021-10-29T15:56:20] Artem Bulashev: Yeap he said yes
[2021-10-29T15:58:26] Luis Magalhaes: Dam
[2021-10-29T15:58:49] Luis Magalhaes: And im running at 130A stock firmware and wanting more phase 😂
[2021-10-29T15:59:02] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb teach me 😂😂😂
[2021-10-29T16:01:01] Mirono escooters: Grinder
[2021-10-29T17:13:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha not complicated, just flash the good 300A fw 🥰
[2021-10-29T17:13:43] sombre_enfant: His wolf warrior will go crazy
[2021-10-29T17:14:01] sombre_enfant: Lg mj1/mh1 en sueur tho
[2021-10-29T17:14:03] Luis Magalhaes: Your using the one i put here from the Russian group?
[2021-10-29T17:14:15] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-10-29T17:14:39] Face de Pin Sucé: PTDR
[2021-10-29T17:14:43] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb what are you using for battery amps?
[2021-10-29T17:15:25] Face de Pin Sucé: I received at same time directly from Spintend, don't remember if I used yours or spintend but it's same
[2021-10-29T17:15:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Only 2x120A at moment, battery is small
[2021-10-29T17:15:49] Luis Magalhaes: Only.. 😂😂
[2021-10-29T17:15:52] Mirono escooters: Only
[2021-10-29T17:15:54] Face de Pin Sucé: New molicel for this one is coming in 2 weeks
[2021-10-29T17:15:54] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-10-29T17:15:59] Mirono escooters: Me happy withh 50
[2021-10-29T17:16:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Same as last time, 16s10P Molicel
[2021-10-29T17:16:12] Luis Magalhaes: I used max 75A
[2021-10-29T17:16:14] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-10-29T17:16:22] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-29T17:16:23] Face de Pin Sucé: 🤣
[2021-10-29T17:16:44] sombre_enfant: Pro version of GPS Speedometer is currently free on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=luo.speedometergpspro
[2021-10-29T17:16:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Problem is I have big motors and they want amps so much
[2021-10-29T17:16:59] Luis Magalhaes: 10P molicel draining 220A? What should be the sag?
[2021-10-29T17:17:12] Face de Pin Sucé: To achieve fast speed, I need a lot of amps
[2021-10-29T17:17:21] sombre_enfant: 😂😂😂
[2021-10-29T17:17:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't know, I'll put like 2x160A battery, but I'm not sure actual cooling can handle it, we'll see in 2 weeks 🤣
[2021-10-29T17:18:20] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-10-29T17:18:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Remember, last time had 118Kmh running 16S12P 50E with Kelly But when I took molicel, was a little faster, maybe 122/123, couldn't test at moment
[2021-10-29T17:18:52] Luis Magalhaes: 💪💪
[2021-10-29T17:19:40] Luis Magalhaes: If i push more phase amps will i need the little fan? 😂😂
[2021-10-29T17:19:40] Artem Bulashev: Btw new v2 ubox also is redesigned to work with normal FW, no need for custom any more 👏👏
[2021-10-29T17:20:09] Mirono escooters: Wtgfff
[2021-10-29T17:20:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes you will
[2021-10-29T17:20:38] sombre_enfant: Me happy with 70kph and 2x20A😐
[2021-10-29T17:21:42] Mirono escooters: Lol 70kph too much forcme
[2021-10-29T17:21:48] Mirono escooters: 50kmh and good torque
[2021-10-29T17:22:35] sombre_enfant: Without helmet tho😐
[2021-10-29T17:22:43] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-10-29T17:22:52] Mirono escooters: u or me?
[2021-10-29T17:27:00] sombre_enfant: Me, and you👉🏾👈🏾
[2021-10-29T17:29:21] Mirono escooters: I wear helmet
[2021-10-29T17:34:57] Happy Giraffe: Miro would have been KIA in the car accident if not😅
[2021-10-29T17:36:08] Mirono escooters: Atleast a severe head problem
[2021-10-29T18:47:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, very nice features. but what is 'ignition Key' ? the switch already work fine to power on/off
[2021-10-29T18:49:41] Happy Giraffe: They want to add a gay key for some sort of security I guess😂
[2021-10-29T18:49:51] Happy Giraffe: I never understood those
[2021-10-29T18:52:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: clearly, it's useless. a guy even detected the same key can unlock multiple escooters. 🤣🤣 other solution, simply tear out the 2 wires, join them, and ride
[2021-10-29T18:53:13] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, the locks used on those have so bad tolerances they can be raked open in 2 sec
[2021-10-29T18:53:38] Happy Giraffe: NFC tag is more secure😂
[2021-10-29T18:54:57] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I like vsett nfc - can’t tear out 2 wires - it is actual serial UART between rfid unit and display :)
[2021-10-29T18:55:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: most are easy to clone
[2021-10-29T18:55:09] Artem Bulashev: But yeah those are all gimmicks
[2021-10-29T18:55:23] Artem Bulashev: Enough to deture stupid people
[2021-10-29T18:55:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: true
[2021-10-29T18:55:41] Artem Bulashev: Specially if scooter would have - gyro alarm
[2021-10-29T18:56:01] Artem Bulashev: And than engage motor braking and siren up on movement without first unlocking rfid
[2021-10-29T18:56:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but i'd never leave an escooter outside with just nfc and big lock
[2021-10-29T18:56:09] Artem Bulashev: Would be amazing :)
[2021-10-29T18:56:29] Artem Bulashev: And let me add - gps 4g immediate notification
[2021-10-29T18:56:53] Artem Bulashev: Which all of those is my plan to be built on top of your board 😁😁
[2021-10-29T18:56:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: next expansion board 😉
[2021-10-29T18:57:13] Happy Giraffe: I got 8mm chain and a kryptonite u-lock to pair it with if I leave scooter alone for longer time (+airtag)
[2021-10-29T18:57:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: gsp+4g+gyro+can+siren+cutoff 😉
[2021-10-29T18:58:26] Artem Bulashev: Gps/sim + mpu6050 + rfid + mosfet for open close high power alarm
[2021-10-29T18:59:32] Artem Bulashev: Cut off not needed :-) just plug VESC button so that board can turn it on when needed and than send -70a to both motors 🤪 :-)
[2021-10-29T18:59:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: where did you find this ???
[2021-10-29T18:59:44] Artem Bulashev: I’m really good in finding things
[2021-10-29T18:59:47] Artem Bulashev: 😜
[2021-10-29T18:59:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah
[2021-10-29T18:59:52] Artem Bulashev: I can see you
[2021-10-29T19:00:00] Artem Bulashev: But I have something else actually now
[2021-10-29T19:00:09] Artem Bulashev: If you have alrwady guro on your board
[2021-10-29T19:00:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. i use a liligo. but not this version (smaller)
[2021-10-29T19:04:35] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-10-29T19:04:38] Artem Bulashev: Check out
[2021-10-29T19:04:49] Artem Bulashev: Sim7600g I think it is called newest one
[2021-10-29T19:05:36] Artem Bulashev: It has 4g and gps and back up battery as well as charging solar circuitry for it - can run dc into it for it to manage back up battery even
[2021-10-29T19:05:44] Artem Bulashev: I desoldered back up battery
[2021-10-29T19:06:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i use the pcie version with a 7600. this is your board ?
[2021-10-29T19:06:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you coded the app ?
[2021-10-29T19:06:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on the esp32 ?
[2021-10-29T19:06:31] Artem Bulashev: This is older
[2021-10-29T19:06:34] Artem Bulashev: 7000g
[2021-10-29T19:06:41] Artem Bulashev: 2g only I think
[2021-10-29T19:06:49] Artem Bulashev: But look at this
[2021-10-29T19:07:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok. 2g network is disappearing in france. this is why i wanted 4g
[2021-10-29T19:07:21] Artem Bulashev: Yeap that’s why there is newer one
[2021-10-29T19:07:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: up
[2021-10-29T19:08:42] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1373@29-10-2021_19-08-42.jpg>
[2021-10-29T19:08:57] Artem Bulashev: Bmw with supported their own sim / gps module
[2021-10-29T19:09:06] Artem Bulashev: It even came with SIM card installed
[2021-10-29T19:09:15] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-10-29T19:09:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah. nice !
[2021-10-29T19:09:21] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1374@29-10-2021_19-09-21.jpg>
[2021-10-29T19:09:25] Mirono escooters: Wich and do u need to pay?
[2021-10-29T19:09:40] Artem Bulashev: Not sure didn’t finish battery yet
[2021-10-29T19:09:48] Artem Bulashev: Waiting for as150u connector
[2021-10-29T19:10:10] Artem Bulashev: Antenna is in the case :)
[2021-10-29T19:10:28] Artem Bulashev: It communicates to BMS via UART
[2021-10-29T19:11:31] Artem Bulashev: And it comes with bms remote app to read and control - can disable remotely
[2021-10-29T19:47:58] Mirono escooters: This is sick
[2021-10-29T20:10:15] Luis Magalhaes: Got to buy some 😂👌
[2021-10-29T20:10:43] Luis Magalhaes: I want more phase amps to get more torque 😂
[2021-10-29T20:10:58] Artem Bulashev: I do like idea of tracker being inside battery - no thief will find it fast enough (so scooter retrieve is basically 100% guaranteed) planned to place my sim7000g in there, but now this module seems like a great option - even has some kind of location based alarm- if only it was lotion based and had Siren out put 😞😞 Really straggling now deciding how everything should be arranged beside the fact that co computer should be powered
[2021-10-29T20:47:54] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1376@29-10-2021_20-47-54.jpg>
[2021-10-29T20:47:54] Mirono escooters: Any experience? 🤣
[2021-10-29T20:47:54] Mirono escooters: Dual hydraulic for 52 lol
[2021-10-29T20:48:12] Artem Bulashev: Get nutt
[2021-10-29T20:48:18] Artem Bulashev: It’s light years ahead
[2021-10-29T20:48:24] Artem Bulashev: And cost not much more on sale
[2021-10-29T20:48:32] Artem Bulashev: Love the colors
[2021-10-29T20:49:23] Happy Giraffe: Zoom is shit
[2021-10-29T20:49:31] Artem Bulashev: Also for e scooters I would advice t get only quad piston once
[2021-10-29T20:49:42] Artem Bulashev: Because high rpm over heat calipers fast
[2021-10-29T20:50:01] Artem Bulashev: They are made for slow rpm bicycles
[2021-10-29T20:50:14] Happy Giraffe: This with double pads, not the wide one. And then proper rotor😎
[2021-10-29T20:50:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Shimano Saint 🥰
[2021-10-29T20:50:44] Happy Giraffe: So far my single wide pad Magura does fantastic but having two intependent pads is better
[2021-10-29T20:50:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Or Shigura
[2021-10-29T20:51:02] Happy Giraffe: No need for that if you get MT5e
[2021-10-29T20:51:12] Happy Giraffe: It has alu lever as stock
[2021-10-29T20:51:24] Face de Pin Sucé: MT5e lever is shit
[2021-10-29T20:51:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Carbotecture
[2021-10-29T20:51:39] Happy Giraffe: Nop
[2021-10-29T20:51:42] Happy Giraffe: Alu
[2021-10-29T20:51:52] Happy Giraffe: I have it myself👀
[2021-10-29T20:51:53] Face de Pin Sucé: My both Weped had MT5e
[2021-10-29T20:52:23] Happy Giraffe: So there are also plastic levers on MT5e???
[2021-10-29T20:52:35] Face de Pin Sucé: https://www.magura.com/en/components/bike/s-pedelec-brakes/productdetailpage/?p=2594
[2021-10-29T20:52:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-10-29T20:53:06] Face de Pin Sucé: And this shit can break on reservoir if you pull too hard on it
[2021-10-29T20:53:25] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1377@29-10-2021_20-53-25.jpg>
[2021-10-29T20:53:29] Happy Giraffe: Reservoir should be ok
[2021-10-29T20:54:01] Face de Pin Sucé: I've seen reservoir breaks in front of me
[2021-10-29T20:54:06] Happy Giraffe: It was the plastic lever what broke on some people
[2021-10-29T20:54:12] Happy Giraffe: How?😂
[2021-10-29T20:55:02] sombre_enfant: Hit the brake real hard on your scoot you'll see😂
[2021-10-29T20:55:03] Face de Pin Sucé: A really great bleed
[2021-10-29T20:55:14] Happy Giraffe: Already did that
[2021-10-29T20:55:18] Face de Pin Sucé: And real brake
[2021-10-29T20:55:21] Face de Pin Sucé: And poof
[2021-10-29T20:55:40] Happy Giraffe: Interesting, I have only heard of broken plastic levers
[2021-10-29T20:55:47] Face de Pin Sucé: It doesn't mean MT5e are bad brakes, for the price it's very good
[2021-10-29T20:55:54] Face de Pin Sucé: And brakes hard
[2021-10-29T20:56:01] Face de Pin Sucé: But Shimano Saint wayyyyy much better
[2021-10-29T20:56:04] Face de Pin Sucé: And tried Shigura
[2021-10-29T20:56:12] Happy Giraffe: Theres the Magura Bosh eStop aswell
[2021-10-29T20:56:15] Face de Pin Sucé: The power of braking is so fucking amazing
[2021-10-29T20:56:23] Happy Giraffe: This has all metal
[2021-10-29T20:56:33] sombre_enfant: Worst brake was avid, its not a thing anymore but it was really a treat impossible to bleed always some bubble
[2021-10-29T20:56:46] Happy Giraffe: Works with normal stuff but made for Bosh ABS
[2021-10-29T20:57:03] Happy Giraffe: Worst is xtech😂
[2021-10-29T20:57:05] sombre_enfant: Now its sram guide same sjit process to bleed but it brake
[2021-10-29T20:57:36] sombre_enfant: Xtech far better from any avid
[2021-10-29T20:58:08] Happy Giraffe: Ok so avid must stop working in two weeks😂
[2021-10-29T20:58:57] sombre_enfant: All dot4/5 brake are horrible, just hope but its rich ppl stuff😂
[2021-10-29T20:59:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Hope are great
[2021-10-29T20:59:44] Face de Pin Sucé: But I prefer Saint
[2021-10-29T21:00:03] Face de Pin Sucé: With 3mm discs it's amazing
[2021-10-29T21:00:08] sombre_enfant: Yeah but the price is just too much
[2021-10-29T21:00:56] Happy Giraffe: 90€ magura go brrrrrr
[2021-10-29T21:01:54] sombre_enfant: U got some at your shop ? I always got the squeaking sound because my rotor get bent from heat😐
[2021-10-29T21:02:04] sombre_enfant: Sound of shame
[2021-10-29T21:02:34] Happy Giraffe: Magura 160mm works great on me, costs only 20€ lmao
[2021-10-29T21:02:45] Happy Giraffe: Good stuff, really rigid
[2021-10-29T21:03:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes I agree
[2021-10-29T21:03:54] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1378@29-10-2021_21-03-54.jpg>
[2021-10-29T21:04:01] Face de Pin Sucé: The last two were installed on this beauty
[2021-10-29T21:04:14] sombre_enfant: 160mmx3 ???
[2021-10-29T21:04:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Yep
[2021-10-29T21:04:27] Face de Pin Sucé: We were bending our discs Everytime
[2021-10-29T21:04:34] sombre_enfant: Lmk the price i need to get that
[2021-10-29T21:04:39] sombre_enfant: My friend too
[2021-10-29T21:04:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: which one is it.?
[2021-10-29T21:04:54] Face de Pin Sucé: (playing 120-0Kmh too many times) so we tried this and it's amazing
[2021-10-29T21:05:09] Face de Pin Sucé: But it's not compatible with Magura
[2021-10-29T21:05:22] sombre_enfant: Nutt too ?
[2021-10-29T21:05:26] Face de Pin Sucé: 3mm is okay for shimano, Hope and Nutt (if I remember well for Nutt)
[2021-10-29T21:06:07] Face de Pin Sucé: https://fastride.fr/fr/pieces-pour-dualtron/1212-disque-de-frein-renforce-160-.html
[2021-10-29T21:06:08] Happy Giraffe: 120kmh is too much for 45kmh designed MT5e😂
[2021-10-29T21:06:13] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't have anymore in stock
[2021-10-29T21:06:21] Face de Pin Sucé: But Fastride have some
[2021-10-29T21:06:38] Happy Giraffe: I forgot you are crazy guy😂😘
[2021-10-29T21:06:43] Face de Pin Sucé: And yes compatible with nutt
[2021-10-29T21:07:06] Face de Pin Sucé: My friend did 4s 100-0Kmh 🤣 (with draggy)

[2021-10-29T21:09:37] Artem Bulashev: Amazing power and 4 piston for really good prices some times

[2021-10-29T21:09:39] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1381@29-10-2021_21-09-39.jpg>
[2021-10-29T21:09:42] Face de Pin Sucé: We worked hard on this one
[2021-10-29T21:09:46] Artem Bulashev: Full kit like 100€ on occasion
[2021-10-29T21:10:04] sombre_enfant: Shimano are always nice and the cup bleed is goated
[2021-10-29T21:10:05] Artem Bulashev: M7120 :) nice
[2021-10-29T21:10:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Sold 7000€ yesterday by it's owner in 4 days 🤣
[2021-10-29T21:10:17] sombre_enfant: Why ???
[2021-10-29T21:10:26] Artem Bulashev: That’s what I use on my trial bike
[2021-10-29T21:10:48] Face de Pin Sucé: This beast hitted 128Kmh with original 20S9P 50E battery
[2021-10-29T21:11:18] Face de Pin Sucé: He did 3000Km with it and now wants to pause and go on another scooter later
[2021-10-29T21:11:53] Face de Pin Sucé: https://youtu.be/VCvH_Gem0R8
[2021-10-29T21:12:02] Face de Pin Sucé: That was before Shimano Saints
[2021-10-29T21:12:18] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm sad we didn't put Molicel in it :/
[2021-10-29T21:29:56] sombre_enfant: Get this its the one i got i only have front brake and its ok https://a.aliexpress.com/_uze23k
[2021-10-29T21:31:58] Happy Giraffe: Shimano patented some lever with progressive ebrake function, perfect for vesc use but we havent heared anything from them
[2021-10-29T21:38:10] Artem Bulashev: 50e if I remember correctly is not very high current rated 12amps continuous full cycle before heating up too much if I remember correctly. How much battery current set on it?
[2021-10-29T21:38:35] Artem Bulashev: Nice where did this info come from?
[2021-10-29T21:39:29] Artem Bulashev: Honestly it’s so easy just to place hall sensor and than small neodymium magnet on leveler
[2021-10-29T21:39:40] Mirono escooters: Ohh pls yes
[2021-10-29T21:39:53] Artem Bulashev: That I’m not sure why bother searching for something that doesn’t exist unfortunately
[2021-10-29T21:40:16] Mirono escooters: Bigger or smaller then xtech(
[2021-10-29T21:40:17] Mirono escooters: ?*
[2021-10-29T21:41:09] Artem Bulashev: Yeah those are great - vsett used those as standard
[2021-10-29T21:41:26] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-10-29T21:41:28] Mirono escooters: How's the size
[2021-10-29T21:41:29] Artem Bulashev: It’s like shimano of china, cheap but great
[2021-10-29T21:41:35] Artem Bulashev: Of what? Disk?
[2021-10-29T21:42:03] sombre_enfant: U lucky i got a caliper and im not lazy
[2021-10-29T21:42:34] Mirono escooters: No of the brake caliper
[2021-10-29T21:42:39] Mirono escooters: It needs to be smaller
[2021-10-29T21:42:41] Mirono escooters: Then xtecy
[2021-10-29T21:42:43] Mirono escooters: Hero
[2021-10-29T21:43:00] Artem Bulashev: If you are worried about clearing the tire
[2021-10-29T21:43:46] Artem Bulashev: I would not worry as that model first tiny 6inch rim with 10x3inch tire of vsett, almost no other caliper clears it
[2021-10-29T21:43:55] Mirono escooters: O sick
[2021-10-29T21:44:50] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_1382@29-10-2021_21-44-50.jpg>
[2021-10-29T21:45:30] Mirono escooters: It hits rim rather
[2021-10-29T21:45:33] Mirono escooters: Monoshit
[2021-10-29T21:45:35] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2021-10-29T21:48:03] sombre_enfant: I dont think theres enough room on mine for 3mm disk even my pads are already a bit used... @SibClimb
[2021-10-29T21:53:06] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1384@29-10-2021_21-53-06.jpg>
[2021-10-29T21:57:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Honestly I don't know, Kelly doesn't sett values on current, only a percent, and no smart BMS so impossible to know how many amps were drawn
[2021-10-29T21:58:20] Face de Pin Sucé: What caliper is it ?
[2021-10-29T21:59:03] sombre_enfant: The cheap one, not the one with la durite articulé
[2021-10-29T21:59:07] sombre_enfant: Nutt
[2021-10-29T21:59:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe it's not the same with "la durite articulée"
[2021-10-29T21:59:37] Face de Pin Sucé: X)
[2021-10-29T22:00:31] Happy Giraffe: Does anybody know a good place to search for caliper mount for Monorim fork?
[2021-10-29T22:00:37] sombre_enfant: Will check with some ali seller if i can only get the caliper since its the same lever and i dont need the sensor
[2021-10-29T22:00:41] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1385@29-10-2021_22-00-41.jpg>
[2021-10-29T22:01:04] Happy Giraffe: Should be like this red+alu part but not crappy like above
[2021-10-29T22:01:13] sombre_enfant: 😭
[2021-10-29T22:01:32] Happy Giraffe: That seems like much better solution
[2021-10-29T22:01:54] sombre_enfant: Hell nah😭 its ok but not at all
[2021-10-29T22:02:32] Happy Giraffe: Only this place I would prefer bigger
[2021-10-29T22:02:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Check on "le bon coin de la trott" on Facebook, a lot of people sells their old Nutt when they change to Magura
[2021-10-29T22:03:01] Happy Giraffe: @SibClimb have you came across a part that could function as a caliper holder in a square fork
[2021-10-29T22:03:44] sombre_enfant: Yes i should have done it with m6,but i was in a whole other city when we done it and in a hurry 😂
[2021-10-29T22:03:50] Mirono escooters: seems better
[2021-10-29T22:04:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Mmmh nope haha
[2021-10-29T22:04:36] Happy Giraffe: The only challenge is just to line up the disc to the damn fork 😂
[2021-10-29T22:04:42] sombre_enfant: Next time i'll weld a plate or use 3 m6 with flat head
[2021-10-29T22:04:52] Happy Giraffe: Calipers have like 2-3mm movement
[2021-10-29T22:05:52] sombre_enfant: Do like Gabriel he got 3 point and big screw, also u both use the same setup
[2021-10-29T22:06:09] Happy Giraffe: Is there a pic about his setup?
[2021-10-29T22:06:21] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_1388@29-10-2021_22-06-21.jpg>
[2021-10-29T22:06:21] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_1389@29-10-2021_22-06-21.jpg>
[2021-10-29T22:06:49] Mirono escooters: Haha ye lol
[2021-10-29T22:06:56] Happy Giraffe: Thanks
[2021-10-29T22:07:05] Mirono escooters: Sickk
[2021-10-29T22:07:28] Happy Giraffe: Will do try this, gotta go to hardware store to get some stainless sheets....
[2021-10-29T22:08:12] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if thats a 160mm disc, and if he wrote up any measurements
[2021-10-29T22:10:01] sombre_enfant: Thats deffo a first price shimano 160mm
[2021-10-29T22:11:03] sombre_enfant: Also he now use 140mm to get more clearence as he said, u can just search on paolo group for his picture by his name
[2021-10-29T22:11:04] Happy Giraffe: Disc is do close to the fork so a really thin head needed for bolt haha
[2021-10-29T22:11:44] sombre_enfant: He widened the fork on many point
[2021-10-29T22:12:06] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_1390@29-10-2021_22-12-06.jpg>
[2021-10-29T22:12:06] sombre_enfant: For the lower one I made a custom bolt with a 8mm steel rod that i threaded at the end
[2021-10-29T22:12:06] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_1391@29-10-2021_22-12-06.jpg>
[2021-10-29T22:12:06] sombre_enfant: Also on the inside of the monorim i bolted a 4mm steel plate
[2021-10-29T22:13:19] sombre_enfant: He made torque arm and shii
[2021-10-29T22:15:45] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1393@29-10-2021_22-15-45.jpg>
[2021-10-29T22:15:53] Happy Giraffe: Some custom fork he got
[2021-10-29T22:16:33] Happy Giraffe: I got the spacers that came with monorim mount
[2021-10-29T22:19:03] Mirono escooters: No suspension? :(
[2021-10-29T22:20:54] Happy Giraffe: Tbh I only got it to have wider fork lol
[2021-10-29T22:21:59] sombre_enfant: Torque arm like he made too, if i was you i will just ask him in dms he a kind guy he will tell u all the size and stuff u need to copy or do better
[2021-10-29T22:26:06] Happy Giraffe: Ill msg him, if I manage to make a working solution I will put all schematics and links here
[2021-10-29T22:31:25] sombre_enfant: Cool
[2021-10-29T22:43:19] Luis Magalhaes: 🙈
[2021-10-29T22:44:16] Mirono escooters: Lol me with 9€ alie disk
[2021-10-29T22:44:19] Happy Giraffe: At that speed parachute becomes a valid option
[2021-10-29T23:01:17] Mirono escooters: 🤣🤣
[2021-10-29T23:06:48] Luis Magalhaes: The caliper is on the right or the left side?
[2021-10-29T23:16:50] Luis Magalhaes: My wolf uses right side caliper 😅
[2021-10-29T23:20:07] Happy Giraffe: Thats weird
[2021-10-29T23:20:29] Luis Magalhaes: But i think zoom made some for the right side too 😅
[2021-10-29T23:20:35] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1394@29-10-2021_23-20-35.jpg>
[2021-10-29T23:20:35] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1395@29-10-2021_23-20-35.jpg>
[2021-10-29T23:20:48] Happy Giraffe: Oh no zoom brakes😂
[2021-10-29T23:21:04] Luis Magalhaes: Its what came with it 😂
[2021-10-29T23:21:35] Luis Magalhaes: I would like to upgrade it, the front one is leaking...
[2021-10-29T23:21:43] sombre_enfant: U do 100kph casually with this brake setup ?
[2021-10-29T23:21:50] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-10-29T23:22:35] Luis Magalhaes: I do it in a straight of 10km i think i can brake 😂😂
[2021-10-29T23:23:12] Happy Giraffe: Should mount some motorcycle brakes lol
[2021-10-29T23:23:18] Luis Magalhaes: What can i use here? Any one knows?
[2021-10-29T23:23:38] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂 thats too big for it
[2021-10-29T23:24:11] Luis Magalhaes: Im not always riding at 100kmh i would be without battery in few kms 😂
[2021-10-29T23:24:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: night work ...

[2021-10-29T23:25:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: redesigned cable output and water resistance
[2021-10-29T23:26:22] Happy Giraffe: Those walls look nice
[2021-10-29T23:26:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, to prevent water to come inside ;)
[2021-10-29T23:27:19] Happy Giraffe: Do you plan to use some rubber ring or silicon on it aswell?
[2021-10-29T23:27:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and we tried to print the cable ring with TPU, it works great !
[2021-10-29T23:27:44] Happy Giraffe: Danish weather is like being thrown into the atlantic ocean
[2021-10-29T23:28:25] Happy Giraffe: Sounds great😉
[2021-10-29T23:28:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I'll see if it's necessary. I want to be able to put it 5min under the tap without water inside.
[2021-10-29T23:29:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😂😂
[2021-10-29T23:48:53] Mirono escooters: How you all space washers?
[2021-10-29T23:48:58] Mirono escooters: Sorry disk brake lol
[2021-10-29T23:50:36] Happy Giraffe: What? 😅
[2021-10-29T23:51:13] Happy Giraffe: I think I should make the mount from grade 5 titanium😂
[2021-10-29T23:51:55] Luis Magalhaes: https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/4000907283025.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.5ee3b90au8MDrD
[2021-10-29T23:51:57] Luis Magalhaes: this?
[2021-10-29T23:52:07] Mirono escooters: Sixk
[2021-10-29T23:52:09] Mirono escooters: Thanks
[2021-10-29T23:54:14] Happy Giraffe: I just used 6x regular stainsless steel washers👀😅
[2021-10-29T23:54:36] Mirono escooters: 5€ for 1 spaxer lol
[2021-10-29T23:54:43] Mirono escooters: I got like 20 xiaomi disk spacers
[2021-10-30T00:02:04] Luis Magalhaes: it was cheaper when i bought
[2021-10-30T12:40:03] Mirono escooters: Stopid question Can u (easily) paint brake calipers? Xtech Gold purple all that shit but no green
[2021-10-30T13:47:33] Mirono escooters: Oof i need to space my disk +-2cm
[2021-10-30T13:47:39] Mirono escooters: Thats 5 of those adaptors 🤣🤣
[2021-10-30T14:02:10] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-10-30T14:02:28] Luis Magalhaes: Try checking if you can get a bigger one
[2021-10-30T14:03:01] sombre_enfant: I got 1cm spacer on mine😂but my disc always go bend
[2021-10-30T14:03:11] Mirono escooters: Idk. Couldnt find. Thzse moments i want a cnc metal lol
[2021-10-30T14:03:13] Mirono escooters: How?
[2021-10-30T14:03:27] Mirono escooters: I dont wanna space 2cm with washers
[2021-10-30T14:04:55] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_1399@30-10-2021_14-04-55.jpg>
[2021-10-30T14:05:10] Mirono escooters: Oo those things i do have
[2021-10-30T14:09:22] Mirono escooters: Wich size m?
[2021-10-30T14:11:48] sombre_enfant: The screw are m4 if im right or m5 maybe, but the washer are way bigger but its not a prob at all...
[2021-10-30T14:11:58] Mirono escooters: Oki!
[2021-10-30T14:12:00] Mirono escooters: Thanks!!
[2021-10-30T14:21:03] Mirono escooters: Whats the name of tjat?
[2021-10-30T14:22:09] Happy Giraffe: If possible when you make some adapter really tall I think a solid ring would be far more stable than 5 independent washers
[2021-10-30T14:23:05] Happy Giraffe: Bolts are sideways stressed much more on independent washers and have more room for movement
[2021-10-30T14:23:51] Mirono escooters: M6 thought
[2021-10-30T14:23:52] Mirono escooters: My*
[2021-10-30T14:24:26] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but as you see the corners are not having full contact
[2021-10-30T14:24:27] Mirono escooters: Why is it never plug and play 🤣🤣
[2021-10-30T14:24:36] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1400@30-10-2021_14-24-36.jpg>
[2021-10-30T14:24:46] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-10-30T14:25:33] Happy Giraffe: Not trying to shit on anyone as brake disk aligment is hard but this is not the safest option I think
[2021-10-30T14:25:45] Mirono escooters: Yea i see why. Hmm
[2021-10-30T14:26:05] Mirono escooters: Im not paying 25€ spacers 🤣🤣🙈
[2021-10-30T14:26:27] Happy Giraffe: Sombre has CNC no?
[2021-10-30T14:26:55] Mirono escooters: @lBabacar
[2021-10-30T14:27:17] Happy Giraffe: Round one piece spacer should be easy on that
[2021-10-30T14:27:24] Mirono escooters: Yes defeni
[2021-10-30T14:28:22] Happy Giraffe: Could also sell those for 💰💰💰 as only the height people want would differ maybe
[2021-10-30T14:29:45] Mirono escooters: Yess
[2021-10-30T14:30:10] sombre_enfant: I work on it,i dont have one the price are crazy
[2021-10-30T14:30:45] sombre_enfant: Rare picture, cam are forbidden at my work place/school

[2021-10-30T14:37:33] sombre_enfant: @Mirono_escooters
[2021-10-30T14:38:32] Happy Giraffe: Yeah meant access
[2021-10-31T14:14:18] Happy Giraffe: Gabriele ignored me lol, I just build my own from my ideas then
[2021-10-31T14:14:30] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha
[2021-10-31T14:14:43] sombre_enfant: Ptdrrr
[2021-10-31T14:15:03] Happy Giraffe: 10mm steel sheet should be thick enough?
[2021-10-31T14:16:51] Mirono escooters: Defo
[2021-10-31T14:17:44] Happy Giraffe: Great, I start looking around then
[2021-10-31T14:21:13] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1402@31-10-2021_14-21-13.jpg>

[2021-10-31T14:24:17] Mirono escooters: Happy
[2021-10-31T14:24:54] Happy Giraffe: But its 6 hole

[2021-10-31T14:29:04] Mirono escooters: I have 10 monorim 5 hole spacers :) but my custom rim has 6
[2021-10-31T14:29:59] Artem Bulashev: Guys let’s try not to run off topic topics for extended periods of time 😳
[2021-10-31T14:30:14] Mirono escooters: Fair enough
[2021-10-31T14:30:24] Mirono escooters: This group is just full of smort people🥴
[2021-10-31T14:31:28] Happy Giraffe: Usually (Xiaomi/Ninebot) scooter people who switch to vesc also change motor to one that has disc holes in it. That leads to alignment issues where the spacers come in, not too far away imo but yeah
[2021-10-31T14:31:55] Happy Giraffe: In xiaomi group nobody has other motors so off topic there aswell
[2021-10-31T14:32:03] Mirono escooters: Yea

[2021-10-31T17:38:21] Happy Giraffe: @artBula Opening the side cover shouldn't require taking this part away right?
[2021-10-31T17:48:00] Happy Giraffe: Paolo said its not from blade, so I guess monorim...
[2021-10-31T17:55:38] Happy Giraffe: But can someone tell me precisely where that ring should be located in a motor?

[2021-10-31T19:02:10] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-10-31T19:02:21] Artem Bulashev: It’s not moving because it is super low power

[2021-10-31T19:07:18] Artem Bulashev: And it is tiny 12v with its own amplifier :) I actually cut down the case around white speaker to make it even smaller. Plan to install one more like this on outside behind oem screen - speaker is only 30mm and 20mm deep
[2021-10-31T19:08:15] Artem Bulashev: 2.59$ per one 😜 and small. More of alarm sound, which is what it is sold as - connected simply on ubox Horn output

[2021-10-31T20:33:06] ST VO: Maybe yes but I didn't try to put pcb in to side panel.
[2021-10-31T20:35:00] ST VO: It is close, but in this cycling siren have a 5 diferent alarms, in the aliexpress description says 3.
[2021-10-31T20:38:53] ST VO: Because lights and because aluminum profilе there after the plastic. I think is dont have enough place in the side panels.

[2021-11-01T13:42:32] Unknown: Idd
[2021-11-01T13:46:00] Happy Giraffe: Did you guys know the motors Spintend sells are Weped?
[2021-11-01T13:46:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seriously ?
[2021-11-01T13:46:20] Mirono escooters: Weped?
[2021-11-01T13:46:27] Happy Giraffe: Weped buys from same source
[2021-11-01T13:46:34] Unknown: Wow, price?
[2021-11-01T13:46:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ah ok. same source doesn't mean same model 😉
[2021-11-01T13:46:49] Happy Giraffe: 250$ for the best with 75mm magnets
[2021-11-01T13:46:56] Happy Giraffe: I meant that lol
[2021-11-01T13:46:59] Happy Giraffe: Same motor
[2021-11-01T13:47:13] Unknown: Dayum, so should be some very descent quality
[2021-11-01T13:48:08] Happy Giraffe: Theres the 60/75mm magnet versions
[2021-11-01T13:56:29] Happy Giraffe: Paolo wu told me he will use them, with Single Ubox👀👀
[2021-11-01T13:56:53] Happy Giraffe: Torque will be insane with those
[2021-11-01T13:57:07] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-01T14:04:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok ! 👍

[2021-11-02T10:51:10] sombre_enfant: Elle fait un peu de la peine la board...
[2021-11-02T10:51:49] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-11-02T11:41:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it feels really low cost
[2021-11-02T11:41:49] Mirono escooters: 100€
[2021-11-02T11:42:06] sombre_enfant: Yes thats the first thing u notice looking at the board
[2021-11-02T11:42:29] Mirono escooters: If it works and is smol im happy
[2021-11-02T11:42:35] sombre_enfant: Seems expensive from how it looks...
[2021-11-02T11:42:44] Mirono escooters: For 84v 100a? Mjeh
[2021-11-02T11:42:53] Artem Bulashev: What is that? The light board ?
[2021-11-02T11:43:04] Artem Bulashev: 😂
[2021-11-02T11:43:10] Artem Bulashev: VESC of your own
[2021-11-02T11:43:12] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-11-02T11:43:17] sombre_enfant: 100a but for how long
[2021-11-02T11:43:48] Mirono escooters: My friend rode 60a and it was fine :)
[2021-11-02T11:43:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, the flipsky 75100 😉 found on endlesssphere
[2021-11-02T11:43:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Wait what ? Link ?
[2021-11-02T11:43:58] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2021-11-02T11:44:07] sombre_enfant: So u got it ?
[2021-11-02T11:44:09] Artem Bulashev: Looks pathetic 🤣🤣
[2021-11-02T11:44:16] Mirono escooters: Friend Not me
[2021-11-02T11:44:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Weped is 60mm magnets
[2021-11-02T11:44:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-11-02T11:45:01] Artem Bulashev: I mean
[2021-11-02T11:45:09] Artem Bulashev: What else would one expect for that price lol
[2021-11-02T11:52:04] sombre_enfant: This ig https://spintend.com/collections/diy-electric-scooter-parts/products/11-3500w-hubmotor-for-electric-fat-scooter
[2021-11-02T11:58:40] Face de Pin Sucé: This is 65mm huameng motors
[2021-11-02T11:59:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Not Weped motors
[2021-11-02T11:59:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Not 75mm
[2021-11-02T11:59:28] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-11-02T12:01:24] sombre_enfant: Check with him maybe he was trippin
[2021-11-02T14:19:54] Mirono escooters: Yellow magnets mean?
[2021-11-02T14:20:00] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1428@02-11-2021_14-20-00.jpg>
[2021-11-02T14:23:57] Happy Giraffe: He said something about 250$ motor which currently doesn't exist there
[2021-11-02T14:45:55] Artem Bulashev: Gold plating 😂
[2021-11-02T14:46:19] Artem Bulashev: A bit of rust man likely
[2021-11-02T14:46:49] Mirono escooters: Doesnt seem like rust
[2021-11-02T14:47:01] Mirono escooters: This motor prob got hot
[2021-11-02T14:47:07] Mirono escooters: Windings melted
[2021-11-02T14:47:13] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-11-02T14:47:17] Artem Bulashev: Not sure
[2021-11-02T14:47:23] Artem Bulashev: Don’t have enough knowledge
[2021-11-02T14:47:46] Artem Bulashev: It’s interesting that some magnets are while others are not at all
[2021-11-02T14:47:56] Mirono escooters: Uea
[2021-11-02T14:48:05] Mirono escooters: Im frankensteining motors together
[2021-11-02T17:31:45] Unknown: Those magnets look the same as my will in a few months shit got so hot today, when i was almoast home and stopped it would'nt even take off anymore 😂 had to push it up to like 6-8 kmh before it started taking off just very slowly
[2021-11-02T17:32:36] Artem Bulashev: You have temp protection with temp sensor or just magnets lost charge temperarely due to heat?
[2021-11-02T17:41:28] Unknown: No temp sensor in, but it is indeed temp due to heat, cold it works just fine haha
[2021-11-02T18:22:14] Mirono escooters: That sounds Like vesc overheated andd went into protectio
[2021-11-02T18:22:34] Mirono escooters: Huh is that possible? Temporalily damage?
[2021-11-02T18:36:41] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-11-02T18:37:13] Artem Bulashev: Magnets at high team stop exiting Magnetic field and it weakens after certain temperature
[2021-11-02T18:37:40] Artem Bulashev: Once temps gets back to normal it will be restored
[2021-11-02T18:38:08] Artem Bulashev: But not fully. Damage is done and field will be weaker after such accident
[2021-11-02T18:38:42] Artem Bulashev: Generally speaking magnets don’t like temps above 80-100c depending on the grade of magnet
[2021-11-02T18:40:33] Mirono escooters: Oempf
[2021-11-02T18:40:50] Mirono escooters: Anyone made a -273* cooled motor yet? ;)
[2021-11-02T20:20:03] Unknown: Well, might be vesc idk, havent checked it 😂 will do, could be since i set start reducing at 80 and end 90°
[2021-11-02T20:46:39] Artem Bulashev: In my experience windings get to 80c when motor cover is only about 35c and motor hub you can feel is about 45c
[2021-11-02T20:48:05] Mirono escooters: With statorade (where do u guys buu that? Oil gives resistance right?)
[2021-11-02T20:49:31] Artem Bulashev: Magnets don’t touch windings so it would take a while for them to get to same temp (first air inside would need to get to same temp and than magnets heat up to it - on that note aluminium cover that is air cooled is about 20c colder than magnets on 20c day) So if your cover gets to 60c which is painful to the fingers, better stop
[2021-11-02T20:52:23] Happy Giraffe: Finally someone who understands how shit works😂
[2021-11-02T20:52:40] Happy Giraffe: What do you think could be done to improve motor temps other than ferro?
[2021-11-02T20:52:48] Mirono escooters: Oil?
[2021-11-02T20:53:21] Happy Giraffe: If windings are source of heat then i they would need some thermal shit against cover lol
[2021-11-02T20:54:57] Happy Giraffe: If fully filled that oil always touches coil + case it should be insane improvement
[2021-11-02T20:57:50] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-11-02T20:57:53] Mirono escooters: I know guys who do it
[2021-11-02T20:59:21] Happy Giraffe: In bigger motors with lower amps it might be too much of an overkill, like my CPU cooler heatsink that never gets more than handwarm from the end of it😂
[2021-11-02T21:05:40] sombre_enfant: Oil,ferro fluid is just for condictivuity it dont decrease heat
[2021-11-02T21:07:11] Mirono escooters: Conductivity to disk to evaporate in air
[2021-11-02T21:07:15] Mirono escooters: Heat
[2021-11-02T21:07:21] Mirono escooters: Oil has heat capacity too so 2 in 1
[2021-11-02T21:07:35] Mirono escooters: But a tiny bit resistance Would oil lezk throufh bearing?
[2021-11-02T21:08:27] Unknown: When i get home often my outside plates are arround 40-50 degrees on hand
[2021-11-02T21:08:34] Unknown: Well, 40-45
[2021-11-02T21:14:57] sombre_enfant: At some point motor shouldnt even heat...
[2021-11-02T21:15:46] Unknown: Motor measures out at like 33 amps, i push 75- 125A max
[2021-11-02T21:22:08] Unknown: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CU1kfZfAMQ4/?utm_medium=share_sheet
[2021-11-02T21:22:24] Unknown: Fr never tought of something like that 😂
[2021-11-02T21:25:36] Happy Giraffe: They exactly decrease heat😅
[2021-11-02T21:26:41] Happy Giraffe: But on 25°c sunny day the temperature delta is lower than winter between motor and outside so efficiency is needed
[2021-11-02T21:30:42] sombre_enfant: Actually increase the feeling of heat on the case, thats how u know its working, but people who say it decrease the temp by the feeling of the cover they just get placebo effect
[2021-11-02T21:32:43] Happy Giraffe: This is the stuff that confuses most people
[2021-11-02T21:33:20] Happy Giraffe: But as we all know it helps heat transfer to outside
[2021-11-02T21:33:32] Unknown: I did'nt put ferro in yet though
[2021-11-02T21:34:09] Happy Giraffe: Only way to find out internal temperature would be to place a sensor
[2021-11-02T21:38:45] Mirono escooters: It helps heat get outside..
[2021-11-02T21:39:30] Happy Giraffe: At our point anything is better heat conductor than air tho😅 except maybe some insulation
[2021-11-02T21:40:04] Mirono escooters: Haha yes
[2021-11-02T21:40:15] Mirono escooters: Except vacuum inside motort ;)
[2021-11-02T21:40:21] Mirono escooters: Oil would be nice and inexpensivr
[2021-11-02T21:40:30] Happy Giraffe: Or some foam lol
[2021-11-02T21:40:37] Mirono escooters: Foam??
[2021-11-02T21:40:40] Mirono escooters: Ohh yes
[2021-11-02T21:40:41] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2021-11-02T21:40:53] Happy Giraffe: The stuff they use on house insulation
[2021-11-02T21:42:55] Mirono escooters: I was confused how u would get it in But its not like a vacuum is.realistoc
[2021-11-02T21:43:22] Happy Giraffe: Oil?
[2021-11-02T21:43:57] Mirono escooters: No foam
[2021-11-02T21:44:03] Artem Bulashev: Guys
[2021-11-02T21:44:06] Artem Bulashev: Stop stop
[2021-11-02T21:44:09] Artem Bulashev: 🤣
[2021-11-02T21:44:27] Mirono escooters: We are technically good with subject
[2021-11-02T21:44:32] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-02T21:44:35] Mirono escooters: Vesc with motor Motor hot Solving hot motor
[2021-11-02T21:44:39] Mirono escooters: See
[2021-11-02T21:44:44] Artem Bulashev: 🤪
[2021-11-02T21:44:55] Artem Bulashev: Ok now I skimmed through your exchange
[2021-11-02T21:45:02] Artem Bulashev: Few things to explain first
[2021-11-02T21:45:57] Artem Bulashev: Gravity and centrifugal forces and “fero” means that All liquid will be concentrated NOT around the coils, but exclusively around the magnets on outside of the rim.
[2021-11-02T21:46:11] Artem Bulashev: Ferrofluid is made to decrease magnets temp mainly
[2021-11-02T21:46:25] Happy Giraffe: Sounds good enough
[2021-11-02T21:47:09] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-02T21:47:17] Artem Bulashev: It adds capacity to magnets and allows heat MAGNETS heat to be transferred away from magnets to the rim which is than cooled and has smaller delta between rim temp and magnets temp
[2021-11-02T21:47:28] Artem Bulashev: There is almost no effect on winding temp
[2021-11-02T21:47:42] Artem Bulashev: Winding heat up for 2 reasons -
[2021-11-02T21:48:40] Happy Giraffe: Windings can handle more heat I assume? Though I have seen many burned ones😅
[2021-11-02T21:48:41] Artem Bulashev: - length of single turn (startor hight basically) - number of turns used (more turns more single conductor length) - thickness of wire used for winding (thinner conductor = more resistance = more heat)
[2021-11-02T21:49:28] Artem Bulashev: Winding can handle normally about 120c before lack (emal) will burn through, some can do 150c +
[2021-11-02T21:49:45] Artem Bulashev: Magnets don’t like above 80c or 100c depending on magnet type
[2021-11-02T21:50:15] Artem Bulashev: You can’t shield winding as I saw some one say above 😅😅
[2021-11-02T21:50:52] Artem Bulashev: FOC is more efficient in driving motor - less heat on motor than squarewave would do to deliver same watt to the ground
[2021-11-02T21:51:17] Artem Bulashev: Rim with design like Vsett has are designed this way to allow cooling of the rim
[2021-11-02T21:51:44] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1429@02-11-2021_21-51-44.jpg>
[2021-11-02T21:51:57] Artem Bulashev: Smaller startor but better cooling
[2021-11-02T21:51:59] Happy Giraffe: Same with Blade
[2021-11-02T21:52:04] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-11-02T21:52:08] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-02T21:52:10] Artem Bulashev: It’s not by mistake
[2021-11-02T21:52:13] Mirono escooters: And my 1200w aftermarket
[2021-11-02T21:52:19] Artem Bulashev: Hope that clarifies some things
[2021-11-02T21:52:30] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I’m considering something unconventional
[2021-11-02T21:52:31] Happy Giraffe: Thanks!👍
[2021-11-02T21:52:36] Mirono escooters: Ur a boss
[2021-11-02T21:52:58] Artem Bulashev: I’m thinking of rising the temp sensor inside wheel away from the winding up into the air
[2021-11-02T21:53:08] Artem Bulashev: Because really I’m not worried about winding temp
[2021-11-02T21:53:15] Artem Bulashev: But I want to know temp of the air
[2021-11-02T21:53:25] Artem Bulashev: As it is air that heats up magnets technically
[2021-11-02T21:53:53] Happy Giraffe: Impossible to put on magnet?
[2021-11-02T21:53:59] Artem Bulashev: …
[2021-11-02T21:54:15] Artem Bulashev: :)) draw me a diagram how would that look on out runner motor
[2021-11-02T21:54:23] Happy Giraffe: Im tired, I dont wanna think myself😂
[2021-11-02T21:54:31] Artem Bulashev: No it is not :))
[2021-11-02T21:54:49] Mirono escooters: Impossible
[2021-11-02T21:54:50] Artem Bulashev: Magnets spin around startor not touching it
[2021-11-02T21:54:52] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2021-11-02T21:55:06] Artem Bulashev: On inn-runner sure
[2021-11-02T21:57:55] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-02T22:17:36] Unknown: Laser termometer module
[2021-11-02T22:18:01] Happy Giraffe: Laser pointing at magnets?😂
[2021-11-02T22:18:10] Unknown: Yes
[2021-11-02T22:18:20] Unknown: No other way
[2021-11-02T22:28:58] Happy Giraffe: Sounds complicated haha
[2021-11-02T22:32:58] Unknown: Imo pointless to do something like this...
[2021-11-02T22:34:05] Unknown: I have my vsett 10 stock and can’t be more happy
[2021-11-02T22:36:57] Happy Giraffe: Yeah true, having big enough motor and using common sense with amps it should be ok
[2021-11-02T22:38:56] Unknown: I never ride at more than 40-50km/h for me its more than enough
[2021-11-02T22:39:03] Mirono escooters: Same
[2021-11-02T22:41:26] Artem Bulashev: Same
[2021-11-02T22:41:47] Artem Bulashev: 99% of people will be happy with it and it’s power
[2021-11-02T22:44:01] Unknown: The power it have for me is crazy the start for example at 5 ..... you cant touch the throtle
[2021-11-02T22:44:27] Artem Bulashev: That requires a lot more than simple one wire signal :)
[2021-11-02T22:45:12] Artem Bulashev: Let’s keep vsett group for vsett talk ;-) ❤️
[2021-11-02T22:45:27] Unknown: Of course yes its crazy like the idea to monitor the magnets temperature
[2021-11-02T22:46:19] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that’s why oem usually don’t use temp sensor - they design motor to be able to handle the controller they use - no variables 👌 controller over heats before motor gets too hot
[2021-11-02T22:46:32] Mirono escooters: My problem is i accidentally touch it and it flies lol
[2021-11-02T22:46:43] Artem Bulashev: In diy world that whole other story we push motor to the maximum more often
[2021-11-02T22:46:50] Unknown: Thats why i have it at 1
[2021-11-02T22:47:06] Mirono escooters: I just use hand to feel lol
[2021-11-02T22:47:07] Unknown: But for some reason it reset itself sometimes
[2021-11-02T22:47:17] Unknown: 2 times until now
[2021-11-02T22:47:31] Unknown: And it put it at 5
[2021-11-02T22:47:50] Mirono escooters: I have it at 1 too but this aftermarket controller.. no filtering at all.. its shitt. Shoots kff
[2021-11-02T22:47:51] Mirono escooters: Off
[2021-11-02T22:47:56] Mirono escooters: Vesc for the win there
[2021-11-02T22:48:26] Unknown: Mine comes with the new controller and is very smooth at 1
[2021-11-02T22:48:50] Mirono escooters: *i dont have a vsett i talk about a random awd controller*
[2021-11-02T22:49:14] Unknown: Ah ok i thought you meant vsett
[2021-11-02T22:49:23] Mirono escooters: I wish

[2021-11-02T23:01:37] Luis Magalhaes: Daniel cadete is a friend of mine from Portugal, he is thinking of making a upgrated xiaomi i told him about vesc's 😂
[2021-11-02T23:02:01] Luis Magalhaes: If any one can share some photos and info he will be appreciated 😁👍
[2021-11-02T23:02:13] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 4.2? ;)
[2021-11-02T23:02:32] Daniel Cadete: Hi guys
[2021-11-02T23:02:54] Happy Giraffe: Hey👋
[2021-11-02T23:04:12] Unknown: No flipsky 4.2 😂flipsky 75 100 and upgrade transistors to descent ones
[2021-11-02T23:04:24] Unknown: Because they looked like total shit
[2021-11-02T23:04:33] Unknown: And edit it a bit probably 😂
[2021-11-02T23:05:50] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-11-02T23:06:05] Luis Magalhaes: He wants to put some power to it
[2021-11-02T23:06:09] Luis Magalhaes: And dual motor
[2021-11-02T23:07:14] Mirono escooters: Why upgrade ?
[2021-11-02T23:07:42] Daniel Cadete: I want to put dual motor, didn't diceded yet if I will use 60v ou 72v
[2021-11-02T23:08:10] Happy Giraffe: If the Spintend single ubox lasts longer on my 2nd try maybe I could recommend it after 1000km😅
[2021-11-02T23:08:53] Happy Giraffe: Dual motor not necessarily needed if you use one bigger motor
[2021-11-02T23:08:57] Mirono escooters: Ieuw spintend
[2021-11-02T23:09:05] Mirono escooters: But its cool
[2021-11-02T23:10:29] Daniel Cadete: I was thinking on using mantis pro motors
[2021-11-02T23:10:30] Happy Giraffe: I think I will be limited by grip of the 3" wide front tire with Blade motor and 95A phase. Just getting the vesc out of customs is pain in the ass
[2021-11-02T23:10:59] Happy Giraffe: Is there a specific reason why you want to keep xiaomi frame?
[2021-11-02T23:11:23] Mirono escooters: In front not mucho grippo
[2021-11-02T23:12:10] Mirono escooters: Because cheap and cool and many mods My prior reasons is cheap Second is soo big community= super much mods= cheap And its good show off for my business lol
[2021-11-02T23:12:34] Mirono escooters: Who here has xiaomi frame with vesc?
[2021-11-02T23:14:08] Daniel Cadete: It looks nice, and I want a small scooter, if not I will end buying a blade 10d
[2021-11-02T23:16:16] Luis Magalhaes: He had a bigger scooter, but now is a unicicle man 😂
[2021-11-02T23:21:51] Happy Giraffe: Maybe Ninebot G30 could be better for awd with vesc
[2021-11-02T23:22:09] Happy Giraffe: Can fit one big battery+dual vesc inside
[2021-11-02T23:22:39] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi Pro can't fit both inside without additional batteries in bags etc
[2021-11-02T23:23:34] Daniel Cadete: Yes, the battery will be external
[2021-11-02T23:23:36] Mirono escooters: +1
[2021-11-02T23:23:41] Luis Magalhaes: He wants to use just the deck for controllers, and a bag outside for battery
[2021-11-02T23:23:49] Mirono escooters: Wtf?
[2021-11-02T23:23:53] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-11-02T23:24:10] Happy Giraffe: You need a backpack battery for awd, and with awg6 cables lol
[2021-11-02T23:24:18] Luis Magalhaes: Like the dualtrons at 100v 😁💪
[2021-11-02T23:24:31] Mirono escooters: Hahaha yes
[2021-11-02T23:24:44] Happy Giraffe: If deck has only vesc then Xiaomi Pro frame fits Spintend dual esc
[2021-11-02T23:24:46] Mirono escooters: I putted 2 controllers exterbal in bag and used all space for batteries Fits so much then without controllers
[2021-11-02T23:25:18] Luis Magalhaes: What battery you have inside?
[2021-11-02T23:25:27] Happy Giraffe: Two big motors, if you want 30Amps for each you need more than 60A continuous battery👀
[2021-11-02T23:25:39] Mirono escooters: Me? 13s5p 21700
[2021-11-02T23:27:21] Happy Giraffe: If you use spintend single vesc, then Xiaomi Pro can fit 13s6p battery inside with small spacer
[2021-11-02T23:28:04] Happy Giraffe: Or you can do like @francois_schempers and use awd, dual vesc and split battery inside + bag
[2021-11-02T23:28:19] Mirono escooters: Or on a rack like me😇
[2021-11-02T23:28:42] Luis Magalhaes: 👍
[2021-11-02T23:29:17] Daniel Cadete: Minimum I want is 16s
[2021-11-02T23:29:30] Mirono escooters: U want speeeed? Xd
[2021-11-02T23:29:47] Mirono escooters: Why 16s+ ? On what factors
[2021-11-02T23:29:57] Happy Giraffe: Trust me on xiaomi frame you dont want more than 50kmh
[2021-11-02T23:30:05] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-11-02T23:30:08] Mirono escooters: I tried. Didnt go well
[2021-11-02T23:30:10] Mirono escooters: 😇
[2021-11-02T23:30:13] Luis Magalhaes: 16S on mantis motors are like 65kmh on minimotors 30A or 28A
[2021-11-02T23:30:57] Daniel Cadete: Speed 60/65 is ok, a 16s battery is easier to find for me
[2021-11-02T23:31:09] Daniel Cadete: 27A
[2021-11-02T23:31:10] Happy Giraffe: 13s on my blade motor should give me 65kmh
[2021-11-02T23:31:19] Mirono escooters: Oempf get good mods on xiaomi 65kmh
[2021-11-02T23:31:31] Luis Magalhaes: At what amps?
[2021-11-02T23:31:47] Happy Giraffe: Not much I think, voltage limit comes soon
[2021-11-02T23:32:15] Happy Giraffe: Also added air resistance so yeah I have to test
[2021-11-02T23:32:15] Luis Magalhaes: A original blade at 60v and chinese controllers can do 80kmh i think
[2021-11-02T23:32:23] Luis Magalhaes: Dual motor
[2021-11-02T23:33:52] Happy Giraffe: But you need to realize 50kmh is dangerous (especially on a Xiaomi😂)and you need to upgrade everything. Brakes, lights, tires, suspension, frame. Buy full motorcycle riding gear..
[2021-11-02T23:34:04] Mirono escooters: Yea. Upgrade shit ton
[2021-11-02T23:34:12] Mirono escooters: Not on a stock🤣 far from
[2021-11-02T23:35:02] Happy Giraffe: I will weight my scooter later, but I think it weighs 2.5-3x of the stock😅
[2021-11-02T23:35:13] Daniel Cadete: Yes, the gear I have, and if I want the scooter with power I will invest in safety too
[2021-11-02T23:36:08] Mirono escooters: If i need to get mine down or up 4 stairs its already hard lmao
[2021-11-02T23:36:45] Artem Bulashev: Man please use other frame
[2021-11-02T23:37:11] Artem Bulashev: Stem will snap from 16s type of acceleration with better motors
[2021-11-02T23:37:28] Artem Bulashev: It’s not made to withstand such loads
[2021-11-02T23:38:00] Happy Giraffe: Haha, yeah Xiaomi...G30 might be bit better but not sure how much
[2021-11-02T23:38:04] Artem Bulashev: Many m365 that are modes for crazy acceleration for that frame end up with stem snapped
[2021-11-02T23:38:23] Artem Bulashev: That thing weight a lot
[2021-11-02T23:38:32] Artem Bulashev: And try it’s without dual motor
[2021-11-02T23:38:35] Artem Bulashev: No suspention
[2021-11-02T23:38:38] Mirono escooters: Way better
[2021-11-02T23:38:47] Artem Bulashev: No disk breaks
[2021-11-02T23:38:54] Happy Giraffe: Less than my Xiaomi 😅
[2021-11-02T23:38:56] Artem Bulashev: And cost like 800€
[2021-11-02T23:38:57] Mirono escooters: We can mod ;)
[2021-11-02T23:39:10] Artem Bulashev: At that point better take vsett 9
[2021-11-02T23:39:13] Artem Bulashev: 950€
[2021-11-02T23:39:20] Happy Giraffe: Yep
[2021-11-02T23:39:23] Artem Bulashev: But dual suspention Dual disk brakes
[2021-11-02T23:39:25] Mirono escooters: G30 is boss I got a rental frame 10kg heavier then stock lol
[2021-11-02T23:39:30] Mirono escooters: 500€*
[2021-11-02T23:39:45] Artem Bulashev: New it is 800€ here in Austria
[2021-11-02T23:39:50] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2021-11-02T23:39:55] Mirono escooters: proper scam
[2021-11-02T23:39:59] Mirono escooters: Uses 2500mah cells 🤣
[2021-11-02T23:40:16] Artem Bulashev: Nope
[2021-11-02T23:40:31] Artem Bulashev: Media Markt 760€
[2021-11-02T23:40:40] Happy Giraffe: G30 sleeper build could be nice, original motor awd and only little deck extension
[2021-11-02T23:40:45] Mirono escooters: If u find frame like me or a cheap second hand super good frame But for that price
[2021-11-02T23:40:47] Artem Bulashev: Amazon 815€
[2021-11-02T23:41:04] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I say vsett 9 is a lot better value
[2021-11-02T23:41:07] Artem Bulashev: 950€
[2021-11-02T23:41:10] Mirono escooters: My rental needs a good clean up. Hope i just have bad welds And flipsky 4.2 fan mod lmao
[2021-11-02T23:41:12] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-11-02T23:41:28] Artem Bulashev: Smaller wheels though :( but really not a problem
[2021-11-02T23:41:42] Artem Bulashev: And better motor
[2021-11-02T23:41:53] Happy Giraffe: I also think G30 overpriced for what it is, got my Xiaomi Pro two years ago brand new 408€ free shipping🌚
[2021-11-02T23:42:02] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-11-02T23:42:06] Happy Giraffe: Can change them?
[2021-11-02T23:42:33] Artem Bulashev: How much it cost to get dual suspention and dual disk breaks and single 500w motor?
[2021-11-02T23:43:21] Happy Giraffe: Too much, 200€ for suspensions, second disc came with my motor
[2021-11-02T23:43:52] Happy Giraffe: Front motor + front suspension is most cost effective
[2021-11-02T23:44:00] Artem Bulashev: The profile is as thick as Xiaomi 10 inch because rim size is 5.2inch instead of 6.1inch on Xiaomi. But tire is 8.5inch
[2021-11-02T23:44:19] Mirono escooters: Ieuw
[2021-11-02T23:44:20] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2021-11-02T23:44:29] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi doesn't have 10" only Ninebot G30
[2021-11-02T23:44:30] Mirono escooters: I never understood y they hahe soo small wheels
[2021-11-02T23:45:27] Happy Giraffe: Blade motor 180€ Suspension to fit it 80€ Brake adapter kit (shit) 40€ Rear hub replacement with CST 2.5" 30€+20€
[2021-11-02T23:45:37] Happy Giraffe: 350€
[2021-11-02T23:45:57] Mirono escooters: But front wheel drive
[2021-11-02T23:46:03] Mirono escooters: And then its still unsafe with folding
[2021-11-02T23:46:37] Happy Giraffe: Stock folding is much stronger than aftermarket parts, because it bends and doesnt snap
[2021-11-02T23:46:40] Mirono escooters: No point in so good upgrades if base is still kinda shit
[2021-11-02T23:46:53] Happy Giraffe: I love mine
[2021-11-02T23:46:53] Mirono escooters: Atleast get a x lock Or non folding (i love that)
[2021-11-02T23:47:00] Happy Giraffe: That makes it weaker (my stem is still functioning as brand new after two years...maybe its the user...)
[2021-11-02T23:47:08] Artem Bulashev: Fun
[2021-11-02T23:47:10] Artem Bulashev: 😂
[2021-11-02T23:47:19] Mirono escooters: I mine too but some basic upgrades are handy xd
[2021-11-02T23:47:25] Artem Bulashev: Considering m365 prob2 cost 500€ now
[2021-11-02T23:47:32] Mirono escooters: Yea :/
[2021-11-02T23:47:43] Mirono escooters: I get mine second hand 50€ or smth lol
[2021-11-02T23:47:50] Artem Bulashev: And that’s 850€ without Rear suspention and without Rear disk brake
[2021-11-02T23:47:50] Mirono escooters: I would never buy new
[2021-11-02T23:48:00] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-11-02T23:48:02] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, it was then dirt cheap deal. Also in Denmark or Finland you would get fucked by riding a Vsett I think
[2021-11-02T23:48:05] Artem Bulashev: Used yeah
[2021-11-02T23:48:08] Mirono escooters: But for 50-100€ defo good frapes
[2021-11-02T23:48:12] Mirono escooters: Frames
[2021-11-02T23:48:19] Happy Giraffe: There is rear disc brake
[2021-11-02T23:48:23] Mirono escooters: M365 looks sleek
[2021-11-02T23:48:27] Artem Bulashev: It exists as 500w version to comply ;-)
[2021-11-02T23:48:36] Happy Giraffe: But front is 100€ extra for magura😅
[2021-11-02T23:48:42] Mirono escooters: Oempf
[2021-11-02T23:48:44] Luis Magalhaes: He already has a xiaomi 😂
[2021-11-02T23:48:49] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-11-02T23:48:53] Mirono escooters: Yea fair
[2021-11-02T23:49:05] Mirono escooters: Idk if we are helping ay this point
[2021-11-02T23:49:07] Artem Bulashev: Just saying because seems like he plans to use it as 50-60kmh scooter
[2021-11-02T23:49:17] Artem Bulashev: And this is no go for that frame
[2021-11-02T23:49:22] Mirono escooters: +1
[2021-11-02T23:49:28] Mirono escooters: Or u need to mod it to death
[2021-11-02T23:49:28] Happy Giraffe: Lmao, maybe I try to buy Vsett 9 frame in Finland then. Because I dont wanna ship an old xiaomi frame with 100€ postage😂
[2021-11-02T23:49:31] Artem Bulashev: By the time he upgrades all he needs
[2021-11-02T23:49:41] Luis Magalhaes: He had a 60v scooter but sold and now rides unicicle, but has a m365 and was thinking to do something powerfull just for fun 😂
[2021-11-02T23:49:47] Artem Bulashev: Like battery and controller and suspention and motor and disk brakes
[2021-11-02T23:50:00] Artem Bulashev: This scooter will cost 1200€ in mods alone
[2021-11-02T23:50:17] Happy Giraffe: Me sweating closer to 1700-1800😅
[2021-11-02T23:50:29] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2021-11-02T23:50:30] Artem Bulashev: Which is price of like vsett 9+ with proper battery dual motor and dual suspention and dual disk brakes
[2021-11-02T23:50:35] Mirono escooters: Me proud with 500 per scoot +-
[2021-11-02T23:50:40] Artem Bulashev: So my point exactly
[2021-11-02T23:51:16] Artem Bulashev: So just make sure you do math before going into m365 molding because it is just too far away from where he want to be
[2021-11-02T23:51:18] Happy Giraffe: But Im satisfied as it covers all my expenses on it, inc. 48v25Ah batteries
[2021-11-02T23:51:27] Mirono escooters: Oof with 35e
[2021-11-02T23:52:02] Artem Bulashev: Yeah vsett would come with 48v21ah lg mj1 battery as well in that cost which is less than what you named :))
[2021-11-02T23:52:05] Happy Giraffe: I wanted portable scooter and had to pay more so I chose Xiaomi. If I wanted bigger for sure Vsett 10 would have been it
[2021-11-02T23:52:53] Artem Bulashev: Vsett 9+ is 24.5kg which is probably more than your m365 after mods with battery. How heavy is it? There is a situation where you think you are saving by making lots of 100€ upgrades to cheap 400€ scooter, that ends up to have no warrenty and being more expensive than pre made scooter with same performance for cheaper :)
[2021-11-02T23:53:38] Happy Giraffe: I will measure later when I got vesc and all put together
[2021-11-02T23:53:45] Happy Giraffe: I think 25-30kg
[2021-11-02T23:54:15] Luis Magalhaes: I sold my m365 and upgrade to a ubgo 1005 knowing the cost it would be to mod, and for a wolf for the same thing 😂
[2021-11-02T23:54:34] Luis Magalhaes: But now i started modding the wolf 😅 so...
[2021-11-02T23:55:10] Artem Bulashev: Yeah so my point exactly again :) But one is made to be driven 55kmh while other frame is not ready for that
[2021-11-02T23:56:27] Happy Giraffe: But tldr of this 100 messages... Only get Xiaomi Pro size frame if: -you dont need much range (Dual motor vesc takes more space of battery) -you ride 50kmh max -you need the portability or smaller size for train luggage compartment etc. -you have most of tools to diy custom solutions for yourself
[2021-11-02T23:56:42] Happy Giraffe: Yep, thats why I went to the gym😎
[2021-11-02T23:56:44] Artem Bulashev: Dual motor stock vsett 9+ will smoke your single m365 while costing less that’s the problem of moding scooter that’s too far off where user wants it to be
[2021-11-02T23:57:12] Mirono escooters: Wich mods?
[2021-11-02T23:57:15] Happy Giraffe: Propably, but its a hobby for me anyways. And its cute to have Xiaomi😉
[2021-11-02T23:57:49] Artem Bulashev: Yeah, that’s a case of when journey is more important than destination
[2021-11-02T23:57:52] Artem Bulashev: 🤷‍♂️
[2021-11-02T23:58:12] Mirono escooters: Same
[2021-11-02T23:58:15] Artem Bulashev: I almost went m365 / max g30 way
[2021-11-02T23:58:18] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2021-11-02T23:58:20] Happy Giraffe: I got both dont worry, I was more than pleased with the performance of shitty 1000w china motor
[2021-11-02T23:58:26] Artem Bulashev: Until I did the math😄
[2021-11-02T23:58:26] Mirono escooters: I love modding yourney Whats the fun in buying pre made shit
[2021-11-02T23:58:45] Happy Giraffe: Vsett 9 I had no idea 2 years ago
[2021-11-02T23:58:50] Unknown: I do and mod its caps
[2021-11-02T23:58:56] Mirono escooters: Being able to say "build myself" and having 1 no one on planet has is worth it
[2021-11-02T23:59:08] Unknown: To a descent brand they looked cheap chinese shit
[2021-11-02T23:59:21] Luis Magalhaes: Ubox, other battery in parallel, and did not do more because of the cost 😂😂
[2021-11-02T23:59:38] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I get such kicks from the frame being so small and portable but still giving me adrenaline when I want it👀
[2021-11-03T00:00:19] Mirono escooters: +1
[2021-11-03T00:00:46] Happy Giraffe: But as I said in my first 5 messages if he has a reason to stay on Xiaomi so we are agreeing its not for majority of the people...Also Ive modded it for two years now so I experienced it myself😅
[2021-11-03T00:00:59] Mirono escooters: For me its the cheap part (only student) And the mods availble for relatively cheap. No other scooter has this And community mods these to death. Never seen on any other scootscoot
[2021-11-03T00:01:24] Mirono escooters: And originality almost forgot
[2021-11-03T00:01:34] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1430@03-11-2021_00-01-34.jpg>
[2021-11-03T00:01:34] Artem Bulashev: Guys the only difference is 9cm longer… once you install front and rear suspention on your m365 it will be same - 3cm higher steering can be ignored as this is Xiaomi on 8.5inch tires, will be same on 10 inch tires or if you upgrade suspention.
[2021-11-03T00:01:35] Luis Magalhaes: I like to see modded xiaomis 😂 but in my case was not enough, but i like them a lot
[2021-11-03T00:02:07] Luis Magalhaes: Hum...
[2021-11-03T00:02:14] Mirono escooters: Will send mine when finally riding lol

[2021-11-03T00:02:40] Mirono escooters: But i dont care about size

[2021-11-03T00:04:38] Happy Giraffe: I dont need another motor etc
[2021-11-03T00:04:47] Artem Bulashev: And you are single motor single disk brake
[2021-11-03T00:05:00] Artem Bulashev: Than see vsett 9 it is single
[2021-11-03T00:05:05] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1432@03-11-2021_00-05-05.jpg>
[2021-11-03T00:05:05] Mirono escooters: A wise person i know once said What you do yourself, you do yourselver
[2021-11-03T00:05:07] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-11-03T00:05:13] Happy Giraffe: What makes you assume I ride with one disc?
[2021-11-03T00:05:18] Happy Giraffe: I got 3 brakes😂
[2021-11-03T00:05:24] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 👍
[2021-11-03T00:05:29] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok 👌
[2021-11-03T00:05:44] Artem Bulashev: Than you will be even closer compare
[2021-11-03T00:06:09] Happy Giraffe: Magura 4-piston on front + vesc ebrake and some backup disc on back
[2021-11-03T00:06:42] Happy Giraffe: But yeah, no Vsett existed in my world 2 years ago
[2021-11-03T00:06:43] Daniel Cadete: And it's only 48v
[2021-11-03T00:07:03] Happy Giraffe: I bought the Xiaomi Pro as a big joke at first, then realized it kicks ass😂
[2021-11-03T00:07:10] Mirono escooters: V doesnt matter much it all depends on the configuration
[2021-11-03T00:07:16] Mirono escooters: They r good
[2021-11-03T00:08:44] Happy Giraffe: Sad thing is I need to disassemble whole scooter in 7 months and sell or dump frame. Then ship motor and components to Finland😑
[2021-11-03T00:09:07] Luis Magalhaes: Your moving?
[2021-11-03T00:09:16] Happy Giraffe: If all goes with the plan
[2021-11-03T00:09:25] Happy Giraffe: Small chances that I stay
[2021-11-03T00:09:46] Luis Magalhaes: Ok
[2021-11-03T00:09:57] Luis Magalhaes: So take some pictures before that 😂
[2021-11-03T00:10:19] Luis Magalhaes: And why wont you send it all to Finland?
[2021-11-03T00:11:33] Artem Bulashev: It goes 58kmh so why bother with higher voltage? Voltage works with motor Kv to determine maximum RPM unloaded, add amount of amps you push and it will determine how close to that max rpm you can get under load 👌 Rpm = speed sort of
[2021-11-03T00:11:38] Mirono escooters: Nooooo
[2021-11-03T00:12:03] Mirono escooters: Yea its stupid to just look at voltage. No idea why he does that
[2021-11-03T00:12:38] Artem Bulashev: May be he didn’t fully understand relationship
[2021-11-03T00:12:47] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-11-03T00:12:58] Happy Giraffe: Shipping costs ton, scooter frame is so big its instantly 100€
[2021-11-03T00:12:58] Mirono escooters: Will sound rude but Most noob customers look at s
[2021-11-03T00:13:07] Mirono escooters: I had a guy come to me and say he wanted 30s lol
[2021-11-03T00:13:16] Artem Bulashev: 😂
[2021-11-03T00:13:28] Daniel Cadete: For that price you can buy a blade 10d that is 60v and can go up to 75/80kmh
[2021-11-03T00:13:37] Artem Bulashev: That would be life endangering lol
[2021-11-03T00:13:43] Mirono escooters: Oempf u on a death ride
[2021-11-03T00:13:55] Luis Magalhaes: Talking about that i think i hit it 😂 last time i did 101kmh downhill and 101kmh uphill in the same place at full battery, i think thats my motors kv limit at 16S is it not?
[2021-11-03T00:14:06] Mirono escooters: Y only look at speed
[2021-11-03T00:14:21] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but that won’t be portable and considering it is based on 10x design will have whole bunch of issues 😅
[2021-11-03T00:14:26] Happy Giraffe: French guys...😘
[2021-11-03T00:14:55] Luis Magalhaes: Dam
[2021-11-03T00:14:56] Artem Bulashev: Could be. Put it on a bench and spin in the air
[2021-11-03T00:15:01] Mirono escooters: Thats a good question? Is that possible theres a limit??
[2021-11-03T00:15:13] Luis Magalhaes: Speeeed
[2021-11-03T00:15:25] Happy Giraffe: Also air resistance is insane at 100kmh
[2021-11-03T00:15:29] Artem Bulashev: Yes - unloaded max rpm
[2021-11-03T00:15:32] Mirono escooters: I remember (Yes. Xiaomi motor) 250w motor I used 15s And 20s Speed was same 50ish. Motor was abused yes but i expected a change?
[2021-11-03T00:15:34] Daniel Cadete: It is better then the 10x
[2021-11-03T00:15:57] Artem Bulashev: Isn’t it same Unicool -t10 ddm ?
[2021-11-03T00:16:07] Luis Magalhaes: Portuguese here 😂
[2021-11-03T00:16:41] Happy Giraffe: You also? Oh...you live closeby enough😂
[2021-11-03T00:16:47] Artem Bulashev: You should have max speed difference between 15a and 20s
[2021-11-03T00:16:49] Luis Magalhaes: Dont like to do that very much 😅 it vibrates a bit 😂
[2021-11-03T00:17:03] Artem Bulashev: 😳😳
[2021-11-03T00:17:10] Luis Magalhaes: Kv of motor
[2021-11-03T00:17:30] Daniel Cadete: Don't know that
[2021-11-03T00:17:43] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i have to get down in the scooter too
[2021-11-03T00:17:53] Happy Giraffe: € 1.655,25 | Original Blade 10 E-scooter 60V Dual Motor 2*1200W Top Speed 75km/h 10*3 inch Wide Tire Electric Scooter https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNrjWZc
[2021-11-03T00:18:05] Mirono escooters: Abused motor then
[2021-11-03T00:18:32] Happy Giraffe: I see familiar motor here🥰
[2021-11-03T00:18:36] Luis Magalhaes: Thats a saturated motor maybe 😅
[2021-11-03T00:18:59] Luis Magalhaes: No its different one
[2021-11-03T00:19:03] Mirono escooters: I pushed it so hard and rewinded to delta then back to star and shit Wouldnt be surprised
[2021-11-03T00:19:25] Luis Magalhaes: It already cames with sinewave controllers and some things
[2021-11-03T00:19:44] Luis Magalhaes: But its a similar frame
[2021-11-03T00:19:51] Happy Giraffe: How much was it at stock? Wolf warrior right?
[2021-11-03T00:20:47] Luis Magalhaes: Your Portuguese?
[2021-11-03T00:21:07] Happy Giraffe: No I meant your buddy as another😂
[2021-11-03T00:21:15] Artem Bulashev: Unicool was the first manufacturer of v1 or v2 of zero 10x. Than it they switch to other factory because QC was shit, than they opened there own factory because other factory also had high fail rate and casting issues. Because of that two other factories beside zero them self had right to produce zero 10x frame under different name And from there it spread like a pledge - those two factories produces parts for different companies to assemble scooters under their name and thus inherited most of issues. Some brands made slight redesigns to combat casting weaknesses of those two factories but that’s the history
[2021-11-03T00:22:02] Luis Magalhaes: Oh ok 😂😂
[2021-11-03T00:22:29] Luis Magalhaes: Wolf warrior 11 pro, the price? 2150€
[2021-11-03T00:23:29] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2021-11-03T00:23:41] Daniel Cadete: Ok ok, the chassis of the blade is better than the zero 10x, it has been reinforced
[2021-11-03T00:23:42] Luis Magalhaes: We know a blade 10 using 50A minimotors and 18S and no problems in chassis 👌
[2021-11-03T00:23:45] Mirono escooters: Chinese copying chinese shit so.. double shit?
[2021-11-03T00:23:51] Happy Giraffe: Not bad, not bad..
[2021-11-03T00:24:05] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂 all chinese..
[2021-11-03T00:24:10] Mirono escooters: I cant imagine giving 2150€ to scoot😭🤣
[2021-11-03T00:24:30] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1433@03-11-2021_00-24-30.jpg>
[2021-11-03T00:25:00] Mirono escooters: Makes me think of copying already bad homework and making it even worse
[2021-11-03T00:25:33] Artem Bulashev: I heard good things about blade 10 but never examined it
[2021-11-03T00:25:46] Artem Bulashev: Stem looks like generic stem of zero line as well
[2021-11-03T00:26:05] Artem Bulashev: So looks like they mixed and matched different innovations parts
[2021-11-03T00:26:16] Artem Bulashev: To make over all better scoot
[2021-11-03T00:26:55] Daniel Cadete: Yes, Chinese scooters are always a mix
[2021-11-03T00:27:16] Artem Bulashev: Almost
[2021-11-03T00:27:18] Happy Giraffe: So conclusion of story, with xiaomi you need to spend 1200-1500€ more, is it worth it for you?
[2021-11-03T00:27:57] Artem Bulashev: Vsett is about the only scooter I didn’t find any off the shelf part on any other scooter beside - brakes. DT and kaboo have some models that are unique but still inherit same issues as their brothers or have new structural weaknesses 🤦‍♂️
[2021-11-03T00:28:07] Luis Magalhaes: I didn't too 😂 but 10000km less in a car is a lot, i did 1200km in m365, 1300km in my ubgo 1005, and the wolf is what i said above 😂
[2021-11-03T00:28:07] Luis Magalhaes: I like more dual stem it looks stronger 😂
[2021-11-03T00:29:16] Daniel Cadete: Yes, it's a brand with better reputation for that
[2021-11-03T00:29:52] Happy Giraffe: Only things left stock in my xiaomi are frame and rear mudguard
[2021-11-03T00:30:14] Happy Giraffe: And bell ofcourse😎
[2021-11-03T00:31:00] Daniel Cadete: The most important feature 😂
[2021-11-03T00:31:40] Happy Giraffe: Thats not far from truth as it allows locked folding and is good for warning pedestrians/bikes
[2021-11-03T00:32:00] Luis Magalhaes: All have weakness is the use you do to it that counts 😂
[2021-11-03T00:32:40] Daniel Cadete: Yes, I was not joking
[2021-11-03T00:35:09] Daniel Cadete: <photos/photo_1434@03-11-2021_00-35-09.jpg>
[2021-11-03T00:35:30] Daniel Cadete: This was my previous scooter
[2021-11-03T00:36:20] Artem Bulashev: I ended up missing my trigger throttle, apperantly is really great design for scooter
[2021-11-03T00:37:13] Daniel Cadete: I changed mine, that's why it is down
[2021-11-03T00:38:01] Mirono escooters: Wich throttle everyone recommend?
[2021-11-03T00:39:52] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂
[2021-11-03T00:41:10] Luis Magalhaes: I only miss my cruise controll 😂
[2021-11-03T00:41:13] Daniel Cadete: For safety reasons it's better the ones like you have on quads
[2021-11-03T00:41:42] Luis Magalhaes: Im using one like xiaomi
[2021-11-03T00:42:33] Luis Magalhaes: Had a thump one too but dont like it very much, for me is the finger like on the original displays or the xiaomi one 😂
[2021-11-03T00:42:48] Mirono escooters: You mean twisting? Not so safe
[2021-11-03T00:43:03] Mirono escooters: Check
[2021-11-03T00:45:04] Luis Magalhaes: The thumb throtlle has a dead zone too so it was not so good for me
[2021-11-03T00:45:18] Mirono escooters: All have dead zone
[2021-11-03T00:45:31] Mirono escooters: But thumb has on my vesc so mucj
[2021-11-03T00:45:37] Mirono escooters: First 20% and last 30%
[2021-11-03T00:45:38] Mirono escooters: Xdd
[2021-11-03T00:50:25] Luis Magalhaes: But mine was from design 😅
[2021-11-03T00:50:52] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi stock, forgot to mention😂
[2021-11-03T00:51:02] Luis Magalhaes: Some people had modified the throtlle to reduce that start dead zone
[2021-11-03T00:51:17] Mirono escooters: How
[2021-11-03T00:51:23] Mirono escooters: Its nice
[2021-11-03T00:51:27] Daniel Cadete: Thumb
[2021-11-03T00:51:59] Mirono escooters: One customer asked if he could buy a better throttle because his friend ones burned because of too much speed The headaches..
[2021-11-03T00:52:02] Mirono escooters: Same dude as 30s
[2021-11-03T00:52:17] Luis Magalhaes: Wtf 😂
[2021-11-03T00:52:48] Luis Magalhaes: He was forcing the throttle to gain mor speed?! 😂
[2021-11-03T00:53:00] Mirono escooters: No idea
[2021-11-03T00:53:03] Mirono escooters: I didnt ask questions
[2021-11-03T00:53:09] Mirono escooters: For my sanity
[2021-11-03T00:53:46] Happy Giraffe: Scooter went 30kmh, throttle burned as result
[2021-11-03T00:54:31] Luis Magalhaes: Black magic 🔥😂
[2021-11-03T00:54:36] Artem Bulashev: 😶‍🌫️
[2021-11-03T00:54:40] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-11-03T01:02:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: New "lights" expansion board : * 1 front light : 5 or 12V / 10A max * 1 rear light : 5 or 12V / 10A max * 1 LEDs strip (WS2812B ou WS2815) : 5 or 12V / 10A max * 5V or 12V input / max global current 10A * 6cm x 3cm to be fitted inside the deck * CAN bus * control from handlebar buttons or android mobile application * can chain multiple boards to expand (more lights, turn signals...) It's just the first design. now... produce & test 🤪
[2021-11-03T01:03:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: next design : 200v & 500A VESC !
[2021-11-03T01:03:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: (joking)
[2021-11-03T01:05:02] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2021-11-03T01:05:09] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-11-03T01:09:06] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2021-11-03T01:10:32] Happy Giraffe: Im more impressed about the lights haha
[2021-11-03T01:10:56] Happy Giraffe: Also if you can make it flash high beam of generic one switch lights
[2021-11-03T02:13:19] Artem Bulashev: 10 amp total g that’s a lot 😄😄 120w 😅😅 count me in 👌
[2021-11-03T02:13:50] Happy Giraffe: Dual xenons incoming
[2021-11-03T02:13:54] Artem Bulashev: So brake light signal would come via can?
[2021-11-03T02:14:30] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow I hope to try the 20w light...fuse arrived
[2021-11-03T02:15:16] Artem Bulashev: And blinkers would be 2 inputs of monetary switch, correct? - head lights and led lights would be operated via 2 inputs of normal 2-position switch (on / off), correct?
[2021-11-03T02:17:48] Artem Bulashev: WS2812B is addressable led right 😳 my dream came true?? 👏👏
[2021-11-03T02:21:21] Artem Bulashev: Now only left to design tracker / 4g / MPU 6050 ✅😁 and find where to connect siren horn🚨 🙂🙂
[2021-11-03T02:22:33] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 je l'aime ❤️😄
[2021-11-03T09:44:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but it doesn't dissipate much in mosfet (very low rdson) 😉
[2021-11-03T09:45:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'll have to re-think buttons. i'd love to have CAN buttons 😁
[2021-11-03T09:45:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes 😉
[2021-11-03T09:45:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-11-03T10:27:55] Artem Bulashev: Cub buttons would be amazing - only 2 wires to go up the steering
[2021-11-03T10:28:10] Artem Bulashev: All buttons plug into board up there 😎😎
[2021-11-03T10:32:05] Artem Bulashev: Maybe long but narrow and flat board so that it could hind inside stem or even handle bar 😎with connectors just on wires for example Just brainstorming haha
[2021-11-03T10:32:12] Artem Bulashev: <sticker>
[2021-11-03T10:34:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: cub buttons ? what is that ?
[2021-11-03T11:31:29] Artem Bulashev: Can
[2021-11-03T11:31:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ah yes 😁👍
[2021-11-03T11:32:49] Artem Bulashev: Considering all buttons are on steering wheel it would be logical to have them run into something up there and than only have can pair of wires going down. 👌
[2021-11-03T11:33:25] Artem Bulashev: But than again - can low - can high - 5v or May be 12v - gnd
[2021-11-03T11:35:47] Artem Bulashev: Vs analog - turn signal L - tube siganl R - head light wire - brake line wire - gnd Only one wire less
[2021-11-03T11:38:22] Artem Bulashev: Though ground and power could be grabbed from what ever display person has - since ground is common any way, or even gnd from a lamp for example = 2 or 3 dedicated wires Up to the personal implementation
[2021-11-03T12:01:56] Mirono escooters: To get a tubeless to seal nicely Any tips? :)
[2021-11-03T12:09:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: + modes + buttons leds control + more buttons if you want.
[2021-11-03T12:09:28] Artem Bulashev: True
[2021-11-03T12:10:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i have been looking for really small microcontrollers with integrated can bus transceivers. they are some chip of 4x5mm 🤪
[2021-11-03T12:10:01] Artem Bulashev: But need to consider where it would be fitted to determine dimensions
[2021-11-03T12:10:11] Artem Bulashev: Oh really??
[2021-11-03T12:10:14] Artem Bulashev: Didn’t know
[2021-11-03T12:10:18] Artem Bulashev: That’s awesome
[2021-11-03T12:10:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes 😁
[2021-11-03T12:12:10] Artem Bulashev: Some thing that would be bossible to place inside steering handlebar and only have plugs on wire would be awesome, may be even use one cable with many pins like similar to the one that Zero/vsett display use with 6 pins and water proofed
[2021-11-03T12:12:37] Artem Bulashev: Than people can wire it up to their buttons around steering
[2021-11-03T12:14:27] Artem Bulashev: Compact dimensions and many pins 😎 other wise board size will be 4 times larger simply due to all the signal connectors
[2021-11-03T13:59:04] Happy Giraffe: Damn XT150 is great👀
[2021-11-03T13:59:16] Happy Giraffe: Never going back to 4mm after these
[2021-11-03T15:04:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: xt150 ? to do what ?
[2021-11-03T15:04:47] Artem Bulashev: Anything high amps 😎
[2021-11-03T15:05:02] Artem Bulashev: I used As150u for battery output
[2021-11-03T15:05:35] Artem Bulashev: It has 4 pins for signal and 2 70amp nominal main connectors and unit spark
[2021-11-03T15:58:44] Happy Giraffe: Phase

[2021-11-03T16:01:39] Mirono escooters: Wtf xd
[2021-11-03T16:02:16] Artem Bulashev: Try up side down, May look more native :)
[2021-11-03T16:06:56] Artem Bulashev: Good choice, nearly no losses, unlike MT60/XT60 4mm bullet with 0.6mOhm 🤪🤪😳😳
[2021-11-03T16:08:21] Artem Bulashev: Better buy normal bullets 5.5 or 6mm would be shorter as well and have resistance of 0.2 = xt150 I think
[2021-11-03T16:10:13] Artem Bulashev: https://media.suzakugiken.jp/ec/AMASS/AMASS_Catalogue_2020.pdf Yeah 0.20mOhm so same Ampasity rating technically speaking
[2021-11-03T16:12:00] Artem Bulashev: New 8mm bullet connector - no antispark though super high rating 👌👌
[2021-11-03T16:13:05] Happy Giraffe: Ultimate xiaomi😂😂😂😂
[2021-11-03T16:13:08] Mirono escooters: I got that
[2021-11-03T16:13:13] Mirono escooters: 8mm bullet is oempf

[2021-11-03T16:13:26] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2021-11-03T16:14:09] Happy Giraffe: Trying to wire the 20w lamp now and see ...
[2021-11-03T16:14:24] Happy Giraffe: Its Australian scooter
[2021-11-03T16:15:11] Happy Giraffe: This looks quite short compared to xt150 (less surface area?)
[2021-11-03T16:18:40] Happy Giraffe: Xt150 contact area about 13mm long
[2021-11-03T16:22:06] Artem Bulashev: Man test them. I bought like 5 lamps before I found one to be real rating (said to be 16-17w and it was 16w in reality) Everything else was 5-10-15w never higher even when said to be 35w
[2021-11-03T16:22:59] Unknown: Any good light suggestions? I want some rechargable lights
[2021-11-03T16:23:20] Unknown: Instead of having to make an extra small batt for lighting etc
[2021-11-03T16:23:28] Mirono escooters: Y not wire to main
[2021-11-03T16:24:04] Unknown: Easy powerswitch 😂
[2021-11-03T16:24:25] Unknown: I have a strap on on my suspension
[2021-11-03T16:24:32] Unknown: But gives shitty lighting
[2021-11-03T16:32:16] Happy Giraffe: I got watt meter, will do after Ive managed to run power wires through stem, so tight spaces😅
[2021-11-03T16:34:42] Happy Giraffe: This is okay, not grear but does the job (low speed riding as it doesnt throw far). I replaced the shity china cells with 35E inside
[2021-11-03T16:46:23] Artem Bulashev: You can use multi meter in amp mode - just rub it in series with one side of the wire info like + or gnd and it will tell you have many amps passes * voltage of battery = watts
[2021-11-03T17:11:20] Happy Giraffe: Watt meter easier as it also uses xt30🌚
[2021-11-03T17:15:30] Mirono escooters: Or Bluetooth jps
[2021-11-03T17:15:31] Mirono escooters: Bms
[2021-11-03T17:26:25] Happy Giraffe: BMS for me must be simple as possible haha
[2021-11-03T17:28:49] Artem Bulashev: For me BMS must be charge and discharge with BT for monitor, unless it communicates to VESC over can for example - because that VESC can do discharge control as well as allow you to monitor it = simple charge only BMS is perfectly enough (also less battery heat)
[2021-11-03T18:18:03] Mirono escooters: Same
[2021-11-03T18:18:22] Mirono escooters: I love Bluetooth
[2021-11-03T20:16:38] Unknown: Am i able to bridge can port for bms communications?
[2021-11-03T23:57:55] Happy Giraffe: @artBula Light works
[2021-11-03T23:58:18] Happy Giraffe: However first it handled like LED on house lamp with 3 step memory
[2021-11-03T23:58:31] Happy Giraffe: Now it always gives me both high+low beam😅
[2021-11-03T23:58:33] Artem Bulashev: :) well that’s expected :)) does it deliver proper power though?
[2021-11-03T23:58:47] Artem Bulashev: 😳😅
[2021-11-03T23:58:56] Happy Giraffe: Dude Im musician and not electric engineer haha
[2021-11-03T23:59:01] Artem Bulashev: :))
[2021-11-03T23:59:07] Artem Bulashev: You have vesc?
[2021-11-03T23:59:14] Happy Giraffe: Not yet, customs ...
[2021-11-03T23:59:30] Artem Bulashev: Than you are verified electrician, nearly

[2021-11-03T23:59:53] sombre_enfant: Really ? Sing real quick now
[2021-11-04T00:00:04] Happy Giraffe: This is shity power meter
[2021-11-04T00:00:10] Happy Giraffe: Need to test with multimeter
[2021-11-04T00:00:26] Happy Giraffe: Max I got is 10w but its really bright
[2021-11-04T00:00:30] Artem Bulashev: It’s probably right, try lower voltage
[2021-11-04T00:00:33] Artem Bulashev: Like 12v
[2021-11-04T00:00:38] Artem Bulashev: Will be more precise
[2021-11-04T00:01:01] Happy Giraffe: Dont have access to 12v other than DC psu from wall I dont wanna fuck up
[2021-11-04T00:01:16] Artem Bulashev: 15w is a lot of light, I use single 15w light to ride at night no issue
[2021-11-04T00:01:28] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2021-11-04T00:02:08] Artem Bulashev: Kind of hard to fuck it up though 😂😂
[2021-11-04T00:02:11] Artem Bulashev: But ok
[2021-11-04T00:02:22] Happy Giraffe: I did enough soldering today😅😂
[2021-11-04T00:02:28] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-11-04T00:02:51] Artem Bulashev: “You performed Admirably”😄
[2021-11-04T00:03:03] Happy Giraffe: I bought it from their reliable store, should be 20w...
[2021-11-04T00:03:21] Artem Bulashev: Than you can get 100% refund
[2021-11-04T00:03:23] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-11-04T00:03:23] Happy Giraffe: Would be a joke if 15w provides more power than 20w
[2021-11-04T00:03:31] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2021-11-04T00:03:31] Mirono escooters: Leds sometimes lie about W. So fucked
[2021-11-04T00:03:46] Happy Giraffe: They even claim theirs is true 20w
[2021-11-04T00:03:49] Artem Bulashev: That was my argument exactly
[2021-11-04T00:04:00] Artem Bulashev: I bought 25w for high beam
[2021-11-04T00:04:13] Happy Giraffe: Yours is 25w version?
[2021-11-04T00:04:47] Artem Bulashev: But my low beam shines brighter as it is actually 16w as claimed 16-17w, while your “more powerful high beam” is actually 10w instead of 25w
[2021-11-04T00:05:31] Happy Giraffe: Driving led at higher voltage would make them brighter with less amps? Or is it linear to wattage IC pulls?
[2021-11-04T00:05:46] Artem Bulashev: No it’s same
[2021-11-04T00:05:48] Mirono escooters: They most defo have a 12v stepdown inside
[2021-11-04T00:05:54] Artem Bulashev: Efficiency may vary
[2021-11-04T00:05:54] Happy Giraffe: Its the same store, I dont understand😭
[2021-11-04T00:06:02] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-11-04T00:06:09] Happy Giraffe: 12v-80v rated
[2021-11-04T00:06:13] Artem Bulashev: If not 5v lol
[2021-11-04T00:06:26] Happy Giraffe: *Cries in a roll*

[2021-11-04T00:07:54] Happy Giraffe: 6w bike lamp vs this "20w"
[2021-11-04T00:07:58] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2021-11-04T00:08:42] Happy Giraffe: Basically I paid more to have less power
[2021-11-04T00:08:44] Happy Giraffe: Scam
[2021-11-04T00:09:30] Happy Giraffe: Atleast beam pattern seems good
[2021-11-04T00:11:22] Happy Giraffe: This also shares power between low/high beam🙈
[2021-11-04T00:11:40] Happy Giraffe: So if I use both same time its 5w for each
[2021-11-04T00:13:15] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣
[2021-11-04T00:13:34] Artem Bulashev: That’s about equal to iPhone flash light, May as well ride with that on
[2021-11-04T00:13:52] Mirono escooters: Oempf
[2021-11-04T00:14:05] Mirono escooters: I will test mine tomorro

[2021-11-04T00:15:36] Mirono escooters: Try with their recommended v?
[2021-11-04T00:15:51] Happy Giraffe: Dont have 12v
[2021-11-04T00:16:08] Mirono escooters: Benvh power supply is nice
[2021-11-04T00:16:10] Happy Giraffe: And no space for stepdown as I have already Rita there etc
[2021-11-04T00:16:26] Artem Bulashev: Damm nicely written. May be you got defective unit
[2021-11-04T00:16:30] Mirono escooters: Stepdown is so small
[2021-11-04T00:16:46] Happy Giraffe: Its stupid it has 50% less power with 48v as its very common battery.
[2021-11-04T00:16:53] Mirono escooters: Operating temperature 80* Hmmmm
[2021-11-04T00:17:00] Mirono escooters: It shouldnt
[2021-11-04T00:17:03] Artem Bulashev: Regardless
[2021-11-04T00:17:08] Artem Bulashev: Voltage is in spec value
[2021-11-04T00:17:13] Artem Bulashev: Power output is shit
[2021-11-04T00:17:20] Artem Bulashev: So refund and re order

[2021-11-04T00:18:36] Happy Giraffe: How do I take my money back? Make claim or write customer support?
[2021-11-04T00:18:49] Artem Bulashev: Really?
[2021-11-04T00:18:51] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2021-11-04T00:18:56] Artem Bulashev: First time on Ali?

[2021-11-04T00:19:36] Happy Giraffe: Disbute?
[2021-11-04T00:19:38] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-11-04T00:19:44] Happy Giraffe: 👍
[2021-11-04T00:20:45] Artem Bulashev: Store doesn’t make those lamps
[2021-11-04T00:20:51] Artem Bulashev: They re sell
[2021-11-04T00:21:00] Artem Bulashev: So shit products can get to you
[2021-11-04T00:21:09] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-04T00:22:00] Mirono escooters: China in a nutshell
[2021-11-04T00:22:23] Happy Giraffe: But do I have to return the product then?
[2021-11-04T00:22:32] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1448@04-11-2021_00-22-32.jpg>
[2021-11-04T00:23:10] Artem Bulashev: Refund only
[2021-11-04T00:23:48] Happy Giraffe: Then I get full refund?
[2021-11-04T00:24:13] Mirono escooters: If they approve
[2021-11-04T00:24:22] Artem Bulashev: After you get money back contact store and ask what the hell? Was it a defect or that’s normal for this light because if defect you will order same lamp again (but if same shit happens will refund again)
[2021-11-04T00:24:29] Artem Bulashev: Yes you will
[2021-11-04T00:25:00] Artem Bulashev: As long as you proof is solid and explanation why it is completely useless is bullet proof
[2021-11-04T00:26:15] Artem Bulashev: I get 99% of claims back - the only one in many years I didn’t get back was because I forgot to file it on time I open box on a camera only and test it right there - all in one video so I always have proof
[2021-11-04T00:26:19] Happy Giraffe: I did video in pitch black room and switched all the modes while recording power reading
[2021-11-04T00:26:33] Artem Bulashev: Sounds good
[2021-11-04T00:26:43] Artem Bulashev: As long as you can see it is that lamp
[2021-11-04T00:26:45] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2021-11-04T00:26:58] Happy Giraffe: Then I need to do another vide
[2021-11-04T00:27:27] Artem Bulashev: Man, to that hey will simply say this is not my lamp - no proof
[2021-11-04T00:27:34] Happy Giraffe: Yep
[2021-11-04T00:29:04] Artem Bulashev: Btw any one here need 52v 13ah battery that does 30amps easy with like 35-38 cycles ?
[2021-11-04T00:29:20] Mirono escooters: For correct price 🤤🙈
[2021-11-04T00:29:47] Artem Bulashev: For cheap 🤷‍♂️
[2021-11-04T00:29:57] Mirono escooters: I offer 69€
[2021-11-04T00:29:58] Artem Bulashev: I think I would be happy enough with 150€
[2021-11-04T00:30:09] Artem Bulashev: Oh come on 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-11-04T00:31:13] Happy Giraffe: 69.420€ is my offer
[2021-11-04T00:31:21] Mirono escooters: Damn
[2021-11-04T00:32:01] Artem Bulashev: Those are 2600mah high discharge cells, BAK supposedly (not sure what vsett uses, but it’s good quality) 1.79€ per cell I give :) 150€ 🙃 if some one decides
[2021-11-04T00:32:42] Mirono escooters: Bak seems nice. I might get em on my next order to test
[2021-11-04T00:32:47] Mirono escooters: Wich bms. Wich size
[2021-11-04T00:32:52] Artem Bulashev: 2.3C discharge and it’s stone cold, about 10c about ambient
[2021-11-04T00:33:00] Artem Bulashev: 14s6p
[2021-11-04T00:33:05] Artem Bulashev: 52v13ah
[2021-11-04T00:33:27] Happy Giraffe: This video should do it?
[2021-11-04T00:33:45] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2021-11-04T00:33:58] Mirono escooters: Defo
[2021-11-04T00:34:05] Artem Bulashev: Vsett original battery - BMS don’t know but never tripped it at 30amps Charger 2amps so not abused (don’t have other)
[2021-11-04T00:34:17] Mirono escooters: Vsett uses bak?
[2021-11-04T00:34:50] Artem Bulashev: Supposedly
[2021-11-04T00:35:14] Artem Bulashev: I didn’t see any one open it though but it performed as good as I would expect branded cell to do
[2021-11-04T00:36:14] Artem Bulashev: 30amps from 13ah is equal to 64amps from 28ah battery, and it’s berally warm
[2021-11-04T00:37:36] Mirono escooters: 125w.. suure
[2021-11-04T00:37:49] Artem Bulashev: 12.5w
[2021-11-04T00:37:52] Artem Bulashev: Probably
[2021-11-04T00:37:53] Mirono escooters: Is their a diff W meaning when talkin about light?🤣
[2021-11-04T00:37:55] Artem Bulashev: See description
[2021-11-04T00:38:11] Artem Bulashev: Unique to each shop I would say

[2021-11-04T00:38:36] Mirono escooters: Light power 125w lol
[2021-11-04T00:45:38] Artem Bulashev: Lol 450g? Range 200m? 🤣😄😄😄
[2021-11-04T00:46:35] Happy Giraffe: Aliexpress app stopped to uploading of video🙈
[2021-11-04T00:51:26] Happy Giraffe: Not my 4G fault ..
[2021-11-04T00:51:43] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-11-04T00:51:56] Happy Giraffe: Chinese censorship I guess, they saw me writing bad stuff about chinese product and Ddossed me
[2021-11-04T00:54:47] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-11-04T00:56:43] Happy Giraffe: For real 170mbs download and 35mbs upload and cant output 30 second 480p video
[2021-11-04T01:02:47] Happy Giraffe: Now done, thanks @artBula for lending me a hand once again
[2021-11-04T01:03:04] Happy Giraffe: And Miro
[2021-11-04T02:40:57] Happy Giraffe: Should I redo this or is it ok? Only 3mm behind others and it still has 10mm contact area left... I only use 95A max phase on these 6mm xt150
[2021-11-04T03:45:43] Happy Giraffe: Nvm did it again and its good now👍 Solder got into locking clip
[2021-11-04T10:41:38] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌🙃
[2021-11-04T16:27:25] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-11-04T16:27:46] Artem Bulashev: Remember guys I said vsett battery (Chinese version was performing amazingly well?)
[2021-11-04T16:28:08] Artem Bulashev: Well I just found that they are made by DynaVolt 😂
[2021-11-04T16:28:28] Unknown: So, it's defo not my mosfets heating up 😂 fets were 46° Motor did it again when i got home 😂 and damnn lol

[2021-11-04T16:29:20] Artem Bulashev: Looks like it’s interesting company I didn’t know about
[2021-11-04T16:36:39] Unknown: Idd haha
[2021-11-04T17:19:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍👍
[2021-11-04T17:23:02] Mirono escooters: U toasting it
[2021-11-04T17:32:31] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 hi man, forgot to ask you if you need addressable led strip or you got some :) have with excess 😅
[2021-11-04T17:34:48] Happy Giraffe: Intel core i9 12900k 250w stock power draw😂
[2021-11-04T17:35:17] Happy Giraffe: Could run some scooter motor with that😂
[2021-11-04T17:36:10] Artem Bulashev: 😳😳😳
[2021-11-04T17:36:12] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2021-11-04T17:36:42] Happy Giraffe: Its faster than everything else but man thats lot of watts...
[2021-11-04T17:45:00] Artem Bulashev: Not really
[2021-11-04T17:45:04] Artem Bulashev: In some tasks
[2021-11-04T17:45:08] Artem Bulashev: But not all
[2021-11-04T17:45:26] Artem Bulashev: Amd tops it on some tasks
[2021-11-04T17:45:40] Artem Bulashev: But yeah 60% is a win for intel
[2021-11-04T17:45:46] Artem Bulashev: I5
[2021-11-04T17:45:52] Artem Bulashev: Is amazing though
[2021-11-04T17:57:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh yes !!!
[2021-11-04T17:57:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and if you have the harnest cable for vsett too 😅
[2021-11-04T17:58:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: do you have ws2812b and ws2815 ?
[2021-11-04T17:58:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: soldering night for me...
[2021-11-04T18:24:05] Unknown: Looking sexy
[2021-11-04T19:06:57] Happy Giraffe: Had thay yesterday until I ran out of solder😂
[2021-11-04T19:07:41] Happy Giraffe: But pcb soldering takes more skill
[2021-11-04T19:07:53] Happy Giraffe: No room for error
[2021-11-04T19:11:40] Mirono escooters: Hate microsoldering
[2021-11-04T19:13:04] Artem Bulashev: Haha :) if you will need help soldering batch let me know haha have reflow station and infrared pre-heat
[2021-11-04T19:13:31] Happy Giraffe: Some guys living in 2077
[2021-11-04T19:13:55] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-04T20:39:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: now cleaaning & testing
[2021-11-04T20:39:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: soldered 😅 2h for this prototype (solder plots + pick & place)
[2021-11-04T20:39:54] Mirono escooters: 💚
[2021-11-04T20:52:26] Artem Bulashev: You use soldering iron? Not paste with reflow?
[2021-11-04T20:54:42] Artem Bulashev: I guess though there is no point of getting shield plate for paste application for possibly not final version of the board (prototype) 👍🙂
[2021-11-04T21:15:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: solder paste & hot plate
[2021-11-04T21:15:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: first boot is a succes !
[2021-11-04T21:17:06] Mirono escooters: 1🥰
[2021-11-04T21:26:15] Artem Bulashev: Nice 😁
[2021-11-04T23:31:18] Mirono escooters: What was 75100 flipsky mosfet?
[2021-11-04T23:32:25] Mirono escooters: Sorry. Drivers
[2021-11-05T02:39:52] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1458@05-11-2021_02-39-52.jpg>
[2021-11-05T02:39:58] Happy Giraffe: They begging me to cancel dispute😂
[2021-11-05T02:42:22] Happy Giraffe: Sent me 5 text messages aswell wow
[2021-11-05T08:04:06] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2021-11-05T08:28:22] Lyss: https://youtu.be/l-39V1beZh8
[2021-11-05T08:29:34] Mirono escooters: "?
[2021-11-05T08:29:36] Mirono escooters: :?*
[2021-11-05T10:46:37] Happy Giraffe: Sure they try to manipulate me by trying to affect my feelings etc😂
[2021-11-05T10:47:05] Mirono escooters: Chinese
[2021-11-05T10:47:29] Happy Giraffe: I will test wattage again with multimeter
[2021-11-05T10:57:54] Happy Giraffe: This means 0,29Amps?
[2021-11-05T10:58:46] Happy Giraffe: 49v x 0.29A = 14.2w
[2021-11-05T11:01:24] Happy Giraffe: Multimeter showing bit more than the other then (still not 20w)
[2021-11-05T12:11:30] Happy Giraffe: Vesc going into UK when it was already in Denmark, GG Spintend and their shipping
[2021-11-05T12:13:45] Mirono escooters: Uk?🤣🤣🤣
[2021-11-05T12:13:52] Mirono escooters: Told ya the shipping method suckef
[2021-11-05T12:15:05] Happy Giraffe: All this fuckery for them saving 5€, I even shipped it to them for free. My piss is boiling
[2021-11-05T12:30:55] Artem Bulashev: I think it’s mistake in tracking
[2021-11-05T12:32:52] Happy Giraffe: I really hope so
[2021-11-05T14:06:22] Lyss: Hello sir good morning.. I was referred to you by franco I'm trying to bypass some bms because of rental firmware. I recieved your recommendation but I was wondering if I could send you the photos of the bms cause I'm confused because some say cut the b- and p- not the positives and on these I dont see the neg that needs to be extended. I dont want tobliw myself up. Been there done that
[2021-11-05T14:07:04] Lyss: Inmotion lf8 bms
[2021-11-05T14:07:14] Mirono escooters: Sure send some photos
[2021-11-05T14:08:58] Lyss: <video_file>
[2021-11-05T14:09:32] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1461@05-11-2021_14-09-32.jpg>
[2021-11-05T14:09:34] Mirono escooters: This is B-
[2021-11-05T14:09:51] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1462@05-11-2021_14-09-51.jpg>
[2021-11-05T14:09:52] Mirono escooters: That is b+
[2021-11-05T14:09:55] Mirono escooters: Solder directly to these
[2021-11-05T14:11:16] Lyss: <photos/photo_1463@05-11-2021_14-11-16.jpg>
[2021-11-05T14:12:04] Lyss: You can lift him up to and you see where it says b+&- there are no cables
[2021-11-05T14:12:32] Mirono escooters: That is becausz its connected with nivkel strip
[2021-11-05T14:13:10] Lyss: Really just a think cable ? That easy? No extending the original batt power cord?
[2021-11-05T14:13:51] Mirono escooters: Thin? No. Solde the power wires to it
[2021-11-05T14:14:08] Lyss: Awwwwwwwwwww and the nickle strip goes all the way down???
[2021-11-05T14:14:14] Mirono escooters: But running no bms is dangerous Consider adding another bms or monittor closely
[2021-11-05T14:14:20] Mirono escooters: Its connected to the batteries
[2021-11-05T14:14:28] Mirono escooters: If you solder to thesz the power cables its fine
[2021-11-05T14:15:06] Lyss: So desolder the main batt power cable and desolder it there?
[2021-11-05T14:16:46] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-11-05T14:17:48] Lyss: I'd love to.. I have a healthy fear of batteries but it has movo rental firmware on it. And I can't get the same thing out of the fort Knox casing
[2021-11-05T14:18:24] Mirono escooters: Its prob siliconed down. Try to cut it loose (GENLTY!) and push out
[2021-11-05T14:22:20] Mirono escooters: Send a pm bcs poor group members
[2021-11-05T14:24:23] Lyss: Just so I'm perfectly positive on what you are saying? Cause I second guess myself on these types of jobs.
[2021-11-05T14:25:07] Lyss: Oh I' apologize
[2021-11-05T14:25:57] Mirono escooters: No worry
[2021-11-05T18:01:26] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2021-11-05T18:01:44] Luis Magalhaes: Play time 😂
[2021-11-05T18:03:16] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb i flashed the 300A firmware 😂
[2021-11-05T18:07:24] Mirono escooters: I saw 280a
[2021-11-05T18:07:25] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2021-11-05T18:14:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Much better :D
[2021-11-05T18:14:32] Luis Magalhaes: True 😂😂
[2021-11-05T18:14:53] Luis Magalhaes: Now it starts screaming 😂
[2021-11-05T18:15:01] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-11-05T18:15:14] Luis Magalhaes: My battery is screaming too 😅
[2021-11-05T18:17:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha perfect
[2021-11-05T18:17:42] Face de Pin Sucé: This is motor current not battery current
[2021-11-05T18:19:22] Mirono escooters: Wich awg u got for motor cables
[2021-11-05T18:19:28] Mirono escooters: Dont think my 16 will cut it
[2021-11-05T18:21:13] Face de Pin Sucé: Depends of motors
[2021-11-05T18:21:24] Face de Pin Sucé: But every 11" can do, at least 10AWG
[2021-11-05T18:21:27] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-05T18:21:35] Face de Pin Sucé: By doing yourself
[2021-11-05T18:21:50] Face de Pin Sucé: (originally it's 16/14AWG from what I've seen)
[2021-11-05T18:40:57] Happy Giraffe: What bugs me in mine aswell the motor wire is 8 strands, together like awg 16🙈
[2021-11-05T18:41:15] Happy Giraffe: How in the hell Im supposed to run 100A on it lol
[2021-11-05T18:47:23] Artem Bulashev: Peak
[2021-11-05T18:47:27] Artem Bulashev: No problem likely
[2021-11-05T18:47:39] Artem Bulashev: As long as your battery amps are low
[2021-11-05T18:48:49] Artem Bulashev: That will limit duration of phase amps and cause reduction earlier in motor voltage range (0kmh = 0v, max rpm = current battery voltage)
[2021-11-05T18:49:18] Happy Giraffe: I plan 40/100 or 40/90-95
[2021-11-05T18:49:37] Happy Giraffe: Bigger motor should have better torque with same amps
[2021-11-05T18:51:36] Happy Giraffe: Motor wire with thin insulation 2.55mm
[2021-11-05T18:51:41] Artem Bulashev: Go to ali and buy dual temp sensor display (about 5Euro) - it’s very basic display with two sensors and attach them to the motor wires of the rear motor inside deck Same tool can be used to evaluate connector temp
[2021-11-05T18:51:41] Happy Giraffe: 8 core wire
[2021-11-05T18:52:01] Artem Bulashev: 2.55mm is diameter?
[2021-11-05T18:52:14] Happy Giraffe: Yws
[2021-11-05T18:52:23] Happy Giraffe: XT150 will be fine
[2021-11-05T18:53:08] Artem Bulashev: Man 2.55mm diameter is basically 5.26mm2 = 10awg
[2021-11-05T18:53:18] Happy Giraffe: Hmm
[2021-11-05T18:53:24] Artem Bulashev: 2.55 is diameter with isolation or of conductor ?
[2021-11-05T18:53:29] Happy Giraffe: Isolation
[2021-11-05T18:53:32] Artem Bulashev: 🤦‍♂️
[2021-11-05T18:53:36] Happy Giraffe: Motor wire with thin insulation 2.55mm
[2021-11-05T18:53:55] Artem Bulashev: Messier conductor dia
[2021-11-05T18:54:36] Artem Bulashev: 1.65diamtet is 14ga
[2021-11-05T18:54:40] Luis Magalhaes: I think its 12awg but the cables arent getting too hot and im carefull with that 😅
[2021-11-05T18:54:43] Happy Giraffe: 2mm conductor minimum, I didnt check when soldering
[2021-11-05T18:54:56] Happy Giraffe: So should be awg12 I guess
[2021-11-05T18:55:08] Artem Bulashev: Around it yes
[2021-11-05T18:55:19] Artem Bulashev: That’s good for a lot more 150a phase and 35a battery for sure
[2021-11-05T18:55:27] Happy Giraffe: 20cm awg12 should take 180Amps for 10 second
[2021-11-05T18:55:48] Luis Magalhaes: Have to do that, upgrade cables and had a temperature sensor, and maybe halls too
[2021-11-05T18:55:49] Happy Giraffe: These are thicker copper strands than that million strand wire so maybe even more
[2021-11-05T18:56:12] Happy Giraffe: But its longer than 20cm on me😂
[2021-11-05T18:56:44] Happy Giraffe: Dronelab.se did some interesting measuring
[2021-11-05T18:58:00] Artem Bulashev: Generally speaking less is better for ampacity (single strand has higher ampacity than multistrended)
[2021-11-05T18:58:58] Artem Bulashev: That’s dc
[2021-11-05T18:59:14] Artem Bulashev: For phase wires * by 1.3
[2021-11-05T18:59:31] Artem Bulashev: Because current passes over each wire only 66% of the time
[2021-11-05T18:59:47] Luis Magalhaes: Waveeee
[2021-11-05T18:59:49] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-11-05T19:00:38] Happy Giraffe: I'm having overkill wires and connectors then👍
[2021-11-05T19:01:01] Happy Giraffe: Also better soldering than what it came with lol
[2021-11-05T19:02:58] Artem Bulashev: Soldering btw has terrible conductivity 🙂
[2021-11-05T19:03:28] Artem Bulashev: Worse than steel I believe
[2021-11-05T19:04:02] Mirono escooters: Rlly???
[2021-11-05T19:04:12] Happy Giraffe: Yep, but no other way to connect two metals haha
[2021-11-05T19:04:17] Artem Bulashev: About 5 to 10 times less than copper
[2021-11-05T19:04:34] Mirono escooters: Wow wtf
[2021-11-05T19:04:40] Artem Bulashev: Silver solder is about 20-40% of copper conductivity only (2-5 times depends on % of silver mainly)
[2021-11-05T19:04:43] Happy Giraffe: That's why you need copper wire on tracks and solder not enough alone
[2021-11-05T19:05:35] Mirono escooters: Yea i do that
[2021-11-05T19:05:42] Happy Giraffe: Stock had poorly done with little contact area, now phase wire is completely soaked there for maximum surface area
[2021-11-05T19:05:42] Mirono escooters: But y we direct solder wires then xd
[2021-11-05T19:06:59] Artem Bulashev: Contact surface is the key
[2021-11-05T19:07:07] Artem Bulashev: And we don’t just solder
[2021-11-05T19:07:36] Happy Giraffe: I filled the pool in xt150 and soaked in haha
[2021-11-05T19:07:37] Artem Bulashev: High power wires have to be twisted together as \|/ and \|/
[2021-11-05T19:07:45] Artem Bulashev: To maximise direct contact
[2021-11-05T19:08:01] Happy Giraffe: That's what I always do aswell
[2021-11-05T19:08:03] Artem Bulashev: Solder than fills in the air gaps to increase contact surface between wires
[2021-11-05T19:08:17] Artem Bulashev: Hope it makes sense
[2021-11-05T19:08:25] Happy Giraffe: Common sense
[2021-11-05T19:08:38] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-05T19:09:09] Artem Bulashev: Good though most people don’t think about whys that much and miss interpreted some ideas behind things we do
[2021-11-05T19:11:20] Happy Giraffe: One guy says to me 6mm is worse than 4mm on awg 12
[2021-11-05T19:11:30] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1465@05-11-2021_19-11-30.jpg>
[2021-11-05T19:11:55] Happy Giraffe: Tried to explain him I bend the wire like this for double the surface area at the connector
[2021-11-05T20:47:55] Artem Bulashev: 4mm2 is 11 awg
[2021-11-05T20:48:01] Artem Bulashev: If that’s what you mean
[2021-11-05T20:48:10] Artem Bulashev: I didn’t understand what you mean
[2021-11-05T21:11:26] Face de Pin Sucé: What the fuck
[2021-11-05T21:11:36] Face de Pin Sucé: 6mm² is 9AWG
[2021-11-05T21:11:46] Face de Pin Sucé: It's ideal
[2021-11-05T21:18:13] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2021-11-06T00:00:49] Happy Giraffe: He said on 12AWG wire 4mm bullet is better than 6mm bullet lol
[2021-11-06T00:46:23] Mirono escooters: Hey smart people
[2021-11-06T00:46:25] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1466@06-11-2021_00-46-25.jpg>
[2021-11-06T00:46:45] Mirono escooters: Dont kill me But does this oil work for hydraulic brakes? (I am a virgin with hydraulic brakes)
[2021-11-06T00:53:02] Happy Giraffe: That only works for brakes that use dot
[2021-11-06T00:53:12] Mirono escooters: Aaaaaa
[2021-11-06T00:53:13] Mirono escooters: Explains
[2021-11-06T00:53:44] Happy Giraffe: Must check individually each brake oil type, mine are mineral oil
[2021-11-06T00:53:52] Unknown: Arent hydrp brakes with dot?
[2021-11-06T00:54:01] Unknown: Hydro*
[2021-11-06T00:54:07] Happy Giraffe: Not all
[2021-11-06T00:54:21] Unknown: Oh snap did'nt know thay
[2021-11-06T00:54:47] Happy Giraffe: Magura MTs use mineral oil
[2021-11-06T00:54:52] Unknown: I'd suggest dot4 as this is good for most 50kmh-75kmh scooters brakes
[2021-11-06T00:55:20] Happy Giraffe: Using DOT in Mineral oil systems might cause damage and be unrealiable
[2021-11-06T00:55:29] Unknown: And yes sure but that's just a choice, isnt the consisticy and thickness the sameish value as dot
[2021-11-06T00:55:56] Happy Giraffe: Its a design choice of manufacturer, not ours😂
[2021-11-06T00:56:10] Mirono escooters: Me cruising at 40
[2021-11-06T00:57:51] Unknown: Yes but i mean, imo this is just a choice in ecological being 🤔 green or not green oil has a purpose in it and i think it's most at consistict and thickness, i dont see how non mineral oil would damage anything besides the planet 🤔
[2021-11-06T00:58:03] Unknown: Wich i don't support but still
[2021-11-06T00:58:51] Mirono escooters: Lets offer up a xtech
[2021-11-06T01:07:02] Unknown: I have an xtech, not worthy above 40, its better then original but still
[2021-11-06T01:07:47] Unknown: Original calipers ran put after like 200km, xtech after like 1000 around 40kmh
[2021-11-06T01:08:55] Mirono escooters: Thats nice
[2021-11-06T01:08:55] Mirono escooters: Idk i will go hydraulic whzn this one dies
[2021-11-06T01:14:25] Unknown: Imma get my batt redone by you, get a rear suspension to put motor in the back, fix all wiring, place hydro brakes and then paint it all to finish
[2021-11-06T01:14:44] Mirono escooters: Sick! Wich color?
[2021-11-06T01:16:20] Unknown: Then save up for a second build and idk yet, thinking limegreen and black, with led strips or stay at red and blue but that might make police keep an eye out for me so 🤷‍♂️
[2021-11-06T01:17:43] Mirono escooters: Oeee
[2021-11-06T01:17:45] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-06T01:21:40] Unknown: Yesh, i want a nice finish for this one 😂 then i wanna get a good speed build
[2021-11-06T01:21:53] Unknown: 75-80ish kmh
[2021-11-06T01:23:26] Happy Giraffe: Other things become bottlelenck first before mineral oil
[2021-11-06T01:25:38] Happy Giraffe: But you should use the oil manufacturer says
[2021-11-06T01:25:56] Happy Giraffe: Some use baby oil on mtb with mineral oil as stock
[2021-11-06T01:30:32] Unknown: Yea but that be baby oil vs brake oil, i talk brake vs brake oil i think it's more about how eco the company is, i think they recommend somy type of oil for world health and money and a good name
[2021-11-06T01:38:56] Happy Giraffe: Everyone says dont use dot in mineral etc
[2021-11-06T01:39:07] Happy Giraffe: But you use what you want👍
[2021-11-06T02:06:19] Unknown: No, i mean i had no clue 😱 i dod'nt know it really made a difference
[2021-11-06T02:36:56] Happy Giraffe: I havent tested them all either but I just want to keep all my friends safe and sound👍
[2021-11-06T10:05:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: use olive oil, it's mineral 🤣
[2021-11-06T10:06:09] Happy Giraffe: Piss in the sylinder and hope it doesnt snow this winter
[2021-11-06T10:07:22] Happy Giraffe: But being serious theres many people thinking any brake oil will do it
[2021-11-06T11:45:41] Mirono escooters: Jezus
[2021-11-06T11:46:11] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2021-11-06T13:48:42] Happy Giraffe: Haha

[2021-11-06T18:32:58] Unknown: What a name 😂 i own a store. "What's it called?" Sexy bus. 😶😂
[2021-11-06T18:33:15] Mirono escooters: Hahah yes xd
[2021-11-07T18:30:58] Happy Giraffe: Anyone else had desire to buy these and put 4wd on them?😂
[2021-11-07T18:32:26] Mirono escooters: Haha yes
[2021-11-07T18:51:16] Happy Giraffe: Soon...soooon
[2021-11-07T18:51:38] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-11-07T20:12:20] Artem Bulashev: Damm what the hell
[2021-11-07T20:13:28] Artem Bulashev: In Austria I email them as soon as I get status “required explanation” even before letter request arrives and next working day it cleared and on the way to me
[2021-11-07T20:15:51] Happy Giraffe: Here no explanations are listened, they give me 20€+taxes to pay and then they release
[2021-11-07T20:48:28] Mirono escooters: Same here
[2021-11-07T21:48:15] Artem Bulashev: Why so long than?
[2021-11-07T21:48:30] Artem Bulashev: Normally they hold only if they need additional info
[2021-11-07T21:48:45] Artem Bulashev: If they don’t they just slap how much to pay and pass it along
[2021-11-07T21:49:27] Happy Giraffe: Nothing in my email, maybe tomorrow they tell me
[2021-11-07T23:45:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Hey Guys, some good vibes with fun rides and tracks performances ❤️ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiVwE4esRLc

[2021-11-07T23:47:22] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 👌
[2021-11-07T23:49:30] Face de Pin Sucé: yes
[2021-11-07T23:49:53] Face de Pin Sucé: it's a bit long but there's some good musics :p
[2021-11-07T23:49:53] Happy Giraffe: Thats cool👍
[2021-11-07T23:50:11] Happy Giraffe: Finally a scooter video that isnt gay like ESC championships
[2021-11-07T23:50:30] Face de Pin Sucé: xDDDDD
[2021-11-08T00:13:36] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1470@08-11-2021_00-13-36.jpg>
[2021-11-08T00:13:50] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2021-11-08T00:14:01] Happy Giraffe: 6€....
[2021-11-08T00:14:20] Artem Bulashev: You worked for those 6€
[2021-11-08T00:14:36] Happy Giraffe: Lel
[2021-11-08T00:14:38] Artem Bulashev: You bought what didn’t deliver what it said it should at minimum
[2021-11-08T00:14:43] Artem Bulashev: So fair game
[2021-11-08T00:14:56] Artem Bulashev: Now you can get 12€ light and not feel bad about it ;-)
[2021-11-08T00:15:03] Artem Bulashev: Than use both lol
[2021-11-08T00:15:49] Happy Giraffe: This is crap and shity
[2021-11-08T00:16:13] Happy Giraffe: Pay more for 20w light and get worse performance than 15w what is cheaper
[2021-11-08T11:58:03] Mirono escooters: How does everyone here see batt %? I can't find any nice displays ._.
[2021-11-08T11:58:30] Happy Giraffe: 6th sense
[2021-11-08T11:58:34] Unknown: In the vesc app you get it 😂
[2021-11-08T11:58:44] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-08T12:00:31] Mirono escooters: I dont wanna open my app constantly
[2021-11-08T12:00:34] Mirono escooters: I got Bluetooth bms for that
[2021-11-08T12:00:37] Mirono escooters: 🤣🤣
[2021-11-08T12:00:44] Happy Giraffe: Then use BMS?
[2021-11-08T12:00:45] Mirono escooters: There must be some stylish design lol
[2021-11-08T12:00:53] Mirono escooters: I dont wanna open app constantly
[2021-11-08T12:01:09] Happy Giraffe: Why would you need to constantly see your battery charge?
[2021-11-08T12:01:10] Unknown: Cant you get a voltage display and decide on that? 🤔
[2021-11-08T12:01:20] Mirono escooters: Boring
[2021-11-08T12:01:28] Mirono escooters: So I know how much range I have
[2021-11-08T12:01:48] Happy Giraffe: I mean you know how much it can go at 100% and 50%
[2021-11-08T12:01:49] Mirono escooters: I've had to walk home enough times bcs my dumbass forgot to charge it🤣
[2021-11-08T12:02:08] Happy Giraffe: Then you just check it once every 5km or so
[2021-11-08T12:02:14] Mirono escooters: Meh
[2021-11-08T12:02:17] Mirono escooters: Rather have a display
[2021-11-08T12:02:24] Mirono escooters: (Personal preference)
[2021-11-08T12:02:38] Mirono escooters: I've ordered a tiny display to glue on scooter but ieuw. I hoped there was something nicer
[2021-11-08T12:02:40] Happy Giraffe: Or get bigger battery
[2021-11-08T12:02:52] Mirono escooters: Haha working in it

[2021-11-08T12:06:31] Mirono escooters: I'm bad at finishing touches. Leave me alone 🤣
[2021-11-08T12:06:38] Mirono escooters: Try to be nice to people for once.
[2021-11-08T12:06:45] sombre_enfant: The handlebar sent me😭
[2021-11-08T12:06:47] Mirono escooters: I'm out for performance not details :)
[2021-11-08T12:06:52] Mirono escooters: Y?

[2021-11-08T12:09:03] Mirono escooters: Mine has 3 layers lol
[2021-11-08T12:09:21] Mirono escooters: Got it for free and let's say.. everything better then stock handlebar
[2021-11-08T12:10:10] Happy Giraffe: I love stock, got extentions and custom grips atm to fit all extra stuff there
[2021-11-08T12:11:10] sombre_enfant: Stock with extender grip or mtb one
[2021-11-08T12:11:47] Happy Giraffe: Mtb can be quite wide, not sure if its comfortable
[2021-11-08T12:12:07] Mirono escooters: I got 3 with stock it gets boring
[2021-11-08T12:12:17] Mirono escooters: I got one sombre will *love*

[2021-11-08T12:14:04] Happy Giraffe: That handlebar trying to make some satanic symbols?
[2021-11-08T12:14:24] Mirono escooters: Rlly no idea
[2021-11-08T12:14:32] Mirono escooters: I just have it laying around no idea what to do with it
[2021-11-08T12:17:50] Unknown: <photos/photo_1475@08-11-2021_12-17-50.jpg>
[2021-11-08T12:18:56] Mirono escooters: Hmm. Looks ok

[2021-11-08T12:23:41] Mirono escooters: I'm the person who wants displays. I like nerdy stats

[2021-11-08T14:49:56] Happy Giraffe: He's the next ghostrider with that handlebar
[2021-11-08T14:52:09] Mirono escooters: Did I put the steering thing backwards or smth?
[2021-11-08T14:52:18] Mirono escooters: Does it look that ridiculous?🥴
[2021-11-08T15:01:08] Happy Giraffe: Unique*😂

[2021-11-08T15:20:16] Happy Giraffe: How could it be in any other way? Handlebars are bended that way
[2021-11-08T15:25:05] Mirono escooters: Rlly? Idk. I'm a noob

[2021-11-08T21:04:24] Mirono escooters: Again a weird seller copying products?
[2021-11-08T21:12:21] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt have any products, mostly copying product page
[2021-11-08T21:15:11] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-11-08T21:15:21] Mirono escooters: Same as before
[2021-11-08T21:17:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I am playing with VESC CAN bus ;)
[2021-11-08T21:17:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I can read status
[2021-11-08T21:17:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also list VESC present on the bus
[2021-11-08T21:17:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1478@08-11-2021_21-17-46.jpg>
[2021-11-08T21:17:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😊😊
[2021-11-08T22:10:09] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2021-11-08T22:10:15] Artem Bulashev: 🤝
[2021-11-08T22:11:02] Artem Bulashev: I think that one should be best and relatively easy to use once you have all needed parameters addresses
[2021-11-08T22:12:20] Artem Bulashev: But my can knowledge is very limited to piggybacking bmw can line for introduction of false errors 🤣🤣 to get serviced by warranty 😄
[2021-11-08T22:37:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's pretty easy. the 'issue' is vesc is using can to transmit 'long frames' (bigger than the 8 bytes allow by can frame). it makes it a bit diffucult to understand the specific protocol used by those frames.
[2021-11-08T22:38:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i can already do almost everything except setting max current / speed. but i hope it will take only few hours to get it done
[2021-11-08T23:54:22] Unknown: Love the duck, does that kind of throttle work with vesc? I tought there where speed settings etc on such
[2021-11-08T23:56:20] Mirono escooters: Yea it has settings but only works on the controllers made for it But Francois was working on a adaptor or such And yea a throttle is a throttle
[2021-11-08T23:56:44] Artem Bulashev: That’s amazing development man ✅✅✅
[2021-11-09T00:00:55] Unknown: Nice let's all baguette francois 😁😂
[2021-11-09T00:12:26] Artem Bulashev: Here is an idea than if it all works out 😁 Small “connectors board” - would connect to smart controller over can - could be design minimized by using display like water proof cable with many pins and than other side unpinned to be soldered to all the inputs. (May be 2 of 6 pin wire would be enough) - This board could be small enough to easily hind in tiny water proof case up under steering bar, or even May fit typical miniMotor / zero / other display enclose! - it could double as pass through for display UART and take in ADC from display to pass over can to smart controller. = result is super clean versatile set up with utilization of oem display, any throttle, while having controls connect to it on top of steering, meaning only 4 wires would need to go down the stem for smartcontroller in the deck, or only 2 power and ground in case of smart display. (It could also be mounter simply behind any display for clean look if pcb would not fit inside oem typical screen) —————— Than output board would be located in the deck and would switch on turn signals /stop signals/headlights outputs or via addressable led address or both. Horn / alarm siren output could be placed there due to similar nature (gyroscope/accelerometer based alarms? Locked armed mode?)
[2021-11-09T00:13:01] Artem Bulashev: Em train of thoughts sorry, might be obvious for you at this stage ahah
[2021-11-09T07:55:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: could you make a quick schematic please ? i have some troubles following you 😅
[2021-11-09T10:22:05] Artem Bulashev: Sure will do
[2021-11-09T12:54:11] Artem Bulashev: https://spintend.com/products/75v-200a-dual-motor-controller-ubox-based-on-vesc
[2021-11-09T12:54:22] Artem Bulashev: v2 is now on sale
[2021-11-09T12:54:57] Mirono escooters: Oempf 300$
[2021-11-09T12:55:08] Artem Bulashev: same as v1
[2021-11-09T12:55:37] Mirono escooters: Yea i know
[2021-11-09T12:55:44] Mirono escooters: Its just a lot for me 🙈
[2021-11-09T12:56:29] Mirono escooters: I stick w flipsky for now :)
[2021-11-09T18:13:38] Unknown: Can i cry out for help? My adc broke a while ago, connected a new one same problem
[2021-11-09T18:14:10] Mirono escooters: I dont use it anymore i just input 3.3v into throttle lol
[2021-11-09T18:14:57] Unknown: Not really gonna look in to it closely today as i am high as a kyte
[2021-11-09T18:16:01] Unknown: And yea i tried without adc adapter but i need one, then arthem got me one, ,worked fine but broke. Now new one does the same as the old one did
[2021-11-09T18:19:35] Unknown: I learned i need adc chip very fast, i orderd 2 new adc's since i'd like a spare and tested it, when testing i saw that it was doing the exact same thing as the last one did
[2021-11-09T19:20:57] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, if someone in EU orders from Spintend please buy one spare adc for me aswell😂
[2021-11-09T19:23:15] Luis Magalhaes: Just some upgrades, no Bluetooth on board right? 😅
[2021-11-09T19:42:27] Unknown: I bought 2, but as i connected one of them.. it did work 🤷‍♂️ Same issue as last time, and had to pay like 50 euro total for 2 adc boards 😒
[2021-11-09T19:43:33] Artem Bulashev: Correct not on board due to poor signal because of metal decks
[2021-11-09T19:44:35] Happy Giraffe: Yeah next time someone should order 4 haha
[2021-11-09T19:44:51] Happy Giraffe: Those bastards cant pay tax beforehand
[2021-11-09T19:45:11] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi plastic bottom ftw
[2021-11-09T19:47:00] Unknown: Yea i orderd 2, 37€ shipping. Vat inc. Delivery guy came and demanded 12.5€ fpr the package... now it looks fine, but it just does not do the thing it supposed to do
[2021-11-09T19:47:08] Unknown: I don't know why
[2021-11-09T19:47:46] Unknown: Last day of work tomorrow, then extended weekend to figure it all out, all help is welcome 😂
[2021-11-09T19:49:01] Artem Bulashev: That controller is for more than Xiaomi 😅 most dual motor scooters are solid metal enclosures so BT had problems communicating. Vsett has plastic top so no problem at all for gps trackers and BT and 2.4ghz controller
[2021-11-09T19:49:32] Happy Giraffe: Only matter of time until someone puts a v8 on xiaomi
[2021-11-09T19:49:43] Artem Bulashev: V8?
[2021-11-09T19:51:09] Happy Giraffe: Was a joke about the crazy modding community
[2021-11-09T19:51:36] Happy Giraffe: Small rockets people have already done on them
[2021-11-09T19:51:46] Artem Bulashev: Oh v8 motor
[2021-11-09T19:52:01] Happy Giraffe: Yes😅
[2021-11-09T19:53:31] Luis Magalhaes: im not having any problem in mine 😂
[2021-11-09T19:54:55] Luis Magalhaes: the xiaomi comunity are crazy as fuck 🤣🤣
[2021-11-09T19:59:05] Mirono escooters: Wich upgrades?
[2021-11-09T19:59:14] Mirono escooters: 😇
[2021-11-09T19:59:21] Mirono escooters: We rlly are
[2021-11-09T20:26:18] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1479@09-11-2021_20-26-18.jpg>
[2021-11-09T20:26:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Charging at 47A 😁
[2021-11-09T20:26:42] Mirono escooters: Wtf 🥰
[2021-11-09T20:26:53] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-09T20:26:57] Mirono escooters: Wich setup
[2021-11-09T20:27:02] Mirono escooters: Wich charger even handles that
[2021-11-09T20:27:15] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1480@09-11-2021_20-27-15.jpg>
[2021-11-09T20:27:19] Happy Giraffe: Lmao, dude plugged in tesla supercharge
[2021-11-09T20:27:25] Face de Pin Sucé: 16S10P Molicel P42A 😁
[2021-11-09T20:27:40] Luis Magalhaes: the power and controll board are removable lolol
[2021-11-09T20:27:58] Luis Magalhaes: 😂 brute
[2021-11-09T20:37:09] Mirono escooters: 🤤
[2021-11-09T20:41:05] Happy Giraffe: Now received 30€ tax haha
[2021-11-09T20:44:13] Artem Bulashev: Can’t wait to get those and finish my pack https://a.aliexpress.com/_9jOftx
[2021-11-09T20:45:17] Mirono escooters: Whats special about em?
[2021-11-09T21:07:16] sombre_enfant: Do you got any battery wrap to sell at your shop ? Im in a hurry and dont have any around 220mm
[2021-11-09T21:08:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope, but maybe SaveMyBattery has some
[2021-11-09T21:08:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Ask me again tomorrow after 20h
[2021-11-09T21:09:03] sombre_enfant: Alright thanks After 20h u still up for this stuff ?
[2021-11-09T21:42:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Im in Paris tomorrow and coming home at 20h, going to SMB to take my battery
[2021-11-09T21:43:20] sombre_enfant: Oh nice i'll send you a remind near 20h tomorrow
[2021-11-09T23:11:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes nice
[2021-11-09T23:58:18] Artem Bulashev: They are higher rated new version of as150 but in single plug and they have also 4 signal pins that can be used for different things hidden inside battery, like tracker module or smart BMS communication to VESC and other things. It’s useful 😊 - I got it because it has Anti spark and it has Lowest IR of all connectors = less losses and sag.
[2021-11-10T08:31:49] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-10T08:32:22] Mirono escooters: In my quest for a cool voltmeter..🤔🤣
[2021-11-10T11:12:03] Mirono escooters: O ps You seem to have ant bms? You prefer that? If so. Why?
[2021-11-10T11:45:00] Mirono escooters: You cant manually turn off on discharge or charge from daly?? Wtf?
[2021-11-10T12:32:36] sombre_enfant: Maybe because its not a daly😭
[2021-11-10T12:32:44] Mirono escooters: Its a daly.
[2021-11-10T12:32:52] Mirono escooters: Official. Came with the paper
[2021-11-10T12:32:59] Mirono escooters: Im not talking about that tiny thing
[2021-11-10T12:33:34] Mirono escooters: Second bms now where i cant manually turn it off or on Garbage. Pure Garbage
[2021-11-10T12:39:33] Face de Pin Sucé: I like ANT because not so big, good quality and good power
[2021-11-10T12:39:40] Face de Pin Sucé: This one is 320A
[2021-11-10T12:40:46] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-10T12:40:52] Mirono escooters: Daly I'm out. So ant is my next best bet
[2021-11-10T12:42:59] Face de Pin Sucé: Go for it, had like 10 BMS from Ant only for me
[2021-11-10T12:43:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Never had a problem
[2021-11-10T12:43:41] Artem Bulashev: They are good but not compact by any means
[2021-11-10T12:44:16] Face de Pin Sucé: You have a 320A 20S BMS more compact than this ? With BLE ?
[2021-11-10T12:44:29] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I went for that other BMS it fit well my space and powerful enough and smart let then ant
[2021-11-10T12:44:42] Artem Bulashev: No I was looking at 60-100a range
[2021-11-10T12:44:47] Artem Bulashev: And ant didn’t fit
[2021-11-10T12:44:57] Artem Bulashev: While that one I posted before did
[2021-11-10T12:45:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes because it's same as 320A with less FETs
[2021-11-10T12:45:05] Artem Bulashev: 320a da duck 😅😅
[2021-11-10T12:45:17] Face de Pin Sucé: So 100A are big yes
[2021-11-10T12:45:23] Mirono escooters: Sad ant display is so.. basic? But daly giving me headaches 🥴
[2021-11-10T17:02:42] Mirono escooters: Im gonna be stupid Can you fill a hydraulic brake kuch xtech kuch With water?
[2021-11-10T17:02:56] Mirono escooters: Im learning how to fill em and hydraulic oil is more € 🥴
[2021-11-10T17:17:52] Happy Giraffe: I'm gonna stay silent at this point
[2021-11-10T17:18:05] Mirono escooters: *visible xtech rage*
[2021-11-10T17:18:19] Mirono escooters: I just used mineral oil dont worry. I figured it out with 2 syringes
[2021-11-10T17:18:24] Mirono escooters: Amount of bubbles jezus
[2021-11-10T17:18:31] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1482@10-11-2021_17-18-31.jpg>

[2021-11-10T17:20:05] Artem Bulashev: Received today those brakes!😍😍😍 shimano m7120 - 4 piston front and break with new design reinforced handle 😍😍 (important for trial jumping 😄😄)
[2021-11-10T17:20:20] Mirono escooters: So small lever
[2021-11-10T17:20:22] Mirono escooters: Cute
[2021-11-10T17:20:30] Artem Bulashev: It’s shifted
[2021-11-10T17:20:39] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1486@10-11-2021_17-20-39.jpg>
[2021-11-10T17:20:51] Artem Bulashev: One finger lever yeah :)
[2021-11-10T17:21:27] Artem Bulashev: I was dreaming about those 🤣🤣 and found guy post locally for 155€ shipped 😍😍 for both without disks, those I had
[2021-11-10T17:21:37] Mirono escooters: Siiick
[2021-11-10T17:22:19] Artem Bulashev: I figured that if I find I don’t need 4 pistons, will install 4 piston on escooter - more heat capacity and install 2 piston on bike
[2021-11-10T17:50:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: smart + vesc + can complete for single vesc. waiting for a spintend to test dual 😁
[2021-11-10T17:50:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a small idea of cables inside
[2021-11-10T17:50:55] Mirono escooters: 💚
[2021-11-10T17:51:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on the can bus, there is also a expansion board. working fine !
[2021-11-10T18:24:13] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 👍i was thinking of upgrade to some mt5 magura 😅
[2021-11-10T18:25:31] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌
[2021-11-10T18:27:03] Artem Bulashev: Nice 😍
[2021-11-10T18:55:11] Happy Giraffe: MT5s are great but be sure to get alu lever
[2021-11-10T19:05:38] Luis Magalhaes: its a kit let me see the link
[2021-11-10T19:06:22] Luis Magalhaes: https://www.probikeshop.pt/par-de-travoes-magura-mt5-2-aa7/131206.html
[2021-11-10T19:07:05] Luis Magalhaes: the cilinder says its carbotecture
[2021-11-10T19:07:08] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2021-11-10T19:07:19] Happy Giraffe: Plastic* but its ok
[2021-11-10T19:07:26] Luis Magalhaes: 5 years warrenty
[2021-11-10T19:07:39] Luis Magalhaes: yap 🤣
[2021-11-10T19:07:53] Luis Magalhaes: 192€ here in portugal
[2021-11-10T19:08:11] Happy Giraffe: Good price for 2
[2021-11-10T19:08:14] Luis Magalhaes: pair of mt5 and disk
[2021-11-10T19:08:29] Happy Giraffe: Then if disc is included its great
[2021-11-10T19:08:52] Luis Magalhaes: yes, without disk was 155 i think
[2021-11-10T19:09:02] Happy Giraffe: Be sure to buy independent brake pads, the wide one works good but 2x small pad is better
[2021-11-10T19:09:14] Luis Magalhaes: but i dont want to use this chinese disk on the magura setup 😅
[2021-11-10T19:09:21] sombre_enfant: Damn u got good price in your country for the same shop
[2021-11-10T19:11:03] Luis Magalhaes: hum, they are diferent? or just the pads?
[2021-11-10T19:14:50] Luis Magalhaes: € 211,90 the m7120 with no disks in this site
[2021-11-10T19:16:05] Luis Magalhaes: are they better then the magura ?
[2021-11-10T19:16:48] Luis Magalhaes: looks same at specs but magura are cheaper in my case
[2021-11-10T19:16:55] Artem Bulashev: Too expensive. Those cost me 155€ for front and rear and they are top notch
[2021-11-10T19:17:17] Luis Magalhaes: nice 👌😂
[2021-11-10T19:17:30] Artem Bulashev: Which are cheaper ?
[2021-11-10T19:17:35] Artem Bulashev: Can you show me link?
[2021-11-10T19:18:20] Luis Magalhaes: the mt5 from magura
[2021-11-10T19:18:33] Luis Magalhaes: from the shimano or the magura ?
[2021-11-10T19:18:38] Artem Bulashev: 211 I don’t think so, minimum I saw new are 230€ set
[2021-11-10T19:18:48] Artem Bulashev: Magura
[2021-11-10T19:19:02] Luis Magalhaes: https://www.probikeshop.pt/par-de-travoes-magura-mt5-2-aa7/131206.html
[2021-11-10T19:19:18] Luis Magalhaes: https://www.probikeshop.pt/par-de-travoes-shimano-slx-m7aa2-4-embolos-j-kit-sem-disco-preto-2-2/186899.html
[2021-11-10T19:19:37] sombre_enfant: I think they're compatible with 3mm disc since its shimano ask @SibClimb . But the shimano single finger feeling is incomparable
[2021-11-10T19:21:40] Happy Giraffe: If you need most power get quad piston with independent pad (for Magura you need to buy them separate but stock pad is ok)
[2021-11-10T19:22:08] Happy Giraffe: Theres also Magura MT5 Bosh estop ABS version with full metal parts
[2021-11-10T19:22:54] Artem Bulashev: Yeah they have servo amplifier of some sort, little pressure results in instant bite
[2021-11-10T19:24:10] Artem Bulashev: Which is what I need for trial bike - great modulation and complete locking with 1 finger 👌👌 Magura feel very different
[2021-11-10T19:24:34] Artem Bulashev: I like this one because it’s first of its kind of handle
[2021-11-10T19:25:26] Artem Bulashev: Mounting is shifted and it is than set against bar, so there is 0 play or wonder 👌👌 again important for sport application
[2021-11-10T19:26:44] Luis Magalhaes: 👍 ok thaks
[2021-11-10T19:29:13] Happy Giraffe: What I mean with independent pads
[2021-11-10T19:29:31] Happy Giraffe: Allows piston to get optimal angle to bite the disc
[2021-11-10T19:30:31] Happy Giraffe: I realized now that I didnt buy two pads, I accidentally bought 8😂
[2021-11-10T19:31:05] Artem Bulashev: Mt5 Magura seems like great option 👌👌
[2021-11-10T19:31:42] Happy Giraffe: Worked fine for me but wanna test it more to give any more praise
[2021-11-10T19:32:47] Happy Giraffe: Control is great and accidentally braking too hard and flipping over bar is almost impossible
[2021-11-10T19:49:20] Mirono escooters: Never too much
[2021-11-10T19:50:03] Happy Giraffe: I guess so lol, lot of rain riding will wear them down but they should last good for a while
[2021-11-10T19:50:57] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that opposite of what I want on trial bike
[2021-11-10T19:53:14] Artem Bulashev: https://youtu.be/HLgTP1mJdfM To give you the taste
[2021-11-10T19:53:40] Happy Giraffe: Exactly, commuting is different
[2021-11-10T19:54:30] Happy Giraffe: Noob who never used front hydros before could do too hard of a quick/emergency braking and fly over on sharp brakes
[2021-11-10T19:55:51] Happy Giraffe: Thats some strong rims and spokes in those😂
[2021-11-10T19:58:31] Mirono escooters: How does rain wear down more then regular?
[2021-11-10T20:06:40] Happy Giraffe: Dirt etc.
[2021-11-10T20:17:08] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2021-11-10T20:18:00] Luis Magalhaes: Ok i get it, i was thinking they where all like that in 4 pistan
[2021-11-10T20:18:48] Luis Magalhaes: Ok lets see then if i can mount them with no problem 😂
[2021-11-10T20:19:12] Luis Magalhaes: Good to know 😂😂
[2021-11-10T20:35:52] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2021-11-10T20:36:20] Mirono escooters: Can we protect brake from it
[2021-11-10T20:38:31] Happy Giraffe: Clean when its dirty
[2021-11-10T20:54:12] sombre_enfant: You got a 100kph scoot dont miss out on brake take dh brake and good pad disk it will be worth it, shimano are reliable for alteast 5year
[2021-11-10T20:57:46] Happy Giraffe: For 100kmh I would buy something better than ebike brake tbh
[2021-11-10T20:58:30] Mirono escooters: Or just no escoot for 100kmh
[2021-11-10T21:03:00] sombre_enfant: When its not a xiaomi frame and it got the setup for 100kph its okay
[2021-11-10T21:03:03] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-11-10T21:03:14] Luis Magalhaes: its not runing allways at 100kmh lolol
[2021-11-10T21:03:23] Luis Magalhaes: it usualy runs at 40 50kmh
[2021-11-10T21:04:06] Luis Magalhaes: but yes better brakes are always good even if it does 25kmh if it stops faster grat
[2021-11-10T21:04:08] Luis Magalhaes: great
[2021-11-10T21:09:58] Happy Giraffe: MT5e (made for 45kmh) should be identical for MT5, only the discs and pads they made is different
[2021-11-10T21:16:20] Luis Magalhaes: ok i was thinking it was just the switch
[2021-11-10T21:17:05] Happy Giraffe: That too, the included pads and discs can be better also. If you can check what items the kit includes?
[2021-11-10T21:17:23] Happy Giraffe: Then we can be sure you dont pay extra for useless shit
[2021-11-10T21:18:17] Luis Magalhaes: Storm HC discs
[2021-11-10T21:18:25] Luis Magalhaes: the pads only says its organic
[2021-11-10T21:18:39] Happy Giraffe: Ooh organic, I would avoid
[2021-11-10T21:19:26] Luis Magalhaes: yes can change them later that would not be a problem
[2021-11-10T21:27:10] Happy Giraffe: I checked, its the Performance pad. I have the same and it was ok in rain👍
[2021-11-10T21:27:44] Happy Giraffe: Only Chinese organic pads loose all grip I suppose😂
[2021-11-10T21:29:26] Artem Bulashev: Honestly
[2021-11-10T21:29:34] Artem Bulashev: Breaks on rear wheel are so pointless
[2021-11-10T21:29:43] Artem Bulashev: I can block the wheel with my foot even
[2021-11-10T21:30:03] Artem Bulashev: Any cheapest mechanical or hydrolic will block it fully
[2021-11-10T21:30:06] Happy Giraffe: Thats why I have some 20€ cable disc there😂
[2021-11-10T21:30:21] Artem Bulashev: Front wheel not sure you want to block ever, so again no point of higher performance breaks there. 4 piston is great for heat mass on those 60kmh 80kmh breaking
[2021-11-10T21:30:22] Happy Giraffe: Isnt Luis buying it for front?
[2021-11-10T21:30:59] Happy Giraffe: My rear brake lmao
[2021-11-10T21:32:53] Artem Bulashev: So for my vsett9+ even with 60v28ah I don’t go above 55kmh - zoom 1 piston mechanical break does the job as good as any hydrolic would in case of emergency it will as much as lock both wheels completely ..
[2021-11-10T21:33:56] Happy Giraffe: Of course, I had enough of unreliable china crap so wanted to go top
[2021-11-10T21:40:25] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂 never had that problem yet
[2021-11-10T21:40:46] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-11-10T21:41:11] Luis Magalhaes: front and back

[2021-11-10T22:17:56] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i know i was joking because of the need of a good rear brake
[2021-11-10T22:18:16] Luis Magalhaes: Its true that even zoom calipers can block the rear wheel
[2021-11-10T22:18:38] Luis Magalhaes: With magura you just do less force 😂
[2021-11-10T22:18:44] Unknown: for me is much better than nutt brakes
[2021-11-10T22:18:58] Luis Magalhaes: Yes it his no doubt
[2021-11-10T22:19:06] sombre_enfant: Old Shimano xt better than a phresh pair of mt5 it show how shimano quality is one of the best

[2021-11-10T22:42:38] Luis Magalhaes: and dont know at what voltage they work 😅
[2021-11-10T22:49:04] Happy Giraffe: They are just a switch to close/open the circuit I think
[2021-11-10T22:49:22] Happy Giraffe: Nothing fancy there going on afaik, I tested with multimeter
[2021-11-10T22:52:27] Unknown: yes, just a switch

[2021-11-10T23:27:47] Happy Giraffe: Wheelway lel
[2021-11-10T23:28:00] Mirono escooters: It came w axle?
[2021-11-10T23:28:04] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2021-11-10T23:28:08] Happy Giraffe: 10mm axle
[2021-11-10T23:28:11] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-10T23:28:32] Happy Giraffe: But the axle is just normal high tensile bolt
[2021-11-10T23:29:28] Unknown: Would such rim fit an m365 with no rear susp and 2.5 tyre? 🤔😂
[2021-11-10T23:29:50] Happy Giraffe: That's exactly what I have
[2021-11-10T23:30:37] Happy Giraffe: You gotta enlarge frame bolt holes and then have spacers to align wheel in proper place, its 1mm business
[2021-11-10T23:33:03] Unknown: What do you mean with the spacers?
[2021-11-10T23:33:20] Unknown: Please picture it for me 😂
[2021-11-10T23:36:41] Happy Giraffe: Frame opening is wider than the rim so you need spacers between frame and the bearings
[2021-11-10T23:44:23] Unknown: Oooh ok, how big of a gap is it?
[2021-11-10T23:45:19] Luis Magalhaes: any one can help here?

[2021-11-10T23:46:09] Luis Magalhaes: a friend of mine conected a ant bms in a battery its not his first time but this is the first time he cant change or read the parameters
[2021-11-10T23:46:59] Unknown: Ouch, blocked by something? 🤔
[2021-11-10T23:47:08] Luis Magalhaes: i think its because it aint configured right
[2021-11-10T23:47:31] Luis Magalhaes: dont know he already did a reset and nothing changes
[2021-11-10T23:47:50] Mirono escooters: Replug balance wires?
[2021-11-10T23:47:52] Luis Magalhaes: all at 0 in parameters and cant change them
[2021-11-10T23:48:27] Unknown: Maybe it's a faulty bms or bt, can he try to do it trough usb?
[2021-11-10T23:48:43] Luis Magalhaes: dont know i will ask him
[2021-11-10T23:48:49] Luis Magalhaes: think yes
[2021-11-10T23:49:56] Unknown: I'd say try usb, if not working contact store for a replacement.. something must be wrong as it don't even show max volt or max low volt etc
[2021-11-10T23:50:16] Luis Magalhaes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myGlZyOAtI4&ab_channel=SmartAzz

[2021-11-10T23:52:48] Mirono escooters: App
[2021-11-10T23:53:03] Luis Magalhaes: Ok so Mr Ant BMS has created a new bms 2021/07/03 The old vbms and ant bms software (apps) both android and iOS versions will not change the values of the new bms. You need to download Hopefully this will help someone (your welcome) very important : Newest BMS must use newest app ! can't use old app to change parameters !
[2021-11-10T23:53:07] Luis Magalhaes: dam...

[2021-11-10T23:55:33] Mirono escooters: Way
[2021-11-10T23:57:02] Unknown: True, but can you configure the older bms's with the newer app? That's rthe real question 😂
[2021-11-10T23:57:47] Luis Magalhaes: that's what i was thinking too
[2021-11-10T23:59:27] Mirono escooters: I think so hes

[2021-11-11T00:04:16] Unknown: Untill you put your amps as high as you setup your bms and scoot dies out 😭😂😂
[2021-11-11T00:04:36] Mirono escooters: My antispark died I got a breaker instead 🥴
[2021-11-11T00:05:11] Unknown: Lolz i got a fuse, 50A and xt90 with antispark
[2021-11-11T00:05:37] Mirono escooters: I need to sometimes manually reset it bcs.. daly

[2021-11-11T00:07:53] Happy Giraffe: Bluetooth man
[2021-11-11T00:08:24] Mirono escooters: Have to specially ask in factory so they can program it so i can turn it on off manually Wtf? Seemed like basic feature to me Smells like cheaping out
[2021-11-11T00:08:25] Happy Giraffe: My really diy spacer solution

[2021-11-11T10:14:32] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2021-11-11T10:15:21] Artem Bulashev: Can was re designed slightly it seems @koxx3
[2021-11-11T10:17:54] Artem Bulashev: Mine is cable, so less points of failure
[2021-11-11T11:52:13] Mirono escooters: 2 already??😅
[2021-11-11T12:05:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. i've seen the video yesterday
[2021-11-11T12:05:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the 5v on the can line must be used to power on the 2nd vesc
[2021-11-11T13:28:47] Happy Giraffe: They sent me vesc without bolts wtf
[2021-11-11T13:32:02] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-11-11T13:32:09] Mirono escooters: I got questions about spintend
[2021-11-11T13:32:19] Happy Giraffe: Now I need to search for bolts that sit flat if I wanna use thermal paste
[2021-11-11T13:32:30] Happy Giraffe: How fucking bad can they be
[2021-11-11T13:32:48] Mirono escooters: Bad

[2021-11-11T13:35:22] Happy Giraffe: Bolts here
[2021-11-11T13:35:37] Mirono escooters: Why? Board gets so hot?
[2021-11-11T13:35:41] Mirono escooters: Small improvrmrnts i see
[2021-11-11T13:36:33] Happy Giraffe: Those screws were not used before
[2021-11-11T13:36:38] Happy Giraffe: I think insulation
[2021-11-11T13:36:56] Mirono escooters: Special insulation
[2021-11-11T13:43:22] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1504@11-11-2021_13-43-22.jpg>
[2021-11-11T13:43:22] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1505@11-11-2021_13-43-22.jpg>

[2021-11-11T13:46:25] Happy Giraffe: They replaced power side completely
[2021-11-11T13:47:20] Happy Giraffe: Also logic board is different
[2021-11-11T13:49:21] Happy Giraffe: My next hope is that pcb insulation around metal screws is properly done
[2021-11-11T14:41:53] Luis Magalhaes: The first one they send to me was like that, without bolts, you know the rest of the story 😂
[2021-11-11T14:52:39] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1506@11-11-2021_14-52-39.jpg>

[2021-11-11T14:53:42] Mirono escooters: I should make a graph w flipsky lol
[2021-11-11T14:54:45] Happy Giraffe: Luckily I invented new fast bolt customization method
[2021-11-11T14:55:02] Mirono escooters: Engineer
[2021-11-11T14:55:47] Luis Magalhaes: 🙈
[2021-11-11T14:55:55] Happy Giraffe: Its called "Yeetus Drillimus"
[2021-11-11T14:56:05] Happy Giraffe: Eye protection advised
[2021-11-11T14:57:14] Luis Magalhaes: I put bolts on mine too was just the external case ones but told spintend that
[2021-11-11T14:58:19] Luis Magalhaes: When it burn out he said its was defective and it pass controll without the bolts they cover all and send new one
[2021-11-11T14:58:46] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂👍
[2021-11-11T14:58:57] Happy Giraffe: I send with bolts but they stole my bolts roflmao
[2021-11-11T14:59:09] Happy Giraffe: Probably ran out of them themselves
[2021-11-11T14:59:18] Mirono escooters: Hahahah
[2021-11-11T14:59:20] Mirono escooters: Waw

[2021-11-11T15:14:20] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2021-11-11T15:14:25] Happy Giraffe: PCB screw design also worries me, its the most common reason why PC GPU riser cables short with the motherboard and case
[2021-11-11T15:15:14] Happy Giraffe: NZXT had H1 case start burns and smoke because of the 12v short lol
[2021-11-11T15:16:18] Happy Giraffe: Again Im just a musician but this PCB stuff is common knowledge
[2021-11-11T15:24:02] Artem Bulashev: Oh I see good way and simple
[2021-11-11T15:24:03] Artem Bulashev: So can 5v is acting like power button

[2021-11-11T15:26:12] Artem Bulashev: Watch out
[2021-11-11T15:26:25] Artem Bulashev: I told you before. Check for solder balls
[2021-11-11T15:27:00] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1509@11-11-2021_15-27-00.jpg>
[2021-11-11T15:28:58] Artem Bulashev: I found a few …
[2021-11-11T15:29:15] Artem Bulashev: Haha ok you got those
[2021-11-11T15:29:37] Mirono escooters: Customers shouldnt need to do this ._.
[2021-11-11T15:30:01] Happy Giraffe: Yep, same places
[2021-11-11T15:30:09] Happy Giraffe: Those I took out
[2021-11-11T15:30:21] Artem Bulashev: Make sure you send photo of solder balls to them
[2021-11-11T15:30:34] Happy Giraffe: I dont want to deal with them anymore
[2021-11-11T15:31:02] Happy Giraffe: Atleast they soldered phase wires well...
[2021-11-11T15:32:31] Happy Giraffe: Next I buy flipsky for my ebike project, done with Spintend
[2021-11-11T15:33:09] Mirono escooters: Waw
[2021-11-11T15:33:14] Mirono escooters: The flipsky ones were so pretty too
[2021-11-11T15:33:18] Mirono escooters: Yess
[2021-11-11T15:33:28] Mirono escooters: Flipsky gang getting bigger😀
[2021-11-11T15:45:38] Happy Giraffe: Hello XT150
[2021-11-11T16:23:21] Happy Giraffe: @artBula can I connect in parallel BT module cables and ADC port? (If I remember correctly I could only choose one)
[2021-11-11T16:23:53] Happy Giraffe: Because on single vesc the BT module uses same port thats already occupied by adc😅
[2021-11-11T16:25:24] Happy Giraffe: Im a bit confused on what port I can put the BT in
[2021-11-11T16:26:54] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1511@11-11-2021_16-26-54.jpg>
[2021-11-11T16:27:14] Happy Giraffe: +, GND and two signal from module
[2021-11-11T16:27:36] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1512@11-11-2021_16-27-36.jpg>
[2021-11-11T16:30:04] Happy Giraffe: Maybe spintend thought people dont want throttle and phone lol
[2021-11-11T17:16:16] Artem Bulashev: Not sure
[2021-11-11T17:16:30] Happy Giraffe: CL and CH are can?
[2021-11-11T17:17:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-11-11T17:17:38] Happy Giraffe: Thanks!
[2021-11-11T17:17:49] Happy Giraffe: Could BT module then be connected to can?🤔
[2021-11-11T17:19:40] Happy Giraffe: I can't check if can has such function as Im not connected
[2021-11-11T17:26:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no
[2021-11-11T17:26:13] Happy Giraffe: Cable color order doesn't match here, but I'm just wondering if I could change it
[2021-11-11T17:26:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: uart only
[2021-11-11T17:26:22] Happy Giraffe: Oh
[2021-11-11T17:26:37] Happy Giraffe: So its only for the same port as ADC
[2021-11-11T17:27:18] Happy Giraffe: And I think I cant put them two in single port either? So have to choose🙈
[2021-11-11T18:38:28] Unknown: Yup
[2021-11-11T18:39:02] Unknown: Tried to flip discharge on/off, i cant indeed
[2021-11-11T18:39:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: just unplug the pins, rewire and use gnd from anywhere else
[2021-11-11T18:39:28] Mirono escooters: Shit..
[2021-11-11T18:39:34] Mirono escooters: Ok im not only one then
[2021-11-11T18:41:09] Unknown: Idd haha
[2021-11-11T18:58:47] Happy Giraffe: But then I have to choose from vesc tool what the port has?
[2021-11-11T20:37:27] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1514@11-11-2021_20-37-27.jpg>
[2021-11-11T20:37:37] Face de Pin Sucé: So slow 10A charge 😅
[2021-11-11T20:38:50] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-11-11T20:38:56] Mirono escooters: Me vibin with 2
[2021-11-11T20:40:47] Unknown: 3.2 😀
[2021-11-11T21:39:37] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂 i fast charge at 5A 😂😂
[2021-11-11T21:40:07] Luis Magalhaes: Normaly charge at 2A
[2021-11-11T21:40:16] Luis Magalhaes: Have time to charge 😂
[2021-11-11T21:41:11] Unknown: But you guys got bigass batts 🤣 im only on 4p
[2021-11-11T21:41:21] Unknown: With the molicel p42a's
[2021-11-11T21:41:27] Mirono escooters: At 40a wich temps did cells reach? @SibClimb
[2021-11-11T21:41:40] Unknown: I love how batts live longer then 😂
[2021-11-11T21:54:42] Luis Magalhaes: You have better cells then me 😂
[2021-11-11T22:10:50] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1515@11-11-2021_22-10-50.jpg>
[2021-11-11T22:10:52] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-11-11T22:11:49] Unknown: Lol 😂
[2021-11-11T22:13:19] Happy Giraffe: Pirate dares to post this after he was sponsored by Flipsky
[2021-11-11T22:13:23] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-11T22:16:28] Mirono escooters: His fault or?
[2021-11-11T22:16:34] Mirono escooters: He is??
[2021-11-11T22:16:48] Mirono escooters: So expensive lol
[2021-11-11T22:19:02] Happy Giraffe: Obviously on some videos Flipsky sent him free stuff and he praised it without even testing it properly😂
[2021-11-11T22:19:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vertical usb without casing ? it's completly crazy !
[2021-11-11T22:19:49] Mirono escooters: @smort designers
[2021-11-11T22:20:14] Happy Giraffe: They should have a competition with Spintend whos vesc smokes the darkest smoke
[2021-11-11T22:20:14] Mirono escooters: It seems like the connector pins are intact The ground thing just loosened
[2021-11-11T22:20:18] Mirono escooters: So resolder
[2021-11-11T22:20:18] Happy Giraffe: 3...2..1..GO!
[2021-11-11T22:20:23] Mirono escooters: Mine still works!
[2021-11-11T22:20:27] Mirono escooters: At 150a 😇😇🤣
[2021-11-11T22:20:39] Happy Giraffe: Mine has green light now lol, time to setup
[2021-11-11T22:21:08] Happy Giraffe: Spintend smoke was light like vaping. I was disappointed
[2021-11-11T22:21:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sure, but a lot of chance many arrives like this.
[2021-11-11T22:22:10] Luis Magalhaes: Transport maybe
[2021-11-11T22:22:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i fried spintend can bus yesterday... but it was my fault (50v on the connector 🤪)
[2021-11-11T22:23:06] Happy Giraffe: Hahaha
[2021-11-11T22:23:31] Happy Giraffe: I feel better about my challenges as I see better guys struggle aswell😂
[2021-11-11T22:23:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it maid a nice firework 😁
[2021-11-11T22:24:06] Happy Giraffe: Spintend has some talent for those, they ended up replacing my unit completely and not even bothering to repair
[2021-11-11T22:24:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: cleanup... and still working (except dual can, just single)
[2021-11-11T22:24:49] Happy Giraffe: Its impressive if single works
[2021-11-11T22:25:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this one a lived hell ...
[2021-11-11T22:25:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: adc dead on core 1 (ground loop), core 2 dead (3.3v out... and may be more), and now CAN 🤤🤤
[2021-11-11T22:26:54] Happy Giraffe: Haha, I dont bother with experimenting and learning. I ride 25km and I bet this one smokes aswell😂
[2021-11-11T22:27:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: once installed, it's rare to smoke one.
[2021-11-11T22:27:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the main issue is cabling
[2021-11-11T22:27:39] Happy Giraffe: I want to believe you😅
[2021-11-11T22:28:22] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, on xiaomi its a nightmare to route all my extra cables for lights and backpack battery😅
[2021-11-11T22:28:52] Happy Giraffe: Need to take everything out and then duct tape together and push in
[2021-11-11T22:29:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳
[2021-11-11T22:29:54] Happy Giraffe: Poor Xiaomi joined #MeToo I guess
[2021-11-11T22:32:53] Artem Bulashev: and thats good for your battery
[2021-11-11T22:34:55] Artem Bulashev: thats the old one I hope than? you keep on killing a dead body I see 😄😄
[2021-11-11T22:35:15] Artem Bulashev: preaty sure it is all reparable
[2021-11-11T22:36:12] Artem Bulashev: I have a guy who repairs VESCs and ubox he did as well many times
[2021-11-11T22:36:22] Artem Bulashev: if you decide. he is in russia
[2021-11-11T22:36:38] Artem Bulashev: I will bee flying for new years and can get it done
[2021-11-11T22:37:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i killed one. i have one installed and safe. and this one is my test unit... so 2 deads. but i make so many tests, pluging, unpluging. it's have to keep them safe.
[2021-11-11T22:37:44] Artem Bulashev: cant you repair them?
[2021-11-11T22:38:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: of course everything can be repaired. but without schematics, it hard to undestand where the issue come from, find the component reference
[2021-11-11T22:38:27] Artem Bulashev: well may be he can help
[2021-11-11T22:38:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 'he' ?
[2021-11-11T22:38:56] Artem Bulashev: yeah
[2021-11-11T22:39:17] Artem Bulashev: I have person I know that repares VESC all the time for many years now
[2021-11-11T22:39:33] Artem Bulashev: and another who is in dev team of Spintend
[2021-11-11T22:39:46] Artem Bulashev: should be possible to figure out what is needed
[2021-11-11T22:40:00] Artem Bulashev: both in Russia
[2021-11-11T22:40:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think @Foujiwara will be able to repair when he'll be back... and much closer to me
[2021-11-11T22:40:11] Happy Giraffe: Damn! Powerful comrades you got
[2021-11-11T22:40:43] Artem Bulashev: not sure who this is but just letting you know that it is possible
[2021-11-11T22:40:51] Artem Bulashev: to find out missing info
[2021-11-11T22:40:52] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: hello
[2021-11-11T22:40:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok. thanks
[2021-11-11T22:40:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: what happen
[2021-11-11T22:40:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: xD
[2021-11-11T22:41:00] Artem Bulashev: 🙂:)
[2021-11-11T22:41:30] Artem Bulashev: discussing burned components on @koxx3 uboxs haha
[2021-11-11T22:41:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @Foujiwara is crazier than me 🤣
[2021-11-11T22:42:00] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2021-11-11T22:42:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and much better than me for repairs (and more equiped)
[2021-11-11T22:42:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-11-11T22:48:18] Happy Giraffe: Was FW 5.2 before on Single vesc?
[2021-11-11T22:53:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yeah i distroy my kitchen with the electronic experience, I have competitor here? 😂
[2021-11-11T22:56:39] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I try make 150v esc based on the M365 esc 😂 and that work a bit at 125v before arrive at the speed when the oem firmware do lots of shit and my mosfet die 😂
[2021-11-11T22:56:55] Mirono escooters: Siick
[2021-11-11T22:57:09] Mirono escooters: M365 esc (M gonna get hate) Is a good cheap base for extreme mods
[2021-11-11T22:59:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes is it, he have a group where we add the good dev where we proposed to develop a home firmware for esc m365 and now it's in the good way thanks to a very efficient guy
[2021-11-11T23:02:21] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Firmware controlled by VESC command, vesc tool hall sensor automatic adjustment ok Resistor and Inductor measurements ok vesc command for control the motor ok and others parameters too
[2021-11-11T23:02:21] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: <video_file>
[2021-11-11T23:03:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that will never have all the fonctions of vesc of course, it's just impossible on this uC, but the target it's use this esc for electric véhicule and the enough parameters for that
[2021-11-11T23:04:00] Artem Bulashev: hm... for such high voltages you need to have completely different PCB design and spacing. even common DC conneectors wont be good fit
[2021-11-11T23:04:16] Happy Giraffe: Vesc values on Blade motor and choosing 2000g outrunner
[2021-11-11T23:04:47] Artem Bulashev: preaty sure 700g selection should be used
[2021-11-11T23:05:01] Happy Giraffe: Even in a motor thats like 7kg?
[2021-11-11T23:05:45] Artem Bulashev: far all scooters as far as I saw - I tried mine on 2kg selection and feed back was terrible didnt even spin\
[2021-11-11T23:05:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes of course, but I had external logic power supply, the high power stage was adapted with 150v mosfet 200V cap and the driver mosfet is already for high voltage but sure it's not enough but I tryed it
[2021-11-11T23:06:03] Happy Giraffe: This spun really effortless and precise
[2021-11-11T23:06:05] Artem Bulashev: i see that makes sense
[2021-11-11T23:06:25] Happy Giraffe: I will do 700g and compare
[2021-11-11T23:06:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that failed expecialy because the firmware turn crazy when you increase too much the voltage because at low speed they was worked
[2021-11-11T23:07:12] Artem Bulashev: thats good, but question is how it would drive - mine spined as well in the air, but could not move once I put it on the ground and stepped on it
[2021-11-11T23:07:18] Face de Pin Sucé: 39°c starting at 23
[2021-11-11T23:07:34] Artem Bulashev: nice man!
[2021-11-11T23:07:46] Happy Giraffe: 750g
[2021-11-11T23:08:14] Happy Giraffe: Same measures, Amp suggestion is useless still
[2021-11-11T23:08:27] Artem Bulashev: yeah
[2021-11-11T23:08:50] Artem Bulashev: well what is the next step? 😄 5kg?
[2021-11-11T23:09:26] Happy Giraffe: Haha, gives me 300A
[2021-11-11T23:11:28] sombre_enfant: Is it because of the memory size of stm ? Because Charles removed the limit of partition to get the 128kb
[2021-11-11T23:13:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: before the fire 🔥
[2021-11-11T23:14:03] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no it's because Ram, memory, capacity of calculate with floating values.. that why vesc run on F4 series not F1
[2021-11-11T23:15:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: <photos/photo_1520@11-11-2021_23-15-30.jpg>
[2021-11-11T23:15:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's valid on any m365 controller ?
[2021-11-11T23:15:47] sombre_enfant: Oh nice u totally deported the power side and 12mos u changed the resistor on driver to feed them enough so they dont switch crazy ? Maybe the high speed problem come from here
[2021-11-11T23:15:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i knew gd32f103 had 128k, but official stm32f103 too ?
[2021-11-11T23:16:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: omg. scary
[2021-11-11T23:17:29] Artem Bulashev: if I understood corretly at 125v RPM is so fast that F1 is not fast enough to compute input and outpput for PID controller and freaks out
[2021-11-11T23:17:52] sombre_enfant: I dont really know about fw stuff but he had managed to unlock it to get the full memory size to create his own fw and put it, it didnt came out officialy, i only got pic/vid of app and some explanation, but ask him, i dont even know what im talking about on this topic
[2021-11-11T23:17:52] Artem Bulashev: not due to fets switching frequencies
[2021-11-11T23:18:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah. i've made it too. but i wasn't sure it'd work on all controllers.
[2021-11-11T23:19:49] sombre_enfant: Really, damn he wasted so much time to read/write on that partition while u already made it 😅 u could colaborate or sum
[2021-11-11T23:20:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: anyway, the main issue is ram, not flash 😅😅
[2021-11-11T23:20:35] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: for différents thinks at 125v and with my mosfets and my long and shit circuit it's not good good have food mosfet attack and also with m365 esc he accelerate alone and upper some speed he turn crazy I don't know how to explain, but even in 84v it's the same, the high speed wheel in the air is irregular
[2021-11-11T23:21:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: because he accelerate to much and brake too much and accelerate again too much...
[2021-11-11T23:22:06] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it is in a kind of rebound acceleration braking which is very violent for the power electronics
[2021-11-11T23:22:10] sombre_enfant: The spanish completed 12mos and current shunt and a ton of resistor and firmware to make it works properly at 80A battery
[2021-11-11T23:22:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: not need that I work at 70A batterie at 36v with 6 mosfets
[2021-11-11T23:23:05] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: or 3800w at 20S battery with 6 mosfets
[2021-11-11T23:23:27] sombre_enfant: Only peak right ?
[2021-11-11T23:24:25] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: with 12 mosfets we can in theory go yo 4500w or more, the problem is the charge of mosfet the circuit etc 2 mosfets have double charge than one, that mean without modify the gate attack circuit you will reduce the commutation speed, so lower performance
[2021-11-11T23:25:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: peak yes but for 3-4 secondes in acceleration, I have nothing to brake the motor at this power
[2021-11-11T23:25:43] sombre_enfant: I guess its fine they changed resistor to feed more current on the mos and also overvolt to 16v via sy8502 u4
[2021-11-11T23:26:26] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: the resistor is there for limited the current for the driver not for the mosfet, or for limited the rebond effect in the gate
[2021-11-11T23:26:36] sombre_enfant: I would like that on my dual g30
[2021-11-11T23:26:40] Artem Bulashev: PID freak out (oscillation) try reducing P and D
[2021-11-11T23:26:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: just reduce this value will be stress the driver mosfet, have to check in the oscilloscope to know
[2021-11-11T23:27:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: exactly, but in the m365 firm you can't adjust that... why I searched a guy to interested and dev a firm for m365 esc
[2021-11-11T23:27:54] sombre_enfant: They leaked a pic then removed it because the firmware isnt available now, i didnt downloaded sadly
[2021-11-11T23:28:04] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and that in this the way now 👏
[2021-11-11T23:28:27] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2021-11-11T23:28:55] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you can it's exactly the same hardware, except one battery shunt in addition and some io available
[2021-11-11T23:30:03] sombre_enfant: few days ago, I tried an extreme mod on an ESC. The result has been incredible, but I have burned the motor 😅 They have asked me for the details of the modification, I have prepared a document for those who want to test it. IT IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL, NOT GUARANTEED !!!
[2021-11-11T23:30:20] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but need to renforced the power lines, capacitors and it's enough for beginning, my prototype run at 3800w 20S work only with that and M365 custom firm remove the bms and voltage limitation, and of course another battery
[2021-11-11T23:31:06] Mirono escooters: Wtf 🙈🙈🙈
[2021-11-11T23:31:35] sombre_enfant: Alright but still cant really do anything till theres not the fw available for it, g30 community is the worst one for esc mod, i kinda developed it (basic overvolt)
[2021-11-11T23:31:47] Happy Giraffe: Now you do Monty Python and slap your foot on it
[2021-11-11T23:34:09] sombre_enfant: Also i would like your nice method to feed the 12v without the sy8502 by a powerbank
[2021-11-11T23:35:08] Mirono escooters: Just a step up from 5v.to 12v? Xd
[2021-11-11T23:35:58] sombre_enfant: It dont work like that man
[2021-11-11T23:36:21] Mirono escooters: Why..?
[2021-11-11T23:36:35] Mirono escooters: Ive done it lol
[2021-11-11T23:36:56] sombre_enfant: The sy8502 get activated from the dash how can you turn it on
[2021-11-11T23:37:10] sombre_enfant: To test the board not to ride with it ?
[2021-11-11T23:38:42] Mirono escooters: Sy8502fcc is 12v stepdown If u power it after it What does it matter?
[2021-11-11T23:38:54] Mirono escooters: Just when u wanna turn on scoot plug powerbank in?
[2021-11-11T23:41:03] sombre_enfant: On est pas au Sénégal ici
[2021-11-11T23:41:27] sombre_enfant: Too hood for me
[2021-11-11T23:41:43] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-11-11T23:41:46] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: without power latch it'd easy just put 12v in the 12v line, but with power latch it's more difficult
[2021-11-11T23:41:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 😂😂
[2021-11-11T23:42:02] Mirono escooters: Yea thats y i just suggested without lol
[2021-11-11T23:42:35] Mirono escooters: If u can do with power latch that sounds great
[2021-11-11T23:42:39] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you can remplace the SY if you can repair it
[2021-11-11T23:42:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: the trace burned can be repaired
[2021-11-11T23:43:14] sombre_enfant: Ye but repair all this lil track...
[2021-11-11T23:43:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I have 5 controller 2.1 and 2 controller G30 will arrive soon for making experiments again
[2021-11-11T23:44:29] sombre_enfant: Let me know if u can do interesting project with g30 controller, i got and had a lot of them
[2021-11-11T23:44:36] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: for me it's easy, but I have the material for it (binocular, the very adapted soldering stuff etx)
[2021-11-11T23:45:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: for sure we can use the firmware currently in development on it, and then use it as we wish
[2021-11-11T23:45:52] sombre_enfant: I will remove the sy8502 of an esx or max plus rental esc then try if it dont then i do the ghetto step down
[2021-11-11T23:46:32] sombre_enfant: I dont even know wich pin i need to connect the stepdown...
[2021-11-11T23:47:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you have to use the same regulator if not the pinouts and the component around will be not match
[2021-11-11T23:48:23] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Woow it's really damage, maybe have other tings die
[2021-11-11T23:50:07] sombre_enfant: Yes two smd caps on the side all caps for power and the one to supply exploded too, i guess the guy was using some shitty bms on ext battery that cutted mid ride, all mosfet are fine
[2021-11-11T23:51:16] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yeah like lots of guy with stupid battery kit
[2021-11-11T23:51:45] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: last time we explain why ppl don't have to use the classic bms connexion but ppl didn't listen
[2021-11-11T23:52:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I even made explanatory videos in front of the oscilloscope with practical examples of what is happening
[2021-11-11T23:53:01] sombre_enfant: When i do an esc I warn them to dont use bad battery setup, but they keep using stock battery mixed with some random common port daly bms so it broke the first meter down the street...
[2021-11-11T23:54:08] sombre_enfant: Some people say stock battery is fine till external battery bms is external port... But i've never tested...
[2021-11-11T23:54:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I don't understand what you mean
[2021-11-11T23:58:46] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but for résume the power loop must never be able to be opened the circuit in the negative current direction, that simple
[2021-11-11T23:59:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and common bms can be it, so if the bms do it automatically the esc die
[2021-11-11T23:59:59] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: one exception is if you don't have elec brake or any regen
[2021-11-12T00:01:01] sombre_enfant: Yeah then external port is fine
[2021-11-12T00:13:59] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1523@12-11-2021_00-13-59.jpg>
[2021-11-12T00:13:59] Mirono escooters: 2*115 = 230nC cannot work fine with m365 controller
[2021-11-12T00:14:16] Mirono escooters: Feedback from diff group about your 150v setup?🤔
[2021-11-12T00:14:23] Mirono escooters: (Im dumb just forwarding)
[2021-11-12T00:14:40] Mirono escooters: The driver cannot push it because the current isn’t sufficient , and also need do some mods at the resistor between driver and FETs
[2021-11-12T00:17:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I don't think so, don't talked a lot about that
[2021-11-12T00:19:30] Mirono escooters: I sended it
[2021-11-12T00:19:31] Mirono escooters: To them
[2021-11-12T00:19:34] Mirono escooters: And someone replied this
[2021-11-12T00:20:10] Happy Giraffe: I've managed to keep myself on vesc topic today, what an achievement
[2021-11-12T00:20:25] Artem Bulashev: 😂
[2021-11-12T00:20:44] Mirono escooters: Proud
[2021-11-12T00:20:55] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ahhh oki, yes but it's not the only reason, just the longueur of the wire playing about it
[2021-11-12T00:21:18] Mirono escooters: Aah
[2021-11-12T00:21:23] Mirono escooters: So would require shitload of mods?
[2021-11-12T00:22:09] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes, it would even deserve a new pcb
[2021-11-12T00:22:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but for 20S the oem esc with some modif is enough
[2021-11-12T00:22:51] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-11-12T00:23:01] Mirono escooters: Idk who in their right minds want higher then 20s?
[2021-11-12T00:23:31] Mirono escooters: I wanna make a opensource upgraded xiaomi controller but im too dumb fo it
[2021-11-12T00:24:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I do not know, me?
[2021-11-12T00:24:55] Mirono escooters: Yea but u dont seem to apply to in their right minds ;)
[2021-11-12T00:27:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: haha yes xD but the futur it's the higher voltage
[2021-11-12T00:28:04] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 20S it's just common voltage now, the news wheels arrive in 120v
[2021-11-12T00:28:10] Mirono escooters: Really??
[2021-11-12T00:28:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes, Inmotion Unicycle is in 20S since the V5 one, more 5 years ago lol...
[2021-11-12T00:29:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: the new V12 is in 24S like lots of others wheels and the new kingsong S20 is in 120v (around 30s)
[2021-11-12T00:29:52] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2021-11-12T00:29:53] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-12T00:30:01] Mirono escooters: Whats the reason? Higher v less amps?
[2021-11-12T00:30:07] Mirono escooters: Cant be for speed right
[2021-11-12T00:30:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and the motorcycle, car, futur airplane... of course it's in 300-600vdc
[2021-11-12T00:31:20] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes higher voltage less amp and if you have less amp you can use wire more smaller etc...
[2021-11-12T00:31:54] Mirono escooters: Car i see why
[2021-11-12T00:32:01] Mirono escooters: Fair :)
[2021-11-12T00:32:03] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that why we transport the current in 20kv in the line, like that we can use small aluminum wire for transport high power
[2021-11-12T00:32:20] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: imagine 1MW in 36v 😂
[2021-11-12T00:32:22] Mirono escooters: Yea thats fuckin sick. Read about that
[2021-11-12T00:32:25] Mirono escooters: Ooef
[2021-11-12T00:32:27] Mirono escooters: Toasty
[2021-11-12T00:32:34] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2021-11-12T00:33:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yeah, and I also want esc high voltage because I have lots of motors from wheel, and it's very low kv motor, if I want make projet to go faster, i need increase the voltage ⚡
[2021-11-12T00:33:56] Mirono escooters: Sad vesc is mostly 16s
[2021-11-12T00:34:01] Mirono escooters: But good for most projects
[2021-11-12T00:34:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and it's not only for the speed, if for example I want to can be 0-50km to 0 - 100% battery, I need also increase the voltage
[2021-11-12T00:34:35] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes you have one in 20S but... 400$ unit
[2021-11-12T00:35:26] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that why I'm interested about M365 esc, sheap, small, efficient, 20S capable with low modification
[2021-11-12T00:35:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I involve one to 100v too, with other one regulator
[2021-11-12T00:35:44] Mirono escooters: Oempf
[2021-11-12T00:35:51] Mirono escooters: Yea :) i like xiaomi esc
[2021-11-12T00:36:04] Mirono escooters: Cant find diff esc for 50€+- 20s capable
[2021-11-12T00:36:17] Mirono escooters: And kinda programmable the custom firmware has become greaay
[2021-11-12T00:36:34] Mirono escooters: Oh check oug flipsky 75100 ps 20s max 100a
[2021-11-12T00:36:37] Mirono escooters: 100€
[2021-11-12T00:36:54] Artem Bulashev: Objectively there are a lot of reasons NOT to go above 75v on escooters.
[2021-11-12T00:37:13] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-11-12T00:37:15] Mirono escooters: I kbow
[2021-11-12T00:37:19] Mirono escooters: Me vibin with 13
[2021-11-12T00:37:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Wut ?
[2021-11-12T00:38:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Please tell me some reasons
[2021-11-12T00:38:18] Mirono escooters: Oh no we awakened the crazy scooter people
[2021-11-12T00:38:23] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jOdUUpbCZVHQc2-eIezrbkNFHuf14I3zOeL0la91yoo/edit?usp=drivesdk
[2021-11-12T00:39:01] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: exact, or yes but no FOC, not with uart, not with power latch etc..
[2021-11-12T00:39:20] Mirono escooters: 🤷‍♂️
[2021-11-12T00:39:23] Mirono escooters: Cheap so yea
[2021-11-12T00:39:26] Mirono escooters: Its foc no??
[2021-11-12T00:39:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes shit esc with 8 bits uC, simple commutation noisy and not efficiency mode yeah
[2021-11-12T00:39:53] Mirono escooters: PhA V_sense*R19060322k? 17 PhB V_sense*R21060322k? 18 PhC V_sense*R22060322k? 19 Pull_down PHA*R6A080520k39k 20 Pull_down PHB*R6B080520k39k 21 Pull_down PHC* This im interested in. Paolo is experimenting with adjusting these to 20s and he saw temps drop
[2021-11-12T00:40:01] Mirono escooters: Cheap
[2021-11-12T00:40:02] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2021-11-12T00:40:04] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: oh sorry, you said cant I read can 😂
[2021-11-12T00:40:31] Mirono escooters: Huh?
[2021-11-12T00:40:56] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow I try 13s vesc and I think Im gonna shit in my pants tbh
[2021-11-12T00:41:34] Mirono escooters: 13s low kv 40kmh gang 🥲
[2021-11-12T00:42:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: wish vesc?
[2021-11-12T00:42:35] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 4.2
[2021-11-12T00:42:37] Mirono escooters: 🥲
[2021-11-12T00:44:25] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ouch
[2021-11-12T00:44:40] Mirono escooters: Works fine for me
[2021-11-12T00:44:45] Mirono escooters: Just gotta upgrade cooling
[2021-11-12T00:44:48] Mirono escooters: 150a phase
[2021-11-12T00:45:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes 50 in real life
[2021-11-12T00:45:44] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 13S ok
[2021-11-12T00:46:01] Mirono escooters: Im running 120a for long now
[2021-11-12T00:46:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 100A peak 1 sec ans 50A some seconds, and 30A dc... 😂
[2021-11-12T00:47:04] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you have to explain to me how because i have it and it's not possible, the temperature increase immediately and the current down for don't broken it
[2021-11-12T00:47:15] Mirono escooters: Yes im upgrading cooling :)
[2021-11-12T00:47:59] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes me too, but by the back of the mosfet it's just not efficient
[2021-11-12T00:50:23] Mirono escooters: Sadly
[2021-11-12T00:52:53] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1524@12-11-2021_00-52-53.jpg>
[2021-11-12T00:52:59] Happy Giraffe: Did someone order spaghetti?
[2021-11-12T00:53:19] Mirono escooters: Oofof
[2021-11-12T00:53:39] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ah no sorry I have the 4.12 not 4.2
[2021-11-12T00:53:52] Mirono escooters: Im gonna be rita nerd again Are it just better mosfets? It seems same size
[2021-11-12T00:53:58] Mirono escooters: Ahh. 4.2 small changes
[2021-11-12T00:54:14] Happy Giraffe: I will add the spacer so they all will fit nicely
[2021-11-12T00:54:26] Happy Giraffe: Denis told me everything is upgraded
[2021-11-12T00:54:35] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-12T00:54:37] Happy Giraffe: It can do 60A peak😂
[2021-11-12T00:54:38] Mirono escooters: Wish i could get 1
[2021-11-12T00:54:39] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: small but you can run at 120, with mine no that sure
[2021-11-12T00:54:47] Mirono escooters: Or im lucky
[2021-11-12T00:55:01] Mirono escooters: Peak seconds tho Im only 50kg And 40kmh speed is quickly hit
[2021-11-12T00:55:07] Mirono escooters: 500w continuous for 40kmh
[2021-11-12T00:55:19] Happy Giraffe: If you prove yourself to be good battery maker maybe he will approve😂
[2021-11-12T00:56:21] Mirono escooters: Did already. Francois voted for me
[2021-11-12T00:56:34] Mirono escooters: He says he doesnt make em anymore?
[2021-11-12T00:56:46] Happy Giraffe: Airtag against plastic bottom
[2021-11-12T00:57:09] Happy Giraffe: Yep, ok I sell you 300€
[2021-11-12T00:57:20] Mirono escooters: Its a collectible now😌
[2021-11-12T00:57:22] Happy Giraffe: Only 2 known units exist (who knows what happens when someone owns both?)
[2021-11-12T00:57:27] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-11-12T00:59:17] Happy Giraffe: I go Spintend single 40/100A without paste now, I think I add it when summer starts
[2021-11-12T00:59:41] Mirono escooters: First make it ride for longer then a week😇
[2021-11-12T01:00:47] Happy Giraffe: Thee days*
[2021-11-12T01:00:55] Happy Giraffe: Now I removed all solder balls
[2021-11-12T01:01:00] Happy Giraffe: Should be ok
[2021-11-12T01:01:46] Happy Giraffe: Pack of gum inside scooter (silica gel for condensation)
[2021-11-12T11:25:17] Lyss: Good morning.. I know this isn't necessarily the group for this.. but it's where the smartest people are in one place.
[2021-11-12T11:25:46] Mirono escooters: My thouchts too
[2021-11-12T11:30:40] Lyss: <video_file>
[2021-11-12T11:31:14] Lyss: Anyone know where the short is on this board?
[2021-11-12T11:31:27] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2021-11-12T11:31:30] Mirono escooters: Is there a short ?
[2021-11-12T11:31:47] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 here he also has same problem with can, 5v 3.3v
[2021-11-12T11:33:04] Artem Bulashev: Ended up changing a lot of things incl 3.3v dcdc both of them and thus both of MCUs as well need replacement, as well as both of CANs - 10€ one cost 😅
[2021-11-12T11:34:35] Lyss: It was working now it dosent. It wants too.
[2021-11-12T11:44:52] Artem Bulashev: Not sure it is currently in progress
[2021-11-12T11:48:00] Artem Bulashev: New v2 has all power with resettable fuses 👌👌 and MCUs are on separate 3.3v ✅
[2021-11-12T12:45:14] Happy Giraffe: Test ride successfull, didnt measure any speed but didnt want to go faster than 40kmh on wet road full of leaves. I hope now solder balls dont come from another dimention
[2021-11-12T12:46:05] Happy Giraffe: Blade motor side not even hand warm after ride with 100A (doesnt tell anything about magnets but it being completely ambient is somewhat new to me
[2021-11-12T12:55:10] Mirono escooters: How long did u ride tho
[2021-11-12T12:56:01] Happy Giraffe: 10km
[2021-11-12T12:56:10] Happy Giraffe: 15km more and kaboom
[2021-11-12T13:15:17] Artem Bulashev: That’s usually enough
[2021-11-12T13:15:33] Happy Giraffe: Last time 25

[2021-11-12T13:16:44] Artem Bulashev: I mean enough to get to working temp
[2021-11-12T13:17:06] Happy Giraffe: Aah yes haha, was rain and traffic lights so that also affects
[2021-11-12T13:17:14] Artem Bulashev: Sounds like this is at least 125/40a motor
[2021-11-12T13:17:30] Happy Giraffe: It takes 150A easy, maybe 180A ferro
[2021-11-12T13:17:54] Happy Giraffe: Btw, I realized now I have no way to know my voltage...no bluetooth support for single vesc
[2021-11-12T13:18:16] Mirono escooters: Whats max phase amps fro spintend single
[2021-11-12T13:18:23] Mirono escooters: No Bluetooth???
[2021-11-12T13:18:28] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2021-11-12T13:18:33] Happy Giraffe: I will add a small voltage meter to my handlebar somewhere, got any recommendations?
[2021-11-12T13:18:34] Artem Bulashev: Though when my winding got to 80c motor cover was just abit warm, if you put your finger on the bearings you feel they were hot but not painfully = 80c winding.
[2021-11-12T13:18:52] Mirono escooters: If u have m365 frame i have smth nice
[2021-11-12T13:18:56] Happy Giraffe: Yep, this is why motor cover not accurate at all
[2021-11-12T13:18:56] Artem Bulashev: 125a was tested by Spintend them self
[2021-11-12T13:19:12] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1528@12-11-2021_13-19-12.jpg>
[2021-11-12T13:19:14] Mirono escooters: :)
[2021-11-12T13:19:18] Happy Giraffe: Not even with their module, I have to choose throttle vs bt ...
[2021-11-12T13:19:26] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-11-12T13:19:28] Mirono escooters: What the
[2021-11-12T13:19:36] Mirono escooters: Yea no way ill get 1 then lol
[2021-11-12T13:20:08] Happy Giraffe: Koxx said something about using ADC port and common negative or something but I didnt understand it😂😅
[2021-11-12T13:20:32] Artem Bulashev: I don’t think this is correct. I may be wrong but BT requires tx out line, while throttle should need rx in line
[2021-11-12T13:20:44] Mirono escooters: Doesnt bt need both??
[2021-11-12T13:20:47] Artem Bulashev: Actually BT needs tx and rx
[2021-11-12T13:20:50] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-11-12T13:20:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-11-12T13:21:04] Artem Bulashev: But also it doesn’t sound right to me that you can’t connect BT
[2021-11-12T13:21:13] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 any idea ?
[2021-11-12T13:21:30] Happy Giraffe: I mean you need to find correct port on vesc and enable in software?
[2021-11-12T13:22:38] Happy Giraffe: I gotta think someting like this hooked for my lamp wires
[2021-11-12T13:22:51] Artem Bulashev: I asked Spintend
[2021-11-12T13:22:57] Artem Bulashev: Waiting for reply
[2021-11-12T13:23:05] Artem Bulashev: Will see about BT on single
[2021-11-12T13:23:20] Happy Giraffe: Thanks🥰
[2021-11-12T13:25:04] Happy Giraffe: I manage to spark my charge plug as I measured many times voltage from it👀
[2021-11-12T13:26:05] Happy Giraffe: Fuck I measured amps lmao and had multimeter in wrong setting😅😅😅😅😅
[2021-11-12T13:27:15] Happy Giraffe: Seems Rita charge port is still current for both ways lmao haha
[2021-11-12T13:27:33] Happy Giraffe: Miked
[2021-11-12T13:27:59] Mirono escooters: Hhahjaa oog
[2021-11-12T13:28:01] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-11-12T13:29:36] Happy Giraffe: But now I know, 47v😅
[2021-11-12T13:34:53] Happy Giraffe: With this knowledge I could buy shity xiaomi charger to get charge port and put voltmeter on the cable?
[2021-11-12T13:35:25] Happy Giraffe: Then it would be safer than to poke multimeter in xt30😅
[2021-11-12T13:36:07] Artem Bulashev: 🤦‍♂️😅😅
[2021-11-12T13:36:23] Happy Giraffe: My boy was having probe on Ampacity slot
[2021-11-12T13:36:27] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-12T13:36:48] Happy Giraffe: I feel "energetic" now
[2021-11-12T13:49:18] Mirono escooters: Kenny I found how to turn it off on
[2021-11-12T13:49:26] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1530@12-11-2021_13-49-26.jpg>
[2021-11-12T13:49:29] Mirono escooters: Hidden in parameters
[2021-11-12T13:49:38] Mirono escooters: It requires u to say "I'm sure" xd
[2021-11-12T13:49:44] Mirono escooters: So switch on main page doesn't work
[2021-11-12T13:49:54] Mirono escooters: Well not useful for me bcs I have the display🤷‍♂️
[2021-11-12T14:05:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah ... didn't understand anything he said 😅😅
[2021-11-12T14:07:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: he can. just has to fill the 8 pins JST correctly
[2021-11-12T14:09:04] Artem Bulashev: Replaced 5v dcdc Stabilizer Turned on but still an error and MCUs both heat up, so checked and found Need more 3.3v DCDC both MCUs both Can both
[2021-11-12T14:09:14] Artem Bulashev: That’s what happened :)
[2021-11-12T14:15:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: does he have the reference for the 3.3V buck ? it would help me to repair mine
[2021-11-12T14:15:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and thanks !
[2021-11-12T14:18:08] Artem Bulashev: Can once you know and 5v?
[2021-11-12T14:19:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I don't have 3.3V on one side. I guess a buck is dead
[2021-11-12T14:20:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for the STM I mean
[2021-11-12T15:08:12] Happy Giraffe: Is 50A/120A currents good idea or does it create too much stress?
[2021-11-12T15:08:24] Happy Giraffe: For this I will put thermal paste now
[2021-11-12T15:09:13] Mirono escooters: I'm on that with flipsky lol
[2021-11-12T15:09:27] Artem Bulashev: Should be ok, there is really good thermal protection on Spintend
[2021-11-12T15:09:50] Artem Bulashev: So just set it to safe 70c start and 80c finish
[2021-11-12T15:10:02] Artem Bulashev: And see if you get to that point
[2021-11-12T15:10:37] Happy Giraffe: I guess I will notice that power limit kicking in, I have no BT
[2021-11-12T15:11:04] Artem Bulashev: Or to make it easier to understand set 70c start 73c finish, that will give you quite let power reduction and easier to spot, but will have to wait for it to cool down, relatevely fast for fets unlike motors
[2021-11-12T15:12:19] Happy Giraffe: Lets see I try 70-80 later today, should be ok. I doubt fets go above 50-60
[2021-11-12T15:12:30] Artem Bulashev: Me too
[2021-11-12T15:12:42] Artem Bulashev: Specially if you place it on metal deck through thermal paste
[2021-11-12T15:12:53] Happy Giraffe: Yes👍
[2021-11-12T15:14:53] Mirono escooters: Any air suspension nerds? Why when not using scoot would both "lock up"? And I need to jump a few times before they come loose? Then they work fine
[2021-11-12T15:54:06] Unknown: Omg 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😂
[2021-11-12T15:55:19] Unknown: But then again, if you turn off discharge you would have to plug it in before you can use your scoot since it turns off after 5 mins orso? 🤔
[2021-11-12T15:57:10] Mirono escooters: You mean the sleep mode?
[2021-11-12T15:57:13] Mirono escooters: You can turn that off
[2021-11-12T15:57:47] Unknown: Yes but that would result in (very little) power loss no?
[2021-11-12T15:58:12] Mirono escooters: Microamps
[2021-11-12T15:58:27] Unknown: True true 😂
[2021-11-12T16:30:31] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb and a video of that weeped with ubox doing a run? 😁 Im curious
[2021-11-12T16:56:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Struggling with @koxx3 LCD for now 😂
[2021-11-12T16:56:51] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2021-11-12T16:58:26] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂👍 ok when it runs make some video for us 😁
[2021-11-12T16:58:46] Face de Pin Sucé: I will trust me 😁😁

[2021-11-12T16:59:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes some good DIY here
[2021-11-12T16:59:37] sombre_enfant: U got a trampa too ?
[2021-11-12T17:00:40] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2021-11-12T17:00:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope, I'm with Dualtron Thunder from my friend Sonken
[2021-11-12T17:01:13] Face de Pin Sucé: He gave me this for the day
[2021-11-12T17:02:12] sombre_enfant: 👍🏾👍🏾
[2021-11-12T17:16:02] Mirono escooters: Where do I find such friend?
[2021-11-12T17:16:30] Mirono escooters: I never rode anything else then m365 modded lol I need to test a diff ready to ride brand to compare
[2021-11-12T17:58:39] Face de Pin Sucé: In France 😂
[2021-11-12T18:02:35] Mirono escooters: But then I need to speak French
[2021-11-12T18:10:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Exactly
[2021-11-12T18:13:45] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-11-12T18:53:32] sombre_enfant: I've went on the highway on scoot just to buy wrap then do it badly😐

[2021-11-12T19:05:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes you met SaveMyBattery team ? 😁😁
[2021-11-12T19:06:14] sombre_enfant: Ye kinda
[2021-11-12T19:07:00] sombre_enfant: They searched a stock g30 for a vid sadly mine aint it
[2021-11-12T19:18:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes I have to make this vid for them but we can't find a G30 😂
[2021-11-12T19:22:43] sombre_enfant: Cant help on that all ppl i knew on g30 i had installed them on 48v/60v and modified the esc...
[2021-11-12T19:59:37] Happy Giraffe: Anyone have an idea why suddenly my Vesc wont react to mt ADC throttle and brake?
[2021-11-12T19:59:54] Mirono escooters: Rip adc board?
[2021-11-12T20:00:16] Happy Giraffe: I opened scooter, put thermal paste under vesc. Upped motor current, adc board has been in its antistatic bag whole the time
[2021-11-12T20:00:39] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I guess wind outside could break it
[2021-11-12T20:00:53] Mirono escooters: If I hear how bad they are
[2021-11-12T20:00:57] Mirono escooters: It's my best bet
[2021-11-12T20:03:03] Happy Giraffe: I broke one but this one I kept with all same settings
[2021-11-12T20:07:56] Happy Giraffe: For real this is not kinder surprise hardware its 200$ vesc🙈
[2021-11-12T20:21:21] Happy Giraffe: Ok I got it working
[2021-11-12T20:21:47] Happy Giraffe: Kenny Make sure you bro also have 5v switch fully all way
[2021-11-12T20:21:58] Happy Giraffe: I think I will glue it permanently in place (Now glued it in place with 2-component epoxy)😂
[2021-11-12T20:23:38] Happy Giraffe: 3.3-5v switch is positioned bad even tiniest bit of pressure will knock it 0.2mm and it doesnt register anymore lol
[2021-11-12T21:15:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: adc is really shitty for vesc. we killed a few...
[2021-11-12T21:15:39] Happy Giraffe: That thing no longer moves, 2-comp in place😂
[2021-11-12T21:16:12] Happy Giraffe: And accidental switch position change when powered could lead to bricked adc😅
[2021-11-12T21:16:18] Happy Giraffe: Think I killed one like that
[2021-11-12T21:16:40] Mirono escooters: Ooof
[2021-11-12T21:16:42] Mirono escooters: .^.
[2021-11-12T21:18:34] Artem Bulashev: His board seems to die if you operate switches during being powered up
[2021-11-12T21:18:57] Artem Bulashev: From what I found
[2021-11-12T21:19:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: unless you push full throttle, it shouldn't exceed 3.3v on the vesc
[2021-11-12T21:19:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh. ok
[2021-11-12T21:20:01] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise seems like Spintend finally delivered with my Single now, should be a baller now
[2021-11-12T21:20:03] Artem Bulashev: Can you send me photo of 3.3v dc component you want to know
[2021-11-12T21:20:05] Artem Bulashev: To be sure r
[2021-11-12T21:20:27] Happy Giraffe: Any luck with finding hydro levers with hall?
[2021-11-12T21:20:37] Happy Giraffe: Or whatever you call proportional sensor
[2021-11-12T21:21:07] Artem Bulashev: No, easier buy and make after market to any brakes you want
[2021-11-12T21:21:28] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-12T21:21:48] Unknown: ,will check on that thx
[2021-11-12T21:21:53] Mirono escooters: How? 😅😅😅
[2021-11-12T21:21:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i guess it's one of those. but not even sure
[2021-11-12T21:21:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1535@12-11-2021_21-21-57.jpg>
[2021-11-12T21:22:10] Happy Giraffe: I would superglue it to permanent 5v if I were you haha (make sure its fully in and works before gluing😅)
[2021-11-12T21:26:06] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1536@12-11-2021_21-26-06.jpg>
[2021-11-12T21:26:18] Artem Bulashev: That blue arrow correct ?
[2021-11-12T21:27:04] Artem Bulashev: Yeah would as well. I would actually prefer to have solder selection instead…
[2021-11-12T21:27:40] Happy Giraffe: Mine was inside a bag and still moved😅
[2021-11-12T21:30:04] Mirono escooters: Kwolity

[2021-11-13T00:06:15] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-11-13T00:06:29] Mirono escooters: Like before lol
[2021-11-13T00:06:39] Mirono escooters: Im not gonna try Anyone
[2021-11-13T00:06:41] Mirono escooters: Anympre
[2021-11-13T05:31:28] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1539@13-11-2021_05-31-28.jpg>
[2021-11-13T05:31:56] Happy Giraffe: They do the hidden middle finger😂
[2021-11-13T11:40:28] Unknown: Well, checked it out, but still the same readings 😒 could it be that there's a broken sensor in throttle/brake? I tried unpluggin either one of those, with no results.. still same prob
[2021-11-13T22:00:10] Happy Giraffe: Sometimes my vesc powerbutton flashes red 3-5 times, what is that indicating?
[2021-11-13T22:02:50] Happy Giraffe: It doesn't happen during high power, even at walking speed
[2021-11-13T22:05:48] Happy Giraffe: Maybe its some sort of anti-slip as I loose power for 1 second and then I got max power directly after that
[2021-11-13T22:06:07] Happy Giraffe: I got 70°c-80° mosfet warning setup in Vesc tool
[2021-11-13T22:06:45] Artem Bulashev: Show me
[2021-11-13T22:07:11] Happy Giraffe: I cant show any of it, happens so randomly. Only at low speeds
[2021-11-13T22:07:37] Happy Giraffe: Cant really film my riding Im sry
[2021-11-13T22:07:47] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2021-11-13T22:08:20] Artem Bulashev: You should not use “anti-slip”
[2021-11-13T22:08:30] Artem Bulashev: It is for dual motor set up
[2021-11-13T22:08:35] Happy Giraffe: I must have missed it in the setting then
[2021-11-13T22:08:50] Happy Giraffe: And when I slipped a bit for real it didnt do anything
[2021-11-13T22:08:52] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-13T22:09:10] Artem Bulashev: It compares from and rear RPM to establish if one of the wheels is spinning faster than other
[2021-11-13T22:09:25] Artem Bulashev: It will not do anything during slipping in the corner
[2021-11-13T22:09:53] Happy Giraffe: Then it shouldnt be on in single vesc anyways?
[2021-11-13T22:09:58] Happy Giraffe: I will check my settings later
[2021-11-13T22:10:15] Artem Bulashev: Only will help reduce from wheel slippage during hard acceleration if you have too many amps on from wheel - or both if your motors are that powerful or you are in bad terrain
[2021-11-13T22:10:26] Artem Bulashev: Correct should not be on
[2021-11-13T22:12:06] Happy Giraffe: I will keep eye on it and count flashes next time
[2021-11-13T23:29:56] Luis Magalhaes: any one knows if the flipsky 75100 can handle the 5v on the adc input??
[2021-11-13T23:30:03] Luis Magalhaes: https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005003508167609.html?srcSns=sns_Copy&spreadType=socialShare&bizType=ProductDetail&social_params=20388946354&aff_fcid=bdfe0661e2754080aaf960c3531c8735-1636842530174-07082-_mqq4Xb8&tt=MG&aff_fsk=_mqq4Xb8&aff_platform=default&sk=_mqq4Xb8&aff_trace_key=bdfe0661e2754080aaf960c3531c8735-1636842530174-07082-_mqq4Xb8&shareId=20388946354&businessType=ProductDetail&platform=AE&terminal_id=80c3dba6ea944ecb82822dbef0b77af1
[2021-11-13T23:30:06] Luis Magalhaes: these ones
[2021-11-13T23:41:11] Mirono escooters: Ask them? They helpful
[2021-11-13T23:41:25] Mirono escooters: Not that seller lol
[2021-11-13T23:41:36] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-11-13T23:41:38] Luis Magalhaes: ok
[2021-11-13T23:42:36] Mirono escooters: Official seller
[2021-11-13T23:42:37] Mirono escooters: Flpsky
[2021-11-13T23:43:05] Luis Magalhaes: @koxx3 dont you know? if it wasnt you i would burn my adc input in ubox 😂
[2021-11-13T23:47:10] Artem Bulashev: ? :))
[2021-11-13T23:48:11] Luis Magalhaes: adc input and 5v 🤣
[2021-11-14T00:03:02] Happy Giraffe: He thinks Koxx is a god that knows everything, but I dont blame him for that😂
[2021-11-14T00:03:14] Happy Giraffe: Ali "20w" light
[2021-11-14T00:03:17] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2021-11-14T00:03:23] Mirono escooters: He is wdym
[2021-11-14T00:03:45] Happy Giraffe: In real life it looks bit bigger of a spot
[2021-11-14T00:03:49] Mirono escooters: well its something
[2021-11-14T00:04:02] Happy Giraffe: Its 14w when I measured with multimeter
[2021-11-14T00:04:26] Mirono escooters: Wonder how (in) efficient led is
[2021-11-14T00:04:33] Mirono escooters: They should add a resist9r Boom 20w
[2021-11-14T00:05:35] Happy Giraffe: I use it with 48v, it might give lesser wattage than using 12v
[2021-11-14T00:09:53] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1542@14-11-2021_00-09-53.jpg>
[2021-11-14T00:09:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Oups
[2021-11-14T00:10:18] Happy Giraffe: ?!?!
[2021-11-14T00:11:12] Face de Pin Sucé: I might be pushing a little hard on Spintend ?
[2021-11-14T00:11:19] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2021-11-14T00:11:27] Artem Bulashev: I think you shunt is broken
[2021-11-14T00:11:34] Artem Bulashev: It doesn’t measure correctly
[2021-11-14T00:11:37] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2021-11-14T00:12:28] Luis Magalhaes: no but he could know 🤣🤣
[2021-11-14T00:12:46] Artem Bulashev: Also what wheel can handle that much lol haha and what rubber can maintain traction lol :) should be burning out even at 30kmh haha
[2021-11-14T00:14:14] Luis Magalhaes: less wattage or less amp draw?
[2021-11-14T00:15:33] Luis Magalhaes: 🙈🤣🤣
[2021-11-14T00:15:53] Mirono escooters: Wattafak
[2021-11-14T00:16:08] Mirono escooters: What the fuck
[2021-11-14T00:16:13] Mirono escooters: Me happy with 150
[2021-11-14T00:16:20] Luis Magalhaes: we need to see some video of this monster 🤣🤣
[2021-11-14T00:16:23] Mirono escooters: This is dual?? 450a each?
[2021-11-14T00:17:07] Luis Magalhaes: that current value is motor fase isnt it?
[2021-11-14T00:17:21] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-11-14T00:17:30] Mirono escooters: (Or so i hope for his battery. Lol)
[2021-11-14T00:18:36] Luis Magalhaes: i think he said he was pussing 120A from battery x2
[2021-11-14T00:18:39] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-11-14T00:18:59] Luis Magalhaes: i would blow up mine 🤣
[2021-11-14T00:19:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Honestly, don't think so 😂
[2021-11-14T00:19:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Yup
[2021-11-14T00:19:33] Face de Pin Sucé: But it's only peak at start
[2021-11-14T00:20:42] Luis Magalhaes: 450 fase amp each ?
[2021-11-14T00:21:04] Mirono escooters: Jezzzzus
[2021-11-14T00:21:07] Mirono escooters: U fly??
[2021-11-14T00:21:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Well it stops when it over current
[2021-11-14T00:21:37] Happy Giraffe: Both I think
[2021-11-14T00:21:50] Face de Pin Sucé: I only putted 250A each and 480A absolute max
[2021-11-14T00:22:09] Face de Pin Sucé: But huge motors eat amps
[2021-11-14T00:22:26] Face de Pin Sucé: I can't full throttle
[2021-11-14T00:28:39] Luis Magalhaes: ok so thats the value of the dual motor, if it was each dam LOL
[2021-11-14T00:28:50] Luis Magalhaes: and dam at dual too 😂😂
[2021-11-14T00:38:32] Face de Pin Sucé: No, it's each
[2021-11-14T00:38:40] Face de Pin Sucé: You got over current faults only on one ESC
[2021-11-14T00:38:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Not on both
[2021-11-14T00:39:25] Luis Magalhaes: had that problem once
[2021-11-14T00:39:41] Luis Magalhaes: but i was at 100A firmware and cant push 130A phase
[2021-11-14T00:39:42] Luis Magalhaes: lolol
[2021-11-14T00:40:30] Artem Bulashev: Man over 400amps on each side is impossible with Ubox mosfets
[2021-11-14T00:40:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Of course it is
[2021-11-14T00:40:59] Face de Pin Sucé: We speak about a millisecond
[2021-11-14T00:41:00] Artem Bulashev: It should fry them in a second
[2021-11-14T00:41:22] Luis Magalhaes: i know that was what was confusing me
[2021-11-14T00:41:28] Artem Bulashev: Your filtered value is over 400
[2021-11-14T00:41:39] Artem Bulashev: Look into the code for what filtered value is
[2021-11-14T00:42:18] Artem Bulashev: It is average of reading over some time - that will give you good point of reference how long it lasted over 400
[2021-11-14T00:42:38] Face de Pin Sucé: That's why it cuts
[2021-11-14T00:42:59] Artem Bulashev: What battery is it?
[2021-11-14T00:43:05] Artem Bulashev: 16s?
[2021-11-14T00:43:14] Face de Pin Sucé: 16S10P Molicel
[2021-11-14T00:43:22] Artem Bulashev: Ok something is wrong
[2021-11-14T00:43:28] Artem Bulashev: Your sag is 4v
[2021-11-14T00:43:47] Artem Bulashev: That’s 4v per cell
[2021-11-14T00:43:53] Artem Bulashev: Under that load
[2021-11-14T00:43:56] Face de Pin Sucé: That's because it's phase amps
[2021-11-14T00:44:01] Artem Bulashev: I know
[2021-11-14T00:44:09] Face de Pin Sucé: At startup
[2021-11-14T00:44:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Very low batt current
[2021-11-14T00:44:43] Artem Bulashev: Still
[2021-11-14T00:44:46] Face de Pin Sucé: 5326RPM is like 20Kmh I think
[2021-11-14T00:44:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Nothing is wrong, completely normal
[2021-11-14T00:45:10] Face de Pin Sucé: You got no power at startup
[2021-11-14T00:45:23] Artem Bulashev: I know how it works
[2021-11-14T00:45:41] Face de Pin Sucé: When you feed a motor with amps, from the first nanoseconds it's like infinite amps (don't know how to say in english)
[2021-11-14T00:45:48] Artem Bulashev: But I still have hard time understanding how 400a can be taken by ubox design
[2021-11-14T00:46:07] Face de Pin Sucé: It can't, that's why it cuts x)
[2021-11-14T00:46:22] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-11-14T00:46:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, I'll look at logs from smartesc (I forgot to log with VescTool)
[2021-11-14T00:46:38] Artem Bulashev: This is 4700rpm
[2021-11-14T00:46:58] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1544@14-11-2021_00-46-58.jpg>
[2021-11-14T00:47:19] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2021-11-14T00:47:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Cannes
[2021-11-14T00:47:52] Luis Magalhaes: i have seen 300A peack in mine 😅 for a split of a second lolol
[2021-11-14T00:49:19] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2021-11-14T00:49:45] Artem Bulashev: May be erpm
[2021-11-14T00:49:54] Artem Bulashev: Than it would be about 3.5kmh on 10inch
[2021-11-14T00:49:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes it's ERPM
[2021-11-14T00:49:59] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-11-14T00:50:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't know why it shows RPM
[2021-11-14T00:50:22] Artem Bulashev: Did you kick or it was 0 start ?
[2021-11-14T00:50:52] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1545@14-11-2021_00-50-52.jpg>
[2021-11-14T00:50:54] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-11-14T00:51:09] Face de Pin Sucé: 0 start
[2021-11-14T00:51:33] Luis Magalhaes: the display fits nice
[2021-11-14T00:52:06] Face de Pin Sucé: That's why it's completely normal x)
[2021-11-14T00:52:19] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-11-14T00:52:23] Artem Bulashev: Than question
[2021-11-14T00:52:36] Artem Bulashev: Why do we even bother with phase limit settings
[2021-11-14T00:52:43] Artem Bulashev: Only to protect motor ?
[2021-11-14T00:53:13] Artem Bulashev: What motor you have (nominal wattage)
[2021-11-14T00:54:39] Artem Bulashev: Can you share log of such 0 start to max please on full battery. I want to see how fast voltage gets to sensible 150amps phase
[2021-11-14T00:56:52] Face de Pin Sucé: To protect both motors and controllers
[2021-11-14T00:57:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't know the voltage, too powerful for the factory, they can't measure
[2021-11-14T00:57:22] Face de Pin Sucé: I will
[2021-11-14T00:57:40] Happy Giraffe: Im amazed single ubox does the 120A at all haha with stock FW
[2021-11-14T00:57:41] Artem Bulashev: Also what p42a I suppose ? What is battery limits you have. 120a each?
[2021-11-14T00:57:41] Artem Bulashev: Thanks
[2021-11-14T00:57:58] Happy Giraffe: But I have no way to monitor this witout BT module, I can only feel a good pull at 25kmhish
[2021-11-14T00:58:33] Artem Bulashev: Wonder how are the mosfet temps and motor temps. Will see in logs 👌👌 thank again
[2021-11-14T02:26:41] Happy Giraffe: Has spintend answered your email btw?
[2021-11-14T02:42:50] Face de Pin Sucé: 130A each Yes P42 OFC 😁😁
[2021-11-14T09:04:24] Lyss: Ello gents n ladies.. I have a nb controller and it won't read any external battery. To me it looks burnt on the negative terminal and the Rx terminal. But I'm not sure how to correctly test it with a multimeter ( w battery or no?) So I'm sending on over rover to get yalss opinion.
[2021-11-14T09:04:33] Lyss: <photos/photo_1546@14-11-2021_09-04-33.jpg>
[2021-11-14T09:04:34] Lyss: <photos/photo_1547@14-11-2021_09-04-34.jpg>
[2021-11-14T09:05:22] Lyss: Also does this look like a short or what could the cause be when it blinks red on turning it on but then fails
[2021-11-14T09:07:11] Lyss: <video_file>
[2021-11-14T09:20:19] sombre_enfant: Is that an esx repair chat ? Es board are not réparable, repair it with a copy then sell the scoot, and stop asking here nobody know about es stuff
[2021-11-14T09:21:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i have never seen a besc supporting 5v on adc. they all copy Vedder designs, and none have voltage divider or another circuit to accept 5v.
[2021-11-14T09:21:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: looooool. i am not
[2021-11-14T09:28:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sorry, but this is a vesc controller group.
[2021-11-14T10:13:14] Lyss: Oo sorry. This group has the most informed members that's why I came to you guys. I ask other groups but they dont have the experience of techy stuff. Also side note I have a escooter business so these arnt my scooters. Hence the constant new questions.
[2021-11-14T10:13:48] Lyss: Have a great night or morning wherever you are in the world 🥰
[2021-11-14T10:14:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hi there y'all
[2021-11-14T10:14:29] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-14T10:15:37] Happy Giraffe: This might be the wrong group to ask multiple questions about other scooters. There should be better ones for multiple Ninebot models
[2021-11-14T10:23:33] Lyss: Sighh you would think cause ninebot and xiaomi started the whole movement but there's unfortunately not. There's scooterhacking but its more for newbies. And a Russian one but translate for hours is not ideal. It's not really a segway controller problem it's more of how do I dissect the board and the most Important components to check. That's really where I'm at. I think I've watched every YouTube video on electronics and transistors hahaha
[2021-11-14T11:11:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hey
[2021-11-14T11:13:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Check ble plug connection on board ,whole thing use to get off, had similar problem once ,also another set of parts would help you diagnose
[2021-11-14T11:14:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The whole base and legs were broken for me under the plug
[2021-11-14T12:42:26] Luis Magalhaes: Ok, i was thinking right that, if they are all copies they are not getting upgrades like that 😂
[2021-11-14T12:43:21] Mirono escooters: Why they dont use better?
[2021-11-14T12:43:27] Mirono escooters: For the price id expext that lol
[2021-11-14T12:55:14] Luis Magalhaes: I would prefer more voltage 😂
[2021-11-14T13:33:27] Artem Bulashev: Because as you can see it is over kill already 😄 better once would cost 3 times more and deliver not much difference for intended 100a max (even 135a max)
[2021-11-14T13:41:01] Mirono escooters: When i see what you all run through it😱
[2021-11-14T19:25:55] Happy Giraffe: I still see the blinking red-green 4 times
[2021-11-14T19:26:41] Happy Giraffe: I immediately released throttle and put full again and it went normally, I couldnt find any weird settings in vesc tool what could cause this
[2021-11-14T19:27:20] Happy Giraffe: If there is some traction control shite, could someone tell me where to search it?
[2021-11-15T19:01:11] Happy Giraffe: Anyone knows anything about the error code flashing about 5 times?
[2021-11-15T19:01:32] Mirono escooters: I hope not drv error
[2021-11-15T19:01:40] Mirono escooters: Screenrecord the error tab and rewatch?
[2021-11-15T19:02:12] Happy Giraffe: I don't have BT
[2021-11-15T19:02:44] Happy Giraffe: I can ride with small throttle during error and after 2 seconds I can do full power (if I continue full throttle during error it will cut power)
[2021-11-15T19:03:02] Happy Giraffe: Its definitely not overheating Im sure
[2021-11-15T19:39:34] sombre_enfant: They do a 100v while i just ordered two 16s smart bms😐
[2021-11-15T19:40:33] Mirono escooters: F
[2021-11-15T19:40:41] Mirono escooters: 16s still 😱
[2021-11-15T19:41:24] sombre_enfant: 16s is only good if u got good motor and battery, not my goofy setup
[2021-11-15T19:41:59] Happy Giraffe: Fuck 13s Im already faster than cars on the city, 16s is more than enough lol
[2021-11-15T19:42:37] sombre_enfant: U top out fast or it take a long time ?
[2021-11-15T19:43:02] Happy Giraffe: 30-50kmh in 2 sec
[2021-11-15T19:43:11] Happy Giraffe: Single motor😅
[2021-11-15T19:43:13] sombre_enfant: F
[2021-11-15T19:43:56] Happy Giraffe: Accelerates very fast but is limited maybe because some vesc acceleration/throttle algoritm
[2021-11-15T19:44:01] sombre_enfant: Thats kinda my dual power, i do 0-60 in 6 sec
[2021-11-15T19:44:13] Happy Giraffe: For single motor its grip thats issue
[2021-11-15T19:44:21] sombre_enfant: But i weight less...
[2021-11-15T19:44:42] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, vesc and blade motor is crazy shit
[2021-11-15T19:45:02] Happy Giraffe: First time riding I was just plain laughing at the power
[2021-11-15T19:45:11] sombre_enfant: Will surely be my last upgrade...
[2021-11-15T19:46:25] Happy Giraffe: Motor side cover has been like 25°c, never got it hotter than that. Ofcourse it doesnt tell much about magnets inside but my wheelway motor almost burned at 95A and this goes 120A ez
[2021-11-15T19:56:56] Happy Giraffe: Damn I wanna do this
[2021-11-15T20:11:22] Mirono escooters: Front lol
[2021-11-15T20:11:29] Mirono escooters: Hell ye im saving up
[2021-11-15T20:12:00] Happy Giraffe: Yeaah, even rear tire would be at max with that power tbh
[2021-11-15T20:12:08] Happy Giraffe: If you make it more aggressive
[2021-11-15T21:39:19] Artem Bulashev: It was known for a while :))
[2021-11-15T21:59:50] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 👌
[2021-11-16T05:35:22] francois schempers: I still think you had manufacturing defect, ask @Her0DasH he as two 1000w wheelway now, he couldn't overheat them
[2021-11-16T07:04:47] Unknown: I push 75a phase 10km drive and my motor loses lots of power (full throttle mostly) fets never go above 55- 60°
[2021-11-16T09:25:56] Happy Giraffe: That whole company is one big fat defect😂
[2021-11-16T10:24:57] Unknown: Indeed 😂
[2021-11-16T12:05:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you need to check the faults with vesctool just after it happen
[2021-11-16T12:05:33] Mirono escooters: Sad no log
[2021-11-16T12:05:40] Happy Giraffe: No BT module
[2021-11-16T12:05:55] Mirono escooters: Lol ducktape laptop to dash
[2021-11-16T12:05:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: connect usb just after
[2021-11-16T12:06:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: bring a laptop
[2021-11-16T12:07:01] Mirono escooters: Hey dumb idea Can we plug a phone in it with a special cable
[2021-11-16T12:07:11] Mirono escooters: I meaaan :) would be cool
[2021-11-16T12:07:28] Happy Giraffe: Oh shiet, does vesc store the log for long then?
[2021-11-16T12:07:42] Mirono escooters: Make a dockin style thing for phone No mess with Bluetooth Can even let it charge And faster comm
[2021-11-16T12:09:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if i remember, it store the last fault until you shutdown.
[2021-11-16T12:09:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: terminal -> faults
[2021-11-16T12:11:49] Happy Giraffe: Sad that I need to open 16 screws for this...
[2021-11-16T12:12:06] Mirono escooters: I got a simple solution
[2021-11-16T12:12:11] Mirono escooters: I stripped 11 😀
[2021-11-16T12:12:16] Unknown: 😂😂
[2021-11-16T12:12:54] Happy Giraffe: Or I can just be balling and make a hole to make USB cable stick out lmao
[2021-11-16T12:13:40] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2021-11-16T12:13:50] Mirono escooters: Use a usb extender and have it somewhere at pole
[2021-11-16T12:16:00] Happy Giraffe: Too bad I already siliconed the cutouts, maybe I put one usb cable then from there to my Denis bag and use with an extension🤔
[2021-11-16T12:17:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2021-11-16T12:19:14] Happy Giraffe: I try that later, so far I have learned to deal with the problem
[2021-11-16T16:13:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I could not overheat them ,i tried well Not even handwarm😅 after 12km
[2021-11-16T16:16:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2021-11-16T16:16:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: First reactions on 30% of battery was cool
[2021-11-16T16:16:37] Mirono escooters: Well the picture i saw with the split magnet doesnt exfactly gimme trust
[2021-11-16T16:16:47] Mirono escooters: That spacer lol
[2021-11-16T16:17:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: ?
[2021-11-16T16:17:49] Mirono escooters: For wheel
[2021-11-16T16:29:33] sombre_enfant: No disk😐
[2021-11-16T16:29:48] francois schempers: hand made rear fork out of monorim suspension
[2021-11-16T16:30:00] francois schempers: welded 4 fork together

[2021-11-16T16:32:30] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-16T16:32:50] Mirono escooters: How much u pay per fork?
[2021-11-16T16:33:25] sombre_enfant: 40+-
[2021-11-16T16:33:35] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-11-16T16:48:48] francois schempers: hero sold me 40 a pair yup
[2021-11-16T16:51:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I could so i did😁 Also was lucky with free shipping that time😂😂😂
[2021-11-16T16:52:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I miss it also but it can stop like this
[2021-11-16T16:52:57] Mirono escooters: Cant u mod on
[2021-11-16T16:53:03] Mirono escooters: I want atleasr 1 mechanical
[2021-11-16T16:53:17] francois schempers: yeah awd Ubox have good strong brake, coule be better with a better batterie capable of fast charge
[2021-11-16T16:53:36] francois schempers: yes, those motor have hole for a disk
[2021-11-16T16:53:59] Mirono escooters: Big fan of ebrake but mechanical never fails
[2021-11-16T16:55:44] Happy Giraffe: I put like -30A/-15A regen and it aint much haha
[2021-11-16T16:56:14] francois schempers: here its -60 per motor and -15 per battery
[2021-11-16T16:56:30] francois schempers: most of the regen goes into mosfet heat
[2021-11-16T16:56:30] Happy Giraffe: That much motor regen?
[2021-11-16T16:56:55] francois schempers: Mos temps before hard brake 22° after 24°
[2021-11-16T16:57:11] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I put 40/15 then
[2021-11-16T16:57:11] francois schempers: he have temps to spare ^^
[2021-11-16T16:57:15] Mirono escooters: Rlly??
[2021-11-16T16:57:39] Happy Giraffe: Regen is 10-15% efficient anyways
[2021-11-16T16:57:56] Mirono escooters: :(
[2021-11-16T16:58:03] Mirono escooters: Still something
[2021-11-16T16:58:23] Happy Giraffe: But I wonder if I use 30 vs 40A phase Regen and keep batt same, where does the extra 10A go?
[2021-11-16T16:58:35] Mirono escooters: Extra??
[2021-11-16T16:58:45] Happy Giraffe: Read again my friend
[2021-11-16T16:58:46] Mirono escooters: Phase amps and batt amps work way diff
[2021-11-16T16:58:54] Happy Giraffe: 🙈
[2021-11-16T16:59:08] Mirono escooters: Or im thinking wrong.. idk
[2021-11-16T16:59:10] Mirono escooters: Im no expert
[2021-11-16T16:59:24] Mirono escooters: I would think it would brake better at lower speeds then
[2021-11-16T16:59:44] Happy Giraffe: I just mean regen behavior in general, -100A phase and -10A battery current will be extreme but yeah
[2021-11-16T17:00:02] Happy Giraffe: If the current aint going into battery I wonder where else
[2021-11-16T17:00:23] Mirono escooters: Well if batt is 60v and 10a Thats 600w But if motor spins slowly and generates 6v lets say (just so math is easy) 6v100a 600w too
[2021-11-16T17:00:31] francois schempers: heat
[2021-11-16T17:00:38] Happy Giraffe: Yeah this is basic
[2021-11-16T17:00:57] Mirono escooters: Well so A higher phase braking will just brake better at lower speeds?
[2021-11-16T17:01:01] Happy Giraffe: But need to know if someone understand it deeper
[2021-11-16T17:01:24] Mirono escooters: I noticed with 10a phase at high speeds slowed down oki But then at low speeds had to use feet or crashed
[2021-11-16T17:01:40] Happy Giraffe: That's with every ebrake in general
[2021-11-16T17:01:54] Happy Giraffe: Sad
[2021-11-16T17:02:01] Mirono escooters: With 60a phase brake it resists quite good
[2021-11-16T17:02:08] Happy Giraffe: Don't wanna cook my fets
[2021-11-16T17:02:32] Mirono escooters: It has protection no
[2021-11-16T17:02:55] Happy Giraffe: I guess so but yeah, will try 45A and 15A batt
[2021-11-16T17:02:56] Mirono escooters: My poor flipsky fets were 80 after few mins 150a is a lot. Lol
[2021-11-16T17:03:18] Mirono escooters: Me 60 and 30 with flipsky 👀
[2021-11-16T17:03:41] Happy Giraffe: You weight the same than my grocery store bag😂
[2021-11-16T17:03:51] Mirono escooters: 😆
[2021-11-16T17:04:10] Happy Giraffe: Half less kinetic energy to stop you down
[2021-11-16T17:04:30] Mirono escooters: Yes fair
[2021-11-16T17:04:33] Mirono escooters: But scoot heavy af
[2021-11-16T17:04:40] Mirono escooters: I should start wejghting shit
[2021-11-16T17:43:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: To have better kers ,your batt needs to be able to take it also
[2021-11-16T17:58:48] Artem Bulashev: Correct
[2021-11-16T17:58:56] Artem Bulashev: Used it few times
[2021-11-16T19:13:11] Unknown: My regen is at 40a phase 10a batt, i only weigh 60ish kg though works fine, but then again
[2021-11-16T19:13:40] Unknown: How does your wheelway not overheat? I do 7-8km trip to work full throttle and it is hot
[2021-11-16T19:14:41] Unknown: As in, my scoot won't even go forward without a good push since it's so hot, and it's not vesc fets, and not bms fets either
[2021-11-16T19:15:06] Unknown: Still no temp sensor though guys 😇😂 dont want to waste money on wheelwayshit
[2021-11-16T19:20:52] Artem Bulashev: So from my understanding regen work same as throttle meaning Battery regen limits up to which Rpm full phase regen is utilised. - once rpm is high enough = voltage on motor is high enough for regen phase amp * motor wheel = battery voltage * battery regen amp, than phase amp regen gets reduced Correct ?
[2021-11-16T19:21:14] Artem Bulashev: That’s also why phase amps can’t be lower than battery regen
[2021-11-16T19:23:07] Artem Bulashev: If it is correct than even setting 100a regen phase with 2amp battery regen will fill same at 15kmh as 40 amp phase regen and 2 amp battery regen
[2021-11-16T19:24:03] Artem Bulashev: But will fill different at like 3kmh, if above is correct
[2021-11-16T19:24:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe its not defo like the others
[2021-11-16T19:24:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅 no idea @francois_schempers lucky pick
[2021-11-16T19:25:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: i have build in temp sensors
[2021-11-16T19:26:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Francois made them
[2021-11-16T19:26:12] Unknown: No clue, i feel as if my phase regen uses power untill it reaches low enough speeds, indeed when reaching under 10A it brakes waaaay better. I tried switching from 40A batt (draw) To 30A batt without changing the regen, and i do feel as if it brakes less good then, with batt up to 40A draw it brakes better.. This untill it reaches a specific speed on wich it brakes so much harder as it goes under 10A i think, wich is my max neg batt amps
[2021-11-16T19:26:30] Artem Bulashev: That’s makes sense because power is watts
[2021-11-16T19:26:37] Unknown: Indeed
[2021-11-16T19:26:42] Artem Bulashev: At low speed voltage on motor is going to 0v
[2021-11-16T19:26:55] Artem Bulashev: So you get like 40w when voltage is 1v
[2021-11-16T19:28:48] Artem Bulashev: So it is same equation as acceleration 👌 Motor phase amps * motor voltage that depends on speed from 0 to nearly battery voltage at most = or < than battery amp lim * battery voltage at the moment
[2021-11-16T19:33:25] Unknown: That feels correct to me 🤷‍♂️ i should get my batt rebuilt anyway.. i got a week off next week, imma have @Mirono_escooters rebuild it if he can do it for me 😇 since i dont need it for work anyway for a week haha, after that 🤔 let's fry up this wheelwayshite and see how far we can push this out, i'll test it with like 50A batt. 100A phase 15A neg batt and 60A neg phase See what it does and then switch 15A neg to like idk 5A neg to check the difference 😂 we'll see
[2021-11-16T19:33:55] Unknown: Imma torture the motor and get a new, good motor after haha looking for that blade bitch 😊
[2021-11-16T19:34:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have - 10 regen And could not heat mosfets more Than 22,5 c°
[2021-11-16T19:36:46] Unknown: My mosfets go up to like 40-50 after 7-8km full throttle mostly, or full brake as i don't cross streets without checking for cars 😂😂
[2021-11-16T19:36:56] Unknown: C°
[2021-11-16T20:41:03] francois schempers: you say you're gonna torture the motor, but that's less than hero xD he have 135 phase xD
[2021-11-16T20:42:25] francois schempers: what Vesc you have ? you put thermal paste ? because hero's never exceed 25°
[2021-11-16T20:46:51] Unknown: I got trampa vesc 6 🤷‍♂️ designed by the big vedder himself 😂 i got paste, but it's not built in perfection as i want rear suspension and put motor and vesc in the back for now its on the side, partially against the scoot and partially against the bottom extender, it is being pushed in place firmly as i don't want to screw it down to that
[2021-11-16T20:47:25] Unknown: And yea, but i can't push 135 phase if the motor heats up already at 75a phase
[2021-11-16T20:47:52] Unknown: I gotta get to work and back and when i'm almoast at work the motor won't even work correctly under like 5-10kmh
[2021-11-16T20:47:59] Unknown: It just brakes at full throttle
[2021-11-16T20:48:16] Unknown: Well it does'nt brake but.. it kind off feels like it
[2021-11-16T20:48:32] Unknown: It just stops instead of taking off after like 7km full throttle
[2021-11-16T21:18:19] Mirono escooters: On-going project, some esthetic improvement to do but works perfectly. I feel that it will break the fork 😬
[2021-11-16T21:18:26] Mirono escooters: Happy giraffe competitor
[2021-11-16T21:18:41] Mirono escooters: Sure thing feel free to
[2021-11-16T21:18:47] Mirono escooters: Oof poor thing
[2021-11-16T21:20:30] Unknown: Will hit you up for bringing the batt over :D gotta get someone to bring it over for me 😝 maybe my aunt or nephew will be kind enough, i'll check on them tomorrow
[2021-11-16T21:20:48] Unknown: How will it break the fork? Looking good
[2021-11-16T21:20:55] Mirono escooters: Idk. His words
[2021-11-16T21:21:17] Mirono escooters: Or post if no better option
[2021-11-16T21:21:53] Unknown: True, but that'd be costive, and also i need it again the week after to get to work 😂😂
[2021-11-16T21:23:23] Mirono escooters: Yea xd
[2021-11-16T21:24:38] Unknown: It'll work out haha i'll just tell my nephew i pay him if i have to xd
[2021-11-16T21:24:57] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-11-16T21:25:00] Mirono escooters: Say its a business vidit
[2021-11-16T21:25:41] Unknown: I'll be glad not having to worry about water anymore then 😂 like i feel shit about to blow any minut as it just can not be watertight atm 😂😂
[2021-11-16T21:28:01] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha oof
[2021-11-16T21:28:04] Mirono escooters: Ill silicon it shut yoo
[2021-11-16T21:28:06] Mirono escooters: Too*
[2021-11-16T21:41:56] Unknown: Oh that's cool :D i watertightend the batt with electrical tape 🥴 if it blows up i'm going down woth it idc 😂😂
[2021-11-16T21:47:49] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2021-11-16T21:47:52] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2021-11-16T21:51:55] Happy Giraffe: Mount is nice
[2021-11-16T21:55:12] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1556@16-11-2021_21-55-12.jpg>
[2021-11-16T21:55:16] Mirono escooters: Am i the dumb one?
[2021-11-16T21:55:37] Mirono escooters: The magnets heat from itself right? Not just from the stator?
[2021-11-16T21:55:43] Mirono escooters: Whole discussion about heat and kv
[2021-11-16T21:56:56] Artem Bulashev: 😄sorry mate
[2021-11-16T21:57:05] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-16T21:57:22] Mirono escooters: (Trying to learn myself)
[2021-11-16T21:57:26] Artem Bulashev: No problem
[2021-11-16T21:57:54] Artem Bulashev: Magnets geat up by convection
[2021-11-16T21:58:16] Mirono escooters: Only that?
[2021-11-16T21:58:48] Artem Bulashev: Meaning - windings heat up due to resistance, and than transfer heat to the air inside motor, as air spins around it spreads evenly and gets hotter and hotter as winidibg heat up
[2021-11-16T21:59:02] Artem Bulashev: Than motors heat up due to ambient temp being high
[2021-11-16T21:59:10] Mirono escooters: Yes. I thought magnets heated from itself
[2021-11-16T21:59:42] Happy Giraffe: Doesn't the magnetic field heat them at all? Or very minimal?
[2021-11-16T21:59:58] Artem Bulashev: Rim to which magnets are mounted actually adds them thermal mass and allows some of the heat to be transferred away - so most of the time magnets can not get to the air temp inside motor
[2021-11-16T22:00:00] Mirono escooters: I thought so too
[2021-11-16T22:00:16] Mirono escooters: A so magnets heat but little?
[2021-11-16T22:00:17] Artem Bulashev: Energy is energy
[2021-11-16T22:00:25] Artem Bulashev: If it has losses there will be heat
[2021-11-16T22:00:28] Artem Bulashev: But
[2021-11-16T22:00:45] Artem Bulashev: Comparing in perspective it is absolutely negligible
[2021-11-16T22:00:53] francois schempers: not, heat comes from the coil, not the magnet
[2021-11-16T22:01:22] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2021-11-16T22:02:02] Artem Bulashev: Exchange of magnetic fields it self can heat up magnets because it literally makes atoms work = heat
[2021-11-16T22:02:15] francois schempers: we even put ferrofluid to aid heat go from the coil to the magnet
[2021-11-16T22:02:18] Artem Bulashev: But it is such minuscule amount vs windings lol
[2021-11-16T22:03:16] Happy Giraffe: Isnt that helping magnet > motor side heat transfer?😅
[2021-11-16T22:04:25] francois schempers: it get the heat faster to the outside, so yes magnet heat up faster, but overall temperature is lower due to faster exchange, so in the end, less heat stay stuck in the motor
[2021-11-16T22:04:27] Mirono escooters: Aaa
[2021-11-16T22:04:34] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-11-16T22:04:39] Mirono escooters: How efficient is a brushless motor +-?
[2021-11-16T22:04:44] Artem Bulashev: Yes to the rim
[2021-11-16T22:05:42] Unknown: Way more efficient then brushed in that matter
[2021-11-16T22:05:45] francois schempers: in what sense ? conversion of energy ?
[2021-11-16T22:05:53] Unknown: I know that from rc's 😂
[2021-11-16T22:06:02] Artem Bulashev: That’s true
[2021-11-16T22:06:07] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt make any sense😂
[2021-11-16T22:06:17] francois schempers: yeah brushed are just high rpm spot welder machine
[2021-11-16T22:06:28] Unknown: 😝
[2021-11-16T22:07:00] Artem Bulashev: FF is designed to help heat transfer from hot coils to the outer rim - which is cooled by air.
[2021-11-16T22:07:03] Happy Giraffe: Why do we wanna heat up magnet from coil instead of cool magnet against frame?
[2021-11-16T22:07:24] Happy Giraffe: Oh, I always see people put it between magnets
[2021-11-16T22:07:26] Mirono escooters: Yesh
[2021-11-16T22:07:27] Artem Bulashev: Because air is terrible conductor of heat
[2021-11-16T22:07:39] Mirono escooters: Yes jaha what a upgrade
[2021-11-16T22:08:21] Artem Bulashev: And windings heat up a lot while magnets do not get warm much Depending on design and utilisation FF May be desired, or May be not!
[2021-11-16T22:08:29] Artem Bulashev: It is not for every set up
[2021-11-16T22:08:36] francois schempers: depends on the motor, newest tesla model get very close to 98%, just amazing, but our little shity motor ? I would be impressed if we are past 60%
[2021-11-16T22:09:32] Happy Giraffe: My range increased a lot after vesc + bigger motor
[2021-11-16T22:09:35] Artem Bulashev: No no from what I read a while ago from electro mechanical point of view real life brushless out runner is at least 86% efficient in BLDC mode of operation
[2021-11-16T22:09:36] Mirono escooters: 98%??🤤🤤🤤
[2021-11-16T22:09:40] Happy Giraffe: Even when pumping ton more power lmao
[2021-11-16T22:09:54] Mirono escooters: Thats so sick
[2021-11-16T22:10:22] Artem Bulashev: In FOC efficiency is higher but I never saw numbers nor do I know enough to calculate gains
[2021-11-16T22:10:28] Mirono escooters: Thats wht big trains use Diesel motor with generator to then drivve electromotor Its way more efficient to generate electrixity and then drive then directly drive
[2021-11-16T22:10:37] Mirono escooters: Im too lazy to make
[2021-11-16T22:10:42] francois schempers: yeah that's when you're using them at their nominal W, we are pushing x3-x4 in those puppies, lots of waist in heat
[2021-11-16T22:11:01] Artem Bulashev: If I’m not mistaken 40–60% is brusshed motor efficiency range
[2021-11-16T22:11:20] Artem Bulashev: Reminiscing returns
[2021-11-16T22:11:41] Artem Bulashev: Any motor will have “sweet spot in rpm range”
[2021-11-16T22:12:01] Artem Bulashev: Xiaomi m365 motor pushed to 30amp, yeah not the sweet spot
[2021-11-16T22:12:18] francois schempers: xD
[2021-11-16T22:12:22] Artem Bulashev: Blade motor doing 35amps sweeet
[2021-11-16T22:13:03] Artem Bulashev: That’s different application
[2021-11-16T22:13:11] Artem Bulashev: Brushed motor as generator
[2021-11-16T22:17:02] Artem Bulashev: But it is exactly what I say. In other words - motor that is harder to spin as motor = less efficient (higher back emf) will generate more power when spinned as generator
[2021-11-16T22:17:39] Artem Bulashev: From my understanding - I’m rather novice in motor design and effect of it
[2021-11-16T22:18:09] francois schempers: let me find you a train motor, worked on one not so long ago x)
[2021-11-16T22:19:00] francois schempers: 60l of consommation at idle xD V16 with 40cm wide piston head xD
[2021-11-16T22:19:13] Mirono escooters: Wtf xd
[2021-11-16T22:19:14] francois schempers: generate 1500V at 1500A peak
[2021-11-16T22:19:28] Mirono escooters: Sorry i ask this but what do u do for job do do such cool shit??
[2021-11-16T22:19:51] Artem Bulashev: Sweeet :))
[2021-11-16T22:20:04] Artem Bulashev: Great way to die with sparks
[2021-11-16T22:21:36] francois schempers: I work for sncf, the france's train company ^^
[2021-11-16T22:21:52] Mirono escooters: As a engineer?
[2021-11-16T22:22:02] Mirono escooters: 5€ if u lick it
[2021-11-16T22:22:14] francois schempers: you should see the size of the plug xD
[2021-11-16T22:22:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😂 why do you tell them🤣🤣🤣
[2021-11-16T22:22:54] francois schempers: as plenty of stuff x) started that way, did lots of formations, now I manage train traffic
[2021-11-16T22:22:55] Mirono escooters: But his one heats a lot lol
[2021-11-16T22:23:09] francois schempers: <files/20210705_104507.mp4>
[2021-11-16T22:23:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wow long time no see 😅 i am banned from there too😏
[2021-11-16T22:25:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No
[2021-11-16T22:25:27] francois schempers: that's a 1500v plug, with current switch off, spark like this just from residuals current 🤣 so I'm not gonna lick it, even off xD
[2021-11-16T22:26:19] Unknown: Dude that's like xt2000 😝😂
[2021-11-16T22:26:28] francois schempers: xD
[2021-11-16T22:27:00] Artem Bulashev: That’s enough to spot weld copper?
[2021-11-16T22:27:03] Artem Bulashev: 😂
[2021-11-16T22:27:20] francois schempers: shurly xD
[2021-11-16T22:27:40] francois schempers: watch that video check the motor size xD
[2021-11-16T22:27:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Magnet heats not just because of one reason, but as we spin engine, you pressure the air in the gaps and this what can be avoided by ferrofluid
[2021-11-16T22:28:36] Artem Bulashev: Ok can see that as well, thanks didn’t think about air heating up due to Air resistance in that close system 😊
[2021-11-16T22:28:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 👌
[2021-11-16T22:29:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Me in love with ferrofluid
[2021-11-16T22:29:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Read some grin technoligies testings
[2021-11-16T22:29:19] Artem Bulashev: Wonder how much that effect contributes to winding heating up the air it self
[2021-11-16T22:30:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: After you start to drug your engine ,only thing is that Engine plates flat surface , whole stupid
[2021-11-16T22:30:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Imagine they make it to be able to transfer heat better
[2021-11-16T22:31:16] Mirono escooters: Wherr u order?
[2021-11-16T22:31:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I started trying it with smaller engine's
[2021-11-16T22:32:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_1557@16-11-2021_22-32-54.jpg>
[2021-11-16T22:33:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pl Site
[2021-11-16T22:33:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They have lot stuff , near heat reducing
[2021-11-16T22:33:36] francois schempers: show him the little bottle x)
[2021-11-16T22:34:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_1558@16-11-2021_22-34-05.jpg>
[2021-11-16T22:34:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Works like magic😂😂 really
[2021-11-16T22:34:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You just hold bottle close and field sucks out
[2021-11-16T22:35:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just stays in gaps
[2021-11-16T22:35:06] Artem Bulashev: How do you apply?
[2021-11-16T22:35:13] Artem Bulashev: How much ? Where
[2021-11-16T22:35:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wait
[2021-11-16T22:36:55] Mirono escooters: I recommend checking out ebikes.ca motor simulator and populating it's Custom motor field with parameters of m365 motor and its rewindings. Stock is 19Kv, 0.3Ohm, 30 poles. Wheel is 230mm for 10". Try increasing Kv, decreasing resistance in one step, and the reverse in other step, how it changes the efficiency graph. And indeed if you lower Kv enough, you can get away with fairly high resistance, while maintaining peak efficiency around 80%. It's a nice tool to get rough idea on what to expect. It assumes block commutation with trapezoid waveform, so foc efficiency will be higher than portayed
[2021-11-16T22:36:56] Mirono escooters: Skck
[2021-11-16T22:36:57] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-16T22:37:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2021-11-16T22:38:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some fills more ,but that after overfilled thats just resistance
[2021-11-16T22:41:00] Unknown: What difference would it make to rewind a motor 🤔 might rewind the 250w xiaomi to star wiring
[2021-11-16T22:41:27] Unknown: But probably with a thicker cable, and less winds offcourse
[2021-11-16T22:42:59] Mirono escooters: Thats all u need?
[2021-11-16T22:43:07] Mirono escooters: I tried. It didnt handle heat
[2021-11-16T22:44:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats a small Engine ,but basically yes
[2021-11-16T22:44:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont get it on your self😅
[2021-11-16T22:44:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Didn't find fancy video version when i use gloves😂😂
[2021-11-16T22:45:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As i said look on there site
[2021-11-16T22:45:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is kinda more but limited to some engine's
[2021-11-16T22:45:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They are basically for bikes
[2021-11-16T22:47:55] Unknown: How did it not handle that? 😂
[2021-11-16T22:48:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Easiest to calm are like engines like this
[2021-11-16T22:48:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_1559@16-11-2021_22-48-23.jpg>
[2021-11-16T22:48:27] Unknown: It would give less ohm but higher resistance no?
[2021-11-16T22:49:26] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1560@16-11-2021_22-49-26.jpg>
[2021-11-16T22:49:27] Mirono escooters: Vesc, but not rion esc
[2021-11-16T22:49:29] Mirono escooters: Hehe topic time
[2021-11-16T22:49:31] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-11-16T22:49:36] Mirono escooters: Dont wanna be banned
[2021-11-16T22:51:13] Unknown: How did it not handle that? 😂
[2021-11-16T22:51:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Delta is more Than just rewiring ,you need to controll that power somehow ,sadly but cant say more since ,i not familar with some secrets
[2021-11-16T22:51:51] Mirono escooters: Think badly wired for it
[2021-11-16T22:53:45] Unknown: Damnit i feel like if i could rework the 250 watt with thicker wire and less loops i'd increase the ohm a bit, wich would end up in a higher kv
[2021-11-16T22:54:07] Unknown: Or stick neo magnets in the rim 🤔😂
[2021-11-16T22:54:14] Happy Giraffe: Isn't it start at stock? 👀
[2021-11-16T22:54:20] Happy Giraffe: Or am I retarded?
[2021-11-16T22:54:32] Happy Giraffe: Inokim

[2021-11-16T22:55:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah my Kim awaits vesc☺️
[2021-11-16T22:55:10] Unknown: Delta, soz my bad
[2021-11-16T22:55:33] Happy Giraffe: Delta requires more current especially starting so it will melt
[2021-11-16T22:55:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bit higher kv ,you can get with some changes
[2021-11-16T22:56:08] Unknown: How then
[2021-11-16T22:56:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I just was playing with this
[2021-11-16T22:56:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i got sensor down
[2021-11-16T22:57:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Replace with 350 sensor ,put to correct holes
[2021-11-16T22:57:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So sensor two empty sensor two empty
[2021-11-16T22:57:46] Happy Giraffe: Most delta motors start with star and switch to delta
[2021-11-16T22:57:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Original is closer
[2021-11-16T22:58:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than put into 350 housing
[2021-11-16T22:58:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Reacts more agressiv this way
[2021-11-16T22:59:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Had some defo 350 and unused 250 to play with
[2021-11-16T22:59:27] Unknown: When does it switch though, there must be a bypass for that no?
[2021-11-16T22:59:43] Unknown: Lol i found the pic with my star delta m365 motor
[2021-11-16T22:59:50] Mirono escooters: So much work

[2021-11-16T23:11:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am not interested in ,wall of text ,just let me ride
[2021-11-16T23:11:34] Unknown: https://youtu.be/o1fQ_BrPBsU
[2021-11-16T23:12:40] Unknown: And listen to me don't try this if you don't know what you are doing ...i exploded an m365 controller...
[2021-11-16T23:12:46] Unknown: Literally
[2021-11-16T23:12:52] Happy Giraffe: Lol, Im just worried it consumes a lot of juice
[2021-11-16T23:13:46] Unknown: Uhhh long time ago ..
[2021-11-16T23:18:07] Unknown: How do you switch to delta while riding?
[2021-11-16T23:18:08] Artem Bulashev: That’s enough? Or add a bit more on second round ?
[2021-11-16T23:18:35] Unknown: By magic
[2021-11-16T23:18:44] Unknown: Delta button
[2021-11-16T23:19:01] Unknown: But how 😂
[2021-11-16T23:19:20] Unknown: You will have to wait....
[2021-11-16T23:19:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Makes new soon™?
[2021-11-16T23:19:41] Unknown: How you make them phahes switch just like that 😂
[2021-11-16T23:20:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can add bit more but useless if overfilled ,all you need basically is to fill gaps, but this will incrase heat to plate
[2021-11-16T23:20:46] Unknown: Yeahhh a lot, im finishing the 3 deltas perfectly so I can take pro pics and pro vid...
[2021-11-16T23:21:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 👌👌
[2021-11-16T23:21:58] Unknown: 💪💪
[2021-11-16T23:22:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Race in rion is fun in a way
[2021-11-16T23:22:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But
[2021-11-16T23:22:48] Unknown: Im off to bed nightnight masterminds!
[2021-11-16T23:23:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont forget you race with some company who has fuckload off money and just on body materials we lose a speed
[2021-11-16T23:23:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Have pleasant scooter dreams
[2021-11-18T17:42:46] Mirono escooters: Bonjourno Now that we have a new 20s vescs What is advantage for 20s instead of 16s At same speed?
[2021-11-18T18:05:22] francois schempers: at same W, less heat
[2021-11-18T18:07:55] Mirono escooters: Any disadvantages?
[2021-11-18T18:20:25] Artem Bulashev: Danger of high voltage
[2021-11-18T18:20:55] Artem Bulashev: May be longer batteries
[2021-11-18T18:22:14] Artem Bulashev: In theory, higher efficiency less wh per km on same speed
[2021-11-18T18:22:40] Artem Bulashev: But I’m not sure it’s true, I think people just deduced it from Ah, which is wrong.
[2021-11-18T18:25:39] Artem Bulashev: Yeah as heat is due to amps. At same amps will have more power proportionally to the s series count increase. Also top speed will increase about 2.5kmh per S added
[2021-11-18T18:27:45] Artem Bulashev: Also helps with motor power if it is limited. Motor heat is also amps So if you motor can only do 30amps than you will get motor power out of it without almost any heat increase, and acceleration will be better as you get motor power earlier (motor voltage climbs faster)
[2021-11-18T18:27:58] Luis Magalhaes: If you run at slow speed it draws less amps but you have a bigger battery if you want same Ah so... Dont know if its worth it if you don't want more speed 😅
[2021-11-18T18:28:53] Luis Magalhaes: I think it will be all about more power in the end 😁
[2021-11-18T18:30:13] Artem Bulashev: It draws proportionally less amps if you drive at any speed as before (same watts consumed in theory, though people say at same speed, doesn’t matter 5km hot 40km, higher voltage set up will draw less Wh = efficiency. don’t know if it is true. )
[2021-11-18T18:30:23] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-11-18T18:30:56] Artem Bulashev: 100v fets are a lot worse, they have higher internal resistance by 33%
[2021-11-18T18:31:04] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, in theory but i think its true
[2021-11-18T18:31:24] Luis Magalhaes: That i didn't know 😁
[2021-11-18T18:31:41] Luis Magalhaes: Generate more heat ?
[2021-11-18T18:31:47] Artem Bulashev: 1.5mOhm vs 2mohm at 10v 80a And 1.1mOhm vs 1.4mOhn at 80v 300a
[2021-11-18T18:31:55] Artem Bulashev: According to data sheets
[2021-11-18T18:35:30] Mirono escooters: Xox
[2021-11-18T18:35:31] Mirono escooters: Wow
[2021-11-18T18:47:41] Luis Magalhaes: whats the price of that ubox ?
[2021-11-18T18:50:11] Artem Bulashev: 100v is not on sale yet
[2021-11-18T18:52:41] Luis Magalhaes: ok did not see it on the spintend site but they could have an idea of price
[2021-11-18T18:52:46] Luis Magalhaes: just curious
[2021-11-18T18:54:10] Happy Giraffe: Propably 50$ more than old dual
[2021-11-19T14:25:19] Ralf Halbknapp: Basically different voltage would have similar efficiency but the whole system needs to be built differently. However you would run into certain limits all the time that may make a certain voltage better to achieve a certain speed and power. But if you have longer and thinner coils in the motor and more of the cells in series then parallel may end up in the same result. Only very high power and speed will at some point be cumbersome on low voltage and small wheels as the currents get impractical to handle.

[2021-11-19T16:36:18] Mirono escooters: Got dem cheap spacers
[2021-11-19T16:37:28] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-19T16:40:09] Mirono escooters: Gonna trust my life with 5 gram spacers or dmth
[2021-11-19T16:40:46] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1563@19-11-2021_16-40-46.jpg>
[2021-11-19T16:40:57] Mirono escooters: And gonna space 5 🌚
[2021-11-19T19:40:10] Unknown: Hollow aluminum or shit 😂
[2021-11-19T20:21:05] Artem Bulashev: No that’s about right for that volume of aluminium
[2021-11-19T20:21:31] Artem Bulashev: Entire disk is like 58g and it is NOT alum
[2021-11-19T20:22:08] Unknown: Oh ok my bad 😂
[2021-11-19T20:22:26] Unknown: Why would'nt they make it steel though
[2021-11-19T20:26:06] Mirono escooters: Hope it survives
[2021-11-19T20:28:38] Artem Bulashev: There is not that much stress
[2021-11-19T20:28:50] Artem Bulashev: Bolts take most of it when it is all right
[2021-11-19T20:29:00] Artem Bulashev: Spacer simply needs not to compress
[2021-11-19T20:30:52] Mirono escooters: Fair
[2021-11-19T20:49:20] Luis Magalhaes: <files/4_5816436366568852583.mp4>
[2021-11-19T20:49:26] Luis Magalhaes: Is this normal?
[2021-11-19T20:50:13] Luis Magalhaes: A p42A molicel pushing 19.8A of it and it goes directly to 1.9V 😅
[2021-11-19T20:50:37] Mirono escooters: 1.9????
[2021-11-19T20:50:44] Luis Magalhaes: Yes 😅
[2021-11-19T20:51:03] Mirono escooters: Aah. I know
[2021-11-19T20:51:11] Mirono escooters: V sag over xires
[2021-11-19T20:51:17] Mirono escooters: Measure directly at Batt points
[2021-11-19T20:51:32] Mirono escooters: That's y good disvhargers use 4 wire method
[2021-11-19T20:51:42] Mirono escooters: Poor wires
[2021-11-19T20:52:06] Luis Magalhaes: They got hot Indeed but should it drop that much any way?
[2021-11-19T20:53:03] Mirono escooters: Over the wires yes
[2021-11-19T20:53:22] Mirono escooters: Measure w multimetrr at Batt contacs directly
[2021-11-19T20:54:15] Luis Magalhaes: You think its only the voltage values that are wrong?
[2021-11-19T21:29:06] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-11-19T21:30:40] Luis Magalhaes: Told him that, he said when the test ended the cell get to 3.1v, lets see if he test it again 😂
[2021-11-19T21:31:29] Mirono escooters: That's y good grsters got 4 wire test method
[2021-11-20T00:44:18] Happy Giraffe: I would guess the point of contact is so bad it isnt accurate, 20A needs bigger surface to travel properly is what my gut tells me. But that's just my guess
[2021-11-20T00:44:43] Mirono escooters: V drop across wires
[2021-11-20T00:44:49] Mirono escooters: Poor Tiny wires lol
[2021-11-20T00:44:53] Mirono escooters: Multimetrr is answer
[2021-11-20T00:45:16] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, also the alligator clips cant properly transfer it haha
[2021-11-20T00:47:39] Mirono escooters: Also
[2021-11-20T00:47:43] Mirono escooters: It's a Lot of powa
[2021-11-20T00:49:54] Luis Magalhaes: He already is thinking the cell is fake 😂
[2021-11-20T00:50:01] Mirono escooters: ...
[2021-11-20T00:50:06] Mirono escooters: Doing bad measures lol
[2021-11-20T00:51:58] Happy Giraffe: Weird people
[2021-11-20T00:52:22] Mirono escooters: I stopped trying to explain to a fb Guy that wh u need to use nominal not max v
[2021-11-20T00:52:28] Mirono escooters: Some ppl just too stupid to teach
[2021-11-20T00:52:45] Mirono escooters: Was a young girl with rich parznts and her uncle builded everyhhing
[2021-11-20T00:53:24] Mirono escooters: I got my 35e finally so tomorrow i go finish scoot
[2021-11-20T02:49:33] Artem Bulashev: Nice what set up? This cells operate best in between 0-7amp per cell
[2021-11-20T02:50:17] Happy Giraffe: *sweating with 6p 50A*
[2021-11-20T02:50:21] Artem Bulashev: Above 7amp long term there are better cells in terms of delivered range
[2021-11-20T02:53:07] Artem Bulashev: 8.3 for short will do well 👌 But if he would plan to use it for long trip where he goes on full amps for 10min in the row, there are better cells, 35e win wh race up to 7amps above that other cells get a lead (just FYI) 😊 Great cell regardless, better get it new though, it is not very good with life cycles
[2021-11-20T02:54:51] Happy Giraffe: Yeah I think my battery current drops quickly
[2021-11-20T02:55:06] Happy Giraffe: Did they respond to the question about BT module?
[2021-11-20T11:54:26] Mirono escooters: It's for a Xiaomi scoot So 5p and no more than 25a lol
[2021-11-20T11:55:12] Mirono escooters: Really? How many cycles we talking bout
[2021-11-20T23:19:03] Mirono escooters: Helo Anyone got some spare p42a for Kenny? Some cells have rust
[2021-11-20T23:19:23] Mirono escooters: Not the safest option to use like dis
[2021-11-20T23:21:54] Unknown: Is nkon out of stock?
[2021-11-20T23:22:23] Mirono escooters: Ah yes they got now
[2021-11-20T23:22:28] Mirono escooters: Last time i chrcked didnt
[2021-11-20T23:23:03] Unknown: Ooh ok, i'll order :D
[2021-11-21T22:51:06] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3
[2021-11-21T22:51:14] Artem Bulashev: Police stopped me
[2021-11-21T22:51:22] Artem Bulashev: 🤤🤤
[2021-11-21T22:51:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh ?!
[2021-11-21T22:52:22] Artem Bulashev: Luckily they mainly cared about watts not being above 600w and my vsett9 has 650w usually, but I showed them my cover is 500w and showed them that online show sells it as 500w - special power reduced version
[2021-11-21T22:52:30] Artem Bulashev: They were like you were going 45kmh
[2021-11-21T22:52:36] Artem Bulashev: I was like noooo, it can’t
[2021-11-21T22:52:39] Artem Bulashev: 🤣
[2021-11-21T22:52:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅😅😅
[2021-11-21T22:52:51] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha cd
[2021-11-21T22:53:44] Artem Bulashev: They were, so you think we are stupid ? I was like nooo, of course not, can I see the speed measured device ? They were like, have good night don’t drive it above 25
[2021-11-21T22:53:47] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁
[2021-11-21T22:54:04] Artem Bulashev: Last phrase was border line angry
[2021-11-21T22:54:05] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂
[2021-11-21T22:54:16] Artem Bulashev: Need vesc speed limiter 😄🤝🤝
[2021-11-21T22:54:18] Mirono escooters: Haha xd. Nice
[2021-11-21T22:54:27] Mirono escooters: I would prob not stop
[2021-11-21T22:54:35] Artem Bulashev: They are faster
[2021-11-21T22:54:37] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅
[2021-11-21T22:54:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ouch... sounds like last warning 😅
[2021-11-21T22:54:49] Mirono escooters: Not in small Roads
[2021-11-21T22:55:09] Artem Bulashev: I was on 3 lane main road in the city center
[2021-11-21T22:55:15] Artem Bulashev: Chilling 45-50
[2021-11-21T22:55:21] Mirono escooters: Aaahh
[2021-11-21T22:55:23] Mirono escooters: Oki lol
[2021-11-21T22:55:24] Mirono escooters: Nvm
[2021-11-21T22:55:56] Artem Bulashev: Yeah don’t want them to see me again with speed limiter 😁
[2021-11-21T23:32:36] Unknown: 😆😂 i do this all time
[2021-11-21T23:33:16] Unknown: Love the response though 😂 they be like you think i'm StUpId?
[2021-11-21T23:33:18] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 😃😃
[2021-11-21T23:33:33] Unknown: Well i was hoping you were 😂😂
[2021-11-21T23:33:40] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2021-11-21T23:33:58] Unknown: But i do it too, if i press my power button poof insta 25kmh
[2021-11-21T23:34:17] Unknown: Fails sometimes though imo
[2021-11-21T23:39:35] Artem Bulashev: I once passed a police car on high way at night slowly in speed limit, in joined in the row of cars to take single lane turn to other high way (they were in that row so I go about 5 cars in front of them) After the turn I floored it before they popped out front the turn and was gone. 4 min later I see headlights far behind of the Open Insignia at the back (what police had) so I get right lane 125kmh (120 is speed limit, + 6km no ticket) 30 sec later they fly by and brake and get in line and tell me to move over 😄😄😄 they fly out of the car and approach me aggressively - how fast were you going?!? - bellow sir, 120-125 why? - we had to go 160kmh to catch up to you!! - oh ok, well sir it wasn’t me who was speeding than right? (They broke the speed limit lane without proper light signal enabled, and they just admitted it all on their body cameras) - drive carefully sir, good night
[2021-11-21T23:40:33] Artem Bulashev: 😃😃 it was single best interaction in my life with police in Switzerland (28kmh is licence taken away, and 1500 chf ticket, I was at around 40kmh above)
[2021-11-21T23:41:52] Unknown: Lucky as hell 😂
[2021-11-21T23:45:12] Unknown: I once went for a bag of weed, years ago it was so much.. like over 100grams 😂 and i was walking with this big shopping bag filled with a bag of weed, and i see police so i put it under my jacket.. They where like what are you doing here? I was like well, i can't find my way to the bus stop i never come arround here i was visiting a friend, i could smell the weed on me thinking i'm fucked because this happend at a sketchy parkinglot. So long story short i'm there with this huge bagaweed at my chest talking to them for like 2-3 mins explaining me where i have to take the bus. I was shitting myself for real
[2021-11-21T23:45:32] Unknown: Don't do kids drugs 🥴
[2021-11-21T23:46:21] Unknown: I was like 17 😂 never ever took that much again hahaha lucky as hell, and i was dumb as hell 😂
[2021-11-21T23:47:17] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2021-11-21T23:47:48] Artem Bulashev: That is hilarious I know how strong food weed can smell even in 10g 😄😄😄
[2021-11-21T23:48:07] Artem Bulashev: I think he was sick with covid - patient zero
[2021-11-21T23:48:46] Unknown: Yea i really tought i was fucked right there 😂😂 took a few years to realize how fucked i was haha
[2021-11-21T23:49:03] Unknown: Now i have a lawsuit and i'm a good boy 😂
[2021-11-21T23:49:27] Unknown: 6 years ongoing, 6000€ fine and 5 years probation
[2021-11-21T23:49:47] Unknown: As i said, young and dumb 😂 at least i learned out of it haha
[2021-11-21T23:50:00] Unknown: But man that was some night though 😂😂
[2021-11-21T23:50:45] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-11-21T23:50:52] Artem Bulashev: Haha that would be life changing
[2021-11-21T23:50:54] Artem Bulashev: For real
[2021-11-21T23:51:39] Unknown: Yea indeed haha they caught me a few years later with some dope and well yea, shit happend. I was young dumb and irresponsible
[2021-11-21T23:51:59] Unknown: Had a bad childhood haha, i got out better 😂 now i look back and think damn
[2021-11-21T23:52:06] Unknown: What a dumbass kid i was haha
[2021-11-22T01:12:10] Happy Giraffe: Dont you have bluetooth to switch profiles?
[2021-11-22T01:12:48] Happy Giraffe: If they stop you when you are not in main road I mean😂
[2021-11-22T07:49:05] Mirono escooters: Lol me without a limiter

[2021-11-22T11:52:14] Unknown: If you switch when they stop you it could be visible you're doing something haha i have 25km profile on permanent use When i start it does 25 untill i switch profile that way its a one click switch no phone needed or nothing haha way safer

[2021-11-23T00:00:11] Luis Magalhaes: Nice
[2021-11-23T00:22:13] Artem Bulashev: Yes new v2 and 100v both have built in 2.4ghz built in with external antenna. BT was removed because range issues on most scooters, placing it externally helps that’s why they took it out
[2021-11-23T01:36:00] Happy Giraffe: Any info about single vesc BT sensor?
[2021-11-23T01:36:19] Happy Giraffe: I guess it cant be used simultaneously with ADC but yeah
[2021-11-23T09:54:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: smartdisplay : full vesc control with uart is working fine now 😉

[2021-11-23T15:23:45] Mirono escooters: Love it
[2021-11-23T15:23:57] Mirono escooters: The ninebot rental uses kinda same connector. Maybe i find it

[2021-11-23T15:48:55] Unknown: @artBula
[2021-11-23T15:53:30] Artem Bulashev: As150u - dammm no more losses, no more sag 😅 Xt60 for compare and xt90 cover for compare
[2021-11-23T15:57:33] Mirono escooters: And i thought xt90 was big
[2021-11-23T16:00:33] Artem Bulashev: 😃😃me too
[2021-11-23T16:02:54] Artem Bulashev: I wonder if one xt90-untispark + xt60 together would provide about equal performance to this connector
[2021-11-23T16:08:44] Artem Bulashev: Based on nominals х60=30а + хт90=45а = 75а As150= 75a номинал :)

[2021-11-23T17:02:15] Artem Bulashev: 40t stays ok up to 20a per cell long term = 80amp from 4p pack no problem at all
[2021-11-23T17:16:14] sombre_enfant: Dual and if i take other motor i may need around 30A-40A continous
[2021-11-23T17:44:32] Happy Giraffe: I don’t think this is correct. I may be wrong but BT requires tx out line, while throttle should need rx in line
[2021-11-23T17:44:32] Happy Giraffe: he can. just has to fill the 8 pins JST correctly
[2021-11-23T17:45:12] Happy Giraffe: So while I now have ADC in place, what do I need to do exactly?😅
[2021-11-23T17:46:08] Happy Giraffe: Im sry for being annoying but I can't figure it out myself
[2021-11-23T21:40:44] Artem Bulashev: 40 total to 80 total?
[2021-11-23T21:41:34] Artem Bulashev: But regardless that pack can handle it
[2021-11-23T21:47:49] sombre_enfant: Yeah 80A in total will it sag too much ? Do i need 5p?
[2021-11-23T22:22:01] Artem Bulashev: No, will be better than any other cell almost in this configuration (4p)
[2021-11-23T22:27:54] Artem Bulashev: The only better cell is Vapcell INR21700 5000mAh T50 (Red) 2020 (Samsung 50s) this one will deliver 13% more wh with similar or equal performance otherwise
[2021-11-23T22:28:08] Artem Bulashev: But price is hard to justify
[2021-11-23T22:28:19] Mirono escooters: And molicel??
[2021-11-23T22:28:29] sombre_enfant: I only search the less sag possible
[2021-11-23T22:28:30] Artem Bulashev: What?
[2021-11-23T22:28:44] Mirono escooters: Isn't molicel one of the best in terms of powa capacity
[2021-11-23T22:28:50] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2021-11-23T22:29:09] Artem Bulashev: Under 20amps it delivers 12.6wh
[2021-11-23T22:29:21] Mirono escooters: 20a damn
[2021-11-23T22:30:29] Artem Bulashev: But t50 (wrapped Samsung 50s) can deliver 14.1wh - that is the only cell that can beat P42a delivery at 20a discharge
[2021-11-23T22:30:55] Artem Bulashev: Not much difference for double the price
[2021-11-23T22:31:00] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-11-23T22:31:01] Artem Bulashev: So great choice
[2021-11-23T22:32:15] Artem Bulashev: Than use copper for sure for the pack
[2021-11-23T22:32:46] Artem Bulashev: Because you so t have much crosssection area in between series
[2021-11-24T10:44:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hello. does anyone know a chinese company which can build custom cables with jst plugs and/or higo/juliet on each end ?
[2021-11-24T22:37:59] Artem Bulashev: Unfortunately 🤷‍♂️
[2021-11-25T11:14:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2021-11-25T12:30:40] Artem Bulashev: How

[2021-11-25T17:32:41] Luis Magalhaes: From a friend of mine
[2021-11-25T17:33:03] Mirono escooters: Kapton. Ieuw?
[2021-11-25T17:33:11] Mirono escooters: Traces thic
[2021-11-25T17:34:34] Happy Giraffe: Do I see kapton between mosfet and heatsink?
[2021-11-25T17:34:38] Happy Giraffe: 🤮
[2021-11-25T17:37:00] Mirono escooters: Yes :(
[2021-11-25T17:37:14] Mirono escooters: Thermal Pads arent expensive
[2021-11-25T17:58:00] Artem Bulashev: yayks 2.4mOh
[2021-11-25T18:10:43] Luis Magalhaes: I think so😂
[2021-11-25T18:11:33] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-25T18:13:22] Luis Magalhaes: Did pass that info about the kapton and the thermal pad to him 😂😂
[2021-11-25T18:13:45] Luis Magalhaes: What was on the new ubox 100v mosfets?
[2021-11-25T19:44:49] Mirono escooters: Is there a charge only super small (15s) bms?
[2021-11-25T21:46:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: small expansion board for lights control. this is for a deck leds strip or simply brakes. fully configurable (nb of leds for each feature, colors...) over can bus
[2021-11-25T21:46:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2021-11-25T21:52:48] Artem Bulashev: sweeeeeeet
[2021-11-25T21:53:35] Artem Bulashev: Already recieved mine 144leds per meter (maximum possible) ahhah
[2021-11-25T21:53:49] Mirono escooters: Waiting for mi'ee
[2021-11-25T21:53:50] Artem Bulashev: there are many non smart once
[2021-11-25T21:53:57] Mirono escooters: Yesssss
[2021-11-25T21:54:11] Artem Bulashev: how small are you talking? what are dimentions to be fitted?
[2021-11-25T21:54:14] Mirono escooters: Hmm. I need one to fit in a small bag
[2021-11-25T21:54:17] Mirono escooters: I Will checl
[2021-11-25T21:54:22] Mirono escooters: 15s not mucho
[2021-11-25T21:54:50] Artem Bulashev: just get of aliexpress basic green board once
[2021-11-25T21:55:13] Artem Bulashev: its only objecvtive is to balance normally so they are small
[2021-11-25T21:56:59] Artem Bulashev: there was an amazing project called FlexiBMS
[2021-11-25T21:57:18] Artem Bulashev: it was 15s version i think and it was tiny tiny
[2021-11-25T21:57:18] Artem Bulashev: https://forum.esk8.news/t/flexibms-lite-flexible-configuration-bms-w-can-bus/8801/1521
[2021-11-25T21:57:55] Artem Bulashev: but I don't think creater has managed to produce any more of them since septermber due to parts shortage
[2021-11-25T21:58:57] sombre_enfant: Theres already a ton of small arduino bms, just say u dont want to spend money
[2021-11-25T22:03:18] Mirono escooters: ??
[2021-11-25T22:03:27] Mirono escooters: Wtf is that for a reaction
[2021-11-25T22:03:49] Mirono escooters: I just asked bcs this group smort and prob knew the best.. like Artem provided (💚)
[2021-11-25T22:04:23] Mirono escooters: Hmm yea :)
[2021-11-25T22:06:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😜👍
[2021-11-25T22:07:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: final size taking into account your suggested mounting holes :
[2021-11-25T22:07:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1585@25-11-2021_22-07-49.jpg>
[2021-11-25T22:18:23] Artem Bulashev: Yes I was asking about 15s BMS :)) how small he want it to be
[2021-11-25T22:18:34] Artem Bulashev: But this is f awesome
[2021-11-25T22:26:43] Artem Bulashev: Ok so this is our out board - so there is no dc-dc on board? Need to supply 12v or it takes vbat? (Where would you plan to get its power from in your system with smart display integrated?) - if it takes vbat, doesn’t it mean that leds will be powered on but be off at all times as power and gnd to 3 pin led connector output is there without interrupters ? - what are small 8 pins on right top? (7 pins used I think?)
[2021-11-25T22:29:13] Artem Bulashev: No conventional turn signal outputs? (Beside LED strip that can be utilized as such, but many people may be using more conventional turn signal)
[2021-11-25T22:29:44] Artem Bulashev: Not bushing 🤤🥰 just thinking out loud in hopes to help or clarify
[2021-11-25T22:39:26] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1586@25-11-2021_22-39-26.jpg>
[2021-11-25T22:39:38] Face de Pin Sucé: almost 500A phase on spintend while accelerating
[2021-11-25T22:41:26] Face de Pin Sucé: heat is an issue with this power
[2021-11-25T22:42:47] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1587@25-11-2021_22-42-47.jpg>
[2021-11-25T22:42:54] Face de Pin Sucé: This one not bad :p
[2021-11-25T22:42:58] Face de Pin Sucé: 11000W
[2021-11-25T22:43:14] Face de Pin Sucé: but reached 80°c so couldn't do more I think
[2021-11-25T22:43:15] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2021-11-25T22:43:26] Mirono escooters: Me happy w 120
[2021-11-25T22:45:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Kelly, so much more power tbh x)
[2021-11-25T22:45:45] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm a little bit surprised XT90 didn't melt already
[2021-11-25T22:46:11] Mirono escooters: 😛
[2021-11-25T22:46:37] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-11-25T22:47:38] Happy Giraffe: Takes quite a lot for it to melt, cant remember if it was 130-140 amps
[2021-11-25T22:48:03] Artem Bulashev: Another idea, since you now going to have “input boards” that will take: - break signal (2wire or 3wire? Two inputs or 1?) - turn signal buttons: 2pc by 2 wires - horn button: 1pc 2 wires - adc input: 1pc 3 wires (5v supply) - headlight button 1pc 2 wires (can be avoided if you map other buttons to enable headlamp like both turn signals together press and hold for 3sec) = 5-7inputs all from steering Could we make police mode deactivation using those existing 5 inputs? - hold break and click once left turn, 2 right, 1 left 😄 or you know some thing easy enough but not enough to be guessed by policeman 😅 And to lock it back to police mode eo the out reboot, sometting like trigger accelerator 3 times (over 60% change in less than 2.5sec) while braking is engaged (scooter won’t accelerate thus and for police it will look like you are simply braking) Again sorry for train of thoughts ahah
[2021-11-25T22:48:50] Artem Bulashev: It is rated for 1min 90amps As I said I think you may be getting false readings
[2021-11-25T22:49:06] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm running a lot of time at more than 150A x)
[2021-11-25T22:49:28] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1588@25-11-2021_22-49-28.jpg>
[2021-11-25T22:49:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Voltage Sag is really okay for the power
[2021-11-25T22:49:44] Artem Bulashev: My point exactly
[2021-11-25T22:49:50] Artem Bulashev: Again my point supported
[2021-11-25T22:50:11] Artem Bulashev: 150a draw would sag any battery more 5-6v
[2021-11-25T22:50:17] Artem Bulashev: 10%
[2021-11-25T22:50:36] Luis Magalhaes: More then 10v 😱
[2021-11-25T22:50:37] Artem Bulashev: I think it is not measuring current correctly
[2021-11-25T22:50:50] Artem Bulashev: 5-6v
[2021-11-25T22:51:21] Face de Pin Sucé: 5V x)
[2021-11-25T22:51:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1/ outsite dc power required. it depends too much of the user ... 1A, 5A, 10A... 5v, 12v, vbat. nearly impossible tontarget the right input. 2/ this version doesn't handle LEDs strip with vbat. single dc input. i could Split them. but most users reported to use 5 or 12v lights. 3/ programming port
[2021-11-25T22:51:48] Face de Pin Sucé: 150A on 16S10P of P42A is nothing
[2021-11-25T22:52:04] Luis Magalhaes: It looks more 😂
[2021-11-25T22:52:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Battery doesn't heat more than 10°c during a long ride
[2021-11-25T22:52:09] Luis Magalhaes: 5v is great
[2021-11-25T22:52:14] Face de Pin Sucé: because of the scale
[2021-11-25T22:52:16] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 15amps for those cells is not hard
[2021-11-25T22:52:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. usage of leds (even a splited strip) only.
[2021-11-25T22:52:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i know 👍
[2021-11-25T22:52:39] Face de Pin Sucé: well, it does, I compared with measurements from BMS
[2021-11-25T22:52:45] Artem Bulashev: Ok 😊
[2021-11-25T22:53:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: almost impossible to take all configurations into account (with reasonable cost & size).
[2021-11-25T22:53:13] Face de Pin Sucé: I pulled more than 320A on this battery with Kellys controllers, so 150A is like sleeping for this one
[2021-11-25T22:53:31] Luis Magalhaes: Dam 😂
[2021-11-25T22:54:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with 'audi style' turn signals
[2021-11-25T22:54:35] Luis Magalhaes: So 7218 still more powerfull and cooler then spintend 75100
[2021-11-25T22:54:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Spintend is a dual ESC that has same volume as only one 7218S it is a little normal xD
[2021-11-25T22:54:48] Artem Bulashev: 1. Understood 👌 May be less idea for reasons bellow 2. Understood, problem May be than that ALL addressable leds are 5v, but 90% lights are 12v
[2021-11-25T22:55:01] Face de Pin Sucé: and you need 2 7218S to run both motors
[2021-11-25T22:55:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2021-11-25T22:55:09] Luis Magalhaes: Yes thats true 😂 and 6fet
[2021-11-25T22:55:31] Face de Pin Sucé: it's a goddamn good performance for only 6 fet
[2021-11-25T22:55:46] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't think I can cool it more than what I do now
[2021-11-25T22:55:50] Luis Magalhaes: I really like the software too 😁
[2021-11-25T22:56:04] Luis Magalhaes: Water cooling 😂😂
[2021-11-25T22:56:45] Face de Pin Sucé: screwed on deck, and sides drilled to let the airflow with angry fan (16500 rpm) cooldown the fets
[2021-11-25T22:56:55] Artem Bulashev: Man amazing , can’t wait to play around with code to make it my pattern 😃😃
[2021-11-25T22:57:04] Face de Pin Sucé: it's just too much amps for this little baby x)
[2021-11-25T22:57:50] Artem Bulashev: Have you not replaced fets for better once ?
[2021-11-25T22:57:57] Face de Pin Sucé: nope x)
[2021-11-25T22:57:59] Luis Magalhaes: Seeing that it was 75v100A max 😂😂
[2021-11-25T22:58:00] Artem Bulashev: Because ubox fets are ok but not top
[2021-11-25T22:58:02] Luis Magalhaes: Dam good
[2021-11-25T22:58:05] Artem Bulashev: That would cool it a lot
[2021-11-25T22:58:11] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm not able to do this, too hard for me
[2021-11-25T22:58:25] Artem Bulashev: Will be happy to do it if you decide 😊
[2021-11-25T22:58:39] Face de Pin Sucé: and I'm not planning to keep it inside this Weped x)
[2021-11-25T22:58:41] Luis Magalhaes: That should be good to see 😂
[2021-11-25T22:58:43] Face de Pin Sucé: not enough power
[2021-11-25T22:58:57] Artem Bulashev: 🖕
[2021-11-25T22:59:00] Artem Bulashev: Sorry
[2021-11-25T22:59:01] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂
[2021-11-25T22:59:10] Face de Pin Sucé: I putted this Spintend for testing purposes
[2021-11-25T22:59:27] Face de Pin Sucé: and to test SmartDisplay development x)
[2021-11-25T22:59:37] Artem Bulashev: 😘 I would argue you succeeded in pushing it to the limits
[2021-11-25T22:59:52] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I heard :)
[2021-11-25T23:00:14] Face de Pin Sucé: but I'm designing my own VESC with Rage Mechanics and prototype is working well, just need a nice heatsink to fully test on road
[2021-11-25T23:00:30] Artem Bulashev: 🤝
[2021-11-25T23:00:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Should be 10-15kW continnuous
[2021-11-25T23:00:39] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣
[2021-11-25T23:00:47] Face de Pin Sucé: 20Kw Peak I hope
[2021-11-25T23:00:49] Artem Bulashev: My 650w dual motors are crying
[2021-11-25T23:01:03] Face de Pin Sucé: but needs 2 for dual motors x)
[2021-11-25T23:01:28] Luis Magalhaes: nice 👌
[2021-11-25T23:01:52] Artem Bulashev: What this world needs is BMS charge only 16s at least that would integrate with VESC and cost 120€ or less 😂
[2021-11-25T23:01:56] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb do a video of the weeped with the spintend for us before you remove it lolol
[2021-11-25T23:02:14] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-11-25T23:02:19] Face de Pin Sucé: what do you want to see ? x)
[2021-11-25T23:02:47] Luis Magalhaes: it power aceleration 😂
[2021-11-25T23:04:34] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb what was your top speed ? did you test it?
[2021-11-25T23:05:03] Face de Pin Sucé: I did 102Kmh last time but had to brake
[2021-11-25T23:05:16] Happy Giraffe: Then XT90 wrong connector for you my friend, XT150 barely enough
[2021-11-25T23:05:31] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm working hard these days and riding only for work in town
[2021-11-25T23:05:40] Face de Pin Sucé: hard to do more than 100Kmh in town x)
[2021-11-25T23:05:43] Luis Magalhaes: nice, it would get more speed or is the kv limit?
[2021-11-25T23:06:00] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂 not recommended
[2021-11-25T23:06:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Already did 118Kmh with Kellys before Molicel, and I know I did a little better with Molicel but did'nt look with GPS :/
[2021-11-25T23:06:29] Face de Pin Sucé: have to put back Kellys x)
[2021-11-25T23:06:37] Artem Bulashev: Xt90 is huge risk here
[2021-11-25T23:06:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Wait for it to melt x)
[2021-11-25T23:06:50] Artem Bulashev: Testing is very short time and short rusts
[2021-11-25T23:06:57] Face de Pin Sucé: if it doesn't, well, it's good x)
[2021-11-25T23:06:58] Luis Magalhaes: 😂 demon
[2021-11-25T23:07:11] Artem Bulashev: You do and all burns incl controller and motors likely and it can block front motor and off you go flying
[2021-11-25T23:07:15] Happy Giraffe: XT90 can resist melting with 200Amps for 10 seconds but its stupid to try it
[2021-11-25T23:07:33] Happy Giraffe: XT150 would be miles better or 8mm even better
[2021-11-25T23:07:35] Artem Bulashev: I can send you my AS150u I don’t need them at the moment
[2021-11-25T23:07:50] Artem Bulashev: Which is almost what happens
[2021-11-25T23:08:34] Happy Giraffe: Yeah another guy tested 270A 10 sec and it desoldered at 300A. But some margin for error must be maintained
[2021-11-25T23:08:37] Artem Bulashev: Would reduce sag I would say, but lol, not sure how much as it is damm good cells already
[2021-11-25T23:08:37] Face de Pin Sucé: motor won't burn, but short-circuited fets can lock the front wheel yes x)
[2021-11-25T23:09:06] Face de Pin Sucé: I've already burnt some controllers
[2021-11-25T23:09:17] Face de Pin Sucé: it's a big brake but you don't flip over
[2021-11-25T23:09:20] Artem Bulashev: If that happens 80kmh you won’t care about motors burned or not haha
[2021-11-25T23:09:21] Happy Giraffe: Also you can get better battery wires with bigger connectors. AWG10 is bit small for those amps
[2021-11-25T23:09:30] Artem Bulashev: Ok 😅
[2021-11-25T23:09:35] Mirono escooters: Lock??
[2021-11-25T23:09:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Because your motors magnets can't lock exactly your motor
[2021-11-25T23:09:37] Artem Bulashev: Hope not because of melted connector
[2021-11-25T23:09:46] Face de Pin Sucé: so it brakes hard only
[2021-11-25T23:09:49] Artem Bulashev: As150u come with 8 awg
[2021-11-25T23:09:55] Mirono escooters: Ok lol i thought so
[2021-11-25T23:10:04] Mirono escooters: It's hard
[2021-11-25T23:10:40] Happy Giraffe: I run 50A through xt90 and think it's a sweet spot lol
[2021-11-25T23:10:54] Happy Giraffe: 200A better get 8mm lmao
[2021-11-25T23:10:58] Artem Bulashev: Most people would go flying if it happened at high speed because high speed = high rpm = high motor voltage = high breaking Watts when it locks (the lower the speed the less watts of braking you would experience)
[2021-11-25T23:11:53] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/4rcCdCVBXAI
[2021-11-25T23:12:00] Face de Pin Sucé: it already happened to me at 60Kmh
[2021-11-25T23:12:20] Face de Pin Sucé: it's okay honestly x)
[2021-11-25T23:12:20] Happy Giraffe: French people are crazy😂
[2021-11-25T23:12:23] Artem Bulashev: 👍👍 yeah, I’m thinking of running xt90-spark + xt60 together in parallel to get solid 60-70amps without almost any losses or heat and keep size tiny
[2021-11-25T23:12:37] Artem Bulashev: Interesting Thanks for info
[2021-11-25T23:12:38] Mirono escooters: Yep got that lol. Spotwelder type plugs
[2021-11-25T23:12:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Have some friends who burnt motors at 100+Kmh, but always back one
[2021-11-25T23:12:59] Artem Bulashev: Front is scary
[2021-11-25T23:13:01] Face de Pin Sucé: but, I do not recommend to test it x)
[2021-11-25T23:13:13] Mirono escooters: Yea lol. Front Brake is good but if u lock it ohh boy
[2021-11-25T23:13:37] Face de Pin Sucé: because it's scary as fuck and if you're not concentrated when it happens, you'll fall
[2021-11-25T23:14:09] Face de Pin Sucé: If you manage to lock a front wheel at 100Kmh, honestly your brakes are insane x) it's impossible
[2021-11-25T23:14:16] Face de Pin Sucé: too much power to stop
[2021-11-25T23:17:23] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb one thing, those 132A from battery you put above, what are you running as limit at battery?
[2021-11-25T23:26:01] Luis Magalhaes: https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/4001339540571.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.49e671be0KVpQn&algo_pvid=c1dee57a-eedb-4e62-8036-5e017634fe1b&algo_exp_id=c1dee57a-eedb-4e62-8036-5e017634fe1b-6&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2210000015735315211%22%7D
[2021-11-25T23:26:06] Luis Magalhaes: is this good ?
[2021-11-25T23:30:33] Face de Pin Sucé: 130 per side
[2021-11-25T23:31:59] Luis Magalhaes: ok so the battery Amps here are from just one side? the 493A from fase is from the 2 motors right?
[2021-11-25T23:32:13] Face de Pin Sucé: it's on both sides
[2021-11-25T23:32:26] Face de Pin Sucé: but max battery amps come at max speed
[2021-11-25T23:32:36] Luis Magalhaes: oh so you did not push the max amps then ?
[2021-11-25T23:32:48] Luis Magalhaes: ok ok understood hehe
[2021-11-25T23:32:50] Face de Pin Sucé: because running in town x)
[2021-11-25T23:33:06] Luis Magalhaes: right sorry silly question 🤣
[2021-11-25T23:33:18] Face de Pin Sucé: and also because of thermal throttling at 80°c I think
[2021-11-25T23:33:22] Artem Bulashev: So you sent twos screen shots of max phase and second of max battery amps right ?
[2021-11-25T23:33:38] Artem Bulashev: So max battery amps is 170+ from both controllers
[2021-11-25T23:33:40] Artem Bulashev: Right?
[2021-11-25T23:33:52] Artem Bulashev: And 500a phase from both together ?
[2021-11-25T23:34:38] Artem Bulashev: Because ubox would melt to shits from 340a battery and 1000a phase together 🤣🤣🤣
[2021-11-25T23:35:07] Artem Bulashev: And so would your xt90 😂😂
[2021-11-25T23:35:18] Face de Pin Sucé: I putted 130 on both
[2021-11-25T23:36:19] Luis Magalhaes: ok, with my deck closed i hit it too, not cooling good have to think about it 🤣
[2021-11-25T23:36:46] Mirono escooters: May i be stupid? The frame.. isn't it a big conductor? Why not use it for -? 🌚
[2021-11-25T23:37:01] Happy Giraffe: But you got thermal paste and good clamping pressure?
[2021-11-25T23:37:22] Artem Bulashev: He is using it.
[2021-11-25T23:37:23] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-11-25T23:37:40] Artem Bulashev: But with that much power fets are not able to spread it fast enough
[2021-11-25T23:37:48] Artem Bulashev: Need lower resistance fets
[2021-11-25T23:38:12] Mirono escooters: I mean for the power - Cf
[2021-11-25T23:38:14] Mirono escooters: Xd*
[2021-11-25T23:38:25] Happy Giraffe: Need graphene thermal pads for the fets at that point😂
[2021-11-25T23:38:46] Luis Magalhaes: sort of 🙈😂
[2021-11-25T23:39:10] Happy Giraffe: Most important thing after mosfet transfering heat to case of ubox....
[2021-11-25T23:39:47] Happy Giraffe: If you bolt it down properly with good pressure and good paste I bet you experience much lower temps
[2021-11-25T23:39:53] Luis Magalhaes: yes i know but im not pushing as hard as him too 😂
[2021-11-25T23:39:59] Luis Magalhaes: dont have battery to that
[2021-11-25T23:40:28] Happy Giraffe: I got that done even with single ubox 50/120A🙈
[2021-11-25T23:40:30] Luis Magalhaes: yes, didnt want to do holes in the deck...
[2021-11-25T23:40:52] Luis Magalhaes: i was thinking of doing something like in the wolf GT
[2021-11-25T23:41:14] Luis Magalhaes: a box in the front of scooter with vents to cool down
[2021-11-25T23:41:24] Luis Magalhaes: the box is for sale now
[2021-11-25T23:41:59] Luis Magalhaes: https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005003441485158.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.b1d32d86xvXms0&algo_pvid=4409dda5-68a1-4253-96bb-a16c7ccf6f2d&algo_exp_id=4409dda5-68a1-4253-96bb-a16c7ccf6f2d-17&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2212000025806671622%22%7D
[2021-11-25T23:42:17] Mirono escooters: Expensive box
[2021-11-25T23:42:18] Happy Giraffe: Ubox has the bolt holes at deck level so you would need to make some sort of clamp mechanism then
[2021-11-25T23:42:33] Mirono escooters: I want watervooling with radiator lol
[2021-11-25T23:42:59] Luis Magalhaes: yes it is lol
[2021-11-25T23:43:17] Happy Giraffe: This box also aint doing shit if ubox is not making proper contact with outer shell
[2021-11-25T23:43:48] Luis Magalhaes: it would be cool
[2021-11-25T23:43:58] Happy Giraffe: If it mounts to this middle piece then its useless
[2021-11-25T23:44:00] Luis Magalhaes: yes i could do that too
[2021-11-25T23:44:01] Mirono escooters: Every part sold from kaboo and so is expensive af
[2021-11-25T23:44:12] Mirono escooters: Yea but a Mess. Radiator and when u rkde it air cools
[2021-11-25T23:44:34] Mirono escooters: I also wanted to use let's say 2 flipsky 75100 On outside bolted to frame Watertight Air would cool it pretty significant
[2021-11-25T23:44:46] Luis Magalhaes: i wantend to bold it inside
[2021-11-25T23:44:59] Happy Giraffe: You only need to find a metal box and clamp ubox into it tight, then make it have airflow from riding...
[2021-11-25T23:45:26] Happy Giraffe: It doesnt help at all
[2021-11-25T23:45:51] Happy Giraffe: Because its still not thermally connected to outer shell
[2021-11-25T23:46:28] Luis Magalhaes: it has holes cooling that aluminium plate from the plastic part
[2021-11-25T23:46:39] Luis Magalhaes: some tipe of vents
[2021-11-25T23:46:46] Happy Giraffe: 🙈
[2021-11-25T23:46:58] Happy Giraffe: Thats not how thermal conductivity works
[2021-11-25T23:47:12] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1590@25-11-2021_23-47-12.jpg>
[2021-11-25T23:47:51] Luis Magalhaes: if it can cool down the aluminium inside and the ubox is atached wont it cool the ubox ?
[2021-11-25T23:47:54] Happy Giraffe: If you want any use of the heatsink you must bolt vesc directly against whats in there
[2021-11-25T23:48:30] Happy Giraffe: Hard to understand what you are doing just from a message
[2021-11-25T23:48:32] Luis Magalhaes: yes i want to bolt it to that part not the black part the use inside
[2021-11-25T23:48:52] Luis Magalhaes: *they
[2021-11-25T23:49:21] Happy Giraffe: The aluminium below this doesnt seem to be flat
[2021-11-25T23:50:06] Happy Giraffe: Not sure about the space needed but wouldnt the easiest thing to be just make 4 small holes in frame?😅
[2021-11-25T23:51:31] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi has 2-layer deck, not sure about yours
[2021-11-25T23:51:36] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1592@25-11-2021_23-51-36.jpg>
[2021-11-25T23:51:43] Luis Magalhaes: this way lolol
[2021-11-25T23:52:26] Happy Giraffe: If it fits there then it can be good, however its a bit inefficient as the ubox would be behind the airflow lol
[2021-11-25T23:52:49] Luis Magalhaes: yes it was 🤣 but im wanting to get that space for a bigger battery some time
[2021-11-25T23:53:11] Luis Magalhaes: true 👌
[2021-11-25T23:53:14] Happy Giraffe: If you can flip this around then you have badass cooling
[2021-11-25T23:53:34] Luis Magalhaes: wait
[2021-11-25T23:53:45] Luis Magalhaes: this is the front side
[2021-11-25T23:54:12] Luis Magalhaes: the ubox fets whould be facing the front of scooter
[2021-11-25T23:54:45] Happy Giraffe: That would be perfect then, I was wondering why would they make it backwards lol
[2021-11-25T23:56:27] Luis Magalhaes: no 🤣 that is the front part, then it has a plastic that bolt on that
[2021-11-25T23:56:37] Luis Magalhaes: to close it and water proof
[2021-11-25T23:58:33] Luis Magalhaes: but to do this i will had to re do the cables
[2021-11-25T23:58:53] Luis Magalhaes: i think the fases of rear motor cant get there
[2021-11-26T00:00:12] Luis Magalhaes: if the ubox was a sealead box on top too i could bolt it outside under the deck too 😂
[2021-11-26T00:00:13] Happy Giraffe: Im confused, whatever you do make sure you bolt it directly to something big and blocky that contacts air.
[2021-11-26T00:00:51] Luis Magalhaes: the deck should be the better thing to bolt i know 😅
[2021-11-26T00:01:28] Happy Giraffe: Or you can just make/find a waterproof metal box and put it in front
[2021-11-26T00:01:47] Happy Giraffe: But phase cables would be insanely long...so not that possible
[2021-11-26T00:04:01] Artem Bulashev: Yeah they would and that would be substantial amount of heat = watts waisted, + voltage drop across wires
[2021-11-26T00:04:18] Happy Giraffe: Would need something awg 4 lol
[2021-11-26T00:04:37] Artem Bulashev: I would argue that attaching it to the deck inside is just about as good as this kaboo fork case
[2021-11-26T00:05:02] Happy Giraffe: Yes, even better but he wants some bigger battery inside
[2021-11-26T00:05:12] Artem Bulashev: But non of the downsides like stupid long cables, many more point of failure, losses, heat, complexity
[2021-11-26T00:06:01] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi frame is onepiece so infinite cooling potential as the base is like 6kg aluminium block making direct air contact
[2021-11-26T00:06:31] Artem Bulashev: Logic dictates - controllers need to be close to motors and batteries, battery needs to be close to controller so placing controller up front of the deck and extra 2x battery on stem is much better option
[2021-11-26T00:07:03] Artem Bulashev: Also will allow to take that extra battery off and ride without it when not needed - specially if it is identical battery
[2021-11-26T00:07:14] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, the thicker wires and connectors inside would use as much as space as ubox anyways😅
[2021-11-26T00:07:46] Luis Magalhaes: that is what i use now, but dont use the scooter without it 😂
[2021-11-26T00:07:52] Artem Bulashev: Haha true I suppose
[2021-11-26T00:08:15] Artem Bulashev: What battery you have now ?
[2021-11-26T00:08:41] Luis Magalhaes: ok ok i surrender 🤣 you guys are the brain it will be inside deck and bolted as it should be 😁
[2021-11-26T00:09:16] Luis Magalhaes: original one on the deck 16S10P and a 16s6P on the front
[2021-11-26T00:09:17] Artem Bulashev: You know. You could fit ubox into custom foot rest 😊😊
[2021-11-26T00:09:19] Happy Giraffe: This is my cable jungle haha (this pic doesnt have the 2.7cm spacer for lowering deck), 15cm batt cable etc and vesc inside bolted to frame. Will connect bluetooth module to check temps later when I have time but will be interesting how good it does.
[2021-11-26T00:10:09] Artem Bulashev: It would leave all it would be right next to the most important of motors and to the battery
[2021-11-26T00:10:12] Happy Giraffe: Also replacing original battery with custom one thats made for the shape might give you more capacity aswell
[2021-11-26T00:10:15] Luis Magalhaes: that would be at the rear its too long for the front fases i think
[2021-11-26T00:10:42] Artem Bulashev: Remember rear motor uses more phase current
[2021-11-26T00:10:52] Artem Bulashev: Because you can’t load front wheel enough
[2021-11-26T00:11:19] Artem Bulashev: So it is better place controller to the more loaded wheel
[2021-11-26T00:11:20] Luis Magalhaes: yes that i know
[2021-11-26T00:11:42] Happy Giraffe: Have you done some calculations of how big custom batt could be?
[2021-11-26T00:11:55] Artem Bulashev: I can see how ubox could be fit into custom CNC foot rest that acts like encousure 😃
[2021-11-26T00:12:06] Luis Magalhaes: no because i was thinking of upgrade voltage too lolol
[2021-11-26T00:12:37] Luis Magalhaes: it could be under the deck in a box what you think ?
[2021-11-26T00:13:14] Happy Giraffe: If you have the ground clearance, but the box would need to be super solid
[2021-11-26T00:13:41] Happy Giraffe: Also routing cables would be bad, go with the footrest Artem said
[2021-11-26T00:13:42] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1594@26-11-2021_00-13-42.jpg>
[2021-11-26T00:14:09] Happy Giraffe: Suspension contract and rocks under make it bit smaller
[2021-11-26T00:14:36] Happy Giraffe: If you have it in back like footrest all cables can go nicely inside deck from sides
[2021-11-26T00:14:37] Luis Magalhaes: Its a lot lol
[2021-11-26T00:15:28] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1595@26-11-2021_00-15-28.jpg>
[2021-11-26T00:16:39] Luis Magalhaes: The cables could pass from inside 😂
[2021-11-26T00:16:54] Happy Giraffe: Routing cables would require you to cut a hole in frame base lol
[2021-11-26T00:17:11] Luis Magalhaes: Yes 😂
[2021-11-26T00:18:57] Happy Giraffe: That's quite DIY method even in my standards...but still better than in front. The metal box would need to be really thick and bolted with many m6 type bolts etc to survive if you hit it to something. Also making this all waterproof etc....
[2021-11-26T00:19:46] Luis Magalhaes: Hum another silly idea
[2021-11-26T00:21:07] Happy Giraffe: But the cables would interfere with battery if you dont put them through the side right?
[2021-11-26T00:21:20] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1596@26-11-2021_00-21-20.jpg>
[2021-11-26T00:21:34] Luis Magalhaes: If i cut a hole to put it up inside from the bottom of the deck? Cables sill go inside but the bottom of ubox would be outside
[2021-11-26T00:22:15] Luis Magalhaes: Yes if i use all space from battery
[2021-11-26T00:22:17] Happy Giraffe: Dont fully understand but doesnt sound good
[2021-11-26T00:22:47] Luis Magalhaes: But using the space i have for battery and maintaining the ubox in same place
[2021-11-26T00:23:16] Luis Magalhaes: I get it inside and bolt it from outside
[2021-11-26T00:23:20] Happy Giraffe: I would place it in back as footrest or in the middle below deck but then you would need it super strong and somehow waterproof it all and shield cables if bottom hits road curb etc
[2021-11-26T00:23:48] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1597@26-11-2021_00-23-48.jpg>
[2021-11-26T00:24:23] Luis Magalhaes: Shouldn't it cooler the case more then bolted inside?
[2021-11-26T00:26:10] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1598@26-11-2021_00-26-10.jpg>
[2021-11-26T00:27:41] Happy Giraffe: Having just ubox base have air contact should be worse than it bolted to frame
[2021-11-26T00:28:31] Happy Giraffe: And the possibility of your vesc hitting a rock/road curb would be insanity😅
[2021-11-26T00:28:45] Luis Magalhaes: Ok 😂😂
[2021-11-26T00:29:18] Luis Magalhaes: So you guys are saying "don't be stupid just bolt it inside with good paste" 😂😂
[2021-11-26T00:29:46] Luis Magalhaes: And i would have to get some fans like in the weeped 😂
[2021-11-26T00:29:47] Happy Giraffe: Or make a solid footrest box
[2021-11-26T00:30:25] Happy Giraffe: I think passive is enough as you see the frame is already like 15kg chunk of thermal mass being cooled by air constantly
[2021-11-26T00:31:06] Happy Giraffe: To heat up 15kg alu block is impossible with vesc box base
[2021-11-26T00:33:22] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1599@26-11-2021_00-33-22.jpg>
[2021-11-26T00:33:30] Luis Magalhaes: Here is the space for the ubox
[2021-11-26T00:35:00] Luis Magalhaes: Its fixes in 2 aluminium blocks that bolt directly in the deck, was what the minimotors used
[2021-11-26T00:35:35] Luis Magalhaes: At first was directly to the deck but it gets hotter then this way
[2021-11-26T00:35:59] Luis Magalhaes: No termal past in any of the first uses 😂
[2021-11-26T00:36:06] Happy Giraffe: With the size of ubox you could fit maybe 20 cells so maybe not worth it
[2021-11-26T00:36:14] Happy Giraffe: Well well well
[2021-11-26T00:36:45] Luis Magalhaes: I know 🤣 but why it cool better now?
[2021-11-26T00:37:25] Luis Magalhaes: Should the deck base not thick enough?
[2021-11-26T00:37:28] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2021-11-26T00:37:35] Happy Giraffe: As I told before, heat source must have best and most efficient route possible to the outside
[2021-11-26T00:37:58] Happy Giraffe: If you dont have flat surface and use thermal paste it will never work
[2021-11-26T00:39:09] Luis Magalhaes: Ok so why it cools more now? It should be better in the deck o think
[2021-11-26T00:39:42] Happy Giraffe: Weather outside cooler I guess
[2021-11-26T00:39:57] Happy Giraffe: On winter you have insane frame cooling
[2021-11-26T00:40:08] Luis Magalhaes: 😂 no i change it on summer
[2021-11-26T00:40:23] Luis Magalhaes: And see diference at change
[2021-11-26T00:40:48] Happy Giraffe: Whatever you do this is the way
[2021-11-26T00:41:01] Luis Magalhaes: Ok
[2021-11-26T00:41:24] Happy Giraffe: +thermal paste wants mounting pressure against frame or whatever you bolt it into
[2021-11-26T00:41:36] Luis Magalhaes: The other thin that helped a lot cooling is the 3mm opened front deck 😂
[2021-11-26T00:41:45] Happy Giraffe: ...
[2021-11-26T00:42:00] Luis Magalhaes: It looks the inside of the deck gets hotter too
[2021-11-26T00:42:15] Happy Giraffe: Dust and water no thanks
[2021-11-26T00:42:18] Luis Magalhaes: Not inicialy but it looks like it satured
[2021-11-26T00:42:39] Luis Magalhaes: Not in winter 😂😂
[2021-11-26T00:43:22] Happy Giraffe: Just bolt it to frame with paste and be done with it lol, we told you all you need
[2021-11-26T00:44:01] Luis Magalhaes: Ok
[2021-11-26T00:44:23] Luis Magalhaes: Im getting colder temps with open deck then the weeped i think 😂
[2021-11-26T00:45:30] Luis Magalhaes: But runing 75A batt and 190A fase values
[2021-11-26T00:46:18] Happy Giraffe: Only way to bolt in deck
[2021-11-26T00:46:34] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise you will never be able to cool it
[2021-11-26T00:47:15] Happy Giraffe: 190A per motor?
[2021-11-26T00:47:37] Luis Magalhaes: Yes that's understood 😂👍 will remove the thick aluminium thats under the ubox and bolt it directly to the frame with termal past and test 😁
[2021-11-26T00:48:04] Luis Magalhaes: Yes all per side
[2021-11-26T00:48:51] Happy Giraffe: Keep us updated how it goes
[2021-11-26T00:49:19] Luis Magalhaes: Im runing it like that for some weeks now 😂
[2021-11-26T00:49:34] Luis Magalhaes: Almost all days 32km +-
[2021-11-26T00:49:53] Luis Magalhaes: Dont go full throttle all time 😅
[2021-11-26T00:50:28] Happy Giraffe: Will be interesting to see how long you get max power with proper setup
[2021-11-26T00:50:50] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1600@26-11-2021_00-50-50.jpg>
[2021-11-26T00:51:13] Luis Magalhaes: Because of temperature?
[2021-11-26T00:52:23] Happy Giraffe: Obviously the thing will melt down without cooling if your max powers are maintained. Im not even sure how you are able to run 190A if others found it to struggle 130-140A
[2021-11-26T00:53:44] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-11-26T00:54:36] Luis Magalhaes: Im not going 10km at full trotlle but i can tell you i can do 10km at 60 70kmh and not hit the thermal cut temperature now
[2021-11-26T00:54:58] Luis Magalhaes: It hot summer i cant tell i was using other settings
[2021-11-26T00:56:04] Luis Magalhaes: I did not put the termal paste but had testing the way to cool down the controller, not the best way i know but it worked 😅
[2021-11-26T01:01:49] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2021-11-26T01:02:04] Luis Magalhaes: This is how it is runing 😅
[2021-11-26T01:03:32] Happy Giraffe: It wont overheat that quick because ubox case takes the burst of heat
[2021-11-26T01:03:38] Luis Magalhaes: It needs more amps in battery to do more 😂 its already drains my battery like that
[2021-11-26T01:04:24] Luis Magalhaes: Yes and if im not giving throtlle it cools fast
[2021-11-26T01:07:45] Luis Magalhaes: @Happy_Giraffe thanks for the pacience 😂 will try to log it, and bolt it to the deck and log it again i know it should run cooler with thermal past, will try to get it tomorrow 😁👍
[2021-11-26T01:09:16] Happy Giraffe: Flat surfaces against each other, thermal paste and good mounting pressure are your friends
[2021-11-26T01:09:34] Happy Giraffe: I bet it will be almost impossible to overheat then
[2021-11-26T01:09:59] Luis Magalhaes: One more ideia not to do some holes in the deck
[2021-11-26T01:10:28] Luis Magalhaes: I can bolt some aluminium plate to the existing holes and bolt the ubox to that plate
[2021-11-26T01:11:00] Luis Magalhaes: Should it be like 3 or 4mm good?
[2021-11-26T01:11:25] Luis Magalhaes: Thermal past in the plate and ubox case of course
[2021-11-26T01:11:30] Happy Giraffe: Yes and have thermal paste between that plate aswell, it will perform worse as its extra layer of heat transfer but yeah
[2021-11-26T01:11:56] Luis Magalhaes: Oh ok so should be better directly than
[2021-11-26T01:12:10] Luis Magalhaes: Was trying not to do more holes but fuck it
[2021-11-26T01:12:13] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2021-11-26T01:12:16] Happy Giraffe: As I told before, heat source must have best and most efficient route possible to the outside
[2021-11-26T01:12:53] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i was thinking that the extra aluminium plate would help dissipate it
[2021-11-26T01:13:20] Luis Magalhaes: Did you see the dualtron thunder the russians where making with ubox?
[2021-11-26T01:13:33] Luis Magalhaes: They use a aluminium plate in it
[2021-11-26T01:14:44] Luis Magalhaes: https://youtu.be/ZWkagSLqOp8
[2021-11-26T01:14:48] Luis Magalhaes: This one
[2021-11-26T01:15:12] Luis Magalhaes: But maybe it was all a block including the exterior part 😅
[2021-11-26T01:18:20] Luis Magalhaes: they said the controller was bolted in 2 aluminium plates so called radiators and with past
[2021-11-26T01:18:22] Luis Magalhaes: paste
[2021-11-26T01:24:13] Happy Giraffe: Thats against all laws of thermodynamics my friend
[2021-11-26T01:24:50] Happy Giraffe: Look at cpu coolers on PCs
[2021-11-26T01:25:44] Happy Giraffe: Direct contact
[2021-11-26T01:27:11] Happy Giraffe: Here you see the alu block is like your frame
[2021-11-26T01:27:20] Happy Giraffe: Shortest path, with some thermal mass
[2021-11-26T01:32:52] Luis Magalhaes: Ok 👌
[2021-11-26T01:33:19] Luis Magalhaes: Just asking this because i had seen it in this video
[2021-11-26T01:33:46] Luis Magalhaes: And dualtron thunder had that cooler in the deck originaly too but a lot smaller
[2021-11-26T01:34:42] Luis Magalhaes: Will try to test the ubox bolted soon 👍 thanks
[2021-11-26T01:35:14] Happy Giraffe: Should be a massive improvement
[2021-11-26T01:38:12] Luis Magalhaes: It would be good 😁
[2021-11-26T12:16:26] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1601@26-11-2021_12-16-26.jpg>

[2021-11-26T13:40:54] Luis Magalhaes: Its already on spintend site
[2021-11-26T13:47:26] Happy Giraffe: I checked Amazon deals with price history and noticed most"deals" are 30%-50% more expensive today
[2021-11-26T13:47:47] Happy Giraffe: That's retarded
[2021-11-26T13:48:25] Happy Giraffe: Imagine if it has solder balls inside and dies for the customers who paid 500 for it😂😂😂😂
[2021-11-26T13:48:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😏😏

[2021-11-26T16:38:58] Luis Magalhaes: @Happy_Giraffe did some logs now pushing it up hill and down hill to it max
[2021-11-26T16:39:14] Luis Magalhaes: Dont have exel home to get to the logs 😂
[2021-11-26T16:39:36] Luis Magalhaes: <files/2021-11-26_15-13-11.csv>
[2021-11-26T16:42:13] Face de Pin Sucé: Use Vesc Tool to get logs ;)
[2021-11-26T16:44:42] Luis Magalhaes: Ok will check that 😅
[2021-11-26T16:45:53] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>

[2021-11-26T17:30:59] Luis Magalhaes: Gps speed
[2021-11-26T17:31:00] Happy Giraffe: Was this with thermal paste?
[2021-11-26T17:31:22] Luis Magalhaes: Not yet mate, it will be the next test 👌
[2021-11-26T17:32:44] Happy Giraffe: Do the same run with paste
[2021-11-26T17:33:20] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i will do it, paste and bolted to deck directly
[2021-11-26T17:33:32] Happy Giraffe: Maybe stress them even more, now peaked 65°c about
[2021-11-26T17:36:01] Luis Magalhaes: The temperature keep rising if i continue at high speed for longer times, and in summer it gets hotter fast too
[2021-11-26T17:38:02] Luis Magalhaes: I did some runs there but when i stop accelerating it cools down fast, when i push it again it has low temperature again
[2021-11-26T17:39:22] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1605@26-11-2021_17-39-22.jpg>
[2021-11-26T17:39:30] Luis Magalhaes: My battery is in suffering 😂
[2021-11-26T17:39:49] Luis Magalhaes: This is the one on the deck that has a smart bms
[2021-11-26T17:40:17] Happy Giraffe: Test how much torture is needed for 80°c
[2021-11-26T17:40:20] Happy Giraffe: Then same with paste
[2021-11-26T17:41:55] Luis Magalhaes: For that i have to log a fast go to job trip 😂
[2021-11-26T17:42:13] Luis Magalhaes: Or a hot sunny day 😜
[2021-11-26T17:46:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-11-26T17:52:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Use speed GNSS it's more accurate x)
[2021-11-26T17:52:58] Luis Magalhaes: Whats the difference? 😁
[2021-11-26T17:53:42] Face de Pin Sucé: GPS speed x)
[2021-11-26T17:54:07] Luis Magalhaes: 😂 ok i think it was that but just confirming 🙈
[2021-11-26T17:54:46] Luis Magalhaes: So that way i dont need to log and use a gps app 😂😂
[2021-11-26T17:54:47] Luis Magalhaes: Nice

[2021-12-01T10:47:33] Unknown: True and nice
[2021-12-01T10:47:45] Mirono escooters: Rental and non rental cant compar but Top plate comes off no bottom plate Oil suspension in front (it's good) 10kg more steel. It's soo' fuckin sturdy Thiccer stem (next to Xiaomi it looks so much better. 2* as thic and big i think( No folding. Happy with it
[2021-12-01T10:47:52] Mirono escooters: Same Fender as g30 so suspension fits
[2021-12-01T10:47:55] Mirono escooters: Oh also dual brake

[2021-12-02T03:10:23] Artem Bulashev: Wired in 8 awg output on as150u😁
[2021-12-02T03:10:49] Artem Bulashev: And trimmed gps/4g module case to fit inside next to BMS 👌 will add some shielding from copper foil under it and on the sides (to reduce effects of high current from battery / BMS 👌)

[2021-12-02T03:12:18] Artem Bulashev: Plenty of space inside 🙂🙂 @koxx3 what are dimensions of smart controller ?
[2021-12-02T03:13:43] Artem Bulashev: Now need to buy silicon wire for charging port and wire it from BMS out and battery + to the other side of the battery (between cells even 14awg will fit without sticking out 😃)
[2021-12-02T08:44:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: something like 6 x 3.5 x 2cm
[2021-12-02T12:17:05] Artem Bulashev: Hm 😅😅😂😂 looks like it is going to fit inside battery

[2021-12-02T15:59:29] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-12-02T15:59:36] Artem Bulashev: It is - oxidizes
[2021-12-02T15:59:41] Artem Bulashev: Resistance increased
[2021-12-02T15:59:46] Artem Bulashev: Heat increased
[2021-12-02T16:00:18] Artem Bulashev: Which speeds up oxidation exponentially
[2021-12-02T17:34:10] Artem Bulashev: Guys look at this

[2021-12-02T18:23:27] sombre_enfant: April fool🤨
[2021-12-02T18:23:33] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-12-02T18:23:38] Mirono escooters: Maybe in april i can come
[2021-12-02T18:23:51] Artem Bulashev: You tried?
[2021-12-02T18:24:14] Mirono escooters: No. But looking at how little it lebers
[2021-12-02T18:24:15] Mirono escooters: Levers
[2021-12-02T18:24:55] Artem Bulashev: Should be better than any of the throttles on AliExpress / Xiaomi / zero triggers that all have huge dead band
[2021-12-02T18:25:17] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I’m not sure about travel
[2021-12-02T18:25:33] Artem Bulashev: At 50 pln no reason not to try 😅
[2021-12-02T18:26:09] Luis Magalhaes: I think it should be for thumb 👀
[2021-12-02T18:50:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: how much is it in euros ?
[2021-12-02T19:10:48] Unknown: 😎 it is beautiful. Best throttle I've ever found
[2021-12-02T19:13:11] Unknown: Usually can set endpoints in vesc tool (correct). In my Nucular setup I can set throttle curve and endpoints to adjust throw and how it engages. The throw seems just right to me, but that's a preference thing. There is zero dead band when setup properly.
[2021-12-02T19:13:52] Unknown: Adjustable endpoints but these were the auto calibration values for that throttle
[2021-12-02T19:14:42] Unknown: .96v to 4.31v with auto calibration. But can adjust so 3/4 throttle is 100% pwm (or whatever you want) I believe VESC has this ability as well
[2021-12-02T19:15:48] Unknown: Also not sure about ubox 3.3v vs 5v throttle uart (?)... But you guys know more about that than me
[2021-12-02T19:16:23] Unknown: Throttle is cheap. Shipping is not
[2021-12-02T19:33:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😁

[2021-12-02T20:36:12] Mirono escooters: The beeper sound goes up with input v
[2021-12-02T20:36:20] Mirono escooters: 12v is mjeh 52v (13s) NOOOOT
[2021-12-02T20:36:28] Mirono escooters: And im going 16s 😉
[2021-12-02T20:37:01] Artem Bulashev: Like 10€
[2021-12-02T21:06:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-12-02T21:11:52] Unknown: It's worth trying. I would order a trigger and thumb and test to see what you like. As I mentioned, very nice units and very sleek. Sure beats those ugly bulky plastic thumb throttles from AliExpress
[2021-12-02T21:15:51] Unknown: 😂😂
[2021-12-02T22:45:37] Face de Pin Sucé: I hope !

[2021-12-03T20:39:35] ST VO: Yes, original design of the tits buttons is amazing but the price is not and because of that, this aftermarket grips are more orthopedic to the hands and will do the job.🤣

[2021-12-04T18:26:22] Unknown: Glad you're trying it. I believe you will like it and definitely will not have a problem reselling if you don't. I'm really happy with mine and glad I found them. Their listing was originally posted on the endless sphere online marketplace. Just be sure to know the pin out on the throttle order, which color wire coordinates with which Higo pin on the 3 pin connector. Let me know how you like it (or hate it 😉)

[2021-12-05T19:17:52] Artem Bulashev: BMS is freakin great! Connected in 2 sec, can enable and disable charging/ discharging/balancing manually in settings. Comes with charge and discharge OFF - so that if you fuck up wiring you won’t kill it 😄
[2021-12-05T19:18:44] Artem Bulashev: Time to figure gps and 4g module connection 👌

[2021-12-05T19:49:14] Artem Bulashev: There is 8p in same size/case = 80a (150a max)

[2021-12-05T20:06:22] Mirono escooters: Omg wow resistance
[2021-12-05T20:09:44] Artem Bulashev: That’s is not cell resistance it is resistance incl long balancing lead and restore in line on balancing circuit
[2021-12-05T20:10:13] Artem Bulashev: That’s why it is called “cell wire resistance”

[2021-12-06T11:28:11] Happy Giraffe: If it's only one rectangle deck coming on top of that, then its easy silicone sealing
[2021-12-06T11:28:20] Happy Giraffe: Also easier to clean off
[2021-12-06T11:28:22] Mirono escooters: Yes but not easy opening
[2021-12-06T11:28:48] Happy Giraffe: Ive done it 4 times, its not hard at all. I use car motor sealant
[2021-12-06T11:29:04] Mirono escooters: You can just pru it open?
[2021-12-06T11:29:08] Mirono escooters: Plexiglas? 🤣
[2021-12-06T11:30:47] Happy Giraffe: Yes, using two fingers. Not hard at all
[2021-12-06T11:31:00] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-12-06T11:31:01] Mirono escooters: Thanks!
[2021-12-06T11:31:18] Mirono escooters: I can make electronics waterpfoof but rather no sea in scooger
[2021-12-06T11:36:55] Happy Giraffe: For me I tried little of both, Spintend single is hanging from top so even little water wouldn't get in, same with battery

[2021-12-07T12:04:23] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1633@07-12-2021_12-04-23.jpg>
[2021-12-07T12:05:42] Mirono escooters: It's beta lol im rebuilding it
[2021-12-07T12:05:43] Artem Bulashev: 1. Discharges cells un equally in each p assembly so they have to equalize between them self all the time. 2. Whole current flows through single 8mm strip of nickel, it will get real hot there
[2021-12-07T12:05:54] Mirono escooters: Thic
[2021-12-07T12:06:11] Mirono escooters: It's 2 layers and im adding Copper : D
[2021-12-07T12:07:03] Artem Bulashev: Re build it this way
[2021-12-07T12:07:20] Mirono escooters: How would you fix problem 1? I don't understand it fully
[2021-12-07T12:07:40] Mirono escooters: To 20s 🙈🙈
[2021-12-07T12:08:57] Artem Bulashev: and use sheets not strips if need high amps
[2021-12-07T12:09:10] Artem Bulashev: Not same ?
[2021-12-07T12:09:43] Mirono escooters: It's 5p? Xd
[2021-12-07T12:09:56] Mirono escooters: 40A
[2021-12-07T12:09:59] Artem Bulashev: This is 3p
[2021-12-07T12:10:09] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2021-12-07T12:10:12] Mirono escooters: 5
[2021-12-07T12:10:15] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok
[2021-12-07T12:10:17] Mirono escooters: 25ah 21700
[2021-12-07T12:10:38] Mirono escooters: Hard to see i guess
[2021-12-07T12:10:40] Artem Bulashev: Emm
[2021-12-07T12:11:00] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1635@07-12-2021_12-11-00.jpg>
[2021-12-07T12:11:51] Mirono escooters: Look next tocit
[2021-12-07T12:11:52] Mirono escooters: ')
[2021-12-07T12:13:04] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2021-12-07T12:13:09] Artem Bulashev: That’s terrifying
[2021-12-07T12:13:12] Artem Bulashev: 😄😃
[2021-12-07T12:13:28] Artem Bulashev: Sag was not terrible ?
[2021-12-07T12:14:00] Artem Bulashev: Why didn’t you just do them in the row ?
[2021-12-07T12:14:24] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1636@07-12-2021_12-14-24.jpg>
[2021-12-07T12:14:48] Artem Bulashev: That would be easier to assemble and a lot more contract between series - no copper needed
[2021-12-07T12:21:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: is 'shaman' design it ? it seems really similar to cheap foccer a d little foccer architecture
[2021-12-07T12:22:43] Mirono escooters: It was very oki
[2021-12-07T12:22:51] Mirono escooters: Only 35A for 0.2mm 10mm nickel
[2021-12-07T12:23:21] Mirono escooters: This was easier to build 🌚
[2021-12-07T12:23:31] Mirono escooters: Im rebuilding anyways doesnt matter
[2021-12-07T12:23:39] Mirono escooters: Haha yea i see that now
[2021-12-07T12:23:45] Mirono escooters: Guess i gotta get those strips
[2021-12-07T12:24:26] Artem Bulashev: 👌😊
[2021-12-07T12:24:44] Mirono escooters: 13s no good on low kv
[2021-12-07T12:24:48] Mirono escooters: Let's go 20s flipsky lmao
[2021-12-07T12:28:07] Artem Bulashev: Here is the chart I use
[2021-12-07T12:29:09] Artem Bulashev: 0.4 X 10mm is good for 15 amps nominal
[2021-12-07T12:29:13] Artem Bulashev: 🔥🔥🔥
[2021-12-07T12:29:58] Artem Bulashev: 0.4 because you said you had 2 layers of 0.2 I presume :)
[2021-12-07T12:31:31] Artem Bulashev: Most of honeycomb strips are 8mm so get 0.25mm thick and you will have 5 of those
[2021-12-07T12:32:48] Artem Bulashev: 7.9*5 = 39.5a rated if they are 8mm wide 👌 or get 0.3mm for extra 7.5a rating
[2021-12-07T12:34:45] Mirono escooters: Yes correct
[2021-12-07T12:34:53] Mirono escooters: Im at 500w continuous 35a peak
[2021-12-07T12:34:57] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-12-07T12:43:58] sombre_enfant: If its sheet its enough ? No need 4mm?
[2021-12-07T13:00:23] Artem Bulashev: Checked most of tilted nickel belts (for honeycomb) are 7mm wide and 0.15mm or 0.20mm thick
[2021-12-07T13:06:14] Artem Bulashev: Single layer 7mm * 0.2mm = 5.7a 5 strips between series =28.5a total (still twice better than your current set up) Or can do dual 0.15mm * 5 strips between series = 21.5a*2=43a rated 😊 no sag no heat
[2021-12-07T13:06:38] Mirono escooters: Will do second thing 🙂
[2021-12-07T13:06:48] Mirono escooters: 20s needs powa
[2021-12-07T13:28:58] Artem Bulashev: Good choice
[2021-12-07T13:28:59] Artem Bulashev: 👌😊
[2021-12-07T14:42:25] Mirono escooters: Thanks for Help! Good diagram
[2021-12-07T14:44:37] Artem Bulashev: Happy to help
[2021-12-07T14:51:03] Liam: Would it be a bad idea to use wd40 to help get the tire of the hub 🤔
[2021-12-07T14:51:06] Liam: I got a flat
[2021-12-07T14:51:27] Artem Bulashev: Use soap
[2021-12-07T14:51:28] Unknown: Baby Powder
[2021-12-07T14:51:58] Artem Bulashev: Or that / talc yeah, but it may be harder to get it under already seated tire
[2021-12-07T15:05:28] Liam: Thanks guys, used a bit of washing up liquid.
[2021-12-07T15:05:34] Liam: Seems to do the job.
[2021-12-07T15:16:08] Artem Bulashev: 🤝🤝
[2021-12-07T16:17:53] Happy Giraffe: And then some baby powder on the tube as its fixed/changed
[2021-12-07T17:21:43] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌 yeah I wonder how close talc and baby powder in effectiveness
[2021-12-07T17:49:12] Unknown: Baby powder = talc (talcum powder) 😎 ... At least in USA, not sure how EU baby powder is made 🤪. Baby powder brands I'm sure can also include different fillers and compositions but essentially they are the same
[2021-12-07T18:03:01] Artem Bulashev: Oh I thought it is more complex 😅
[2021-12-07T18:03:49] Mirono escooters: From babies
[2021-12-07T18:03:53] Artem Bulashev: I remember some one from US telling me online that “don’t use talc it causes cancer, we in US know it”
[2021-12-07T18:03:59] Artem Bulashev: No idea why 🤣
[2021-12-07T18:04:04] Artem Bulashev: Than he slipped
[2021-12-07T18:04:09] Unknown: By the way Johnson and Johnson declare broke in USA because of baby powder
[2021-12-07T18:04:23] Artem Bulashev: He was like Lung cancer - if you inhale it 🤣
[2021-12-07T18:04:27] Unknown: It's true
[2021-12-07T18:04:48] Artem Bulashev: Who would inhale talc? 😄
[2021-12-07T18:05:05] Unknown: Babys???
[2021-12-07T18:05:12] Artem Bulashev: It’s on their ass
[2021-12-07T18:05:18] Artem Bulashev: I never used it 🤷‍♂️
[2021-12-07T18:05:24] Mirono escooters: I dont do weed i do baby powder
[2021-12-07T18:06:10] Unknown: Here my Wikipedia friend https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/
[2021-12-07T18:06:32] Artem Bulashev: My kid did well without it, just was a matter of finding suitable diapers
[2021-12-07T18:06:43] Mirono escooters: And we trust Em with vaccines
[2021-12-07T18:07:00] Artem Bulashev: Sure
[2021-12-07T18:07:15] Artem Bulashev: But again who would inhale it for tube change 😃
[2021-12-07T18:07:18] Mirono escooters: Same with 3M they knew for yeeaars they we're dumping bad things in the ground.. They didnt do anything bout it bcs. Why would they Fuckers
[2021-12-07T18:07:42] Artem Bulashev: Because it is what that person replied to 😃
[2021-12-07T18:07:53] Unknown: Before I shoot Johnson i shoot myself with the horse stuff, luckily vaccinated with good German shite
[2021-12-07T18:08:16] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2021-12-07T18:09:20] Artem Bulashev: Here it clearly states that it is not talc
[2021-12-07T18:09:23] Artem Bulashev: But carcinogenic asbestos
[2021-12-07T18:09:39] Artem Bulashev: Which was found some times in talc they used
[2021-12-07T18:09:49] Unknown: Burnnnnnn
[2021-12-07T18:10:23] Artem Bulashev: So it is not correct to say all talc is bad even, let alone adult should be able to hold his breath and not inhale it for few seconds 😉😉😄
[2021-12-07T18:10:35] Artem Bulashev: Winter edition 😂👌👌
[2021-12-07T18:57:26] Mirono escooters: 500$ for ubox wattafok

[2021-12-07T19:46:24] Mirono escooters: I consider hydro but first it needs to RIDE
[2021-12-07T19:46:46] Happy Giraffe: Ebrake is nice but when your life is dependant on it I would have a backup
[2021-12-07T19:47:07] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-12-07T19:47:09] Mirono escooters: Defenitely

[2021-12-08T01:44:13] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1654@08-12-2021_01-44-13.jpg>
[2021-12-08T01:44:23] Artem Bulashev: In case some one wants 52v battery ;-)
[2021-12-08T01:44:28] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1655@08-12-2021_01-44-28.jpg>
[2021-12-08T01:47:49] Artem Bulashev: I’m now 70% complete finally! - finished 60v28ah battery installation just now😍😍✅ - first test sample of spacer is made and installed today✅ - rewriting for new battery ✅ - ubox installed✅ - AWD installed ✅ - 500w and no engraving motor covers installed ✅ - motor temp sensor added ✅ Ahh that feels good :)) - need to make final spacer from transparent plexiglas - get and install all the smart controller goodies and lights 😁@koxx3
[2021-12-08T01:48:12] Artem Bulashev: Btw @koxx3 forgot to give you tracking number, will send tracking tomorrow
[2021-12-08T01:58:54] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2021-12-08T01:59:37] Luis Magalhaes: its a good looking scooter the vsett
[2021-12-08T02:24:18] Artem Bulashev: Thanks man yeah not too shabby 😁 Getting fat though haha, added like 5kg in 6 month - scooter not me, I lost 2 😂
[2021-12-08T02:27:56] Luis Magalhaes: its for a good cause 🤣🤣
[2021-12-08T02:58:06] Artem Bulashev: You think 650w nominal - 1100w max motors can handle 30 amps battery and 100amps phase per motor? 😄
[2021-12-08T03:12:29] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-12-08T03:13:13] Luis Magalhaes: I only have the experience of mine, 1200W runing 70A 170A limits 😂
[2021-12-08T03:16:18] Artem Bulashev: Well
[2021-12-08T03:16:38] Artem Bulashev: 1200w nominal right? So like 2400w max?
[2021-12-08T03:16:53] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i think its nominal
[2021-12-08T03:17:40] Artem Bulashev: That’s about 2 times more so mine should be able to do 30amps battery and 85a phase for sure
[2021-12-08T03:17:43] Luis Magalhaes: You have temperature sensors in motor dont you?
[2021-12-08T03:17:48] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-12-08T03:17:51] Artem Bulashev: In rear
[2021-12-08T03:18:24] Luis Magalhaes: I think they can, with the temperature sensor you can see if they are over heating too
[2021-12-08T03:18:37] Artem Bulashev: But it was barely warm when it got to 90c on windings, so not sure what’s up - stock controller let it run a lot hotter
[2021-12-08T03:18:40] Luis Magalhaes: I use the hand sensor 😂
[2021-12-08T03:18:54] Artem Bulashev: Yeah stock controller only had hand sensor :))
[2021-12-08T03:19:31] Luis Magalhaes: My minimotors setup get the motor lot hotter then my setup with ubox
[2021-12-08T03:19:49] Luis Magalhaes: Maybe because of square wave
[2021-12-08T04:20:20] Artem Bulashev: Oh yes it does a magnitude hotter
[2021-12-08T07:47:27] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2021-12-08T09:42:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Really nice this spacer battery, how many centimeters ?
[2021-12-08T10:24:31] Artem Bulashev: 155mm х 400mm
[2021-12-08T10:30:41] Artem Bulashev: But original hight was only about 48mm (51mm technically but foot plate has some ribs to make it stronger) But it’s nice that deck opens on top, make it super mod friendly
[2021-12-08T10:33:20] Face de Pin Sucé: So, what battery did you put in it ?
[2021-12-08T11:21:19] Artem Bulashev: Hence Samsung 35e (new cells) 28ah 60v 16s8p Those cells because they are the best 18650 up to 7amps = 56amp But they deliver a lot of wh even at 10amps. (One of top 3 cells that deliver the most wh) My draw won’t ever be above 60a 👌 that’s why I chose that cell
[2021-12-08T11:23:20] Face de Pin Sucé: That's nice
[2021-12-08T11:24:46] Mirono escooters: Yall got sum money
[2021-12-08T11:27:16] Artem Bulashev: Battery cost me 600€ total
[2021-12-08T11:27:24] Artem Bulashev: Because I made my self
[2021-12-08T11:36:50] Unknown: Dang i paid like 300 for my 12s4p's cells
[2021-12-08T11:37:04] Unknown: 16.8 ah
[2021-12-08T11:51:49] Artem Bulashev: Text me next time if in eu 😊
[2021-12-08T11:52:49] Mirono escooters: Molicel tho
[2021-12-08T12:16:14] Artem Bulashev: 👌 can get those too for about same price
[2021-12-08T12:16:24] Artem Bulashev: 50g for example 4€
[2021-12-08T12:16:26] Mirono escooters: Oo
[2021-12-08T12:24:52] Unknown: True 😂
[2021-12-08T12:25:23] Unknown: Nicee, will do 😂 i'll need about 72 more in a few months
[2021-12-08T13:01:44] sombre_enfant: Do you got any deal better than nkon on 40t?
[2021-12-08T15:17:42] Artem Bulashev: In another group I just compared 40t to P42a
[2021-12-08T15:18:13] Artem Bulashev: P42a wins at 20 and 30a discharge - delivers more Wh down to 3v level
[2021-12-08T15:19:17] Artem Bulashev: There is no reason to get 40t AT ALL
[2021-12-08T15:19:30] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1656@08-12-2021_15-19-30.jpg>
[2021-12-08T15:20:18] Artem Bulashev: If you need a cell that will often be above 15amp get p42a - up to 30a
[2021-12-08T15:20:54] Artem Bulashev: If you need cell that most often will be 7-10a and max at 15a long term get 50g.
[2021-12-08T15:21:10] Artem Bulashev: 40t is inferior in all accounts to p42a
[2021-12-08T15:23:13] Artem Bulashev: The only cell that beats 50g and made for 15a continues instead of 10a and 20a max long term vs 15a long term in 50g, is Samsung 50s (Vapecell t50) But it const 2 times more than 50g so diminishing returns (It delivers as much as P42a at 30amps even getting to same temp cut off, so it will be better at 20a as well)
[2021-12-08T15:24:33] Artem Bulashev: I can get most cells for 4€-4.5€ which is better than nkon
[2021-12-08T15:33:42] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-12-08T16:37:29] Unknown: Hm are molicels p42a? I paid like 5.95 or 5.75 at nkon can't recall
[2021-12-08T16:38:38] Artem Bulashev: Will check
[2021-12-08T16:39:29] Unknown: Ty 😁
[2021-12-08T17:08:25] Artem Bulashev: He doesn’t have those at the moment
[2021-12-08T17:08:54] Artem Bulashev: But as example 30t cost 2.50euro
[2021-12-08T17:09:23] Artem Bulashev: 50g 4€
[2021-12-08T17:09:36] Artem Bulashev: Less if a lot taken
[2021-12-08T17:10:00] Mirono escooters: Daamn
[2021-12-08T17:10:05] Mirono escooters: 👀
[2021-12-08T17:10:07] Artem Bulashev: 35e 3.4€
[2021-12-08T17:10:13] Artem Bulashev: Just examples
[2021-12-08T17:10:18] Artem Bulashev: 😁🤓
[2021-12-08T17:12:21] Luis Magalhaes: Nice prices, but then to send would be a lot of problems or not?

[2021-12-08T18:20:25] Luis Magalhaes: not yet 😂 no time to get the paste and disasemble the ubox
[2021-12-08T18:20:30] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1658@08-12-2021_18-20-30.jpg>
[2021-12-08T18:20:38] Luis Magalhaes: but will do it soon 😂
[2021-12-08T18:20:55] Unknown: 👌😂😂 know that feeling of "doing it soon"
[2021-12-08T18:21:00] Happy Giraffe: I mean you just need to tilt it a bit, no need to get all cables out
[2021-12-08T18:21:12] Happy Giraffe: Same with my BT module, too lazy to install
[2021-12-08T18:21:20] Unknown: 😂😂
[2021-12-08T18:22:00] Luis Magalhaes: have to remove the battery to have acess and remove the two blocks of aluminium i have under the ubox
[2021-12-08T18:22:16] Luis Magalhaes: and bolt it down after the paste
[2021-12-08T18:24:28] Happy Giraffe: Oof
[2021-12-08T21:26:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Price for refurbish is some reason sometimes x)
[2021-12-08T21:27:26] Face de Pin Sucé: 30T is damn great
[2021-12-08T21:27:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Me, why?

[2021-12-08T22:55:18] Artem Bulashev: Voltage spiking to over 72v from 65v
[2021-12-08T22:55:34] Artem Bulashev: Even if -1a of regen is used
[2021-12-08T22:55:49] Artem Bulashev: And over voltage protection
[2021-12-08T22:58:00] Artem Bulashev: Than I figured that vesc gets that voltage spike registrars but multi meter and battery bms do not show anything. And after 1h figured it out. That smart BMS has ability to disable charging while keeping discharging active (even though it is common port!) My charging setting was disabled so bms refused to accept current that would start to flow back into it😅😅 All seems good now no more crazy voltage spikes
[2021-12-08T22:58:29] Mirono escooters: O that's a cool setting
[2021-12-08T22:59:03] Mirono escooters: It's cool vesc does't die when the bms shuts off while regen
[2021-12-08T22:59:09] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi does
[2021-12-08T23:12:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Inwas going to tell you that x)
[2021-12-08T23:37:12] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-12-08T23:37:16] Luis Magalhaes: lucky one
[2021-12-09T00:56:45] Artem Bulashev: It doesn’t kill vesc becuse it keeps 5v low current going - logic doesn’t shut off just goes from over voltage to under voltage protection (sleep mode until on charger)
[2021-12-09T00:57:04] Artem Bulashev: Love that BMS :)
[2021-12-09T00:57:17] Artem Bulashev: And man that thing flies
[2021-12-09T00:57:33] Artem Bulashev: 50kmh in like 50m under ground garage
[2021-12-09T00:59:24] Artem Bulashev: Front wheel spins through even at 25-30kmh if not loaded well 😄😄 and that is only 85amps phase and 27a battery ahah Motors are made for torque and not speed lol. But since they are 48-52v, my top speed now is around 65kmh 😄😄😄
[2021-12-09T01:12:41] Artem Bulashev: 20kmh in 2 sec 30kmh in 3 sec 32kmh in 3.05sec (20mph) 40.3kmh in 4.05 sec (25mph) 46kmh in 5sec 48.28kmh in 5.3 sec (30mph) 50kmh in 5.5 sec (31mph) 80m long Garage finished, not top speed tested yet ONLY 3.6v sag 😍😍 Settings - 27amp battery both motors - 80amp phase rear (because it staters with higher, needs tunning to be used with more phase amps) - 85amp phase front Those two 650w motors are nuts in terms of Torque! No wonder vsett9+ amazes so many reviewers about power that 25kg scooter has (even for its 48v, I just get 46% more hehe due to voltage and amp increase)
[2021-12-09T01:18:02] Artem Bulashev: 😍😍😍
[2021-12-09T06:54:36] Luis Magalhaes: 💪
[2021-12-09T07:46:38] Mirono escooters: Sick! Love low kv motors
[2021-12-09T11:55:45] Unknown: I prefer speed over acceleration 😂 there's just a golden spot where you just nearly start spinning, and still have some high speeds
[2021-12-09T11:55:54] Mirono escooters: I prefer accel over speed
[2021-12-09T11:55:56] Mirono escooters: XD
[2021-12-09T11:56:01] Mirono escooters: Low kv and 20s Yes
[2021-12-09T11:56:40] Unknown: Still gonna get some badass speeds with that 20s voltage though 😂
[2021-12-09T11:56:51] Mirono escooters: Hahaha defenitely and wheelie torque
[2021-12-09T11:57:50] Unknown: True, but i don't trust xiaomi pole for the hit to the ground after doing a wheelie 😂
[2021-12-09T11:59:08] Mirono escooters: Rental 😄
[2021-12-09T12:01:19] Unknown: Yeah i know 😒 mine aint. 😔🤣
[2021-12-09T12:01:30] Mirono escooters: Poor u
[2021-12-09T12:01:34] Mirono escooters: 🙈🤣
[2021-12-09T12:01:46] Unknown: Yeah. Fy bro 🤣🤣
[2021-12-09T12:02:45] Unknown: Before i forget, did you also print that one sidepiece for my scoot? 😂 and is batt nearly done or not yet, just so i know haha my nephew was wondering for when to come get it 😆
[2021-12-09T13:02:23] Mirono escooters: Soon :) this weekend
[2021-12-09T14:04:58] Artem Bulashev: I’m right there haha front wheel 80a Almost spins through even at 15kmh. If I set it at 85a phase it spins through at 25kmh, not safe if not careful in turns. 🤓
[2021-12-09T14:06:14] Artem Bulashev: Rear wheel needs tunning it statters above 80a for some reason
[2021-12-09T14:07:52] Face de Pin Sucé: We don't live in the same world x)
[2021-12-09T14:16:02] Artem Bulashev: Sent wiring brother ✅
[2021-12-09T14:16:27] Artem Bulashev: Oh meant to private @koxx3
[2021-12-09T14:17:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeahhh !
[2021-12-09T14:17:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I am costing custom wires (for VESC & smart) china. not so easy to specify 😅
[2021-12-09T14:44:08] Artem Bulashev: Check it out, compared my speed run vs tested vsett10+ https://electric-scooter.guide/comparisons/compare-electric-scooters/
[2021-12-09T14:44:08] Artem Bulashev: Wow, unexpected.
[2021-12-09T14:45:29] Artem Bulashev: Foc
[2021-12-09T14:45:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: which driver weight ?
[2021-12-09T14:45:57] Artem Bulashev: Not sure
[2021-12-09T14:46:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and which app to measure.
[2021-12-09T14:46:05] Artem Bulashev: But we do know that foc is slower at first
[2021-12-09T14:46:11] Artem Bulashev: But faster after like 15kmh
[2021-12-09T14:46:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: GPS are bad to measure such precise timing. you need a "draggy"
[2021-12-09T14:46:30] Mirono escooters: I just feel wind and know I go fast
[2021-12-09T14:46:34] Mirono escooters: Physics 100
[2021-12-09T14:46:36] Artem Bulashev: They used Racelogic - pro tool to measure acceleration via percision gps Mine is actual speed from the rear wheel that is calibrated down to be exact and pressure checked
[2021-12-09T14:46:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Il faut un draggy
[2021-12-09T14:48:11] Artem Bulashev: I think actually this is operation of foc controller
[2021-12-09T14:48:27] Artem Bulashev: Because square wave controllers have no limit on phase
[2021-12-09T14:48:46] Artem Bulashev: So it can shoot though 150-200a for a moment = punch to start you off
[2021-12-09T14:49:29] Mirono escooters: That's y mine scoots away immediately with aftermarket Really dangerous if not used to it
[2021-12-09T14:49:57] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-12-09T14:50:11] Artem Bulashev: Mine starts fast but no punch
[2021-12-09T14:50:14] Artem Bulashev: But
[2021-12-09T14:50:30] Mirono escooters: Mine punch. Its really weird. When friends ride i put on eco l9l
[2021-12-09T14:50:35] Artem Bulashev: When you get to 10kmh you strat to feel pressure on your hands increasing exponentially
[2021-12-09T14:50:48] Artem Bulashev: What if your set up?
[2021-12-09T14:50:55] Artem Bulashev: Xiaomi ?
[2021-12-09T14:50:58] Mirono escooters: 15s awd 40A
[2021-12-09T14:50:59] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-12-09T14:51:04] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-12-09T14:51:08] Artem Bulashev: Yeah squarewave
[2021-12-09T14:51:15] Mirono escooters: Aftermarket controllers
[2021-12-09T14:51:21] Artem Bulashev: They are so loud compare to Vesc
[2021-12-09T14:51:23] Mirono escooters: 80€ for 2 with dash lmao
[2021-12-09T14:51:23] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁
[2021-12-09T14:51:26] Mirono escooters: Havavah yesssss
[2021-12-09T14:51:35] Mirono escooters: My vesc is silent af These Njieuw f1
[2021-12-09T14:51:40] Mirono escooters: I dont mind
[2021-12-09T14:51:43] Mirono escooters: It sounds funny
[2021-12-09T14:51:50] Mirono escooters: For the price cant complain
[2021-12-09T14:51:53] Artem Bulashev: Mine is basically silent and than stock m365 passes by like a diesel car in compare lol
[2021-12-09T14:51:59] Artem Bulashev: Absolutely
[2021-12-09T14:52:04] Mirono escooters: Just the start sucks u can't program it. I had to get used to it
[2021-12-09T14:52:10] Mirono escooters: I was scared of it for a while lmao
[2021-12-09T14:52:16] Mirono escooters: Relatable
[2021-12-09T14:52:40] Mirono escooters: I wish I could get dual ubox but the price of it was price 2 motors Suspension Battery And these aftermarket controllers lol
[2021-12-09T14:52:46] Mirono escooters: Soo yeaaa had to budget out
[2021-12-09T14:52:55] Artem Bulashev: Yesterday I got scared when accelerated it he turn and front wheel started spinning through at 25kmh 😆
[2021-12-09T14:53:00] Mirono escooters: These are good enough for the scoot lol. As long ad it rides
[2021-12-09T14:53:05] Artem Bulashev: It was at 95a
[2021-12-09T14:53:06] Mirono escooters: Oh thats scary
[2021-12-09T14:53:14] Mirono escooters: Awd?
[2021-12-09T14:53:20] Artem Bulashev: Each
[2021-12-09T14:53:23] Mirono escooters: 120a flipsky go brrr Luckily rwd
[2021-12-09T14:53:42] Artem Bulashev: To much for me
[2021-12-09T14:53:55] Mirono escooters: When is too much?
[2021-12-09T14:54:08] Artem Bulashev: Settles for 80a front and rear and 27a
[2021-12-09T14:54:33] Artem Bulashev: Will try to push rear to 90a though will see
[2021-12-09T14:54:37] Mirono escooters: Awd different story ofcourse then rwd
[2021-12-09T14:54:43] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-12-09T14:54:44] Mirono escooters: Rear can be higher amps
[2021-12-09T14:55:04] Mirono escooters: Oh i loved 150a flipsky vesc If i didnt lean forward i wheelie And smolth
[2021-12-09T14:55:11] Mirono escooters: Motor barely warm
[2021-12-09T14:55:14] Artem Bulashev: I can’t get good tune on rear motor for some reason.
[2021-12-09T14:55:37] Mirono escooters: Maybe something faulty?
[2021-12-09T14:55:45] Artem Bulashev: Front is ok even with 95a no statoring
[2021-12-09T14:55:50] Mirono escooters: How u tune it i just use stock lmao
[2021-12-09T14:56:08] Artem Bulashev: What motor?
[2021-12-09T14:56:15] Mirono escooters: Flj 1200w
[2021-12-09T14:56:17] Mirono escooters: Low kv
[2021-12-09T14:56:19] Artem Bulashev: :))
[2021-12-09T14:56:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 80A phase only ????
[2021-12-09T14:56:24] Artem Bulashev: Mine is 650w
[2021-12-09T14:56:34] Artem Bulashev: Man it spins through already
[2021-12-09T14:56:36] Artem Bulashev: :))
[2021-12-09T14:56:37] Mirono escooters: Do they get warm?
[2021-12-09T14:56:40] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-12-09T14:56:58] Artem Bulashev: High torque small dia - it is 8.5 inch
[2021-12-09T14:57:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: forget about those datas, use your hand to check if it's hot (or place a sensor) ;)
[2021-12-09T14:57:05] Mirono escooters: Ohhh
[2021-12-09T14:57:11] Mirono escooters: Hand gang
[2021-12-09T14:57:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Puuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuush iiiiiiiiiiiiîiiiiiiiiiiiiit
[2021-12-09T14:57:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Throw some fucking AAAAAAMPS into it
[2021-12-09T14:57:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: put 130A phase on each motor (and 160A abs max).
[2021-12-09T14:57:29] Artem Bulashev: I have sensor 👌
[2021-12-09T14:57:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-12-09T14:57:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: temperature sensor ?
[2021-12-09T14:57:47] Face de Pin Sucé: We want you to burn tyres every fucking day
[2021-12-09T14:57:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2021-12-09T14:57:56] Artem Bulashev: I added NTC100k
[2021-12-09T14:58:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: then go for it ! PUSH IT ! you have literaly no risk ! :D
[2021-12-09T14:58:24] Artem Bulashev: It looses sync
[2021-12-09T14:58:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ???
[2021-12-09T14:58:30] Artem Bulashev: At above 85a
[2021-12-09T14:58:32] Artem Bulashev: Rear
[2021-12-09T14:58:36] Artem Bulashev: Front is fine
[2021-12-09T14:58:42] Artem Bulashev: Tested 95a
[2021-12-09T14:58:43] Face de Pin Sucé: What do you mean ?
[2021-12-09T14:58:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what do you mean by 'loose sync' ?
[2021-12-09T14:58:58] Artem Bulashev: It stators does like Drr dr drr
[2021-12-09T14:59:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: wtf ... last time I had such issue, I had a dead mosfet 😅
[2021-12-09T14:59:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Verify your motor connections
[2021-12-09T14:59:49] Face de Pin Sucé: And also your mos
[2021-12-09T14:59:53] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah x)
[2021-12-09T14:59:56] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-12-09T15:00:01] Artem Bulashev: May be ubox defect
[2021-12-09T15:00:11] Artem Bulashev: I had front motor on rear before
[2021-12-09T15:00:13] Artem Bulashev: Did same
[2021-12-09T15:00:24] Artem Bulashev: Now on front it doesn’t
[2021-12-09T15:00:30] Artem Bulashev: Will loo into it
[2021-12-09T15:00:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: even the single core spintend, I pushed it to 120A phase with a 500W minimo motor
[2021-12-09T15:00:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't look further x)
[2021-12-09T15:00:42] Face de Pin Sucé: You got a dead mos x)
[2021-12-09T15:01:13] Mirono escooters: Shit u made him angry
[2021-12-09T15:01:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: crap ...
[2021-12-09T15:01:33] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂 I heard 80A phase x)
[2021-12-09T15:01:53] Mirono escooters: Maybe ded sensors?
[2021-12-09T15:01:53] Face de Pin Sucé: Even on my speedway Leger I putted 160A phase and 55A batt on one motor
[2021-12-09T15:02:03] Mirono escooters: Horror
[2021-12-09T15:02:08] Mirono escooters: Why get ubox for 80a
[2021-12-09T15:02:30] Mirono escooters: How can it work until xA Then die above that valu?
[2021-12-09T15:02:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Can't explain but already saw it
[2021-12-09T15:02:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Works with few amps and then go crazy
[2021-12-09T15:03:00] Mirono escooters: Me gonna do same w flipsk6
[2021-12-09T15:03:03] Artem Bulashev: Lol ok it was so from day one
[2021-12-09T15:03:18] Mirono escooters: Like my flipsky but a reset fixed it. Lol
[2021-12-09T15:03:18] Face de Pin Sucé: 😁😁😋🥰
[2021-12-09T15:03:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: use vesc logs with the smartphone. it will help to diagnose too
[2021-12-09T15:04:06] Mirono escooters: I suspect motor more Can u run sensorless?
[2021-12-09T15:04:20] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2021-12-09T15:05:13] Artem Bulashev: Will ask Spintend
[2021-12-09T15:05:58] Artem Bulashev: Thanks for advice
[2021-12-09T15:06:08] Artem Bulashev: How can I see it in logs ?
[2021-12-09T15:06:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Also, try sensorless as @Mirono_escooters suggests
[2021-12-09T15:06:26] Artem Bulashev: What to look at? I have iPhone not see there is an app
[2021-12-09T15:06:32] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-12-09T15:06:45] Artem Bulashev: EFI?
[2021-12-09T15:07:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Only sensorless
[2021-12-09T15:07:08] Artem Bulashev: I never tried non hall setups - seemed pointless
[2021-12-09T15:07:11] Face de Pin Sucé: You'll have to push a little at start
[2021-12-09T15:07:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Disconnect halls and set to sensorless
[2021-12-09T15:07:27] Artem Bulashev: Front will be sensored
[2021-12-09T15:07:30] Artem Bulashev: Should help
[2021-12-09T15:07:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Also do a new detection
[2021-12-09T15:07:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Because sometimes VESC does shit
[2021-12-09T15:08:04] Artem Bulashev: I think it is that because I do it 20 times and finally get no problem at all
[2021-12-09T15:08:22] Artem Bulashev: Before even at 80a would do that
[2021-12-09T15:08:27] Face de Pin Sucé: I mean, disconnect hall sensors and do a new detection
[2021-12-09T15:08:33] Happy Giraffe: Hand sadly is useless, motor coils can be 120°c while side is not even warm
[2021-12-09T15:08:50] Face de Pin Sucé: It's okay
[2021-12-09T15:08:59] Face de Pin Sucé: Never burnt anymotor while touching x)
[2021-12-09T15:09:09] Face de Pin Sucé: It's when I stop touching that I burn motor x)
[2021-12-09T15:09:17] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but its basic thermodynamics afterall
[2021-12-09T15:09:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not sure you have logs on alternative vesctool apps
[2021-12-09T15:09:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Putted 26S 100A on Citycoco monomoteur (800W motor)
[2021-12-09T15:09:42] Face de Pin Sucé: It burnt uphill x)
[2021-12-09T15:09:58] Face de Pin Sucé: It depends, what does he use?
[2021-12-09T15:12:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: from my point of view a simple graph test with vesctool should be able to detect a dead mosfet, no ? shitty current phase graph, no ?
[2021-12-09T15:12:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @Foujiwara
[2021-12-09T15:21:19] Face de Pin Sucé: @foujiwara is currently playing with his testicules on his power supply at 400Vdc x) he won't respond quickly
[2021-12-09T15:21:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣🤣 or sleeping ...
[2021-12-09T15:22:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah, too much current
[2021-12-09T15:57:36] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: what?
[2021-12-09T15:59:49] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no only 440v
[2021-12-09T16:06:59] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2021-12-09T16:08:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Nice
[2021-12-09T16:14:19] Mirono escooters: Haha yep

[2021-12-09T16:28:57] Unknown: You don't even need to disconnect halls, you can select sensorless in vesc settings leaving them plugged no probs
[2021-12-09T16:29:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Not always working well
[2021-12-09T16:29:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Better to disconnect and do a new detection
[2021-12-09T16:29:52] Face de Pin Sucé: To be sure it's sensorless
[2021-12-09T16:30:24] Unknown: Oh had no idea about that, never had an issue 🤣
[2021-12-09T16:30:53] Face de Pin Sucé: I think I experienced every problem possible on VESC x)

[2021-12-09T17:11:12] Face de Pin Sucé: It was a dead drv
[2021-12-09T17:14:46] Mirono escooters: i once got it and couldnt do foc, only super loud bldc, and on foc it shutted off with more then 10 procent throttle and that error flashed, after recalibrating evrything ok lol

[2021-12-14T15:54:14] Face de Pin Sucé: 20S*
[2021-12-14T15:55:29] Happy Giraffe: (x) doubt
[2021-12-14T16:01:12] Happy Giraffe: Is there a vesc that can do 200A phase?
[2021-12-14T16:01:19] Mirono escooters: Ubox?
[2021-12-14T16:01:26] Mirono escooters: Thé guys here run 300A loo
[2021-12-14T16:01:28] Happy Giraffe: But its 100A both
[2021-12-14T16:01:43] Mirono escooters: If flipsky handles 150 already
[2021-12-14T16:02:10] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but 200+?
[2021-12-14T16:02:23] Happy Giraffe: And continuous, not peak
[2021-12-14T16:04:43] Mirono escooters: Wich damn thing needs continuous 200a
[2021-12-14T16:05:13] Happy Giraffe: I was just wondering, for my ebike later on...👀
[2021-12-14T16:05:40] Happy Giraffe: Guy in my hometown uses 720A phase 450A batt
[2021-12-14T16:05:51] Mirono escooters: No way u need 200a continuous? Or am i wrong
[2021-12-14T16:05:55] Mirono escooters: (im prob wrong)
[2021-12-14T16:06:29] sombre_enfant: I like that if truck or deck fail u got a nice face lifting😂
[2021-12-14T16:07:37] Mirono escooters: Thé strain on neck too
[2021-12-14T16:18:47] Happy Giraffe: Well, I wanna do wheelie from throttle only😂
[2021-12-14T16:19:56] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/5aSFXgQUqRQ
[2021-12-14T16:20:23] Happy Giraffe: Uses rewinded QSmotor with ferrofluid
[2021-12-14T16:22:15] Mirono escooters: I do it on 150a. But im light
[2021-12-14T16:25:15] Happy Giraffe: Will be fun to register it as 25 km/h ebike with throttle
[2021-12-14T16:26:28] Mirono escooters: 😂
[2021-12-14T16:30:53] Unknown: 😂🤦‍♂️
[2021-12-14T16:31:04] Unknown: Impossible i think 😂😂
[2021-12-14T16:31:37] Happy Giraffe: If I can find a 2000-4000w motor with 1000w label then its possible
[2021-12-14T16:32:07] Happy Giraffe: Costs like 70€ per year lol
[2021-12-14T16:32:11] Unknown: Btw, tested my adc yesterday, could it be possible that throttle or brake broke? Tested 2 adc chips, both read out wrong
[2021-12-14T16:32:15] Unknown: Andlolll
[2021-12-14T16:32:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😏
[2021-12-14T16:32:59] Happy Giraffe: Check that adc switch is 100% to the side of the 5v if you use those
[2021-12-14T16:33:00] Unknown: <photos/photo_1090@20-09-2021_11-59-09.jpg>
[2021-12-14T16:33:05] Happy Giraffe: 99% is not enough
[2021-12-14T16:33:09] Unknown: It wad
[2021-12-14T16:33:11] Unknown: Was*
[2021-12-14T16:33:21] Unknown: That's why i tested 2 different chips
[2021-12-14T16:33:26] Unknown: Both read out the same
[2021-12-14T16:33:41] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, and proportional is set there?
[2021-12-14T16:34:22] Unknown: What do you mean? I set up like i did it the first time, and it worked fine like that, untill it stopped working 😆😂
[2021-12-14T16:34:34] Unknown: I hope it's not the vesc that broke
[2021-12-14T16:34:38] Happy Giraffe: In middle of riding?
[2021-12-14T16:34:44] Unknown: No
[2021-12-14T16:35:03] Unknown: Like i rode about 100m, brake, then tried taking off and it was poof gone
[2021-12-14T16:35:09] Happy Giraffe: I used always the PC vesctool. Not sure how it works on android app sry
[2021-12-14T16:35:09] Unknown: After braking
[2021-12-14T16:35:19] Unknown: Oh crappers
[2021-12-14T16:35:33] Mirono escooters: Id try to connect. Throttle 3.3v and yeet adv adaptor
[2021-12-14T16:35:35] Mirono escooters: Just to trst
[2021-12-14T16:35:41] Happy Giraffe: Noo
[2021-12-14T16:35:53] Happy Giraffe: That will brick the adc module for sure
[2021-12-14T16:36:02] Happy Giraffe: Especially if scooter is on
[2021-12-14T16:36:09] Unknown: I wont 😂
[2021-12-14T16:36:29] Mirono escooters: No no don't get me wrong
[2021-12-14T16:36:34] Unknown: Might directly connect throttle and brake to vesc
[2021-12-14T16:36:38] Unknown: Without adc chip
[2021-12-14T16:36:48] Mirono escooters: 3.3v to throttle Signal directly to adc in Ground directly to throttle To test if throttle is fine Or brake
[2021-12-14T16:36:49] Unknown: And give it a very light push to see if it reacts
[2021-12-14T16:36:49] Happy Giraffe: But those are 5v?
[2021-12-14T16:36:53] Unknown: Yup
[2021-12-14T16:37:06] Unknown: If i dont push all the way it should'nt matter right?
[2021-12-14T16:37:13] Happy Giraffe: Then I would consult someone expert before doing that
[2021-12-14T16:37:14] Mirono escooters: I ride with 3.3v input on throttle i got deadpoints but o wel
[2021-12-14T16:38:05] Unknown: Idc anymore about dead points at this moment 😆 i'm sick of using my rc car controller to ride my scoot
[2021-12-14T16:38:19] Mirono escooters: Then do as me
[2021-12-14T16:38:43] Unknown: Do you mean without the adc chip? Like just take 3.3v output on vesc?
[2021-12-14T16:40:30] Face de Pin Sucé: If you can wait, VESC I develop will do easily 200A continuous
[2021-12-14T16:41:06] Happy Giraffe: I'm not that serious about it yet. In future I might build a bike like that so I was just interested whats out there
[2021-12-14T16:59:13] Luis Magalhaes: Seems good 😂👌
[2021-12-14T16:59:32] Happy Giraffe: Lacroix on steroids
[2021-12-14T17:59:45] Face de Pin Sucé: X)
[2021-12-14T20:37:51] Luis Magalhaes: hi mates, have a question, can i conect one of those controll remote switches to the 12v feed of the ubox to power up the switch ?
[2021-12-14T20:37:55] Luis Magalhaes: https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/4000034995107.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.2742b90azR4NRp
[2021-12-14T20:38:00] Luis Magalhaes: one of those
[2021-12-14T21:06:24] Artem Bulashev: There is smaller option
[2021-12-14T21:06:48] Artem Bulashev: Speed limiter - SUPER TINY (updated) 20x11x11 mm https://a.aliexpress.com/_AMR1LR It’s basic (see photo) - Connect 12v - ground - white cable you cut one side to Normally Closed - another side to COM
[2021-12-14T21:06:50] Artem Bulashev: Here
[2021-12-14T21:10:07] Luis Magalhaes: allready have the one i put, it was working with a dc converter but it stoped working and dont have the 12v output to conect it
[2021-12-14T21:10:35] Luis Magalhaes: dont know if the 12v output of the ubox can handle it or not
[2021-12-14T21:10:58] Luis Magalhaes: i think it can but before burning something... lolol
[2021-12-14T21:12:45] Luis Magalhaes: i use it as a swith for the lights
[2021-12-14T21:45:23] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>

[2021-12-14T21:47:02] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-12-14T21:47:09] Luis Magalhaes: so i would kill it ?
[2021-12-14T21:48:03] Happy Giraffe: No, based on my understanding
[2021-12-14T21:48:59] Happy Giraffe: It can provide atleast 1.5A if I remember right so should be more than ok
[2021-12-14T22:30:41] Luis Magalhaes: nice
[2021-12-15T14:16:21] Mirono escooters: Hey. Problably logical question but
[2021-12-15T14:16:57] Mirono escooters: If u have a 16s It's ofcourse reasonable to take a 7-16s ant bms But they arent In stock Any downsides on taking a 8-20s? Higher resistance mosfets?
[2021-12-15T14:33:12] Luis Magalhaes: Im using a 8-20S on my 16s
[2021-12-15T14:33:19] Luis Magalhaes: Ant bms
[2021-12-15T14:33:46] Luis Magalhaes: Dont known if there is a down side😅
[2021-12-15T14:33:54] Luis Magalhaes: But dont think there is
[2021-12-15T14:34:56] Mirono escooters: Why they Bother w 2 versions?
[2021-12-15T14:38:01] Luis Magalhaes: Maybe to have more or less components dont know
[2021-12-15T14:38:33] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-12-15T14:38:37] Mirono escooters: Weird
[2021-12-15T19:34:53] Artem Bulashev: Мысль убрать все провода с фермы, слишком завладела мной)))
[2021-12-15T19:35:01] Artem Bulashev: Pretty dope
[2021-12-15T19:56:39] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 you will like that I think 😄
[2021-12-15T20:00:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: wireless ?? nice !
[2021-12-15T20:14:05] Artem Bulashev: Yeh :))
[2021-12-17T17:02:49] Happy Giraffe: Did someone try field weakening on vesc here?
[2021-12-17T17:13:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Only on air
[2021-12-17T17:13:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Not on road yet
[2021-12-17T17:29:18] Happy Giraffe: Would be interesting to see, how much can you control it when it activates etc? Im a total noob on this😅
[2021-12-17T17:29:46] Face de Pin Sucé: It activates at a certain Duty Cycle ;)
[2021-12-17T17:29:53] Face de Pin Sucé: That you set
[2021-12-17T17:29:58] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-12-17T17:30:03] Mirono escooters: Wish i had vesc in my slow scoot
[2021-12-17T17:30:21] Happy Giraffe: That's cool, would be a fun way to get some extra giggles from my Xiaomi
[2021-12-17T17:32:30] Happy Giraffe: BLDC + field weakening🤪
[2021-12-17T17:34:59] Happy Giraffe: Also did anyone try to make vesc acceleration more aggressive? On standard settings it's nice and smooth but if you want a bit more kick, what settings do you tweak?
[2021-12-17T17:36:17] Mirono escooters: Bldc
[2021-12-17T17:36:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Acceleration ramping time
[2021-12-17T17:36:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Set to 0.05s
[2021-12-17T17:37:25] Happy Giraffe: Thanks a lot, I will try later🥰
[2021-12-17T17:37:56] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2021-12-17T17:37:59] Face de Pin Sucé: This is one of my tests
[2021-12-17T17:38:04] Face de Pin Sucé: (didn't film other tests)
[2021-12-17T17:38:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Field Weakening activated at 90% duty cycle
[2021-12-17T17:38:22] Face de Pin Sucé: 100A
[2021-12-17T17:39:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Without FW : 38000ERPM
[2021-12-17T17:39:12] Happy Giraffe: Lmao, that's some rpm there
[2021-12-17T17:39:14] Face de Pin Sucé: With 100A : 53000ERPM
[2021-12-17T17:39:58] Happy Giraffe: 40% gain on air not bad
[2021-12-17T17:39:58] Face de Pin Sucé: 1220W running on air 😂
[2021-12-17T17:40:58] Happy Giraffe: You crazy guys at it again 😂
[2021-12-17T17:41:07] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-12-17T17:41:17] Happy Giraffe: You should make some 0-100kmh competition
[2021-12-17T17:43:35] Mirono escooters: What?? How??
[2021-12-17T17:43:39] Face de Pin Sucé: We will sometime
[2021-12-17T17:43:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Field Weakening x)
[2021-12-17T17:44:10] Mirono escooters: In air?? So much?
[2021-12-17T17:44:21] Face de Pin Sucé: I putted 100A on field weakening
[2021-12-17T17:44:27] Mirono escooters: Jezus
[2021-12-17T17:44:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Meaning it push 100A phase
[2021-12-17T17:44:44] Face de Pin Sucé: And it pulls 20A from battery
[2021-12-17T17:47:26] Happy Giraffe: This might become nice option if we sometimes need the extra speed. For fun or to escape the crazy car drivers tryna kill us
[2021-12-17T17:48:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't forget, it heats very much
[2021-12-17T17:48:38] Face de Pin Sucé: pulls a loooooooot of current
[2021-12-17T17:48:42] Face de Pin Sucé: no efficiency at al
[2021-12-17T17:48:45] Face de Pin Sucé: all*
[2021-12-17T17:49:17] Mirono escooters: With a button? Would b fun
[2021-12-17T17:56:10] Happy Giraffe: 120A phase is ok for me and 80A batt. Will never use it more than 10 sec anyways
[2021-12-17T17:57:05] Face de Pin Sucé: But I don't know how exactly it works on road
[2021-12-17T17:57:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Like if you have 80A phase and set 100A for Field Weakening, will it pull 100+80A ?
[2021-12-17T17:57:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Need to test
[2021-12-17T17:57:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: any idea what is the 'ds' blue pin ? battery voltage going back from display to controller ?
[2021-12-17T17:57:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1669@17-12-2021_17-57-59.jpg>
[2021-12-17T18:01:01] Happy Giraffe: That will be interesting
[2021-12-17T18:06:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How about telling more what is type is that exactly and what's the goal?
[2021-12-17T18:07:24] Happy Giraffe: His goal = Magic stuff
[2021-12-17T18:12:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than answer is behind Magic also
[2021-12-17T18:14:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-12-17T18:14:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1670@17-12-2021_18-14-40.jpg>
[2021-12-17T18:15:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and yes, it's voltage back ;)
[2021-12-17T18:15:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: only enabled once vsett rfid tag is applied
[2021-12-17T18:16:38] Artem Bulashev: It is only so if your motor is cool without firldbweakening
[2021-12-17T18:17:35] Artem Bulashev: Because field weakening overloads motor to archive higher rpm. If your motor is already at limit, than field weakening is not for you
[2021-12-17T18:17:44] Mirono escooters: Let it sweat
[2021-12-17T18:18:02] Happy Giraffe: It is, can't even get side have warm. Magnet is placed directly at the other side of plate
[2021-12-17T18:18:16] Artem Bulashev: 👌🙂
[2021-12-17T18:18:37] Artem Bulashev: 🤝 than you be good
[2021-12-17T18:18:56] Artem Bulashev: May front lights
[2021-12-17T18:19:13] Happy Giraffe: The blade motor is insane...
[2021-12-17T18:19:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I don't think so.
[2021-12-17T18:19:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: as minimotor, the display MOSFET is here to provide power back from display to the controller
[2021-12-17T18:20:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the logic part of the controller is powered by the display
[2021-12-17T18:20:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the display act as a poweron switch
[2021-12-17T18:21:05] Artem Bulashev: 👌 zero is same ?
[2021-12-17T18:21:26] Artem Bulashev: New once should be same as they plug in and fully work with each other
[2021-12-17T18:21:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, and minimo too
[2021-12-17T18:21:31] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2021-12-17T18:21:45] Artem Bulashev: I’m rather sure this button is dual mode
[2021-12-17T18:22:17] Artem Bulashev: Because that line runs from button to display and controller - display has small indicator about dual motor mode enabled
[2021-12-17T18:22:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it may have the same name, but correct me if I'm wrong, you can't enable/disable dual motor from the display ?
[2021-12-17T18:22:44] Artem Bulashev: No
[2021-12-17T18:22:57] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1671@17-12-2021_18-22-57.jpg>
[2021-12-17T18:22:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think this feedback comes from the serial link
[2021-12-17T18:23:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, but this signal is only in the harness from buttons to controller
[2021-12-17T18:23:40] Artem Bulashev: I checked printout with multi meter
[2021-12-17T18:23:47] Artem Bulashev: This DS
[2021-12-17T18:24:12] Artem Bulashev: Buzz from button wire to ds on display and on pin on controller side
[2021-12-17T18:24:31] Artem Bulashev: Open controller and see where it goes there (May be some sign)
[2021-12-17T18:24:46] Artem Bulashev: But I’m 95% sure
[2021-12-17T18:26:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: they all use the same derivated controller wiring
[2021-12-17T18:26:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1672@17-12-2021_18-26-14.jpg>
[2021-12-17T18:36:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: messages : - from controller to display : every 500ms - from display to controller : eveery 200ms
[2021-12-17T18:37:02] Mirono escooters: Isn't that slow ? For throttle response
[2021-12-17T18:37:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, it's slow, but no, the throttle doesn't use this signal. it's an analog signal beside thoses
[2021-12-17T18:37:45] Mirono escooters: A
[2021-12-17T18:37:47] Mirono escooters: Woops
[2021-12-17T18:37:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's only for modes, speed display ...
[2021-12-17T18:38:00] Mirono escooters: Aha ok
[2021-12-17T18:38:02] Mirono escooters: Good enough
[2021-12-17T18:42:24] Artem Bulashev: So than what is DS? 😁
[2021-12-17T18:43:15] Artem Bulashev: That is one mistery I was not able to solve as you had my controller and display since when I one of 2 buttons signal going to display and controller at once
[2021-12-17T18:45:50] Artem Bulashev: Considering horn goes only down to 10 pin and not display, second button on 9+ is DUAL motor, that’s why I concluded that. I think it goes to display to enable indicator and to controller because controller is very basic thus B simply does what controller A is doing = that line simply tells it to do it or not to do it
[2021-12-17T18:46:29] Artem Bulashev: That was my conclusion based only on cable and button that I had (didn’t have controller and no display already at that point)
[2021-12-17T19:04:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like an antispark switch?
[2021-12-17T19:06:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a bit

[2021-12-17T19:09:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also check pins
[2021-12-17T19:10:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, it's just bad hall wiring

[2021-12-17T22:24:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahha. didn't set the battery voltage 😉
[2021-12-17T22:43:26] sombre_enfant: Adc battery reading on your board or on the controller ?
[2021-12-17T22:50:36] sombre_enfant: Also for temp its the sensor near mosfet or on your display
[2021-12-17T22:58:42] Luis Magalhaes: nice

[2021-12-17T23:47:00] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1677@17-12-2021_23-47-00.jpg>
[2021-12-17T23:47:13] Artem Bulashev: Why you should not buy cheap Chinese chargers that say 5amps.
[2021-12-17T23:48:09] Artem Bulashev: It does 4.3amps stable empty to full (till battery voltage is equal to charger output!) without slowing down at all - it is CC charger only!! Don’t buy this
[2021-12-17T23:48:22] Artem Bulashev: https://a.aliexpress.com/_9Q2B3k
[2021-12-17T23:49:11] Happy Giraffe: Yzpower seems to be really nice charger brand based on my usage. Gotta swap their fans to noctuas and then Im good to go🤪
[2021-12-17T23:49:52] Happy Giraffe: Its crazy it got 4.8/5
[2021-12-17T23:49:53] Artem Bulashev: Also you get differently looking charger, for that reason alone I got money back. It is light weight 4.3a 600g only charger that you can’t use to charge to full but can be used for quick charging on the travel because of light weight
[2021-12-17T23:50:22] Artem Bulashev: Because people don’t have smart BMS, so they don’t see the problem and don’t see that one or few cells are over charged
[2021-12-17T23:50:43] Happy Giraffe: I monitor my chargers with power meter to see it slows down👀
[2021-12-17T23:51:18] Artem Bulashev: That’s 👍 good. This one just blasts 4.3amp non stop
[2021-12-17T23:52:08] Happy Giraffe: Thats also bit bad for battery life right? Cell takes most amps at closer to nominal?
[2021-12-17T23:52:45] Artem Bulashev: Really bad
[2021-12-17T23:54:01] Artem Bulashev: Charging above 80-85% should go to CV (constant voltage mode) where battery sucks only as much current as it needs based on difference of voltage, and charging cycle should end once charger sees pull of less than 50-80ma
[2021-12-17T23:54:48] Artem Bulashev: At higher voltage inside cell - 4.2v max, internal resistance is higher than at 3.7v
[2021-12-17T23:57:00] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1679@17-12-2021_23-57-00.jpg>
[2021-12-17T23:57:33] Happy Giraffe: And BMS balances only at full? 😅
[2021-12-17T23:58:33] Artem Bulashev: Depends on BMS. Mine is active balancesr
[2021-12-17T23:59:45] Artem Bulashev: This means it doesn’t just let current flow and equalize it self slowly based on voltage difference (50-80ma typically, instead it turns on circuits and can balance up to 600ma rate if variance is large.
[2021-12-18T00:00:23] Artem Bulashev: Mine starts to balance only once cels go out of balance by more than 0.01v
[2021-12-18T00:00:51] Artem Bulashev: It didn’t do it once since I built the battery - perks of new cells 🙂
[2021-12-18T00:00:58] Happy Giraffe: If you didn't have active balance and used this charger I guess bad things would have come out of it
[2021-12-18T00:01:20] Artem Bulashev: Cells are with in 0.003-0.007v even figuring discharge
[2021-12-18T00:01:43] Happy Giraffe: That's nice👍
[2021-12-18T00:07:34] Artem Bulashev: If you didn’t have BMS that can cut of charging completely based on single cell going above set voltage - 4.22v for me, than yeah, could be bad. For example if one cell is 0.15v above others than it would be at around 4.35v before others got to 4.2v where charger would finally stop pushing 4.3amps of current. that may not be enough for fire on but can be terrible for health of that one cell = meaning next time it will be even worse on that same cell - accumilate enough and you got fire ball
[2021-12-18T00:09:42] Happy Giraffe: Im lucky I didnt even think about this before and got good stuff based on the brand😅
[2021-12-18T00:41:50] Artem Bulashev: I got this charger becasue I knew it woudl be free 🙂 Checked reviews and saw people say they get different looking charger , than saw seller claim refund if color or type is not correct - so ordered 😄 Free charger it is, far from perfect but the lightest out there that does 4.3amps for 16s 🙂 So a win over all, but don't buy it haha
[2021-12-18T00:42:25] Artem Bulashev: plan to get proper charger for sure with knob to set tcharging to 80-90-100% and adjustable amps - saw one 2-6amps adjusttable
[2021-12-18T00:51:49] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if Yzpower has one🤔 or some other proper brand. I bought an expensive charger from amazon and it does 2.4A but rated 3A😂
[2021-12-18T01:24:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on xiaomi esc. i failed the config on the video
[2021-12-18T01:24:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, mosfet temp

[2021-12-18T14:11:39] Mirono escooters: Shouldnt it do cv from itself?
[2021-12-18T14:12:08] Mirono escooters: I mean When it hits the specified v amps drop automatically no? Physics?
[2021-12-18T14:12:15] Mirono escooters: I only buy 1 good known brand anyway
[2021-12-18T14:30:34] Artem Bulashev: Correct if it is in CV
[2021-12-18T14:30:50] Artem Bulashev: But this charger is CC (constant current) non stop
[2021-12-18T14:46:46] Mirono escooters: Non stop??
[2021-12-18T14:46:46] Mirono escooters: Ooof

[2021-12-18T14:47:46] Artem Bulashev: And it is still at 4.4a even though there is 0.06v left from entire pack
[2021-12-18T14:47:57] Mirono escooters: What's thé output v unloaded?
[2021-12-18T14:48:09] Artem Bulashev: I’m glad I got full refund from this charger haha
[2021-12-18T14:48:13] Artem Bulashev: I check
[2021-12-18T14:49:14] Artem Bulashev: 67.6v

[2021-12-18T15:05:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's my app. for smartdisplay/smartcontroller. a board i am developping
[2021-12-18T15:06:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, it's the vesctool latest beta from vesc forum
[2021-12-18T15:07:16] Unknown: I know you're developing a smart display but shii, looking 👌👌 and oh ok so more possibilities, but without using a vesc, and using a xiaomi esc instead you mean?
[2021-12-18T15:07:26] Happy Giraffe: Yz*?
[2021-12-18T15:07:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and of course : PRICE ! highly customizable firmware on 25e esc... with mods, 100v / 100A
[2021-12-18T15:08:19] Unknown: I understand 🙃 thanks for clearing up to this dumb fuck 😆😂
[2021-12-18T15:08:35] Unknown: I feel so dumb sometimes 😂😂
[2021-12-18T15:08:54] Mirono escooters: That
[2021-12-18T15:08:59] Happy Giraffe: Is Xiaomi chip powerful enough for all the FOC goodies?
[2021-12-18T15:09:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i hate usual custom xiaomi firmwares. all black boxes without possibility of modification. none opensource as i know of
[2021-12-18T15:09:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: largely !
[2021-12-18T15:09:10] Mirono escooters: Cheap af esc
[2021-12-18T15:09:21] Happy Giraffe: Lol, me too
[2021-12-18T15:09:32] Happy Giraffe: That's nice😎
[2021-12-18T15:09:37] Unknown: 👌
[2021-12-18T15:10:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: using 30% cpu if i remember. ram/flash is more an issue. but for now, working good. we'll see when we'll increase possibilities (sensorless, dual esc...)
[2021-12-18T15:12:40] Happy Giraffe: That's impressive
[2021-12-18T15:13:45] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi esc gang
[2021-12-18T15:13:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but clearly, the main goal is not xiaomi. it's more for middle range escooters/eskates.
[2021-12-18T15:14:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-12-18T15:14:04] Mirono escooters: How fast can we see a release of this? Maybe i don't need a flipsky. I got Xiaomi all along
[2021-12-18T15:14:10] Mirono escooters: Heaps
[2021-12-18T15:14:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no eta. needs more testing
[2021-12-18T15:14:28] Mirono escooters: :(
[2021-12-18T15:14:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: devs are working on it since 1 year !
[2021-12-18T15:14:47] Mirono escooters: 😱
[2021-12-18T15:15:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah. not so easy 🤪
[2021-12-18T15:16:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but for me, it's mature enought for ride testing now. i think @Foujiwara will soon test it on a scooter
[2021-12-18T15:17:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on my side, i don't have any frame/battery to make test rides with this configuration. only bench tests
[2021-12-18T15:18:52] Face de Pin Sucé: I have 😏
[2021-12-18T15:19:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😁😁

[2021-12-18T17:08:13] sombre_enfant: He prolly talk about the space of the stm
[2021-12-18T17:08:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lets say we are working on something similar ,but xiaomi based
[2021-12-18T17:08:58] Happy Giraffe: What he said previously xiaomi chip only at 30% when running FOC so theres headroom
[2021-12-18T17:09:13] sombre_enfant: This year everyone is onto something on vesc🧐
[2021-12-18T17:15:36] Unknown: 😂😂
[2021-12-18T17:15:46] Happy Giraffe: Oh yes, after fiddling with Xiaomi esc a higher quality feels nice. Especially the thermal design of Spintend is really nice
[2021-12-18T17:16:02] Unknown: Well 🖕 i'm alone then 😭😂😂😂
[2021-12-18T17:17:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha sorry, pussy is too damn great 🥰

[2021-12-18T17:20:49] Artem Bulashev: Finally
[2021-12-18T17:20:54] Artem Bulashev: All fixed up
[2021-12-18T17:23:27] Artem Bulashev: Was having controller go into low voltage protection and could not figure out why
[2021-12-18T17:23:46] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂😂😂
[2021-12-18T17:23:52] Face de Pin Sucé: I love sea 😂
[2021-12-18T17:24:03] Unknown: 😂😂😂
[2021-12-18T17:31:42] Artem Bulashev: Ended up being hard to diagnose issues because it was A result of a long and very quick chain of events. What one would see When this happened, is short-circuit up on output of VMS and low-voltage message on VESC… in reality there is no short circuit and there is no low-voltage on on the amount in BMS work and told her what happened was one of balancing leads number three (between cell number two positive and cell number three negative) Was not solar properly YouTube copper nickel heat dissipating too quickly That one wire caused the two cells to lose readings of voltage and resistance BMS would read that as a wrong cell count error. It’s all done turn off all charging and discharging which caused controller to lose input voltage and go into low-voltage production. BMS would read that protection state of controller as a short circuit. In just a second wire with reconnect with the battery and BMS would turn on charge on the charge again but by this time it would now read a short circuit on the controller and go into discharge disable mode (short circuit protection)
[2021-12-18T17:32:05] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2021-12-18T17:44:42] sombre_enfant: You missing out on lot of arguments and headaches

[2021-12-18T18:17:26] Unknown: <video_file>
[2021-12-18T18:18:32] Artem Bulashev: 58kmh max speed on flat road no wind. - thrust is amazing from like 8 to 54kmh, it is constant continuous torque! Than suddenly goes flat around 56->58kmh mark 😁 Honestly it’s perfect! I wanted to have 50kmh down to 25% battery and May be 55kmh max speed ever 😁 Motors are such high torque low kv 😄 16s = 58kmh 😄
[2021-12-18T18:18:40] Happy Giraffe: Dw, I can send you new one with fucked hall

[2021-12-19T01:27:03] Happy Giraffe: They changed also a littlebit how they do the single ubox from my beta unit to te replaced one. Only minor changes like some added silicone pads etc but still they might have an important role🤔
