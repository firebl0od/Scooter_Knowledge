[2024-10-10T18:15:26] Yamal: with cnc rim?
[2024-10-10T18:15:41] Yamal: Or just LY rim
[2024-10-10T18:15:46] Andrei Albert: I have the standard ly rim
[2024-10-10T18:15:48] Yamal: 33/2 yea
[2024-10-10T18:16:07] Yamal: They are very wide...
[2024-10-10T18:16:08] Andrei Albert: I want cnc rim but no money now

[2024-10-10T18:21:30] Yamal: Let's see what top speed you reach
[2024-10-10T18:28:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: His is 90h that rewinding
[2024-10-10T18:31:35] Yamal: Same this
[2024-10-10T18:33:23] Yamal: What I see about the 90h is that it is not as cool as the 75/80 in its construction
[2024-10-10T18:34:11] Yamal: because the engine is nami/kaboo type, the engine is not divided from the rim
[2024-10-10T18:34:15] Andrei Albert: You saw the ultra with thunder arms?
[2024-10-10T18:34:40] Yamal: Nop..
[2024-10-10T18:35:35] Andrei Albert: <photos/photo_18364@10-10-2024_18-35-35.jpg>
[2024-10-10T18:36:25] Yamal: I mean the magnets are attached to the rim
[2024-10-10T18:36:43] Yamal: yes I saw it! Nice
[2024-10-10T18:37:29] Yamal: Yours look better 🔥👌
[2024-10-10T18:37:42] Yamal: A little rare I think..
[2024-10-10T18:38:15] Andrei Albert: It is cuz custom body
[2024-10-10T18:39:25] Yamal: <photos/photo_18365@10-10-2024_18-39-25.jpg>
[2024-10-10T18:39:59] Andrei Albert: Cant wait to be one piece
[2024-10-10T18:42:06] Yamal: It gives the impression that the engine is smaller than it is.. xD It might be because of the rim that is super wide
[2024-10-10T18:42:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_AixcnM9ON/?igsh=dTF4a21yd2Jza3Rj
[2024-10-10T18:43:02] Yamal: Do you have a good straight line to test top speed?
[2024-10-10T18:43:02] crimeware: Which victims? There were none

[2024-10-10T20:08:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't think would fit my motor (mantis 10 motor)

[2024-10-10T21:03:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Mantis 10 rim is 6 not even 6.5 (zero rim)
[2024-10-10T21:04:04] Andrei Albert: Zero 10x and matins 10 have the same rim 6
[2024-10-10T21:04:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is the victor frame better then zero10x (and while I'm asking that is the motors better?)

[2024-10-10T21:13:09] haku: all vapes now are electronic. its not how it used too. back then you had to roll coils on your own and make use of all the amps
[2024-10-10T21:13:28] haku: thats why vapes used to blow up haha
[2024-10-10T21:15:00] haku: back then the hardest hitting cell are sony vtcs. that was around 10 years ago. you were a baby

[2024-10-10T23:13:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Did you ever saa this frame ? (I wonder if it's just a Chinese frame like zero and more )
[2024-10-10T23:15:33] haku: so many chinese scooters now. who knows. even laotie has many verions now
[2024-10-10T23:15:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It a very old frame here (in my country)
[2024-10-10T23:16:58] haku: i really think of these generic frames as disposable frames. so many parts available of it breaks
[2024-10-10T23:17:35] haku: like laotie for example.

[2024-10-10T23:18:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think it's like the Inokim ox
[2024-10-10T23:18:34] haku: some big brand scooters have expensive replacement parts

[2024-10-11T05:43:34] haku: what? what is a hyperscooter? these 11" are hyperscooters. thats thier identity. so is the vsett 10
[2024-10-11T05:44:04] haku: so is the laotian ti30
[2024-10-11T05:49:47] Yamal: Hehe
[2024-10-11T05:50:15] Yamal: Maybe emove roadster
[2024-10-11T05:51:15] Yamal: but if you think they are all hyper scooters, perfect!! It's basically nonsense
[2024-10-11T05:55:25] haku: thats what "they" call em. not my rules
[2024-10-11T05:56:09] haku: theres commuter scooters and these so called hyperscooters
[2024-10-11T06:00:49] haku: the title is still up for grabs. who has the fastest scooter in the world of the fastest scooter? who is the fastest of the fast.
[2024-10-11T06:02:14] haku: is it the french? the swiss g30? the turkish zero10? or china with unknown brand since it all comes from there anyways
[2024-10-11T08:20:20] Yamal: In Spain this year there is already a scooter at the level of the French, not in terms of rain xD, but 22s batteries, high discharge vesc controllers and 80h speed motors, basically in the world of competition (France) and Now I think that Spain also does not allow more than 22s of battery, the Turkish has 24s but its motors are not the most appropriate,, but come on, voltage plays a very important role... so nothing, everything evolves very quickly and little by little things will be seen...
[2024-10-11T08:23:47] Yamal: What is clear is that when you immerse yourself in the world of tunnig scooters, the standard ones no longer make much sense... because in terms of gross acceleration and top speed, they are two worlds apart. I think Elon has something to do with this but never forget that he The one who whips him with the whip to make him run more is the good Benjaming
[2024-10-11T09:11:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: how you talk early in the morning ☺️
[2024-10-11T09:35:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The Ukrainans is also zero10x Israel is inokim ox USA is everything but mostly surron
[2024-10-11T09:44:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Do u have a suggestion for a winter tire ? (Maybe an off road one?)
[2024-10-11T09:48:36] Jan: I think there is no clear definition of what a hyperscooter is. For me its power to weight ratio. (Else if you define 10kW+ is a hyper scooter and somebody has a 150kg scooter, its gonna be slow). For me Hyperscooter start at 500W/kg
[2024-10-11T09:49:07] Jan: Commuter are like 25W/kg
[2024-10-11T09:49:59] Jan: Vsett 10+ is 82W/kg (100W/kg, depends on measure)
[2024-10-11T09:51:29] Jan: I think 1kW/kg is feasable, (1:1 ratio)
[2024-10-11T10:16:18] Andrei Albert: Only the ones that exists already
[2024-10-11T10:26:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes and yes
[2024-10-11T10:28:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Oh now I have to upgrade
[2024-10-11T10:30:13] Andrei Albert: Its the mini thunder
[2024-10-11T10:30:38] Face de Pin Sucé: I think you're right
[2024-10-11T10:30:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Mini ? This is the only one we have
[2024-10-11T10:30:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Even if I would say 750W/Kg is hyperscooter
[2024-10-11T10:31:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Under that, would be SuperScooter
[2024-10-11T10:32:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: They want 1450$ for it 60/30 dual
[2024-10-11T10:32:40] Andrei Albert: A lolott of
[2024-10-11T10:32:43] Andrei Albert: Lot
[2024-10-11T10:33:07] Andrei Albert: New?
[2024-10-11T10:34:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Second hand
[2024-10-11T10:41:34] Basti: Does anyone know a good point silencer?
[2024-10-11T10:51:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This one is 3800$ new (I don't exactly know the name of model)
[2024-10-11T10:55:07] NetworkDir: I think it's luxury plus model but for 3800$ very overpriced!!!
[2024-10-11T10:55:23] NetworkDir: You can buy Inmotion rs with 4k$
[2024-10-11T10:55:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Everything here is overpriced
[2024-10-11T10:55:37] NetworkDir: Damn
[2024-10-11T10:56:24] Andrei Albert: U can buy thunder 2 sh with 2200eur
[2024-10-11T10:56:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The wolf is 7100$
[2024-10-11T10:56:46] NetworkDir: Wtf
[2024-10-11T10:56:52] NetworkDir: ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
[2024-10-11T10:58:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And the wolf x is 3450$
[2024-10-11T11:04:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 5.300$ now u understand why I'm staying with the cheap zero10x.
[2024-10-11T11:05:28] Jan: For sub 30kg this is really though to do already
[2024-10-11T11:06:22] Jan: I think except 40PL you cant do it anymore
[2024-10-11T11:07:31] Jan: My Ninebot G30 is about 650W/kg and with 40PL would be 1080W/kg
[2024-10-11T11:17:38] Jan: Or is it a size issue? 🧐 120Cells are really pushing it already
[2024-10-11T12:07:26] GABE: The 801d has put some craters in the Molicel, yikes. I shouldn't have double welded in the same spot
[2024-10-11T12:16:59] GABE: Assuming these cells have so much weld spots, I may have to pot the cell. @Mirono_escooters
[2024-10-11T12:17:01] haku: aslong as it sticks. your lucky ot doesnt deform the negative when you rip test
[2024-10-11T12:17:29] GABE: It kinda does if I do it wrong. may have to get a few extra.
[2024-10-11T12:17:47] GABE: I need to buy new micro pliers, or I can't get most of it off
[2024-10-11T12:17:58] GABE: These old ones harm the cell
[2024-10-11T12:18:01] haku: agree with this. i did not consider weight to be a standard for scooters
[2024-10-11T12:18:05] GABE: The top tooth is damaged
[2024-10-11T12:18:19] GABE: <photos/photo_18380@11-10-2024_12-18-19.jpg>
[2024-10-11T12:18:28] GABE: Caused issues, only noticed recently
[2024-10-11T12:18:37] GABE: thankfully didn't take apart the other part of the 8p.
[2024-10-11T12:18:45] GABE: It's still all in one piece.
[2024-10-11T12:18:45] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-11T12:18:56] haku: you need tiny flush cutters
[2024-10-11T12:19:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It is not comparable 10x with Nami, the 10x is mid-range, the Nami is high-end
[2024-10-11T12:20:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I sent him a message the day before yesterday
[2024-10-11T12:23:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Well my zero10x is high end in terms of performance
[2024-10-11T12:26:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also the price of a new one here is 1800$
[2024-10-11T12:30:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, well, in terms of customization it won't be the same, just like the chassis.
[2024-10-11T12:40:10] GABE: the price reminds me of apple pricing.
[2024-10-11T12:51:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes the frames are way better now the zero10x frame is very old
[2024-10-11T12:52:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes they treat it like that because it's "brand"
[2024-10-11T13:17:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: ¡Mira lo que acabo de encontrar en Wallapop! Nami burn e 2 max https://wallapop.com/item/nami-burn-e-2-max-1055581775?utm_medium=AppShare&utm_source=ShareItem
[2024-10-11T13:18:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: But today, knowing what we know, it is better to buy a chassis and add parts.
[2024-10-11T13:21:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's hard to sell things here that is why I don't upgrade frame

[2024-10-11T17:10:30] haku: you overlapped the other scooters haha
[2024-10-11T17:12:12] haku: driver is really skilled. they way he kneels then turns his hips to get more turn angle is crazy
[2024-10-11T17:13:57] haku: fastest machine + skilled driver.
[2024-10-11T17:15:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Will do ❤️
[2024-10-11T17:15:22] haku: i will try to recreate this with the segway es3
[2024-10-11T17:15:36] Face de Pin Sucé: That's what I like, but recently, it's not me making videos, so I took personal time to make this one haha

[2024-10-11T18:15:27] Face de Pin Sucé: 30S6P in G30 ? Where do you put controllers ?
[2024-10-11T18:25:04] Patrick: Like on the picture below the battery
[2024-10-11T18:25:24] Patrick: Even fits the ANT 850A peak its like the seven is made for the G30
[2024-10-11T18:26:50] haku: title still up for for grabs boys. who will be the challenger 40pl on seven vesc
[2024-10-11T18:27:21] Face de Pin Sucé: x)
[2024-10-11T18:28:11] haku: remember get your cells from a trusted souce. @jamessoderstrom only one i know in EU that has genuine 40pl
[2024-10-11T18:29:20] haku: he also has other cells in every category
[2024-10-11T18:29:51] Patrick: I have an seller

[2024-10-11T18:55:58] haku: no motor temp sensor?
[2024-10-11T18:56:43] haku: 40kw is crazy
[2024-10-11T18:56:56] Lisa: Hahaha what’s the beping? Cop radar? 🤣
[2024-10-11T18:59:15] haku: i wonder if this kw is possible on spintend 85/200
[2024-10-11T19:00:09] GABE: Should be actually. obviously not cont.
[2024-10-11T19:00:26] GABE: James pushed 26kw on double separate 6fet.
[2024-10-11T19:00:28] haku: how. explain the science behind it
[2024-10-11T19:00:36] NetworkDir: No
[2024-10-11T19:00:45] GABE: I'm sure double the FETs and same architecture will achieve 46kw (52)
[2024-10-11T19:00:52] GABE: Logically if same fets are used
[2024-10-11T19:00:57] puneDir: <video_file>

[2024-10-11T19:01:32] haku: ok i believe. that name is legendary
[2024-10-11T19:02:01] GABE: What motors
[2024-10-11T19:02:17] NetworkDir: I think big huameng motora with 40 pole and 7 rim
[2024-10-11T19:02:38] GABE: H Count?
[2024-10-11T19:02:49] haku: how many poles LY motor?
[2024-10-11T19:02:57] GABE: I didn't know you're part of the 40kw club
[2024-10-11T19:03:03] GABE: Let alone 20
[2024-10-11T19:03:08] NetworkDir: Should 70H 22x3
[2024-10-11T19:03:18] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_18388@11-10-2024_19-03-18.jpg>
[2024-10-11T19:03:30] GABE: Jesus fucking Christ does that not melt them
[2024-10-11T19:03:34] GABE: You need a hall sensor
[2024-10-11T19:03:45] haku: huameng makes 70h? theyre biggest is 60h isnt it
[2024-10-11T19:03:45] GABE: Glad to hear they can actually chug that though holy shit

[2024-10-11T19:05:43] NetworkDir: He say the motor from outside max 50C But who knows what temp inside x)
[2024-10-11T19:06:02] GABE: With my ximi motor, it meant the inside is 150.
[2024-10-11T19:06:10] GABE: 🗿

[2024-10-11T19:07:14] NetworkDir: Yeah he do it for range
[2024-10-11T19:07:19] haku: stop hating and work on your world title
[2024-10-11T19:07:23] GABE: even range wise.
[2024-10-11T19:07:26] NetworkDir: He buy 6-7$ per cell
[2024-10-11T19:07:34] GABE: No I'm just curious how yall have THIS MUCH MONEY
[2024-10-11T19:07:37] NetworkDir: So this price fuck moli
[2024-10-11T19:07:47] NetworkDir: Now i can find 40pl for 5.5$ x)
[2024-10-11T19:08:07] haku: p42 is $1.80
[2024-10-11T19:08:21] Patrick: Expensive for 40pl
[2024-10-11T19:08:22] GABE: Damn you Americans.
[2024-10-11T19:08:48] haku: i have the world title of bargain shopping so
[2024-10-11T19:09:10] NetworkDir: Im on turkiye finding this cell for this price is very cheap in here because fuckeria customs
[2024-10-11T19:09:17] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2024-10-11T19:09:51] NetworkDir: P42 = ~8$
[2024-10-11T19:09:52] haku: i got the belt world title for less paid per KW
[2024-10-11T19:11:18] GABE: Impossible to import or?
[2024-10-11T19:11:49] haku: no idea
[2024-10-11T19:11:52] GABE: Range would be the same but if you're gonna ball then go baller ig kek
[2024-10-11T19:12:00] GABE: if 4.2 ain't a lot

[2024-10-11T19:17:11] haku: thats what double deck 21700 looks like. look how thickboy plus bms.
[2024-10-11T19:20:06] Jan: Try not to overstretch it with the space, each cable has also some size, at this power level even more. Insulated flat copper bars makes it a bit better to assemble
[2024-10-11T19:21:11] Jan: Battery connector in the rear is supper tight
[2024-10-11T19:22:20] Patrick: I know with the seven you have even more space for the wirss then on the 85250
[2024-10-11T19:23:04] Patrick: Battery terminals are more on the middle of the esc
[2024-10-11T19:23:41] GABE: Mine will be 25% less wide, 6p instead of 8p width, and therefore 25% longer
[2024-10-11T19:24:17] haku: yes what i mean is the height of the battery. you need a long spacer
[2024-10-11T19:24:33] GABE: measure height
[2024-10-11T19:24:45] GABE: <photos/photo_18392@11-10-2024_19-24-45.jpg>
[2024-10-11T19:24:46] Paolo ⁭: Is the spacer open source too now?
[2024-10-11T19:24:48] haku: aftee gym. yes
[2024-10-11T19:25:40] GABE: need more fiber sheet ino
[2024-10-11T19:25:41] haku: wait because i still need to weld the nickle strips for the balance cables
[2024-10-11T19:25:58] GABE: dont need that dw
[2024-10-11T19:26:03] haku: also consider the fishpaper and epoxy sheet in between
[2024-10-11T19:28:48] haku: we work on safety here boys. if i have to spend on all the materials to make it safe so be it. i cannot dissapoint the battery lords or they will demote me back to peasant level

[2024-10-11T19:55:43] Patrick: No the same problem
[2024-10-11T19:55:57] Patrick: I tried via phone bridge and also via tcp
[2024-10-11T19:56:24] Patrick: Everytime the same problem 😢
[2024-10-11T19:56:59] haku: once the battery lords promote me to free citizen i will be allowed to sell batteries
[2024-10-11T19:57:28] haku: to get to that level i need to learn cad
[2024-10-11T20:00:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: doing my first tests but the front wheel keeps slipping

[2024-10-11T20:01:46] haku: sorry to keep asking
[2024-10-11T20:02:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not bridge, only phone
[2024-10-11T20:02:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That's what we're here for, to ask questions. Those who don't like being asked questions will do badly in life 🤣🤣🤣 Yes 33x2 70h

[2024-10-11T20:04:00] GABE: No need
[2024-10-11T20:04:20] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I don't understand anything about programming, I just raise or lower the A's of the controllers
[2024-10-11T20:04:51] haku: no you need to be certified free citizen. need documents. thats the rules
[2024-10-11T20:05:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: For now, as Gabe says, it is not necessary. The front wheel continues to skid at 133 km/h.
[2024-10-11T20:06:18] haku: dam thats crazy. but if you decide to push it. power is always there
[2024-10-11T20:06:30] haku: big battery
[2024-10-11T20:06:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: and I have a problem where I live there is not enough straight tea to see how much I can achieve
[2024-10-11T20:07:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: As you say, the power is there, but the power without control...
[2024-10-11T20:07:55] haku: thats true
[2024-10-11T20:08:55] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: but we will keep trying until someone decides to help me configure until then we will continue going up and down A 🤣🤣🤣
[2024-10-11T21:12:01] GABE: Battery tech is unexplainable atm to anyone who doesn't know what it is
[2024-10-11T21:12:34] GABE: Never in ever would this happen if NIMH was the only option
[2024-10-11T21:13:01] GABE: I did love my NiMH cells tho, damn that was 10y ago or so.
[2024-10-11T21:13:08] GABE: Thats a decade
[2024-10-11T21:21:37] haku: @jamessoderstrom this is stamped yea?

[2024-10-11T23:01:02] GABE: If I dropped a moli once or twice is it dangerous @jamessoderstrom
[2024-10-11T23:01:16] GABE: my floor is wood so it doesnt absorb much
[2024-10-11T23:01:18] NetworkDir: @SibClimb :D
[2024-10-11T23:02:23] NetworkDir: I just set lower phase because motor can't handle 400A and got stature But now with new values very fuckeria
[2024-10-11T23:04:18] Rose: Hey there Se, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-10-11T23:33:09] NetworkDir: 50C very fine for 35kW on cl350

[2024-10-11T23:33:19] Yamal: 💃🪩
[2024-10-11T23:34:25] Yamal: You are revolutionizing your country! set up the business now
[2024-10-11T23:35:42] NetworkDir: In here people prefer shunting controllers lmfao so selling vesc should hard I recommended vesc to volkan, and volkan asked vesc from friends they said vesc just drone controller lol
[2024-10-12T00:03:16] Yamal: tell him to buy a pair of Ly75/80h 33/2 engines
[2024-10-12T00:10:11] Yamal: And you
[2024-10-12T00:10:53] Yamal: He have shop right? You need a frame brother ……. :(
[2024-10-12T00:11:05] Yamal: Zero die
[2024-10-12T00:11:05] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-12T00:12:16] NetworkDir: I will weld neck with tig
[2024-10-12T00:14:05] Yamal: Why don't you look for something different?
[2024-10-12T00:14:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What?
[2024-10-12T00:15:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh my bad , i miss read 🤣
[2024-10-12T00:15:43] Yamal: After a chassis break, it is the best way to turn the page xD
[2024-10-12T00:17:41] Yamal: How are those scooters going?
[2024-10-12T00:21:29] Yamal: You, who are a man of knowledge, wanted to contrast a doubt and a question at the same time about how long the standard 4mm phases can last safely,,?
[2024-10-12T00:23:57] Yamal: Good old Roscheee has already told me that 180A, no prob, over 200 gonna be critical,,
[2024-10-12T00:25:16] Yamal: shit phases,? xd Better to change them if you want to handle decent phase amps without having to cook rasta pasta
[2024-10-12T00:25:16] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-12T00:36:41] Jan: No prob = i didnt blow yet
[2024-10-12T00:40:20] Yamal: Don’t understand Jan
[2024-10-12T00:40:28] Yamal: ^^'
[2024-10-12T00:42:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Slow lot other stuff going on
[2024-10-12T00:44:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Always better to have max thick what fits
[2024-10-12T00:44:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Standard on what / what kind usage?
[2024-10-12T00:46:14] haku: lmao

[2024-10-12T00:48:40] haku: we need a jrev reunion like ice cube and dr. dre.
[2024-10-12T00:51:14] haku: oh no. punedir is world champ now then. we need a comeback
[2024-10-12T00:52:26] Yamal: I say standard, because at least the 60h type motors that I know of come with 4mm phases, what type of use? Well, I don't scooter every day, some time on the circuit, some stretches at night on the highway 130kmh xD normal, day to day
[2024-10-12T00:53:09] haku: punedir getting all the girls with zero10 world champ
[2024-10-12T00:53:15] Yamal: you don't like them anymore?
[2024-10-12T00:55:23] Yamal: Likewise, it is understood that running above 200A phase is not safe.
[2024-10-12T00:56:19] Yamal: and peculiarly we like to race with the scooters and make them work and raise numbers
[2024-10-12T00:57:25] NetworkDir: No i mean just i will repair zero and use like old No new frame or scooter
[2024-10-12T00:57:42] haku: get a moto and electric it
[2024-10-12T00:57:51] Yamal: I mean going fast, burning the tires and ensuring that everything reaches temperature simultaneously.
[2024-10-12T00:58:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Working quite well
[2024-10-12T01:00:03] Yamal: Sad,,,The TUNE electric scooter is already a fact and a lifestyle, and thanks to the Leon de Bejaming we can flow with an unprecedented pure wave
[2024-10-12T01:01:10] Yamal: my congratulations on your Trojan horse!!! By the way, you have 2 identical ones, right?
[2024-10-12T01:01:21] Yamal: Red and black,,?
[2024-10-12T01:02:02] Yamal: Base thunder
[2024-10-12T01:02:45] Yamal: France can! you can't? XD
[2024-10-12T01:02:45] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-12T01:24:06] haku: all europeans like fancy brands. like clothes and stuff? i noticed that before when i used to work at a hotel. they come in armani and royal oak watches
[2024-10-12T01:24:46] haku: is that the culture there. fancy brands?
[2024-10-12T01:27:00] haku: i used to work at a 5star hotel. thats what ive noticed
[2024-10-12T01:27:40] Jan: Rich people dont wear that shit. The "brands" they wear are bespoke clothing and usually most people have never heard of. No logo, nothing, just perfectly fitting
[2024-10-12T01:28:10] Jan: Zegna Bespoke Clothing for example
[2024-10-12T01:28:48] haku: i see. i noticed this too with chinese gamblers. they come in in flip flops and funny hats but have deep pockets
[2024-10-12T01:29:16] haku: i thought its just eu culture
[2024-10-12T01:30:02] Jan: Non bespoke tshirt in merino wool. You cant even put it into the washing machine. You have people doing chemical laundry for you
[2024-10-12T01:30:25] Jan: 1985CHF ~ 2300USD
[2024-10-12T01:30:38] Jan: Bespoke clothing is way higher
[2024-10-12T01:30:39] Yamal: I have always cared little about clothes, I really need to buy clothes, I don't have any!!! Now I spend everything I can on scooters, and why not? It is a hobby, a sport when you enter the circuit, which also acts as a vehicle, it is a way to clear your mind and blow away a little of all the shit that is happening these days.
[2024-10-12T01:31:00] haku: wow. thats insane
[2024-10-12T01:32:04] haku: i didnt even know that existed. i thought kanye has the most expensive clothing brand. dear lord
[2024-10-12T01:32:21] Jan: Also saying that luxury brands dont make adds is also untrue, you are just not in the target audience bracket to receive it
[2024-10-12T01:32:24] Yamal: Crazy ..
[2024-10-12T01:32:58] Jan: Your phone is always listening, attend multiple entrepreneurship forums and see how your phone adds change
[2024-10-12T01:33:07] Jan: Thats insane
[2024-10-12T01:33:50] haku: im good with fruit of the loom. maybe my most branded shirt is old navy 😭
[2024-10-12T01:33:54] Yamal: Cotton 100x100 10/15$ is the way
[2024-10-12T01:34:15] Yamal: Zegna is…..😂💥
[2024-10-12T01:34:20] Jan: Dont wear fancy shit, its a trap
[2024-10-12T01:34:20] Yamal: Shit bro
[2024-10-12T01:34:41] haku: but i did notice europeans are really fashionable. proper fitting suits and stuff
[2024-10-12T01:35:14] Jan: Yeah but you dont need crazy money spendings on it
[2024-10-12T01:35:28] Yamal: The people who use zegna are precisely the people who take their own lives or suffer from constant depression xD
[2024-10-12T01:35:38] Jan: Real rich is Income >>>> Spendings
[2024-10-12T01:36:04] Jan: Nobody buys non bespoke there
[2024-10-12T01:36:12] haku: money making money. they dont have to work.
[2024-10-12T01:36:27] Jan: The people there go in on a tuesday and spend 50-100k usd
[2024-10-12T01:36:34] Jan: On like 3-4 items
[2024-10-12T01:36:40] haku: wow.
[2024-10-12T01:38:34] Jan: They really dont buy to impress others
[2024-10-12T01:38:57] haku: like rion? not waterproof?
[2024-10-12T01:38:59] Jan: If you can buy there, you dont use laundry machines
[2024-10-12T01:39:21] Jan: You have services doing the necessary steps, whatever the cost
[2024-10-12T01:39:25] Yamal: I know a place in my city that sells second-hand THE NORTH FACE jackets that come from northern Europe, maybe one is from Jan for €10 😂👌✍️
[2024-10-12T01:39:49] Jan: I have a 10$ jacket
[2024-10-12T01:39:54] Jan: For the workshop
[2024-10-12T01:39:57] Jan: Its perfect
[2024-10-12T01:40:03] haku: the butler will get it done.
[2024-10-12T01:40:11] haku: haha
[2024-10-12T01:40:23] Yamal: I love mountain clothing, both summer and winter, it is clothing, with real benefits, technical clothing
[2024-10-12T01:51:06] Noname: I buy my clothes from Tractor Supply or Wal-Mart. If they don't survive the washer I don't want them.
[2024-10-12T01:52:19] Yamal: They also have to survive your routes
[2024-10-12T01:52:57] Yamal: you look like crossing rivers with the e-moto
[2024-10-12T01:55:36] haku: fancy boy carthart here
[2024-10-12T01:59:17] Noname: Just the pants. Mart stopped selling faded glory. It was a whole thing finding pants I liked
[2024-10-12T02:01:50] haku: i have to admitt carthart is very rugged very good quality
[2024-10-12T02:02:54] haku: its how nothface used to be. now northface went the way of lululemon
[2024-10-12T02:02:57] Noname: It's $$$$$$
[2024-10-12T02:04:47] haku: designer clothes is the word i was looking for describing european guests

[2024-10-12T02:41:54] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-12T02:50:24] Noname: Upgrade from rice? Don't spend all that Ebike money

[2024-10-12T06:04:20] Noname: Definitely
[2024-10-12T06:04:52] Noname: Gotta do a dual fold soon
[2024-10-12T06:04:52] haku: also the little bms leads welds might touch so i need to also think about that
[2024-10-12T06:07:25] Noname: Paper and board spacer be alright. You'll have a gap then just tape and paper them down. Prob should have offset but a lil late
[2024-10-12T06:09:31] Noname: Well my 20s turned into 19s but 18 is easier to build a battery box. Sucks cause it's a weird layout 6s x 3
[2024-10-12T06:16:03] haku: dang. i think thats how those big packs are done. folded multiple times
[2024-10-12T06:16:26] haku: big square packs
[2024-10-12T06:17:13] Noname: I just have to jump over a full cell to connect 3rd then from bottom to top with copper
[2024-10-12T06:22:50] haku: is this best steering geometry?
[2024-10-12T06:23:30] Yamal: I think not 😂

[2024-10-12T11:24:50] GABE: Fuck, the cells get destroyed when I tear off everything. Craters and Bends are made. Glad i only took a few apart. Taking It slowly prevented me from fucking everything up I'm gonna have to take not all of it off and weld over. I underestimated the 801D.
[2024-10-12T11:29:03] GABE: 👍 The calm mind wins. Left copper on most of them months ago because I have a bad trimmer.
[2024-10-12T12:04:16] NetworkDir: put some solder and use it :D
[2024-10-12T12:36:14] GABE: This happens when I double weld in the same spot. I did this for 20 cells or so..That's 70€ gone there.
[2024-10-12T12:36:16] GABE: It is what it is
[2024-10-12T12:36:24] GABE: At least I didn't do it on 4/5 of them.

[2024-10-13T19:49:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This would fit the zero10x
[2024-10-13T20:44:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So it's ok
[2024-10-13T21:38:06] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I use this tire, it was recommended to me by @jamaludin_algarnati, it works really really well
[2024-10-13T21:46:51] haku: i have that on the laotie motor. not bad
[2024-10-13T21:50:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <animation>
[2024-10-13T21:51:02] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: There you can see them
[2024-10-13T21:53:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Are you sure it's the same size ?
[2024-10-13T21:53:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Those are 80/65
[2024-10-13T21:54:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think u have 90/65
[2024-10-13T21:55:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: no sorry you use 10 we use 11
[2024-10-13T21:56:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ok I get it u better than me
[2024-10-13T21:57:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Checking motor heat ?
[2024-10-13T22:17:53] Rose: Hey there ג'ונגלר מהז'ורנל, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-10-13T22:21:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, we were doing a setup and the rear engine got so hot that we left it for tomorrow 🤣🤣
[2024-10-13T22:21:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: No man, we are not better alone, we are just crazy people 🤣
[2024-10-13T22:24:47] cihan: @PaoloWu could you tell more about the timer you're using for TIG welding? By the way I couldn't find any cheap 100 bucks TIG welder but I found some for 180. Are you TIG welding batteries without argon gas? Are TIG and MIG welders the same machine? Do they become MIG welder with consumable electrode and TIG welder with tungsten electrode? Is this the only difference?
[2024-10-13T22:25:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hot from setup ?
[2024-10-13T22:27:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If that's why we leave it and continue tomorrow, we put a lot of power into it
[2024-10-13T22:27:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can u hold your hand to it ?
[2024-10-13T22:28:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If yes not too hot yet
[2024-10-13T22:31:00] Roland 11x: Hi everyone What do you think better for 800-1000w hub motors: 30-40% field start or 90% like the default and whats the diffrents actually? Thanks
[2024-10-13T22:34:18] GABE: If it's single motor then no fwk better
[2024-10-13T22:34:22] GABE: 90%
[2024-10-13T22:34:26] GABE: Duty cycle
[2024-10-13T22:34:32] GABE: You don't want it to hit earlier Or no field is made
[2024-10-13T22:35:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm on 90 btw
[2024-10-13T22:36:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also in this group the belief is that phase amps better then filed but I'm yet to try it
[2024-10-13T22:37:16] Andrei Albert: Yea
[2024-10-13T22:49:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No we just had a problem that the motor chocked in high % but I think it was a vesc/fw issue since I don't get that problem anymore
[2024-10-13T22:58:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yet to try

[2024-10-13T23:03:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <sticker>
[2024-10-13T23:03:28] haku: what does that do anyway? can you explain
[2024-10-13T23:03:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Same question I'm asking
[2024-10-13T23:03:47] haku: i still have alot to learn from the lords
[2024-10-13T23:03:59] haku: of the vesc realm
[2024-10-13T23:06:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So he is wrong
[2024-10-13T23:08:17] haku: im ready to wage war on these chinamen if i dont get my parts this week. im about to drop the paypal bomb.
[2024-10-13T23:08:46] haku: chinamen killing chinamen
[2024-10-13T23:09:21] haku: im on my wits end with these people
[2024-10-13T23:09:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Better to turn a safety feature off?
[2024-10-13T23:10:42] haku: my messages left read but no reply is very non professional
[2024-10-13T23:11:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For a second I thought u ware tallking to me ahah
[2024-10-13T23:11:25] haku: thats not how we make deals in america. these people gonna learn today
[2024-10-13T23:12:28] haku: i dont give af if its pride month in china and your not suposse to answer customers
[2024-10-13T23:16:05] haku: i have a good heart. ill give em 24h to reply or the paypal bombs and ali dispute bombs start flying
[2024-10-13T23:28:43] NetworkDir: Turn on slow abs = turn off safety feature Turn off slow abs = turn on safety feature Basically after enabling this option abs over current smoother and slowly triggered and if any short circuit available the controller cocked
[2024-10-13T23:31:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ok but if turn off and over courrent error (at least in my old 75200)
[2024-10-13T23:32:19] Noname: My friends pos he drives to work. He got cut off and hit a car. Still works but bent wheel etc we need him to upgrade
[2024-10-13T23:32:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: just a few seconds 💥
[2024-10-13T23:32:37] Noname: Found this and he thinks it's ugly for 600$ prob less it's been listed a while
[2024-10-13T23:35:03] haku: i like his style.
[2024-10-13T23:35:27] Noname: What breaking down all the time lol
[2024-10-13T23:35:35] haku: was it welded? by him?
[2024-10-13T23:35:54] Noname: K4 frame bolted to a razor drift trike neck
[2024-10-13T23:36:02] Noname: The k4 snapped
[2024-10-13T23:36:15] haku: dang
[2024-10-13T23:36:48] Noname: Rather not spatula him off the road
[2024-10-13T23:39:14] haku: is this electric too?
[2024-10-13T23:39:20] Noname: Yeah
[2024-10-13T23:39:23] Noname: 72v
[2024-10-13T23:39:39] haku: oh wow. whats it called
[2024-10-13T23:39:43] haku: thats pretty neat
[2024-10-13T23:43:32] Noname: ZEV T 6000 L
[2024-10-13T23:43:48] Noname: He has 20s batterys so it's just plug in his and ride
[2024-10-13T23:44:04] Noname: It's like 12 yrs old
[2024-10-13T23:45:54] haku: big moped tires is cool though
[2024-10-13T23:57:10] Yamal: Waiting for speed test..? What happen
[2024-10-13T23:57:38] haku: have faith my brother
[2024-10-13T23:58:04] Yamal: The boss has gone to a party and has forgotten about us...?
[2024-10-13T23:58:05] Yamal: :(
[2024-10-13T23:58:46] haku: they are toasting to success.
[2024-10-13T23:59:57] NetworkDir: If you got over current error you should set more abs current and if still happens try another observer like Ortega :)
[2024-10-14T00:00:40] haku: popping champagne my boy. that means something yea
[2024-10-14T00:00:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Now on mxlemmings used to be on ortage
[2024-10-14T00:02:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Over current error when passing 150a phase (now that I set 120a I'm closer to to abs so closer to error )
[2024-10-14T00:04:02] Yamal: Be carefully with over current
[2024-10-14T00:04:40] NetworkDir: 1.3x of phase should fine for abs current Maximum 1.5x If you put 120A phase 160-180A abs current should fine
[2024-10-14T00:05:22] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-10-14T00:05:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But I'm with 84100 (I think the max is 150 on it)
[2024-10-14T00:05:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He died ? (Not supposed to )
[2024-10-14T00:06:20] Yamal: Not .. just sleepy xD
[2024-10-14T00:06:31] NetworkDir: Abs over current happens when your motor detection bad Your motor got stature Your abs current low Your controller bullshit
[2024-10-14T00:06:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: On
[2024-10-14T00:06:53] Yamal: Waiting to change the pcb ? XD
[2024-10-14T00:07:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Detection is ok (I think) abs current currently on 155a and controller ok not good nor bad (as far as I can say)
[2024-10-14T00:09:35] Yamal: why vesc instead of nutt
[2024-10-14T00:09:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ha ? Nutt ?
[2024-10-14T00:10:05] Yamal: NICCC
[2024-10-14T00:10:08] Yamal: NUCC
[2024-10-14T00:10:17] Yamal: i mean
[2024-10-14T00:10:44] Yamal: Nucc f24
[2024-10-14T00:10:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Money have you heard of it? (Well if you did I don't have it)
[2024-10-14T00:10:57] Yamal: Hehe
[2024-10-14T00:12:00] Yamal: thanks to the money you ended up in vesc. d
[2024-10-14T00:13:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but money for dual nuc is a lot also nuc for 50h motors is a waste of a good controller
[2024-10-14T00:13:16] Yamal: If you had money would you start NUCC? or larger vesc controllers?
[2024-10-14T00:13:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't know I've fallen in love with vesc
[2024-10-14T00:14:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If I had the money I would I've started first with a better frame
[2024-10-14T00:14:58] Yamal: That's what I wanted to hear brother, thank you for your words, we're starting a great day, time to look for a donut xD
[2024-10-14T00:15:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Strating?
[2024-10-14T00:16:20] Yamal: <photos/photo_18442@14-10-2024_00-16-20.jpg>
[2024-10-14T00:16:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Nami or dualtron (maybe zero11x or vest11/10 or the wollf )
[2024-10-14T00:16:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wow u so far ahead in life
[2024-10-14T00:16:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: We don't have inmotion RS here
[2024-10-14T00:17:17] Yamal: But the zero still okay
[2024-10-14T00:17:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (or the vestt11 but can get part by part and assemble)
[2024-10-14T00:17:37] Yamal: It has good things too, it is not heavy
[2024-10-14T00:17:54] Yamal: Nami or thunder
[2024-10-14T00:17:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: We have the 11x also its ok but big
[2024-10-14T00:18:05] Yamal: Zero 11 x very heavy
[2024-10-14T00:18:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: We have the thunder but price is ^^^^^^
[2024-10-14T00:18:45] Yamal: …..
[2024-10-14T00:19:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: .
[2024-10-14T00:19:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: See there a lot of examples of very high prices
[2024-10-14T00:19:51] Yamal: Victor luxury
[2024-10-14T00:20:00] Yamal: Also new for what
[2024-10-14T00:20:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: All of the dualtrons look the same
[2024-10-14T00:20:20] Yamal: When you want to cook your own soul..
[2024-10-14T00:21:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: .
[2024-10-14T00:21:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (72/30)
[2024-10-14T00:21:28] Yamal: but the measurements are not the same,,
[2024-10-14T00:21:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Need to see irl to notice
[2024-10-14T00:21:51] Yamal: important battery and controller capacity
[2024-10-14T00:22:14] Yamal: ideal second-hand market..
[2024-10-14T00:23:27] Yamal: Another good thing, if you ever plan to travel to Europe, come with a large and empty suitcase, you save some money and you come back with a dualtron chassis
[2024-10-14T00:23:40] Yamal: it's not a joke
[2024-10-14T00:24:03] haku: can i come back with a lambo?
[2024-10-14T00:24:50] Yamal: Lambo or Ferrari , YES , YOU CAN!
[2024-10-14T00:24:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: To here no ahah
[2024-10-14T00:25:34] Yamal: Why is just aluminum
[2024-10-14T00:25:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (very high sucrity and customs in Israel)
[2024-10-14T00:25:59] Yamal: Is frame to go to school
[2024-10-14T00:26:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: First of all it's heavy
[2024-10-14T00:26:13] Yamal: Nothing bad..
[2024-10-14T00:26:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe part by part with friends
[2024-10-14T00:26:35] Yamal: You have 25/32kg for travel
[2024-10-14T00:26:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Each guy a part
[2024-10-14T00:26:44] Yamal: Can XD
[2024-10-14T00:27:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also no plans to leave Israel at the moment
[2024-10-14T00:27:36] Yamal: I mean in the future
[2024-10-14T00:27:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Let's see what scooters we have here let me pull a website
[2024-10-14T00:28:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Meh maybe
[2024-10-14T00:32:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Rate
[2024-10-14T00:33:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: We have also thunder and spider and wollf and zero11x and a maybe more but they don't carry them
[2024-10-14T00:41:51] 'lekrsu': Thanks, I'll remember to do this before the next rides
[2024-10-14T00:43:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Dualtron x limited is 11k here (hard to find also)
[2024-10-14T00:57:34] Pandalgns: Hey @punedir I have a question for you, let's see if you can help me, how much maximum voltage can the 84200hp support? In theory they are 84v but in practice do they support more? Will it support it around 23s?
[2024-10-14T00:58:02] NetworkDir: 84V max
[2024-10-14T00:58:29] Pandalgns: Max max and no one volt more??
[2024-10-14T00:58:30] NetworkDir: 23s very dangerous on makerbase even components support
[2024-10-14T00:58:38] NetworkDir: No
[2024-10-14T00:58:42] Pandalgns: Fuck
[2024-10-14T00:58:55] NetworkDir: For more voltage you can buy tronic 3shul or bulild mp2
[2024-10-14T00:59:18] Pandalgns: I was thinking about 23s but I see that it will not be feasible
[2024-10-14T00:59:51] NetworkDir: Use 20s with more current ^^^
[2024-10-14T01:00:08] Pandalgns: they are very expensive😭
[2024-10-14T01:00:54] Pandalgns: 20s 10p p45b... I have plenty of current haha
[2024-10-14T01:02:21] NetworkDir: Yeah unfortunately
[2024-10-14T01:02:45] NetworkDir: Maybe 75200 without regen but anyway i dont advice
[2024-10-14T01:17:42] haku: good lawd. what european accent is this lmao. https://youtube.com/shorts/EYECiwXd7p4?si=SbsyfDu-7R6cgK16

[2024-10-14T01:35:12] Yamal: but it needs some modification for better cooling.
[2024-10-14T01:35:31] Yamal: Seven… 600$

[2024-10-14T03:13:31] haku: i want to see if i can get another frame. maybe goodwill has em
[2024-10-14T03:14:06] Noname: Balance bike prob best choice
[2024-10-14T03:14:30] haku: balance bike has plastic wheels but yes good idea on the 12" ones

[2024-10-14T05:09:03] Noname: Well fix it and add more padding to the side of it damn you
[2024-10-14T05:11:23] Yamal: Almost finish
[2024-10-14T05:12:03] Yamal: The emotobikehypere-scooter will be ready soon!
[2024-10-14T05:12:58] haku: this bms wiring is a mimdfuck dude.
[2024-10-14T05:15:06] Yamal: you are an artist👍
[2024-10-14T05:16:56] Yamal: I want to start doing my things too, Not making batteries but assembling my controllers and little by little gaining skill with the soldering iron vs tin ^^'
[2024-10-14T05:21:22] haku: takes 5 yrs to learn this profession son.
[2024-10-14T05:21:23] Yamal: What I don't understand is why you haven't connected your Samsung battery to even go for a ride around your city, after so much time, I wouldn't have lasted, of course, I like driving the scooter more than having it on a bench making modifications to it.
[2024-10-14T05:21:26] haku: just kidding
[2024-10-14T05:23:14] haku: that will be crimped in parallel
[2024-10-14T05:23:26] haku: no crimper yet
[2024-10-14T05:23:35] Yamal: Yes I know .. 👍
[2024-10-14T05:24:04] haku: with the blessings of the battery lords.
[2024-10-14T05:24:34] Yamal: A few days is ready !
[2024-10-14T05:24:45] haku: yep
[2024-10-14T05:25:00] haku: if nothing blows up
[2024-10-14T05:25:53] Yamal: Have you already bought the cat woman leather jumpsuit in case you fall?
[2024-10-14T05:26:20] Yamal: XD
[2024-10-14T05:26:27] haku: i got poison ivy green.
[2024-10-14T05:41:54] Yamal: I like this way to conect the phase motor also hall sensor
[2024-10-14T05:42:36] Yamal: What are 8mm bullet connectors?
[2024-10-14T05:46:06] haku: no idea
[2024-10-14T05:46:57] haku: maybe 8mm.
[2024-10-14T05:55:36] Yamal: You use 8mm?
[2024-10-14T05:59:26] haku: no 10mm
[2024-10-14T05:59:43] haku: because of the spintend 2 10awg
[2024-10-14T06:25:29] haku: what a midfuck of a bms wiring.
[2024-10-14T06:29:18] Yamal: The good thing is that the battery fits in a good box, you fit it well and you put Netflix on it, and let's see the world!
[2024-10-14T06:29:36] Yamal: What I mean is that it is well protected.
[2024-10-14T06:30:23] haku: i need a welded box. but its expensive
[2024-10-14T06:30:44] Yamal: For Samsung battery,?
[2024-10-14T06:31:27] Yamal: You are going to have a huge amount of autonomy and a brutal discharge!!!!!
[2024-10-14T06:32:27] Yamal: If I were you, to celebrate, I would lose the map for a weekend with your e-motorcycle to cover the kilometers and reflect a little.
[2024-10-14T06:33:18] Yamal: fast charger backpack, some food for the road and some money, find your own adventure!
[2024-10-14T06:35:14] Yamal: Google Maps is the key to organizing your routes, kilometers vs autonomy
[2024-10-14T06:35:14] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-14T06:36:19] haku: no money. just ride broke. 😭
[2024-10-14T06:36:57] haku: have to say making batteries can be exhausting. need alot of focus wich i dont have
[2024-10-14T06:41:51] Noname: He's 100mi through the desert till next town.

[2024-10-14T07:03:33] haku: i still like my boys peak g30 if i can only strap a big battery lol

[2024-10-14T07:27:23] Yamal: https://maps.app.goo.gl/NzuvCWLdVvjJxHJz9?g_st=it
[2024-10-14T07:28:53] Yamal: I see many nice places I don’t know what happen with google maps and the screenshots
[2024-10-14T07:29:33] Yamal: Also is nice conect “citys “
[2024-10-14T07:33:52] Noname: Only way there is highway

[2024-10-14T07:34:46] haku: theres a bike lane
[2024-10-14T07:35:01] haku: its not a freeway
[2024-10-14T07:35:19] Yamal: Many placesssssssssss
[2024-10-14T07:35:33] Yamal: 55 highway!!!!
[2024-10-14T07:35:54] haku: i dont want to leave the hood. thats my bubble. im protected by the thuggish ruggish bones
[2024-10-14T07:35:58] Yamal: Or relax bike line the both are nice
[2024-10-14T07:36:22] Yamal: :(
[2024-10-14T07:40:24] Yamal: race against the surron?
[2024-10-14T07:46:56] Yamal: You could also write to Allien rides, for a review of your e-bike!! I do not recommend Voro motor, because they are not going to want you to ruin their industry.
[2024-10-14T07:48:27] Yamal: ROADRUNNER? 🤣
[2024-10-14T07:48:27] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-14T07:51:59] haku: the mini bike roadrunner is actually good
[2024-10-14T07:52:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2024-10-14T08:03:52] Yamal: It will be, but light years from your performance
[2024-10-14T08:04:15] haku: hopefully.
[2024-10-14T08:04:51] haku: mine is all custom though. empty frame with my parts
[2024-10-14T08:05:41] haku: but that riadrunner minibike is has a pretty good package just expensive. maybe my whole setup costs around one of those
[2024-10-14T08:06:50] haku: im happy i finally close to finishing it. its been a year of these parts laying around
[2024-10-14T08:11:03] Yamal: autonomy and power, top-notch motors and electronics, with heart attack cells and pure Vedder wave backup
[2024-10-14T08:11:14] puneDir: Accidents suck
[2024-10-14T08:11:21] Yamal: Again?
[2024-10-14T08:11:28] Yamal: Hey what happen
[2024-10-14T08:12:01] Yamal: You lost your girlfriend and you don't care about your life or what
[2024-10-14T08:12:09] puneDir: Not again
[2024-10-14T08:12:16] puneDir: No but my zero is damaged slightly
[2024-10-14T08:12:25] Yamal: XD just kidding, but many time in a little time
[2024-10-14T08:12:26] haku: where?
[2024-10-14T08:12:28] puneDir: I need to fix the extender
[2024-10-14T08:12:36] puneDir: Extender and damper broke
[2024-10-14T08:12:44] puneDir: Tbh zero is strong lol
[2024-10-14T08:12:58] puneDir: I expected it to snap in 3 places after crash
[2024-10-14T08:13:10] haku: those are printed parts. just make another one
[2024-10-14T08:13:33] haku: or have someone mill you an aluminum one
[2024-10-14T08:13:52] puneDir: It would cost more than zero
[2024-10-14T08:14:10] Yamal: the zeros are complicated lately..
[2024-10-14T08:14:14] haku: i thought its cheap in turkey
[2024-10-14T08:15:25] Yamal: Extender is the stem?
[2024-10-14T08:16:04] puneDir: No
[2024-10-14T08:16:14] puneDir: <photos/photo_18453@14-10-2024_08-16-14.jpg>

[2024-10-14T08:16:35] puneDir: I crashed to car like 50 kmh and this is the only damage
[2024-10-14T08:16:39] Yamal: This is cheap to do right
[2024-10-14T08:17:02] puneDir: Car driver said i can pay for the scooter but i said no thank you
[2024-10-14T08:18:25] Yamal: Tell him that $3,500 is what he is worth, and that you forgive him the sentimental part.
[2024-10-14T08:18:45] Yamal: And buy new hehe
[2024-10-14T08:18:49] puneDir: 😄😄😄😄

[2024-10-14T10:22:11] GABE: So I'll start assembling the scooter in 3 weeks or so
[2024-10-14T10:22:45] GABE: Not gonna weld a 6p because those cells can't handle another rip off, I can tell
[2024-10-14T10:23:15] GABE: I'll wait till I get a measurement for a real cell
[2024-10-14T10:31:29] iMarek: good day please I seriously need help. is it possible to control the controller for Vsett 10 without the display directly and only the throttle? thank you for the info🙏🏻

[2024-10-14T12:01:34] Andrei Albert: Its not tje original one
[2024-10-14T12:03:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe that is why it broke because it's not an original bolt also the teeth of the bolt aren't the kind they using in scooters the gap between is too big (for the lack of a shorter and better explanation)

[2024-10-14T19:58:21] NetworkDir: yeah i build it
[2024-10-14T19:59:05] Pandalgns: so you are the engineer of the display project
[2024-10-14T19:59:26] Pandalgns: I thought it was pune's work 😅😅
[2024-10-14T20:00:36] Pandalgns: Well, if you could help me with this, I would be very grateful.
[2024-10-14T20:01:04] Pandalgns: I don't know anything about Arduino and I'm quite useless with programming.
[2024-10-14T20:01:37] NetworkDir: yeah no problem message me on DM
[2024-10-14T20:01:53] Pandalgns: Ooook thx mate ❤️

[2024-10-14T20:39:02] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): And now a CAN version ;) although many required data might not be available on CANbus ("V%d Current" "A" (canget-current id)) ("V%d Current In" "A" (canget-current-in id)) ("V%d Duty" (canget-duty id)) ("V%d RPM" (canget-rpm id)) ("V%d Temp Fet" "degC" 1 (canget-temp-fet id)) ("V%d Temp Motor" "degC" 1 (canget-temp-motor id)) ("V%d ADC1" "V" (canget-adc id 0)) ("V%d ADC2" "V" (canget-adc id 1))
[2024-10-14T20:46:00] haku: dam what is this alien language
[2024-10-14T20:46:14] haku: i need to learn it
[2024-10-14T20:46:28] NetworkDir: can version need transmitter
[2024-10-14T20:46:40] NetworkDir: esp32 can't directly use CAN protocol
[2024-10-14T20:53:40] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): I know ... but thats easy 1 euro item ... using it already for VESC Express :)
[2024-10-14T20:54:36] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): ESP32 C3 Mini + can
[2024-10-14T20:55:22] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32224361513.html
[2024-10-14T20:57:44] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Hmmmm maybe just an SPI display already enough i had to test an SSD1306 on it working.
[2024-10-14T20:58:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What is that for ?
[2024-10-14T20:58:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Isn't can just 2 wires between vescs ?
[2024-10-14T20:59:03] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): It can hook up with a GPS + SD Card and logs directly on the SDcard and also makes it possible to connect the VESC via Wifi + BT
[2024-10-14T20:59:29] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Here more info on the original one: https://trampaboards.com/vesc-express--p-34857.html
[2024-10-14T20:59:38] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): But you can DIY
[2024-10-14T21:00:33] NetworkDir: yeah true but currently i try to rebuild bullshit codes after fixing i will add canbus option
[2024-10-14T21:01:18] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): No hurry ... yesterday ready is ok 🤣🤣🤣🤣

[2024-10-14T22:24:55] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2024-10-14T22:25:25] NetworkDir: Volta electric bikes shitty I think

[2024-10-15T00:19:23] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Could it be because of the programming?
[2024-10-15T00:21:29] haku: whoa that sounds strange
[2024-10-15T00:21:57] Yamal: Super nami !!!!!!!!
[2024-10-15T00:22:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's very strange, it's only at that speed, no more, no less.
[2024-10-15T00:23:01] haku: im not sure what it is. you might want to ask vessc help
[2024-10-15T00:24:23] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'm going to do that, good idea
[2024-10-15T00:27:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It could be because the programming only does it at that speed, no more, no less.
[2024-10-15T01:00:45] haku: dam huameng axles are smaller than LY. ill just have to use the ly ones.

[2024-10-15T02:51:29] Yamal: Since everything is so expensive, in the end we will end up living in something like this...
[2024-10-15T02:52:00] Yamal: I'm happy with having a power outlet to charge the scooter.
[2024-10-15T02:55:30] Noname: Same my house is to big and expensive. Just need a garage
[2024-10-15T03:04:40] Noname: @jamaludin_algarnati what?
[2024-10-15T03:12:04] Yamal: nothing, sometimes I don't understand what you say or I don't know how to put it into context xD
[2024-10-15T03:12:39] Yamal: or I just understand it wrong
[2024-10-15T03:14:22] haku: that commie talk boy
[2024-10-15T03:15:09] haku: i chose to live a tiny shed lifestyle. not kamalas choice
[2024-10-15T03:17:46] Noname: I literally sleep upstairs in 1 out of 3 rooms otherwise I'm sitting in basement workshop. Tornado could rip off the first floor I might not notice for a week
[2024-10-15T03:18:33] haku: also no one wants to clean a big house
[2024-10-15T03:20:03] Yamal: ……

[2024-10-15T03:38:35] Yamal: https://youtu.be/AmQmVJyeMSU?si=1dQSScSumiNpEbbR
[2024-10-15T03:39:23] Yamal: Very nice ,, Gaste 4500€ and after mount vesc ….. sad and cool
[2024-10-15T03:49:47] Yamal: Fardrive controller ..
[2024-10-15T04:01:02] haku: fardriver is cheap but pretty reliable ive heard. its just big af
[2024-10-15T04:01:34] haku: they also have touch screen displays now
[2024-10-15T04:05:22] haku: my frame can fit 2x 96530 or 72480. but i will not betray the vesc brotherhood
[2024-10-15T04:07:23] haku: i have made my home here. aint no way baby. unless its free or 50%off
[2024-10-15T04:07:48] Noname: You have to pay to update fardrver
[2024-10-15T04:07:58] Noname: It's like a subscription
[2024-10-15T04:08:11] Noname: Vesc forever
[2024-10-15T04:08:32] haku: that sucks dude. maybe its the paid app
[2024-10-15T04:08:40] Yamal: Foc forever
[2024-10-15T04:08:58] haku: isnt fardriver foc too?
[2024-10-15T04:09:51] Yamal: Don’t know man ,but what I am sure is that its wave is not pure
[2024-10-15T04:10:58] Yamal: The market is full of "simulated" sine waves but they are not pure Vedder
[2024-10-15T04:11:44] haku: maybe some day ill try on a bigger motor
[2024-10-15T04:12:13] haku: i mean moped motors
[2024-10-15T04:12:39] Yamal: so its wave lines, looked at with a magnifying glass, make a wave in the shape of squares or steps, simulating a wave, which is also pleasant in the delivery of power but the pure veder wave is a perfect line.
[2024-10-15T04:13:15] haku: i want viking controllers
[2024-10-15T04:13:25] Yamal: and this is how I understand it xD
[2024-10-15T04:14:22] haku: if only these big vescs are cheap. im sure US will use it. its all fardrivers here
[2024-10-15T04:14:26] Yamal: <photos/photo_18474@15-10-2024_04-14-26.jpg>
[2024-10-15T04:15:29] haku: look at all the youtube ebike channels. most promoting fardrivers
[2024-10-15T04:15:56] Noname: Stick with what ya know

[2024-10-15T04:16:27] haku: nah dude. its not cheap
[2024-10-15T04:16:45] haku: you pay premium
[2024-10-15T04:16:51] Noname: It's premium
[2024-10-15T04:17:15] haku: ill stay with spintend. they should make a 18fet imo
[2024-10-15T04:17:20] Noname: It's like size of cell phone
[2024-10-15T04:17:27] Noname: Fardriver are huge
[2024-10-15T04:17:54] haku: yes they big. not for scooters
[2024-10-15T04:17:59] Noname: That's 1/2 the reason I hated Nucular shits big for no reason
[2024-10-15T04:18:38] Noname: <photos/photo_18475@15-10-2024_04-18-38.jpg>
[2024-10-15T04:18:48] Noname: Both 10kw

[2024-10-15T04:19:38] Noname: More space more batterys
[2024-10-15T04:20:47] Noname: Stock Vsett dual. It's 1/2 the size of everything
[2024-10-15T04:22:24] Noname: That's basically a fardriver I'd have to do 10s to fit 2 of those
[2024-10-15T04:22:32] Yamal: Power vesc, can’t wait for finish the nami and start new proyect
[2024-10-15T04:22:40] haku: that will fit mine.

[2024-10-15T04:36:23] Noname: I'm no engineer but I think phase amps is starting torque
[2024-10-15T04:40:14] A: How can I set that parameter in software, means how I can get the proper value so that torque can increase
[2024-10-15T04:47:42] Noname: Open this tab. What's your current?

[2024-10-15T06:02:36] Noname: You need to clean and cover that the air makes it hurt more
[2024-10-15T06:02:54] Yamal: 🤲
[2024-10-15T06:03:53] Yamal: combining positive and negative of a Moli battery is very dangerous

[2024-10-15T11:30:30] GABE: i get 1000e soon. Problem is the Molis wont handle another reweld, i can tell.
[2024-10-15T11:30:50] GABE: I wont be able to weld a 6p by any means, its too risky, theyre already kind of deformed after the initial weld.
[2024-10-15T11:32:39] GABE: Stuck in a tough spot rn. Bad project managament
[2024-10-15T11:33:58] Yamal: 1 year 4 months in Dual
[2024-10-15T11:34:20] GABE: It is odd that 18650 can handle continious rewelds but 21700 just doesnt take it. My 18650 dont deform like that by any means, it is what it is.
[2024-10-15T11:35:40] GABE: it seems 21700 have the same shell density in order to fit more Wh, in a trade for less structual integrity

[2024-10-15T11:37:22] GABE: seeing how that Molicel exploded yesterday scared the shit out of me. Imagine 240 of them doing that/
[2024-10-15T11:37:32] GABE: By no means am i deforming those molicels more.
[2024-10-15T11:37:41] GABE: they can only afford a second reweld.
[2024-10-15T11:37:42] FreehandZ: Same thickness, but wider so weaker contacts?
[2024-10-15T11:38:00] Mirono escooters: Eh, not good not bad
[2024-10-15T11:38:10] GABE: They blew up worse than a LIPO block.
[2024-10-15T11:38:14] GABE: a single one

[2024-10-15T14:46:36] GABE: Id try just stop sugar completely. It's easier.
[2024-10-15T14:46:41] GABE: Remembering how sugar tastes like is bad
[2024-10-15T14:47:24] GABE: I personally just eat salty snacks now, Cannabis also helps me feel more of the flavour of more natural foods. Candy isn't that spectacular, it tastes overpowering when "on THC"
[2024-10-15T14:47:38] GABE: Have you tried cannabis for your pain after working out? Sugar that's not in fruit and veg is quite literally the definition of poison
[2024-10-15T14:48:07] haku: yes. im not used to it. i get paranoid
[2024-10-15T14:48:24] GABE: Ah, that's the same as when the doctor tells you to keep using new medication because of side effects .
[2024-10-15T14:48:29] GABE: Take a week or two, see how it is.
[2024-10-15T14:48:33] GABE: Don't rush it.

[2024-10-15T14:49:33] GABE: Yes, like Xanax for example.
[2024-10-15T14:49:56] GABE: Yeah it's odd but I know many parents and they all drive while "stoned" but who says you gotta.

[2024-10-15T21:25:15] haku: remember when we were boos china. im sorry okay
[2024-10-15T21:28:57] haku: you used brake cable to pass the wires thru stem? good idea.
[2024-10-15T21:32:51] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Who needs power button status light 😂
[2024-10-15T21:33:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: use a very hard wire as a guide
[2024-10-15T21:34:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I didn't want to put the light on it, I just used it as on/off
[2024-10-15T21:41:15] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): We should trade whahahahaha you the button i the light
[2024-10-15T21:52:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: To put the light on you just have to make a bridge between pins 🤣
[2024-10-15T22:13:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Help please 😭
[2024-10-15T22:14:11] haku: not today @Gabzy_x evil spirit be gone
[2024-10-15T22:14:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2024-10-15T22:14:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Caliper gets clipped in the bolts
[2024-10-15T22:14:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can help ?
[2024-10-15T22:15:52] haku: shave a little off or add spacer.
[2024-10-15T22:16:39] haku: caliper spacers
[2024-10-15T22:18:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: First center the engine on the arms with a gauge then put the discs on
[2024-10-15T22:20:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If the motor shaft is more protruding in one nut than in another, the motor is off-center.
[2024-10-15T22:26:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: are the discs the same thickness? does it use disc spacer?
[2024-10-15T22:26:48] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Just drive fast they shave themselves bit off :)
[2024-10-15T22:39:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Zero10x is off center
[2024-10-15T23:24:04] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: will have to focus it
[2024-10-15T23:24:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <sticker>
[2024-10-15T23:24:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I've gotten use to how it is already
[2024-10-15T23:25:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @punedir u said to paint the box black
[2024-10-15T23:26:29] haku: now i know why we exploded last night. the lord wasnt here.
[2024-10-15T23:30:13] haku: now im safe
[2024-10-15T23:32:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If the vehicle is not centered between the axles, it affects the condition both on curves and on straights.
[2024-10-15T23:35:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I know but I adjust to it so changing will not be good now
[2024-10-15T23:36:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What to do if caliper won't grab disk ? (Like it stops but can roll if I apply pressure)
[2024-10-15T23:36:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Disk is old
[2024-10-15T23:45:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can a brake have too much oil in it ?
[2024-10-15T23:58:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Brake is new
[2024-10-15T23:58:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Shlomozero10 has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-16T00:01:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, of course, remove the brake pump screw and open the caliper pistons.
[2024-10-16T00:03:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Center the brake caliper on the disc, brake 2 or 3 times, then brake without releasing the brake, tighten the brake caliper screws, then the caliper will be centered
[2024-10-16T00:03:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If it turns by hand but the wheel brakes, the disc is bent.
[2024-10-16T00:05:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think problem is either disk is old and worn out or too much oil because I rebleed it (but not drained it out first so just added oil)
[2024-10-16T00:05:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Pistons Im not touching
[2024-10-16T00:05:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How do I drain a little bit oil without getting Air in ?
[2024-10-16T00:21:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: @shlomda2
[2024-10-16T00:22:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I told not removing pistons
[2024-10-16T00:22:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Never did that before don't intend to do it now
[2024-10-16T00:22:57] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: To properly thumb the brake you have to open the slats
[2024-10-16T00:23:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Ok
[2024-10-16T00:23:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: There are other ways to drain oil from the brakes
[2024-10-16T00:23:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Just unscrew bolt on caliper and brake handle and re bleed
[2024-10-16T00:24:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also I think it's more of a disk issue then a brake issue
[2024-10-16T01:01:19] Yamal: How is your hand @Bradhaku?

[2024-10-16T01:57:06] haku: i know my boy @Gabzy_x failed us in 70h g30. i will not dissapoint my friend
[2024-10-16T02:07:23] Yamal: I just finished training the leg with a rotation type warm-up to start and stretching to finish both full body; We must not lose our elasticity. They bring back good memories when I did capoeira as a child xD
[2024-10-16T02:13:42] Yamal: <photos/photo_18511@16-10-2024_02-13-42.jpg>
[2024-10-16T02:23:57] Yamal: This is the Asian "Monaco", strong economy but endlessly busy... of course there is a better quality of life in southern Europe, so difficult a question, we will see what the future holds for us, for sure all the good things are yet to come

[2024-10-16T04:31:41] Yamal: Or 14mm
[2024-10-16T04:32:18] Yamal: for use in the motor outlet and for bullet connectors
[2024-10-16T04:46:36] Yamal: Your motor come with temperature sensor ,,?
[2024-10-16T04:46:36] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-10-16T04:59:26] Yamal: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EHF9G49
[2024-10-16T05:07:35] haku: i have 200w. but you need a big heavy iron thats powerful if you solder you battery leads
[2024-10-16T05:10:15] Yamal: not to make batteries for motor phase connectors//battery connectors etc...
[2024-10-16T05:10:33] Yamal: Basic thing
[2024-10-16T05:18:02] Yamal: I mean …
[2024-10-16T05:18:48] haku: im not a pro but i used 200w
[2024-10-16T05:19:08] haku: <photos/photo_18519@16-10-2024_05-19-08.jpg>

[2024-10-16T05:31:09] haku: no drilling holes to pass the wire extensions. i might have to re open ubox. aluminum chips mightve went in
[2024-10-16T05:31:38] Yamal: Better!
[2024-10-16T05:31:44] haku: i just finished the battery. give me a few more days
[2024-10-16T05:31:56] Yamal: give the plate air!

[2024-10-16T07:51:46] haku: 4 6awg cables fit there. we are all set on the holes
[2024-10-16T08:31:20] Yamal: Do you think it is better to have two scooters for the circuit or one for the circuit and another for routes with larger capacity cells, etc.?
[2024-10-16T08:34:06] haku: idk it depends on the budget. imo 1 big capacity bike and 1 portable scooter is enough
[2024-10-16T08:34:19] Yamal: Nop!!
[2024-10-16T08:34:32] haku: if your getting into racing just have both

[2024-10-16T08:46:01] Yamal: By the way Andrei... you who have the dt thunder, do you think the ubox 85/250 fits with a 20s 10p battery?
[2024-10-16T08:47:21] Yamal: If there is space in the box I mean...
[2024-10-16T08:49:29] Andrei Albert: 20s9p with spacer in thunder 1 looks like this
[2024-10-16T08:49:55] Andrei Albert: So i dont think would fit the s85/250 too
[2024-10-16T08:50:25] Yamal: How is posible is just all the box
[2024-10-16T08:50:58] Andrei Albert: Its all about the type of spacers that you use
[2024-10-16T08:51:26] Andrei Albert: This batt was made with square ones, mine it’s made with other type
[2024-10-16T08:51:43] Andrei Albert: Or you can 3d print one even tighter

[2024-10-16T08:53:00] haku: i see. what the battery on that?
[2024-10-16T08:53:07] Yamal: Maybe the best thing is to make a longer box or buy it from the French...
[2024-10-16T08:53:10] Andrei Albert: 20s9p moli p45
[2024-10-16T08:53:23] Yamal: Can fit 22s11p with controller inside

[2024-10-16T13:43:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Need to accelerate faster maybe better front tire and holding traction will shave 1-2 seconds
[2024-10-16T13:47:59] Yamal: I like that way of video, I'm also looking forward to purchasing a second-hand Gopro camera or whatever so I can make videos with the scooter, but I'm a fool with the computer and the edition

[2024-10-16T14:42:59] GABE: these fets are too HV for 13s anyways, too much heat.
[2024-10-16T14:48:44] GABE: New 3.1 also has this issue? it's like a 1A trace on phase, the hell. I'll reinforce it for real now.

[2024-10-16T16:33:29] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Ok found my own answer / solution already .... it seems for the VESC Express they dont follow the normal pin assignment. See here in the code vs the ESP C3 Mini pinout .... so they (VESC Dev) swapped some pins for whatever reason.

[2024-10-16T21:09:26] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yes ... if you follow the ESP32 C3 pins for the SPI (SDCard) you end up wiring it wrong .... As for whatever reason in VESC they have remapped the pins. Took me ages to figure that out but now all works
[2024-10-16T21:15:11] NetworkDir: oh nice i have esp32 c3 but i will buy sdcard module + gps you can send exact name and model?

[2024-10-16T21:18:56] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Mini SD Card: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006248599786.html RS232 <> CAN:"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32224361513.html GPS: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006816514975.html ESP32 C3 Mini: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006391993583.html
[2024-10-16T21:19:13] NetworkDir: Thanks
[2024-10-16T21:19:23] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yes ... and i modified the lisp so you can log way way more data then original lisp script
[2024-10-16T21:20:33] NetworkDir: and what if i have a dual controller? the controllers connected with can
[2024-10-16T21:22:30] NetworkDir: and for CAN "MCP2515" doesn't work instead as this?
[2024-10-16T21:23:12] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): It log limited data of the can connected controller
[2024-10-16T21:24:17] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): WHy would you use MCP2515? big, complex ... the one i linked it tiny.
[2024-10-16T21:24:45] NetworkDir: finding the mini one in turkiye hard xD
[2024-10-16T21:25:42] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): It is possible to run the lisp on both controllers and let them send the data to the express so you have 2 full logs but you cant use autostart as they will try to write into 1 file then. If you start them manual there is little offset and thus it creates 2 files.
[2024-10-16T21:26:44] NetworkDir: Yeah i know this but i mean can ports isn't free on dual port how i should wiring
[2024-10-16T21:27:33] NetworkDir: seems just 1 CAN port
[2024-10-16T21:30:02] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Can is daisy chain ... and dont worry for termination on that short length
[2024-10-16T21:30:11] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): I just made a Y cable
[2024-10-16T21:30:53] NetworkDir: Oh i remember CANBUS have address and can use on multiple surfaces
[2024-10-16T21:32:07] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yes the Express als has a CAN ID that you can set yourself ... same for the ESC's

[2024-10-16T22:46:14] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Btw if you gonna build an express yourself ... dont fall in the same trick as i did for the SD reader .... So dont follow the pins described on the board but use the pin numbers of the 2nd image.

[2024-10-16T22:46:42] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Ok found my own answer / solution already .... it seems for the VESC Express they dont follow the normal pin assignment. See here in the code vs the ESP C3 Mini pinout .... so they (VESC Dev) swapped some pins for whatever reason.

[2024-10-17T08:40:40] Yamal: Tell him that you don't have a car or a house, just the minibike and yourself!'

[2024-10-17T08:50:32] Yamal: As you know, in the world of bodybuilding, where you grow is in bed sleeping.
[2024-10-17T08:55:38] haku: i stoped growing a long time ago. only thing grows is my belly lol

[2024-10-17T10:35:23] haku: what about battery? 250a?
[2024-10-17T10:44:30] haku: what the heck its a racing scooter now.
[2024-10-17T10:44:31] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-10-17T10:48:25] GABE: i literally couldnt control it it all felt so fucking real
[2024-10-17T10:49:05] GABE: At the end of the ride i checked the motor temps and it was hot asf and i forgot to install a temp sensor LOL

[2024-10-17T10:56:53] haku: 6p is plenty. you can add in the future. 12p needs alot of planning

[2024-10-17T13:13:31] Yamal: ?
[2024-10-17T13:14:26] Noname: But seriously surron peeps are the worst kind of gay
[2024-10-17T13:15:05] GABE: Surron peeps are all criminals.
[2024-10-17T13:15:18] GABE: Its pattern recognition
[2024-10-17T13:16:03] GABE: Id be at my uni and a few surroners just come around with masks on through the college park, theyre totally just goody 2 shoes who dont sell drugs whatsoever.
[2024-10-17T13:16:51] GABE: Same in the UK.
[2024-10-17T13:21:41] Noname: We ask them no wheelies on 100+ riders takeover ride coming up and nothing but complaining. They were on sidewalks jumping dividers on the wall of a fountain etc
[2024-10-17T13:33:16] Ion: Can VESC control normal 2 Wire DC motors? I have an application that uses that
[2024-10-17T13:35:47] 'lekrsu': Yes, it can
[2024-10-17T13:40:26] 'lekrsu': There's the option to select DC in the general motor tab.
[2024-10-17T13:52:52] Noname: Why you up 5am
[2024-10-17T13:58:21] Yamal: Energy drink or sugar drink?
[2024-10-17T14:00:20] Yamal: Anyway, I have a doubt, Which do you think is the drink that people from Vesc Project like the most?
[2024-10-17T14:01:12] Andrei Albert: Coffe
[2024-10-17T14:01:35] Yamal: ✍️
[2024-10-17T14:05:21] Yamal: musical genre?

[2024-10-17T14:17:55] Andrei Albert: <video_file>
[2024-10-17T14:19:52] Ion: Do you know if that still can do current limiting/speed control etc? Like a normal BLDC just that it's brushed. Or would it always send full power?
[2024-10-17T14:20:13] 'lekrsu': Haven't explored it

[2024-10-17T14:31:03] puneDir: Can it do 100a discharge
[2024-10-17T14:35:59] Yamal: Gt2 🤯
[2024-10-17T14:39:45] NetworkDir: No
[2024-10-17T15:04:39] Rose: Hey there Jonathan, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-10-17T15:21:30] Patrick: The wrap😍
[2024-10-17T15:22:37] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Actually No :) Its a GT1D that has been modified a tiny bit (cough)
[2024-10-17T15:23:31] Patrick: Cheaper then water
[2024-10-17T15:24:15] Yamal: ?

[2024-10-17T15:24:36] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Motors are the ones from a GT2 :)
[2024-10-17T15:24:43] Yamal: red bull imitation?
[2024-10-17T15:24:54] Yamal: WouhhhhhHhhhh
[2024-10-17T15:25:08] Yamal: 85/150?
[2024-10-17T15:25:11] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): In the past this was branded as Golden Shower Power but for obvious reasons they changed the name.
[2024-10-17T15:25:21] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yes 2 of them
[2024-10-17T15:25:42] Yamal: your heatsinks sing it xD
[2024-10-17T15:26:27] Yamal: what's up man? we want to know everything!!!!!
[2024-10-17T15:26:45] Yamal: torque, speed /// battery ??
[2024-10-17T15:26:51] Yamal: 🤩
[2024-10-17T15:27:00] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yeah that was the first try .... now we have a better solution for it :) (Not mine but from a friend)
[2024-10-17T15:27:19] Yamal: Which friend ? The king ..?
[2024-10-17T15:27:47] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Torque ... Insane :), Speed 90+ (GPS corrected speed as dash gives +5km/h), Batt 19S9P EVE 50E (21700)
[2024-10-17T15:28:00] Yamal: the most stable scooter on the market!!!!
[2024-10-17T15:28:10] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): I did a group buy for VESC's for the GT ... so we have a group of people converting them right now
[2024-10-17T15:28:48] Yamal: “No limits “ group
[2024-10-17T15:28:49] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): There are now 2 in the US too (work in progress)
[2024-10-17T15:29:05] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Nope no Dulitsky ....
[2024-10-17T15:29:08] Yamal: Nice
[2024-10-17T15:29:40] Yamal: the most daring from Roscheee right?
[2024-10-17T15:29:57] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): As you know i have those bridges for the GT series to make Dash, buttons, lights and all working with VESC and no fiddling with cables or soldering. Only soldering you have are the motor connectors.
[2024-10-17T15:30:30] Jan: Ive designed also a radiator for GT2 https://www.printables.com/model/990931-jrev-segway-gt2-complete-collection/files
[2024-10-17T15:30:48] Jan: Need to download the zip file
[2024-10-17T15:30:56] Jan: Handlebar, Spacer, Radiator
[2024-10-17T15:31:23] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yeah will have a look ..... at the time i started that wasnt available :)
[2024-10-17T15:34:03] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): YEah i cant mill so had to adapt heatsinks but that radiator looks good!
[2024-10-17T15:37:26] Noname: That's worse than my worst. Conveyor belt and tape. It's like rubberized cloth.
[2024-10-17T15:39:47] Jan: https://jlcpcb.com/ ?
[2024-10-17T15:39:56] Jan: They also do cnc
[2024-10-17T15:43:13] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): For me now not needed but yeah could be interesting. Must place an order for some boards soon anyway. Will get some pricing for the sink
[2024-10-17T15:49:15] Yamal: Gt2 performance
[2024-10-17T15:49:32] Yamal: Peak watts?

[2024-10-17T15:54:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have a question to see if you can help me.
[2024-10-17T15:54:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: By detecting the accelerator and foc motors, adding their parameters to curren, can the skate be used or do you have to do something else?

[2024-10-17T16:11:20] Yamal: Pretty
[2024-10-17T16:11:20] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-17T16:17:08] 'lekrsu': If needed also adjust foc observer and regen voltage limits. Otherwise, yeah. It'll spin.
[2024-10-17T16:19:57] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Currently 6Kw per motor
[2024-10-17T16:20:53] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yeah 65H or 70H motors and 26S ... not much of a GT anymore :) Peak draw was 27Kw what i heard :)
[2024-10-17T16:24:48] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): He made alot of friend with his driving action in Russia on the EUC .... Thanks to his action a heavy ban can follow (he made it into the news)

[2024-10-17T16:27:22] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Just the shopping basket is missing and maybe some handle bar streamers ....
[2024-10-17T16:27:42] puneDir: Its the ugliest.thing ive ever seen
[2024-10-17T16:28:56] Yamal: You buy ?
[2024-10-17T16:31:18] Yamal: make a thai scooter! 250km/h
[2024-10-17T16:31:32] Yamal: XD
[2024-10-17T16:36:22] Кирилл: Stock modified gt2 motors and 22s
[2024-10-17T16:37:21] Yamal: 85/250 and 3shull right?
[2024-10-17T16:38:10] Кирилл: Nah, custom one, but ubox and 3shul also were tested
[2024-10-17T16:38:21] Кирилл: All works great
[2024-10-17T16:40:05] Yamal: of course, the most powerful gt2 to date,, still waiting for Mr. Roscheee's to come to light
[2024-10-17T16:41:08] Yamal: Stock 50h?
[2024-10-17T16:42:25] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Modified as in rewired? As on 19S cant push it harder as 95 but my pack is mostly the limit as i can draw only 120Ah from the EVE 50E
[2024-10-17T16:42:56] Кирилл: Around 45h, but stator is 125mm
[2024-10-17T16:46:12] Кирилл: Wires (≈6mm² winding), ≈8mm² phases, other magnets, better cooling with statorade. Works pretty ok
[2024-10-17T16:47:42] Кирилл: This on video was 22s8p on p42a
[2024-10-17T16:51:02] Yamal: 8 parallels is the maximum that fits,,?
[2024-10-17T16:51:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: the observer? regeneration I set it to 0
[2024-10-17T16:52:15] Yamal: And 28s long could fit right?
[2024-10-17T16:52:45] Кирилл: The maximum can be up to 200 cells
[2024-10-17T16:53:00] Кирилл: but you need space for insulation
[2024-10-17T16:53:31] Кирилл: 28s7p ye, maybe
[2024-10-17T16:53:56] Yamal: Also putting fat engines, a problem, but if they came in 70 h it could be beautiful
[2024-10-17T16:54:41] Кирилл: Actually with new cells with 21700 5.5+ah you can do stock 14s14p or 77ah or ≈3800wh nominal energy, thats sick
[2024-10-17T16:55:18] Yamal: Also, the cool project 140 in GT2 is an achievement and fun!
[2024-10-17T16:55:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That is, by detecting the motor, foc plus adding battery voltage A of phase A of controller wheel diameter with that the scooter could be used
[2024-10-17T16:57:20] Yamal: Don't let any g30 get ahead of you! XD
[2024-10-17T16:59:23] Кирилл: Also for these small scooters you can do drastic capacity right now
[2024-10-17T17:00:34] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I want to start from scratch as if I took the controller out of the box and started again.foc curre voltaje an wheel diameter
[2024-10-17T17:00:35] Yamal: I definitely prefer discharge cells to capacity cells.
[2024-10-17T17:03:16] Yamal: I don't know if it fits into context, but that being said!
[2024-10-17T17:07:31] 'lekrsu': Yes, the observer. There's options.
[2024-10-17T17:07:41] GABE: Beer run with it.
[2024-10-17T17:07:54] 'lekrsu': Just backup your settings via the backup button, and try it out.
[2024-10-17T17:08:34] puneDir: Yes
[2024-10-17T17:11:35] GABE: hasn't blown yet

[2024-10-17T17:19:35] Yamal: are you going to mount vesc controller?
[2024-10-17T17:19:59] Yamal: 〰
[2024-10-17T17:20:22] Yamal: flowing
[2024-10-17T17:24:40] Yamal: One thing I would like to know and clarify is that as a general rule when we do motor detection and a zero zero configuration, there is no reason to touch the values or parameters referring to the motors on our scooter, correct? Does the application do this alone?

[2024-10-17T17:59:33] GABE: Thinking of keeping it at 12/13s. The issue was the traces burned with fwk, issue is now solved with reinforcement.
[2024-10-17T17:59:40] GABE: I just had some fwk earlier, was awesome.

[2024-10-17T18:08:47] 'lekrsu': Aluminum wrecker, fry shaker, steel hater!
[2024-10-17T18:08:51] Paolo ⁭: Ah yes but it was 10 inch
[2024-10-17T18:08:56] Paolo ⁭: And not me , friend
[2024-10-17T18:08:59] GABE: You're kidding, at that speed.
[2024-10-17T18:09:05] Yamal: 150 I think right ?
[2024-10-17T18:09:07] Paolo ⁭: I only did settings
[2024-10-17T18:09:12] GABE: Speed i will not speak about
[2024-10-17T18:09:23] Paolo ⁭: He reached 155 22s and Kelly if not wrong
[2024-10-17T18:09:26] GABE: it's a secret
[2024-10-17T18:09:45] Paolo ⁭: 145 10 inch was mantis 60h
[2024-10-17T18:10:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I want to get to 150 hahaha
[2024-10-17T18:10:20] Yamal: Your friend 145 with 65h10” 20 s and 🐬come on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2024-10-17T18:11:02] Paolo ⁭: Who? I don't know nobody with 65h
[2024-10-17T18:11:09] Yamal: Exactly, he should take 150 without problem
[2024-10-17T18:11:19] Yamal: Sorry 60h I mean
[2024-10-17T18:11:28] Yamal: The same
[2024-10-17T18:11:38] Yamal: Vídeo scooter on highway
[2024-10-17T18:11:44] Yamal: Rasta pasta

[2024-10-17T18:12:51] Paolo ⁭: 145 was the limit, battery was done with used 21s6p nickel welded battery
[2024-10-17T18:14:52] Yamal: Are you in China ? XD
[2024-10-17T18:15:39] GABE: NICKEL?

[2024-10-17T18:16:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Fix ? (Win7 PC)
[2024-10-17T18:18:04] Noname: My buddy's ride is falling apart. Forced him to buy this, I'm picking it up today. He hates it 😆
[2024-10-17T18:18:49] Yamal: What I'm saying is that if your friend took 145, he can take 150 with the nami, right?
[2024-10-17T18:19:47] Noname: What Voltage?
[2024-10-17T18:23:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ooaoa the tyres
[2024-10-17T18:23:20] puneDir: 48v lead acid
[2024-10-17T18:23:41] Noname: So prob 30mph unrestricted or 48kmh I'd guess
[2024-10-17T18:25:27] Paolo ⁭: Not really, because nami is much more heavier, on heavier tires too. But with good current settings obviously it will reach it, even more I guess
[2024-10-17T18:25:42] Mirono escooters: Win7? Does it even support vEsc tools
[2024-10-17T18:25:51] Mirono escooters: You seem to be missing drivers
[2024-10-17T18:25:51] puneDir: Hes like that
[2024-10-17T18:25:58] puneDir: I wanna leave it stock lol
[2024-10-17T18:26:10] puneDir: So it doesnt get broken
[2024-10-17T18:26:25] Paolo ⁭: 11" tire has much more grip , and much heavier motor + tires. The difference is big on the speed
[2024-10-17T18:26:45] Noname: What's the top speed now?
[2024-10-17T18:26:51] puneDir: I dont know
[2024-10-17T18:27:08] puneDir: Its going to get delivered tomorrow
[2024-10-17T18:27:23] Noname: Legal speed in your country for moped?
[2024-10-17T18:27:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Which ones ?
[2024-10-17T18:28:16] puneDir: Yes
[2024-10-17T18:28:21] puneDir: No restrictions
[2024-10-17T18:28:37] Mirono escooters: No idea, something about opengl2.0
[2024-10-17T18:29:09] puneDir: But i want to make it 20s
[2024-10-17T18:29:19] Yamal: 75h lower top speed than 70h right?
[2024-10-17T18:32:53] Yamal: I am eager to learn well with the configurations, they are the key, because of course put what battery we have, put A phaseA battery and original Ortega to say the least, it is a drop of water in the immensity of the ocean with respect to what can be done in vesc tool
[2024-10-17T18:33:51] Paolo ⁭: Not really much
[2024-10-17T18:33:52] Yamal: 🗝
[2024-10-17T18:34:29] Yamal: Do you think that motors as a general rule do not touch the parameters in the configuration?
[2024-10-17T18:35:38] Paolo ⁭: Too much things have to be considered
[2024-10-17T18:36:01] Paolo ⁭: But the best move is to have some sine wave controller instead of bldc one
[2024-10-17T18:36:20] Paolo ⁭: Someone on Facebook says Xiaomi size controller can't perform as yuyang king
[2024-10-17T18:36:33] Yamal: By the way, I saw a photo of you, from a plane, you are in Asia for vacation xD
[2024-10-17T18:36:58] Paolo ⁭: Yes

[2024-10-17T19:29:34] haku: can the ly motors fit on the gt2?
[2024-10-17T19:34:08] Кирилл: Not much. Only ones with no more than 135mm dropout
[2024-10-17T19:34:30] Кирилл: Stock motors is pretty well made and powerful
[2024-10-17T19:35:03] Кирилл: Ly poorer quality compare to segway
[2024-10-17T19:35:26] haku: segway big stators like qs. just need rewind

[2024-10-17T20:08:04] NetworkDir: @AJAJ1992 you should love it 😂
[2024-10-17T20:15:33] Jan: Lol
[2024-10-17T20:16:44] Jan: As Elon said it really nicely, the worst thing to do as an engineer is to optimize a solution that shouldnt exist
[2024-10-17T20:29:56] haku: nah thats not ruckus clone
[2024-10-17T20:56:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, steering damper is useful in racing conditions
[2024-10-17T21:03:08] Jan: For what do you use it?
[2024-10-17T21:06:16] Noname: You missed a key word "BIG Ruckus"
[2024-10-17T21:08:09] Face de Pin Sucé: To reduce movements of the scooter while cornering, this way the driver gives less efforts to maintain his trajectory
[2024-10-17T21:08:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Only for that
[2024-10-17T21:08:15] haku: puneped
[2024-10-17T21:08:36] Face de Pin Sucé: With or without damper, we go more than 150Kmh
[2024-10-17T21:10:26] Noname: My buddy's last ride we called Penny Farthing, Penny or Pervert farting. New one has been named Seemen Seeker 😆 because I'm buying it I get to name it

[2024-10-17T21:41:22] Pandalgns: Guys I have a question, does anyone have the stl of the battery extender for Xiaomi Pro? but not the conventional straight one but rather a modified one that varies the shape a little, I have seen an extender that is wider at the back as if it had air inlets and at the front as if it had a lip
[2024-10-17T22:16:00] haku: dual fardrivers on a geared hub. he will shred these nylon/delrin gears real quick 😭 https://youtu.be/PRwJYKE2BtY?si=bQ2bh8VQdgatGes3

[2024-10-17T23:37:53] haku: its suppose to be for magazines. for those tactical dudes
[2024-10-17T23:38:40] Lieven L.: Magura 👌🏻
[2024-10-17T23:39:11] haku: thats for a separate build lol. this minibike scoot is china parts only haha
[2024-10-17T23:39:22] haku: exclusively
[2024-10-17T23:40:15] Lieven L.: Anyway. Still love my MT7 😁
[2024-10-17T23:41:05] haku: nice. its an experimental i love china minibike. exept cells. if my brake fails ill put magura haha
[2024-10-17T23:41:36] haku: its mt5e so its not that great
[2024-10-17T23:41:57] Lieven L.: mt5 isn't bad either
[2024-10-17T23:42:13] haku: nice.
[2024-10-17T23:42:22] haku: plastic handles though
[2024-10-17T23:46:28] Lieven L.: pump is always plastic because they want to save weight.
[2024-10-17T23:46:59] Lieven L.: MT7 just has a different caliper and lever
[2024-10-17T23:47:19] Yamal: I want HOPE
[2024-10-17T23:47:35] Lieven L.: I prefer Magura.
[2024-10-17T23:47:37] Yamal: Hehe also I have mt7
[2024-10-17T23:48:15] Lieven L.: Sram Code is also very good
[2024-10-17T23:49:00] Lieven L.: but MT7 with HC3 lever is my favorit
[2024-10-17T23:49:08] Yamal: Why
[2024-10-17T23:49:23] Yamal: Sponge bob feel
[2024-10-17T23:50:07] Lieven L.: Lots of power, very modular break feel. Not just on and off.
[2024-10-17T23:50:45] Yamal: Also Shigura people say it’s good
[2024-10-17T23:50:48] Lieven L.: HC3 lever is very adjustable.
[2024-10-17T23:51:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Ok I made the detection, I added the data of foc, general foc, curren, voltage and wheel diameter, I think that's how it is, right?
[2024-10-17T23:51:19] Yamal: tired forearms on long descents xD
[2024-10-17T23:51:28] Lieven L.: Shigura gives you more power. But MT7 is powerfull enough for me and I'm a heavy rider
[2024-10-17T23:51:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I want to do everything from scratch. I didn't do the previous configuration and I'm learning.
[2024-10-17T23:52:02] 'lekrsu': Don't copy values from the earlier config then, didn't quite grasp what you implied
[2024-10-17T23:52:11] Lieven L.: Yeah but that happends with any break.
[2024-10-17T23:52:12] Yamal: I like Magura too
[2024-10-17T23:52:23] Yamal: But I want to try hopE
[2024-10-17T23:52:32] Yamal: Nop

[2024-10-17T23:53:54] Lieven L.: Well I had them all 😉 I prefer MT7 and Code but would like to try Tricksuff.
[2024-10-17T23:54:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I don't copy them hehe but are they just those parameters mentioned or is there more?
[2024-10-17T23:54:28] Lieven L.: But the break is more $$$ than a car and you have to wait for 1 year or 2
[2024-10-17T23:54:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: the translator 🤷‍♀️
[2024-10-17T23:55:02] 'lekrsu': Just type without a translator then, :)
[2024-10-17T23:55:12] Yamal: Okeeeee
[2024-10-17T23:55:17] Yamal: German solution
[2024-10-17T23:55:37] 'lekrsu': Might be a good idea to throw in a screenshot so someone might get a grasp.
[2024-10-17T23:56:41] Lieven L.: Man of them where on my buddies bikes and I gave them a try
[2024-10-17T23:57:02] 'lekrsu': Use one with three cables
[2024-10-17T23:57:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I only speak Spanish 🤣
[2024-10-17T23:59:16] Yamal: Now I remember
[2024-10-17T23:59:22] Yamal: You have g30 right
[2024-10-17T23:59:25] Lieven L.: Hope looks nice but they don't really feel nice in my opinion.
[2024-10-17T23:59:31] Lieven L.: G2
[2024-10-18T00:00:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2024-10-18T00:00:22] Yamal: Well, apart from being all CNC, it seems that they are the most powerful on the market, and I'm not saying that
[2024-10-18T00:00:37] Lieven L.: With stock breakes 😂
[2024-10-18T00:01:22] Yamal: I also said once that I would like to try Shimano, so dry dry
[2024-10-18T00:01:51] Yamal: G2 with trampa
[2024-10-18T00:02:04] 'lekrsu': Are you entering these manually or are you using the "Setup Motors" button?
[2024-10-18T00:02:43] Yamal: 160kmh! Please
[2024-10-18T00:02:47] Lieven L.: 4 piston breaks are all more powerful then anybody really needs them to be. If you're a good rider you don't need much power anyway.
[2024-10-18T00:03:28] Yamal: I would like to try brembo
[2024-10-18T00:03:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Previously, Setos motors had already given them to me and I saved them in a notebook
[2024-10-18T00:03:52] Yamal: 🇮🇹🤌
[2024-10-18T00:03:57] Lieven L.: Got brembos on my Ducati 😉
[2024-10-18T00:04:19] Yamal: My uncle 7 kawa he love ,,,,
[2024-10-18T00:04:29] Yamal: I just 🛴
[2024-10-18T00:04:38] 'lekrsu': Then you're not setting it up from scratch if you're just redoing everything the same again.
[2024-10-18T00:05:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I want to put the basics so I can use it and then learn
[2024-10-18T00:06:12] Lieven L.: No stock controller with 16S battery
[2024-10-18T00:06:44] Yamal: Pretty cool
[2024-10-18T00:07:08] 'lekrsu': I just, Do motor detection on large outrunner, and accept the "reset configuration". Then configure the pole count as per how many the rotor has, gear ratio 1, direct drive, enter wheel size. Then let the detection do it's thing. Now there's automatic values applied in FOC instead.
[2024-10-18T00:07:29] 'lekrsu': Did I miss any steps there?
[2024-10-18T00:07:52] Lieven L.: It's okay, fast enough for what it is, but could have more torque.
[2024-10-18T00:07:59] 'lekrsu': Why not a VESC? The G2 controller ruins quite badly if I have to say so myself.
[2024-10-18T00:08:28] haku: oh man. this is all i can find for kids hands
[2024-10-18T00:08:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: so i think i put it all in
[2024-10-18T00:08:40] haku: is it still possible?
[2024-10-18T00:08:56] Lieven L.: It's okay with the stock motor. I would switch to VESC if i'd change the motor.
[2024-10-18T00:09:04] 'lekrsu': Then don't manually adjust the foc values, that's the last thing you'd do and only if it definitely runs wrong after the automatic values.
[2024-10-18T00:10:03] Lieven L.: But I'm always hesitating because of the added weight. I want this thing to still be portable.
[2024-10-18T00:10:12] 'lekrsu': Oh right, we've had this conversation before! Haha. Don't remember if anyone else had any feedback to that.
[2024-10-18T00:10:22] Yamal: G2 It will soon hit the streets in a single engine with 3shull (owner of this group)
[2024-10-18T00:10:44] Yamal: Just waiting …………
[2024-10-18T00:10:49] haku: can i rig this to regen/ebrake?
[2024-10-18T00:10:59] Lieven L.: Which motor?
[2024-10-18T00:11:21] 'lekrsu': In my opinion, it really isn't. Vesc runs it so damn efficiently and dead silent. Stock is uneven and loud. Doesn't even have phase shunts.
[2024-10-18T00:12:41] Lieven L.: Anything is better than stock. But going to VESC is so much work to. Needs a new G30 dash. Signals have to be rewired....
[2024-10-18T00:13:57] Yamal: G2 tune ! to make the children of dualtron and those of the surron cry
[2024-10-18T00:15:31] Lieven L.: Well tuning is nice but I got more powerful toys if i wanna go fast. So it's not really necessary.
[2024-10-18T00:16:23] 'lekrsu': I just run without dash, without signals.
[2024-10-18T00:16:44] Yamal: love for scooter tuning is what I feel
[2024-10-18T00:17:46] 'lekrsu': The wiring only took a couple hours, then it was done.
[2024-10-18T00:17:51] Yamal: Every vehicle has its place in the world, I am talking only and exclusively about scooters,
[2024-10-18T00:17:56] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_18622@18-10-2024_00-17-56.jpg>
[2024-10-18T00:18:00] haku: what is the ports for 2 cables?
[2024-10-18T00:18:11] Yamal: Which vesc you mount ..?
[2024-10-18T00:18:18] 'lekrsu': Ubox Alu Lite ⚡️
[2024-10-18T00:18:27] haku: or do i rig it
[2024-10-18T00:18:30] Yamal: Single right
[2024-10-18T00:19:11] 'lekrsu': Yes, the stock G2 motor. Only goes 65 km/h without relying on field weakening (cringe weakening), but it's so pleasant to ride
[2024-10-18T00:19:41] Yamal: Pretty cool
[2024-10-18T00:20:05] 'lekrsu': Is it just A2 to GND then acting as a switch?
[2024-10-18T00:22:27] 'lekrsu': <video_file>
[2024-10-18T00:27:08] Yamal: magic shine
[2024-10-18T00:59:44] haku: gotcha thanks

[2024-10-18T02:08:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-18T02:36:08] Noname: May I present the seemen seeker scooter. She's a big bottom girl for sure 400lbs of awkward
[2024-10-18T02:49:47] haku: nice dude
[2024-10-18T02:50:50] Noname: Kinda want it but don't need another project
[2024-10-18T02:50:51] haku: that frame is badass tbh. i would get one
[2024-10-18T02:51:20] Noname: I'd buy a gas one but they're also kinda scarce
[2024-10-18T02:51:22] haku: trump red too

[2024-10-18T03:10:19] Noname: Lead silicate
[2024-10-18T03:10:25] Noname: Or somethimg
[2024-10-18T03:10:45] Noname: It's so freaking heavy

[2024-10-18T03:14:15] Noname: He's got 2 84v li ion pouch batterys

[2024-10-18T03:17:03] Noname: On the side is the controller out in the wind it's huge
[2024-10-18T03:17:57] Yamal: you live like kings in the USA
[2024-10-18T03:18:05] Noname: Over the tire the box
[2024-10-18T03:18:07] haku: im sure. 10yr old tech prolly similar to sabvoton
[2024-10-18T03:18:19] Noname: That's the city I don't live there
[2024-10-18T03:18:38] Noname: 40mi away where there's lawns and cows
[2024-10-18T03:19:52] Yamal: do you live in the town or what

[2024-10-18T03:28:25] Noname: Prices are high as the seller. You have to wait for the hunt sometimes
[2024-10-18T03:28:49] Noname: Then run or play can I wait and see if they lower
[2024-10-18T03:29:04] haku: my ebike i sold used just 100 off
[2024-10-18T03:29:23] Noname: If I didn't have a job I could sporadically make bank

[2024-10-18T03:36:31] haku: sounds like a kamala rally.
[2024-10-18T03:37:11] Yamal: I mean, the movie is quite a few years old and of course it's American...
[2024-10-18T03:38:03] haku: maybe scooter culture is huge in EU. ive never heard of people saying ly motors or vesc here
[2024-10-18T03:38:37] haku: its always these paid youtubers claiming the fastest retail scooter
[2024-10-18T03:39:44] Yamal: Faster in USA?

[2024-10-18T03:49:47] Yamal: but currently I have a cousin working in Miami.. I don't plan to cross it yet, I still have a lot of money to invest in an e-scooter xD
[2024-10-18T03:51:05] Noname: I can't be on a plane for hours I go crazy
[2024-10-18T03:51:32] Yamal: Drive car better
[2024-10-18T03:52:21] Noname: <animation>
[2024-10-18T03:53:06] Yamal: you stop in the place you want, not everything is easier... They also say that our soul travels at the speed of the horse, that means that mine has not yet reached where I am now xD
[2024-10-18T03:54:21] Noname: Teleport better
[2024-10-18T03:55:02] Yamal: When I travel back to my country, I will yell at him through the plane window to turn back xD
[2024-10-18T04:06:33] Yamal: https://youtu.be/HHbJO4qkcdI?si=hjoRg6bsZ1pSsuvy

[2024-10-18T04:25:59] haku: do they have big batteries. 150v and lots of range. how?
[2024-10-18T04:29:37] Yamal: I have also seen some American road wheels and they are crazy xD they drive very fast among the cars
[2024-10-18T04:30:49] haku: is it popular in spain. ive seen a few here. more than hyperscooter
[2024-10-18T04:32:07] Yamal: Yes, in Spain there are also, they also compete on the circuit
[2024-10-18T04:32:45] haku: dang euc racing. thats new
[2024-10-18T04:35:46] Noname: So I know a guy who has custom ones built from begode with big batterys etc it's a Boston long range wheel. But he went further and made like an 8kw monster, mind you he's 300+ lbs but gets 150mi of range.
[2024-10-18T04:47:22] haku: nice.
[2024-10-18T04:48:12] Noname: Self employed so taking an afternoon ride to Canada happens
[2024-10-18T04:48:57] haku: im very curious what cells it uses pouch or cyindrical. im watching a yt video on this new euc. 150v and 100m of range in a small package. how? they more efficient than scooter or bike?
[2024-10-18T04:50:21] Noname: 21700
[2024-10-18T04:50:45] Noname: Yeah they're very efficient. It's just a wheel and battery
[2024-10-18T04:51:18] haku: i see. crazy
[2024-10-18T04:51:36] haku: its fast too
[2024-10-18T04:51:57] haku: very risky to rely on ebrake though lol
[2024-10-18T04:52:28] Noname: Some are crazy like 60+ but you lean so modded scooters can beat most safe riders
[2024-10-18T04:52:43] Noname: You don't want to see a cutout it's bad
[2024-10-18T04:52:52] haku: im sure
[2024-10-18T04:52:59] haku: even a flat
[2024-10-18T04:53:43] Noname: Flat you wobble and crash. Cutout pads grab your legs when it rolls and whips you to the ground the the wheel chases you tumbling
[2024-10-18T04:54:12] haku: dam
[2024-10-18T04:54:15] haku: brutal
[2024-10-18T04:54:28] haku: no wonder they gear up to the fullest
[2024-10-18T04:54:56] Noname: You have to unless your completely stupid
[2024-10-18T05:17:11] haku: how do i fix this error again? running motor detection on bike

[2024-10-18T07:44:57] Yamal: XD

[2024-10-18T08:27:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: So ?
[2024-10-18T08:29:41] NetworkDir: Yes on e-scooter motors the MTPA doesn't work very well
[2024-10-18T08:30:15] NetworkDir: What controller do you have ?
[2024-10-18T08:31:34] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 3chul v4
[2024-10-18T08:56:25] Lieven L.: I don't need the dash. But i need the signals 😁
[2024-10-18T09:04:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He would get that I don't think u do
[2024-10-18T09:12:01] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): As i have modified the Lisp script from LogUi for VESC Expressto get more fields available then the standard script the question comes: What fields would be the most important to have .... As the updated script is quite extensive it would be better to have the most important in the top section. So my questions are what fields from the logs are the most important. The basic ones like V, Ah, Watt, Phase, Speed are obvious but then ..... The ones available are in the screenshot.

[2024-10-18T09:57:50] Yamal: 70h g30 waterproofed?
[2024-10-18T09:59:27] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): PlastiDip is your best friend!
[2024-10-18T09:59:48] Yamal: We really shouldn't take scooters in the rain, it doesn't make sense, they are electric vehicles, it's not even good for the engines, But if they are well insulated in case of emergency and if you get caught in the rain outside your home and nothing happens, it's cool.
[2024-10-18T10:02:15] Andrei Albert: Shit happens
[2024-10-18T10:02:36] Yamal: What happen br0
[2024-10-18T10:03:01] Yamal: Dry xD

[2024-10-18T10:04:31] puneDir: Reliable and cheap
[2024-10-18T10:05:28] Andrei Albert: It happened 2 months ago, luckily it was dry inside

[2024-10-18T10:22:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: How can you have solid wheels, how crazy?
[2024-10-18T10:40:58] Yamal: https://youtu.be/9aAPQWjopDw?si=XmGzvouYsh58cxh1
[2024-10-18T10:46:47] GABE: Last frame I threw away cos 2000km solids. This frame has never had solids before. I am getting real tyres IMMINENTLY will only drive a few KM with these on.
[2024-10-18T10:46:51] GABE: I don't know how to break it to my mother that she needs a whole new frame as well, on her m365 she has 2000km also is on solids
[2024-10-18T10:47:34] GABE: She's been looking for some m365's on adverts
[2024-10-18T10:48:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: A week ago I gave away an m365 chassis
[2024-10-18T10:49:22] GABE: How do I check for Micro fractures?
[2024-10-18T10:49:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Solid wheels only bring problems in the long run
[2024-10-18T10:49:45] GABE: She's had them on for over 2y, consider that frame SO FUCKED
[2024-10-18T10:50:10] GABE: I'll tell her if she wants to keep using it it's risky as hell
[2024-10-18T10:50:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Omg
[2024-10-18T10:51:09] GABE: I'm staying with 8.5" on my Pro 2 for one reason only, still drive able when tyres are popped
[2024-10-18T10:51:20] GABE: I don't wanna be stranded in the middle of a field just cause of 10 inch tyres
[2024-10-18T10:51:34] GABE: 8.5 never comes off but 10' just pops off immediately
[2024-10-18T10:51:57] GABE: I choose to have less top speed and more security.
[2024-10-18T10:56:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What opening does it give me

[2024-10-18T12:42:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I went for a little walk to check the temperature of the engines but I found an elderly person on the ground dead. I touched his chest but there was nothing there so I called the police and emergency services 🚑

[2024-10-18T17:03:01] Jan: I try to keep it clean unless i see a value in a sponsor beyond money
[2024-10-18T17:03:29] haku: agreed.
[2024-10-18T17:04:45] haku: ill put ali express, alibaba, temu and wish on mine. keep it real haha

[2024-10-18T17:17:37] puneDir: Flipsky of bms
[2024-10-18T17:18:12] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): No clue but based on my image and since its double sided would say 16
[2024-10-18T17:18:33] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Hmmmm with the 100 i am not so sure .. the regular daly i totally agree.
[2024-10-18T17:24:46] haku: i will use zipties to hold these phase wires. this is ugly and gaps too wide.
[2024-10-18T17:25:13] haku: but for testing ill run with this
[2024-10-18T17:25:15] puneDir: Man this thing uses ethernet cable as phase cable
[2024-10-18T17:32:55] haku: you better carry. you dont want someone taking it. atleast put a gps module
[2024-10-18T17:33:38] haku: unless no one messes with you in your area because you the boss of the hood
[2024-10-18T17:35:19] Noname: You measure power in kb not kw
[2024-10-18T17:35:29] Patrick: So the cable arrived outer diameter is 5.5mm if just leaving the first Fiberglas layer its ~3.5mm
[2024-10-18T17:35:30] Patrick: <photos/photo_18652@18-10-2024_17-35-30.jpg>

[2024-10-18T17:36:59] Patrick: 10mm² cable too
[2024-10-18T17:45:58] haku: is that the material for ly phases?
[2024-10-18T17:46:05] haku: its like asbestos?
[2024-10-18T17:47:22] Jan: Its glasfiber
[2024-10-18T17:51:03] Patrick: Pretty happy with the cable right now took a while until it arrived but i have nothing bad to say about it right now
[2024-10-18T17:55:22] haku: what you using it for?
[2024-10-18T18:14:19] Patrick: For the motor if i can somehow fit them they are little big i ordered 6mm² but got 10mm² sadly
[2024-10-18T18:17:53] Rose: Hey there Michele, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-10-18T20:20:36] haku: what a day to test. windy and cold.
[2024-10-18T20:21:24] haku: and it might rain. but for the boys ill do it.

[2024-10-18T21:10:43] haku: that side panel will be painted tactical desert tan. or stainless
[2024-10-18T21:13:07] haku: wheelbase is smaller than the vsett lmao.
[2024-10-18T21:20:10] haku: doesnt have torque at startup but dam once you get going its fast af. scary fast.
[2024-10-18T21:23:35] Rose: Hey there Silexx, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-10-18T21:27:35] haku: test ride baby. yippee.
[2024-10-18T21:34:44] haku: dam thats it. 10kw
[2024-10-18T21:35:40] 'lekrsu': Two motors though yeah? So 20k?
[2024-10-18T21:36:02] 'lekrsu': Looks damn awesome :3
[2024-10-18T21:36:16] haku: yea. its only using 10kw though. no tune just motor config
[2024-10-18T21:36:42] haku: its fast af though no toque too bad
[2024-10-18T21:36:54] haku: ty bro
[2024-10-18T21:41:42] GABE: The project is complete?
[2024-10-18T21:42:48] haku: yes. its slow. surron boys will shit on me
[2024-10-18T21:42:55] haku: <photos/photo_18665@18-10-2024_21-42-55.jpg>
[2024-10-18T21:44:27] GABE: Slow?
[2024-10-18T21:44:51] GABE: im confused.
[2024-10-18T21:44:54] haku: yes. cant do a burnout
[2024-10-18T21:45:04] haku: slow off the line
[2024-10-18T21:46:29] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): More phase currents :) and maybe you profit in this case from mtpa
[2024-10-18T21:46:59] haku: yea no tune yet. waiting on the lord himself to tune it
[2024-10-18T21:47:24] haku: i want to do burnouts so badly
[2024-10-18T21:48:24] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Generate a log file shows you alot where you can improve things
[2024-10-18T21:49:23] haku: right now just motor config nothing has been touch. even bms settings not tuned
[2024-10-18T21:50:03] haku: my 60v laotie was faster than this on stock esc
[2024-10-18T21:51:56] haku: its like theres a ramp time. no burnout energy
[2024-10-18T21:55:19] puneDir: @Tommynwn help him
[2024-10-18T21:56:13] haku: 70g 33x2 i think is the wrong motor for burnouts
[2024-10-18T21:56:25] Tommy ª: 33 amps phase?
[2024-10-18T21:56:49] haku: no idea. just riding around. let me check in a bit
[2024-10-18T21:57:07] Tommy ª: probably im gonna to get banned xD
[2024-10-18T21:59:06] Noname: What? My emoto 1wd hits like 7kw on a 1500w stock motor. Any more and I get shuttering or rotor slip.idk what it's called
[2024-10-18T21:59:23] Noname: You need to turn that shit way up
[2024-10-18T22:06:35] haku: yea dude. battery has lots of amps. it should burnout.
[2024-10-18T22:06:58] haku: its fast once you get it running. but no startung torque
[2024-10-18T22:07:14] haku: surron boys gonna gap me.
[2024-10-18T22:08:49] haku: no wheel slip is what im.saying
[2024-10-18T22:09:35] Noname: 11kw? OK so now your at my vsett power. There's still more to go
[2024-10-18T22:09:52] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Too soft tires too much grip ..... do some burnouts get rid of the profile 😂
[2024-10-18T22:11:25] Noname: Prob ramp time and phase amps issue
[2024-10-18T22:11:38] Noname: Beside highway motors
[2024-10-18T22:12:26] 'lekrsu': For ADC's or are there separated ramp up for the motor?
[2024-10-18T22:13:14] Noname: Idk I'm a set it and forget it guy
[2024-10-18T22:25:32] haku: dam im dissapoined. peak g30 and vsett9 acelerates faster than this
[2024-10-18T22:26:07] haku: ill mess around with it later
[2024-10-18T22:26:37] haku: all that hype dam
[2024-10-18T22:27:25] Noname: You should be over 20kw
[2024-10-18T22:29:55] haku: yea. was expecting the same
[2024-10-18T22:30:39] haku: maybe bms setting fucked up.
[2024-10-18T22:30:47] Noname: If a g30 with a 6p battery can do it
[2024-10-18T22:31:37] Noname: 400a discharge
[2024-10-18T22:31:42] haku: motors are warm too. i hit 60 though. it can do more i think
[2024-10-18T22:32:03] haku: should i crank it up to 550?
[2024-10-18T22:32:16] Noname: No your not cutting bms
[2024-10-18T22:32:42] Noname: Idk mabey geared to high with those motors
[2024-10-18T22:32:52] haku: yea
[2024-10-18T22:32:55] Noname: 60 is moving
[2024-10-18T22:33:08] haku: dude the acceleration is super slow
[2024-10-18T22:33:29] haku: ill mess with it tomorow
[2024-10-18T22:33:54] NetworkDir: you can send Motor Settings -> General -> Current?
[2024-10-18T22:33:55] haku: i was hoping it would buck me off
[2024-10-18T22:36:00] haku: <photos/photo_18668@18-10-2024_22-36-00.jpg>

[2024-10-18T22:36:41] Tommy ª: even my old ass razor uses 180a phase
[2024-10-18T22:38:39] NetworkDir: oh fuck your regen seems very wrong
[2024-10-18T22:39:10] NetworkDir: you have a 70H 33x2 right?
[2024-10-18T22:39:29] Noname: My 1500w stock motor has 180
[2024-10-18T22:39:52] Tommy ª: casually the mine is 1500w and it also has 180
[2024-10-18T22:40:26] Noname: @Bradhaku turn up phase to 220 and try
[2024-10-18T22:40:47] haku: yes
[2024-10-18T22:41:33] NetworkDir: Motor Max Current : 280A Motor Max Brake: -100A ABS Current: 360A Battery Current Max: 250A Battery Max Regen: -10A (Depends your cell and bms charge current)
[2024-10-18T22:42:08] haku: my cells can do up to 525a 12p p42
[2024-10-18T22:42:16] haku: bms is 575a
[2024-10-18T22:42:43] NetworkDir: Nice so set like i say
[2024-10-18T22:42:57] NetworkDir: anyway you can push 300A phase but try with this if don't like make it 300A :D
[2024-10-18T22:43:19] haku: okay thanks man
[2024-10-18T22:43:48] haku: ill make 1 more run then need to get my kid
[2024-10-18T22:44:42] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Run a log
[2024-10-18T22:44:55] haku: how? im new to vesc
[2024-10-18T22:45:16] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Main page start log (select log directory first
[2024-10-18T22:45:21] haku: ive never tuned before i just run basic motor config
[2024-10-18T22:45:28] NetworkDir: you can send your esp32-c3 wiring for vesc_express? i don't find correct pin outs for sd and ..
[2024-10-18T22:46:10] NetworkDir: lol
[2024-10-18T22:46:25] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Thats easy .... as in VESC they remapped the pins ... hold on ....
[2024-10-18T22:46:28] Noname: Just quick ride and see. He's busy guys
[2024-10-18T22:47:25] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Have a look here https://t.me/VescHelpGroup/1/274750
[2024-10-18T22:49:35] NetworkDir: Oh nice and gps - canbus module ?
[2024-10-18T22:51:53] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): For the GPS you use 20(RX)/21(TX) and the can 0(RX)/1(TX)
[2024-10-18T22:53:18] NetworkDir: I will make a GitHub repository for all documents if you want to :)
[2024-10-18T22:54:20] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Always handy that kinda stuff as i could no where found anything so i had to dig trough the sourcecode till i realized he remapped the pins :) (As you see the SD Card pins are mixed totally)
[2024-10-18T22:56:18] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): For the GPS a cheap UBLOX Neo works the best (as it has backup battery) https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006816514975.html
[2024-10-18T22:56:21] haku: @NetworkDir holy shit that setting changed it drastically wow
[2024-10-18T22:56:51] haku: <photos/photo_18672@18-10-2024_22-56-51.jpg>
[2024-10-18T22:57:06] haku: thats just a short street.wtf
[2024-10-18T22:57:42] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): We want burnouts (+video)!!!!
[2024-10-18T23:01:06] Noname: Still only 15kw
[2024-10-18T23:02:31] haku: need a long street
[2024-10-18T23:03:04] Noname: Did you full throttle it. Not top speed but power applied
[2024-10-18T23:03:18] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): And keep an eye on motor temp/fet temp if they just from that short trip ramped up like that you might need cooling ;)
[2024-10-18T23:03:28] Yamal: How's the minibike going...! :)
[2024-10-18T23:03:56] haku: very good now.
[2024-10-18T23:04:08] Noname: Mood has changed a bit lol
[2024-10-18T23:04:17] Noname: <animation>

[2024-10-18T23:04:36] Yamal: So much temp
[2024-10-18T23:04:59] Yamal: Almost 67°C
[2024-10-18T23:05:04] Noname: Struggling with speed motors?
[2024-10-18T23:05:18] haku: i dont even know if i have the right ntc settings
[2024-10-18T23:05:19] Yamal: 12fet..
[2024-10-18T23:06:17] haku: i want to keep riding this fuck. i but kid needs to be picked up. maybe ill pick him up in this
[2024-10-18T23:06:32] haku: can it do 400 phase?
[2024-10-18T23:06:46] Noname: Add heat quicker sure
[2024-10-18T23:07:06] Yamal: Safe? I think noP……
[2024-10-18T23:07:27] Noname: Safe is not fun
[2024-10-18T23:07:28] haku: ill do it
[2024-10-18T23:07:43] Noname: Need to set temp shut down first
[2024-10-18T23:07:51] haku: we want to convert fardriver boys
[2024-10-18T23:08:45] Noname: Ah it's refined vs brute strength. Need ya a Seven to compete mabey
[2024-10-18T23:08:46] haku: burnouts is what i built this for
[2024-10-18T23:08:53] Yamal: Why, minibike ?
[2024-10-18T23:09:19] Noname: To vesc
[2024-10-18T23:09:22] Yamal: Burnouts with 33/2 it’s not easy man
[2024-10-18T23:09:37] Noname: Run what ya brung
[2024-10-18T23:09:40] haku: <video_file>
[2024-10-18T23:09:50] haku: for you yamal

[2024-10-18T23:09:53] Noname: Need I love china torque edition
[2024-10-18T23:10:16] Yamal: 🔥
[2024-10-18T23:11:06] NetworkDir: :D
[2024-10-18T23:11:21] haku: 300 phase is safe yea?
[2024-10-18T23:11:27] NetworkDir: yes bro
[2024-10-18T23:11:50] haku: whats the max i can do with 33x2?
[2024-10-18T23:11:51] NetworkDir: but after making 300A phase change abs current to 390A
[2024-10-18T23:11:59] NetworkDir: i think you don't have a any limits
[2024-10-18T23:12:03] NetworkDir: :D
[2024-10-18T23:12:24] haku: aslong as 250 battery amps?
[2024-10-18T23:13:10] Yamal: What is the current abs worth?
[2024-10-18T23:13:27] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_18673@18-10-2024_23-13-27.jpg>
[2024-10-18T23:13:59] Yamal: I seem to remember that I have that value set to zero in the little Focer...
[2024-10-18T23:14:03] NetworkDir: your motor have a temp sensor?
[2024-10-18T23:14:41] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_18674@18-10-2024_23-14-41.jpg>
[2024-10-18T23:14:44] haku: yea. ntc100k
[2024-10-18T23:15:14] NetworkDir: Nice do you setup it correctly?
[2024-10-18T23:15:29] NetworkDir: should something like this
[2024-10-18T23:15:42] haku: im not sure tbh. i just put motor config at ntc100k
[2024-10-18T23:16:15] NetworkDir: OK monitor motor temp max should 85C i think
[2024-10-18T23:16:34] haku: gotcha. thanks bro
[2024-10-18T23:16:38] NetworkDir: np
[2024-10-18T23:16:49] NetworkDir: also try mxlemming observer
[2024-10-18T23:17:02] haku: ok. where is that setting?
[2024-10-18T23:17:03] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_18676@18-10-2024_23-17-03.jpg>
[2024-10-18T23:17:15] haku: ty
[2024-10-18T23:17:20] NetworkDir: Motor Settings -> FOC -> Advanced -> Observer Type -> Set it to OBSERVER_Mxlemming
[2024-10-18T23:17:29] haku: im learning today
[2024-10-18T23:17:36] NetworkDir: you do setting on both vesc's yes?
[2024-10-18T23:17:47] haku: yep
[2024-10-18T23:17:50] NetworkDir: ok good
[2024-10-18T23:18:45] haku: 33x2 isnt bad at all. its fast af. at first it was just accelerating slow but after current fix it bucks me off
[2024-10-18T23:20:28] Yamal: ?
[2024-10-18T23:21:07] haku: when i first ran it it was underwhelming. because vesc settings all over the place
[2024-10-18T23:21:12] NetworkDir: High kV motors need huge phase amps for good accelerating
[2024-10-18T23:21:39] haku: but heats up easily yea?
[2024-10-18T23:21:50] NetworkDir: i don't think
[2024-10-18T23:22:00] NetworkDir: fine anyway for your currents
[2024-10-18T23:22:12] NetworkDir: you have good motors (magnet quality and etc..)
[2024-10-18T23:22:38] haku: gotcha. i still have a lot to learn about vesc and motors
[2024-10-18T23:22:55] NetworkDir: and buy the esp32 display and build fuckeria display :)
[2024-10-18T23:23:44] Noname: @Bradhaku your kid don't forget him
[2024-10-18T23:23:54] NetworkDir: 😂😂😂
[2024-10-18T23:23:54] Yamal: XD
[2024-10-18T23:24:58] haku: oh fuck i forgot about him
[2024-10-18T23:25:37] Noname: Vesc rabbit hole got him
[2024-10-18T23:26:27] Pandalgns: mounting the screen and putting the resistor mod 💪😁
[2024-10-18T23:31:01] Paolo ⁭: Oh my goodness
[2024-10-18T23:33:06] Pandalgns: Gays, i have a problem, i dont know where put the resistor mod in 84100hp
[2024-10-18T23:33:09] Pandalgns: 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
[2024-10-18T23:35:11] Pandalgns: Yes, but it only turns off while it is stopped, the moment you move it it turns on and I understand that the resistor mod turns it off completely even if you move it
[2024-10-18T23:36:18] Paolo ⁭: @Pandalgns
[2024-10-18T23:36:36] Paolo ⁭: Not verified source , you check
[2024-10-18T23:37:30] Pandalgns: I think I remember talking to Punedir at the time and having it confirmed, but I'm not sure.
[2024-10-18T23:38:02] NetworkDir: I don't recommend if you love the CANBUS :D
[2024-10-18T23:38:13] Pandalgns: cry
[2024-10-18T23:38:15] Pandalgns: i use can bus
[2024-10-18T23:38:16] Pandalgns: xDD
[2024-10-18T23:38:46] Pandalgns: and I have already had to remove the safety mosfet
[2024-10-18T23:39:41] Pandalgns: @punedir clear me of doubts please 😂😂
[2024-10-18T23:39:42] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Pandalgns has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-18T23:49:31] Yamal: 👍
[2024-10-18T23:51:10] Pandalgns: In any case, I understand that the problem of burning the canbus is not due to turning off the controller but rather from connecting and disconnecting the battery with the canbus connected.
[2024-10-18T23:58:20] haku: im in the school. but anyways i think the spinny throttle might have some lag.
[2024-10-18T23:58:32] haku: or ramping
[2024-10-18T23:58:53] haku: i still like it though
[2024-10-18T23:58:55] 'lekrsu': 13 mph? 😁
[2024-10-18T23:59:11] haku: lol idk my tire size lol
[2024-10-18T23:59:20] 'lekrsu': wrong poles too ye
[2024-10-18T23:59:21] haku: diameter
[2024-10-18T23:59:31] haku: i put 30
[2024-10-18T23:59:37] 'lekrsu': do u have 30
[2024-10-18T23:59:42] haku: im not sure tbh
[2024-10-19T00:00:02] 'lekrsu': love the wild tuning
[2024-10-19T00:00:25] haku: i just want it running and doimg burnouts
[2024-10-19T00:00:43] haku: does the pole count affect the motor at all? like heat?
[2024-10-19T00:01:10] 'lekrsu': reported speed ye
[2024-10-19T00:01:19] haku: i see
[2024-10-19T00:02:31] haku: im not sure. i have ly 70h 33x2
[2024-10-19T00:03:03] 'lekrsu': tempted to level up to 65h, but need James to find axle extension size needed on his g2 :))
[2024-10-19T00:03:10] 'lekrsu': then I can copy 😁
[2024-10-19T00:03:51] 'lekrsu': I have no torque at low speeds lmao
[2024-10-19T00:03:56] haku: 65h on a g2 is crazy
[2024-10-19T00:04:07] 'lekrsu': I have 25h rn ))
[2024-10-19T00:04:34] 'lekrsu': freaking fun but any hills is ded
[2024-10-19T00:04:38] haku: if you give it ebough amps i think it will give torque. earlier i have the same problem. low amps in vesctool
[2024-10-19T00:04:46] 'lekrsu': No, can't give it more
[2024-10-19T00:05:03] haku: 40pl dude all the amps you need
[2024-10-19T00:05:03] 'lekrsu': doing 30A batt 60A phase, still can overheat yk
[2024-10-19T00:05:37] 'lekrsu': g2 motor can't use high amps ))
[2024-10-19T00:06:06] haku: g2 motor and gen 2 g30 similar?
[2024-10-19T00:06:17] 'lekrsu': nah
[2024-10-19T00:06:30] 'lekrsu': all diff
[2024-10-19T00:06:44] haku: my boys g30 motor on bike is pretty okay. i love that little thing
[2024-10-19T00:07:08] 'lekrsu': different pole count, different rim, diff h-size, hall layout diff, diff stator rim
[2024-10-19T00:07:18] haku: it pops a wheelie at 50a
[2024-10-19T00:07:34] 'lekrsu': it wouldn't easily pop a wheelie on a scooter haha
[2024-10-19T00:07:44] 'lekrsu': unless you go nuclear amp level
[2024-10-19T00:07:49] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-10-19T00:07:50] haku: the bike short wheelbase
[2024-10-19T00:07:57] 'lekrsu': 10cm 😁
[2024-10-19T00:08:06] 'lekrsu': front wheel touching rear motor 🛵
[2024-10-19T00:11:09] 'lekrsu': Anyone using the Seven vescs?
[2024-10-19T00:13:37] Yamal: good question
[2024-10-19T00:16:22] Yamal: Also x12
[2024-10-19T00:20:41] haku: spintend for life baby.
[2024-10-19T00:21:06] Yamal: Yes I want to get soon
[2024-10-19T00:21:17] haku: get seven
[2024-10-19T00:21:24] haku: we need a tester
[2024-10-19T00:21:28] Yamal: Bro no can
[2024-10-19T00:21:38] haku: yes can
[2024-10-19T00:21:42] Yamal: 1200$ for the pair
[2024-10-19T00:22:02] haku: for theb18fet?
[2024-10-19T00:22:04] Yamal: I need buy many things
[2024-10-19T00:22:20] Yamal: 599 =1 controller
[2024-10-19T00:22:37] haku: thats the cheaper one?
[2024-10-19T00:22:45] Yamal: Yea
[2024-10-19T00:22:51] haku: oh my
[2024-10-19T00:23:12] Yamal: 175$ 12 fet spintend xD
[2024-10-19T00:23:17] haku: how many amps can that do?
[2024-10-19T00:24:20] Yamal: <photos/photo_18679@19-10-2024_00-24-20.jpg>
[2024-10-19T00:25:19] Yamal: 300 continuous 700 burst 😂
[2024-10-19T00:26:16] Yamal: 750 max set point
[2024-10-19T00:27:58] Yamal: <photos/photo_18680@19-10-2024_00-27-58.jpg>
[2024-10-19T01:05:11] haku: @NetworkDir is this the mxlemmings?
[2024-10-19T01:05:19] haku: is it lambada
[2024-10-19T01:06:03] haku: wich one is it? so many mxlemmings.
[2024-10-19T01:12:02] Noname: What's the difference in those
[2024-10-19T01:18:38] haku: no clue
[2024-10-19T01:19:28] haku: dam this bold will come off. its so tight to work with
[2024-10-19T01:19:29] Noname: Thanks 😊 helpful comment
[2024-10-19T01:20:02] Noname: Ah button heads my nemesis
[2024-10-19T01:20:17] haku: its a steering bolt too
[2024-10-19T01:20:35] haku: i might have to cut one of mu hex keys
[2024-10-19T01:20:38] Unknown: Vesc g30 dash
[2024-10-19T01:20:40] Unknown: But the same thing. I can load the built-in settings and read them. but I can't load our settings. I can't understand.
[2024-10-19T01:21:07] NetworkDir: Just select mxlemming without Ortega
[2024-10-19T01:21:14] Unknown: Vesc g30 dash
[2024-10-19T01:21:16] Unknown: But the same thing. I can load the built-in settings and read them. but I can't load our settings. I can't understand.
[2024-10-19T01:23:25] haku: there is no mxlemmings ortega. these are the choices.
[2024-10-19T01:23:47] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_18685@19-10-2024_01-23-47.jpg>
[2024-10-19T01:23:57] haku: ok gotcha
[2024-10-19T01:30:46] Yamal: learn that haku programming well!! It will be my turn soon! XD
[2024-10-19T01:31:01] Yamal: I think always original Ortega
[2024-10-19T01:39:46] NetworkDir: on 3shul better use original ortega but on ubox mxlemming works
[2024-10-19T01:43:32] Yamal: Amaizing info
[2024-10-19T01:43:52] Yamal: I use original Ortega on little F
[2024-10-19T01:47:29] haku: what retarded design wtf china
[2024-10-19T01:47:30] haku: <photos/photo_18687@19-10-2024_01-47-30.jpg>
[2024-10-19T01:51:35] Yamal: No place
[2024-10-19T01:52:52] haku: it takes like 50 quarter turns. its not even done yet. reminds me of my old mercedes
[2024-10-19T01:54:10] Yamal: Did you previously have a Mercedes?
[2024-10-19T01:59:01] haku: yes. im glad they did not use torx
[2024-10-19T01:59:15] haku: china. unlike mercedes
[2024-10-19T01:59:34] haku: torx for everything so stupid
[2024-10-19T02:02:06] Yamal: You mean , you like torx
[2024-10-19T02:03:33] haku: yes the bit. the star shaped
[2024-10-19T02:04:18] haku: and everything is so tight. no space to work on. have to remove parts to get to one
[2024-10-19T02:04:33] haku: just like this china bike
[2024-10-19T02:05:57] Yamal: But is complete!
[2024-10-19T02:06:36] Yamal: Time to race, so many things you can do with it,
[2024-10-19T02:07:09] Yamal: go on the road and go buy a coke 40km from home
[2024-10-19T02:07:10] Yamal: XD
[2024-10-19T02:08:06] haku: i have to make sure all bolts are tight and settings are good
[2024-10-19T02:10:26] Yamal: make sure everything is fine!! That beast looks very beautiful, I think you are going to steal more than one Latin heart and make more than one boy cry with a surron
[2024-10-19T02:15:00] haku: i just want to get back at the surron boys for calling me gay
[2024-10-19T02:15:14] haku: that started last year. i will never forget
[2024-10-19T02:16:12] Yamal: 😂
[2024-10-19T02:17:29] Yamal: oh really?
[2024-10-19T02:18:41] Yamal: don't let teenagers disrespect you
[2024-10-19T02:19:00] Noname: Who cares. Had a harley rider hold up gay hand as we passed. He was alone we were in a group who's gay
[2024-10-19T02:19:33] Noname: Almost blows off a finger not a peep but soft inside
[2024-10-19T02:19:57] Noname: Whos my big Chinese teddy bear
[2024-10-19T02:20:16] Yamal: These things make me angry, because more and more sadly, principles and education are being lost.
[2024-10-19T02:20:44] Noname: Had a lot of encounters it's amazing. Like why you care do your own thing
[2024-10-19T02:22:40] haku: nah those surron kids went too far. it cut ne deep
[2024-10-19T02:23:05] haku: this might not be the best idea burnouts all the time
[2024-10-19T02:24:45] Noname: 2nd tire change and you'll stop
[2024-10-19T02:24:46] Yamal: How beautiful the engine phases look xD
[2024-10-19T02:26:19] Yamal: Are they snakeskin covers?
[2024-10-19T02:26:40] Noname: <animation>
[2024-10-19T02:28:30] haku: nah ill stop burnt rubber flakes all over the rear ofthe frame
[2024-10-19T02:30:34] NetworkDir: When you want burnout on app settings change mode to Current for disabling regen and brake Front brake + full throttle should funny 😅
[2024-10-19T02:37:39] haku: i forgot i hava rear fender so i can keep doing it haha
[2024-10-19T02:49:26] haku: yes it is haha. lot of smoke and burnt smell
[2024-10-19T02:56:14] haku: is it difficult to burnout on pmt? very sticky
[2024-10-19T02:57:34] Noname: It's rubber not plastic better but still spin
[2024-10-19T03:10:06] haku: <video_file>
[2024-10-19T03:10:19] haku: 500a boy and witherstorm
[2024-10-19T03:16:15] Yamal: Heheh
[2024-10-19T04:12:08] Yamal: You are going to bring the revolution to Las Vegas with the VESC project
[2024-10-19T04:39:24] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-10-19T04:47:03] haku: need to put this back together and sell
[2024-10-19T04:47:38] haku: dam stock controller gonna be a bitch to wire
[2024-10-19T04:47:47] haku: its all cut up
[2024-10-19T04:49:15] haku: if i sell this and vsett ill get a seven to test for da boys
[2024-10-19T04:51:45] Noname: You need 2
[2024-10-19T04:51:59] Noname: Like 2 of them
[2024-10-19T04:52:05] Noname: No 2 do it
[2024-10-19T04:53:24] haku: daym i guess we never gonna test and feel the seven. i wonder what thier warranty is when you blow it up. if it lives up to spec
[2024-10-19T04:54:03] Noname: 7 rear vesc front?
[2024-10-19T04:54:07] haku: now that i felt what 72 feels like. i want more
[2024-10-19T04:54:31] Noname: Your not even tuned
[2024-10-19T04:54:44] Noname: If you had torque motors
[2024-10-19T04:55:06] Noname: Things wired for straight speed
[2024-10-19T04:55:21] haku: yea man. speed kicks in at 10mph
[2024-10-19T04:55:44] haku: its when you feel it.
[2024-10-19T04:56:01] Noname: Starting manual car in 3rd gear
[2024-10-19T04:56:19] haku: agreed
[2024-10-19T04:56:23] Noname: How did you measure 60mph gps?
[2024-10-19T04:56:29] haku: yes
[2024-10-19T04:56:35] Noname: Jesus
[2024-10-19T04:56:49] haku: it felt like it had more to give
[2024-10-19T04:57:22] Noname: My buddys 20s9p vsett with the nucs he let off around 70. Idk what the wind is
[2024-10-19T04:57:23] haku: ill properly test a speed run when tune is peefect and i know the bike well
[2024-10-19T04:57:41] Noname: I don't even want to know the speed
[2024-10-19T04:57:50] Noname: How did it handle
[2024-10-19T04:57:54] haku: i had lean forward like a try hard but its needed
[2024-10-19T04:58:08] haku: very stable
[2024-10-19T04:58:16] haku: suspension sucks though
[2024-10-19T04:58:35] haku: it kinda has a built in damper i think.
[2024-10-19T05:00:29] Noname: Yeah always suspension woes. Short travel
[2024-10-19T05:02:20] haku: if i blow suspension ill get the ali ones. i forgot the name but its bang for buck
[2024-10-19T05:02:49] haku: ill not spend anymore unless it needs fixing
[2024-10-19T05:03:17] haku: i need to wire lights and switch tom
[2024-10-19T05:04:09] haku: maybe just buy a spray paint to color sides tan. you know like how toyota has those tan trucks? tundra and tacoma
[2024-10-19T05:04:22] haku: like sand color
[2024-10-19T05:04:22] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-19T05:17:26] Yamal: Very guud
[2024-10-19T05:26:09] haku: idk my battery drains fast for a 50ah. i just traveled short distances bit full blast. im down to 50%
[2024-10-19T05:29:48] Noname: 4000w battery pulling 14000watts
[2024-10-19T05:31:08] Noname: I cruise at 2500 to 3500w on 6700w battery. 30 to 35mph I get 60 - 70 miles.
[2024-10-19T05:32:13] haku: ill try that.
[2024-10-19T05:32:58] Noname: It doesn't take long like driving a big Ole v8 when ya stomp on it. She gets thirsty
[2024-10-19T05:33:11] haku: from 82v to 76v
[2024-10-19T05:33:27] haku: oh yea. lol
[2024-10-19T05:33:58] haku: idk how gramma affords the v8 life
[2024-10-19T05:34:15] Noname: Feather 🪶 on the pedal
[2024-10-19T05:35:36] haku: imo where i live 4cyl 1.8 2.0 is enough
[2024-10-19T05:36:13] Noname: I will never again own a 4cyl

[2024-10-19T05:41:17] Noname: Idk why make 80-100k$ trucks I want a sub 30K
[2024-10-19T05:41:53] Noname: AC power windows and a 4.0L rubber floor mats and a radio is good enough
[2024-10-19T05:42:07] haku: the diesel ones are cool.never owned a diesel. my dad had a diesel land cruiser.

[2024-10-19T12:34:32] Yamal: Acabo de encontrar este increíble artículo en AliExpress. ¡Échale un vistazo! 24,99€ | Kit de soporte de amortiguador de dirección para patinete eléctrico, soporte negro para Inxing V5 CNC, estabilizador de fibra de carbono, amortiguador de dirección https://a.aliexpress.com/_EyzzNfF
[2024-10-19T12:35:26] 'lekrsu': Go without))
[2024-10-19T12:43:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It breaks when the shock absorber is set too hard. The oil seal is too small and cannot withstand the pressure and breaks.
[2024-10-19T12:56:10] Yamal: I like going fast too much, it is better to use it in case wobbles appear xD
[2024-10-19T13:09:23] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, but you can't set it too hard or they will break unless you buy brands like Ohlins, Mupo, WP, Hiperpro…
[2024-10-19T13:09:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Those on Aliexpress are all the same, only the logo changes. Look at the shock absorber model and you will know what I mean.

[2024-10-19T19:54:36] haku: wait till you get big qs and big battery on the puneped.
[2024-10-19T20:07:41] haku: guys 30s on a 33x2 will just give me more speed no torque yea? example if i do 30s 8p. 40pl
[2024-10-19T20:08:26] haku: will that setup still have startup speed and will able to do burnouts
[2024-10-19T20:09:05] haku: or not a good idea for small 70h scooter motor
[2024-10-19T20:09:06] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-19T22:15:35] puneDir: Noname what motor is good for moto

[2024-10-19T22:34:14] haku: tbh i think thats the only esc option for this
[2024-10-19T22:36:22] haku: i still have a lot to learn about these motors. in my mind idk why but bigger and heavier the motor the better
[2024-10-19T22:36:37] haku: more copper and stuff
[2024-10-19T22:39:11] haku: china gonna china. no engineering just make the biggest haha
[2024-10-19T22:41:00] puneDir: Turkish made motor
[2024-10-19T22:41:12] haku: do you know where seven is made?
[2024-10-19T22:41:42] haku: ive been wondering that for a long time
[2024-10-19T22:41:56] haku: sweden?
[2024-10-19T22:43:00] puneDir: Turkish femsan makes stark varg motor

[2024-10-19T22:43:21] puneDir: And turkish citizens cant get motor
[2024-10-19T22:43:59] haku: very far. hopefully someday

[2024-10-19T22:45:32] puneDir: If police gets varg you cannot take back
[2024-10-19T22:45:58] puneDir: <photos/photo_18703@19-10-2024_22-45-58.jpg>
[2024-10-19T22:46:25] puneDir: Tiny motor
[2024-10-19T22:47:07] puneDir: With what
[2024-10-19T22:47:15] puneDir: Best i can find 35h
[2024-10-19T22:47:49] puneDir: Is there cheap ok power motors?
[2024-10-19T22:53:32] haku: wich country assembles varg? finland?
[2024-10-19T22:53:47] haku: or turkey?
[2024-10-19T22:58:09] haku: wow nice
[2024-10-19T22:59:20] haku: that is the e dirt bike to beat currently yea? factory specs are insane
[2024-10-19T23:06:01] Patrick: More kW atleast for topspeed interesting if youre already saturating them
[2024-10-19T23:06:43] haku: i shouldve have though it thru or asked questions before purchasing 33x2 last year. i dont want fast top speed but just fast off the line
[2024-10-19T23:07:32] haku: but im already happy with my setup. thats enough
[2024-10-19T23:08:59] haku: i remember that one guy forgot his name has 33x2 motors and doing rolling burnouts. maybe bike too heavy
[2024-10-19T23:18:42] haku: dual motor 16x4 bad idea?
[2024-10-19T23:22:09] haku: like 70h and above. scooter stator
[2024-10-19T23:22:52] haku: but single thats fine yea?
[2024-10-19T23:23:24] haku: like 65h 16x4 10"
[2024-10-19T23:23:28] haku: single
[2024-10-19T23:24:02] Patrick: Youre looking more for peak Power so if youre not racing 30s should be fine
[2024-10-19T23:24:29] Patrick: 33x2 is fast enough on 20s anyways
[2024-10-19T23:25:42] haku: i want unlimited burnouts at low amps haha
[2024-10-19T23:26:24] haku: one motor g30
[2024-10-19T23:26:33] Patrick: Yea ofcourse at high speeds more important once you need the power
[2024-10-19T23:26:39] Patrick: <photos/photo_18704@19-10-2024_23-26-39.jpg>
[2024-10-19T23:27:05] Patrick: If youre looking for topspeed its cool
[2024-10-19T23:27:45] haku: im a bitch to test at those speeds.
[2024-10-19T23:27:46] Patrick: Yea but sadly some time you saturate them
[2024-10-19T23:28:10] Patrick: How fast is 33x2 70H around 150km/h right?
[2024-10-19T23:28:25] haku: oh really at 20s?
[2024-10-19T23:28:35] Patrick: Yea kV is insane
[2024-10-19T23:28:36] haku: or 22
[2024-10-19T23:29:28] Patrick: Yea if youre looking for doing this for some km get a bigger motor
[2024-10-19T23:29:38] haku: can my battery and vesc can do that?
[2024-10-19T23:30:17] Patrick: Yes what even is the biggest motor you ever tested James?
[2024-10-19T23:30:26] Patrick: 100H+?
[2024-10-19T23:31:47] haku: those qs273 vesc can push those easily yea? 3t motors
[2024-10-19T23:32:41] Yamal: 🧐
[2024-10-19T23:32:55] haku: normally folks here match them with sabvoton 😭72200

[2024-10-20T02:45:08] Yamal: The rice in this recipe is delicious because they boil it with a little coconut milk
[2024-10-20T02:53:54] haku: winter gear baby.
[2024-10-20T03:36:07] Yamal: In your area, is heating, stoves or fireplaces necessary to generate electricity in the winter?
[2024-10-20T03:36:25] haku: yea we use gas
[2024-10-20T03:37:40] haku: i dont even need to turn it on. i just use a small electric heater for me and my boy

[2024-10-20T03:51:37] Yamal: I don’t like seat
[2024-10-20T03:52:26] Yamal: Seat in sofa with Pocahontas
[2024-10-20T03:54:56] Yamal: I like the scooter concept and standing, to rest or sit in a good place with good views to relax, but the mere act of standing makes me become more part of the vehicle, the driving is more intense, In my opinion, interactions are more with the vehicle, sometimes I kneel on the deck to rest a little. I didn't fall in love with its concept on the first day.
[2024-10-20T03:56:36] Yamal: <photos/photo_18720@20-10-2024_03-56-36.jpg>

[2024-10-20T05:18:39] Noname: Just go to far now. 12 hrs standing sucks
[2024-10-20T05:18:40] Yamal: In my country, if you put a seat on a scooter and they catch you, they fine you €1,500 and this is real.
[2024-10-20T05:19:12] Noname: Yeah it makes it a "motorcycle"
[2024-10-20T05:19:22] haku: even short distances. legs always sore after working out
[2024-10-20T05:20:19] Yamal: May I remind you how a scooter was born?
[2024-10-20T05:20:25] Yamal: XD
[2024-10-20T05:20:33] haku: by boys peak g30 prolly tge best one ive made. small can fit anywhere and can go places
[2024-10-20T05:21:10] Yamal: I remember them as a kid with the transparent rubber wheels and without being electric.
[2024-10-20T05:22:51] haku: here laws i think has to have pedals
[2024-10-20T05:23:04] haku: but not enforced in my area
[2024-10-20T05:23:46] Yamal: But it seems perfect to me that you like to sit down seriously!
[2024-10-20T05:24:11] Yamal: Free Las Vegas
[2024-10-20T05:25:04] haku: its just such a hassle for me to stand up when legs sore. also the stance is not comfortable
[2024-10-20T05:25:16] Yamal: Also I like fiido minibike custom

[2024-10-20T05:29:45] Yamal: If nothing happens, I'll show you once again what it's like to spend an entire weekend standing on a scooter. XD
[2024-10-20T05:29:57] Noname: Only emoto 4 you toss the scoots
[2024-10-20T05:31:30] haku: we run the hood now
[2024-10-20T05:31:44] haku: the surron boys can kiss the pinky ring to show respect
[2024-10-20T05:31:56] Yamal: Nice
[2024-10-20T05:32:17] haku: this was earlier. dam my caliper so noisy still
[2024-10-20T05:32:28] Noname: Obeys traffic better than my friends 😆
[2024-10-20T05:32:34] Yamal: Your discs make noise, you must center the calipers
[2024-10-20T05:33:39] haku: its rubbing in 1 area. i think it might be bent
[2024-10-20T05:34:23] Yamal: You could also have the disc bent somewhat, but being new it shouldn't be.
[2024-10-20T05:35:04] haku: ill check it tomorow. i was hoping it will go away in time from rubbing haha
[2024-10-20T05:35:17] Yamal: ;)
[2024-10-20T05:36:07] haku: what thickness rotors are those 3mm when new?
[2024-10-20T05:36:29] Yamal: Nop,, 2
[2024-10-20T05:36:40] Yamal: And no good quality
[2024-10-20T05:36:57] haku: but your magura works great with it though
[2024-10-20T05:37:49] haku: does magura also sell rotors?
[2024-10-20T05:37:49] Yamal: my magura have left the discs like cigarette papers and also with organic brake pads xD
[2024-10-20T05:38:01] Yamal: Yes
[2024-10-20T05:38:13] haku: is it good quality?
[2024-10-20T05:38:19] Yamal: Next I want to buy galfer disc
[2024-10-20T05:38:30] haku: show photo
[2024-10-20T05:38:46] haku: what size you use 160?
[2024-10-20T05:40:00] Yamal: <photos/photo_18724@20-10-2024_05-40-00.jpg>
[2024-10-20T05:40:43] haku: i want this one.
[2024-10-20T05:40:44] haku: <photos/photo_18726@20-10-2024_05-40-44.jpg>
[2024-10-20T05:41:16] haku: how much is that?
[2024-10-20T05:41:47] Yamal: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EwSk4H7
[2024-10-20T05:41:47] Yamal: Many people use this ..
[2024-10-20T05:42:10] haku: laotie uses that
[2024-10-20T05:42:40] Yamal: 3mm 160mm is good I never try
[2024-10-20T05:43:02] Yamal: 30€ around
[2024-10-20T05:43:20] haku: yea. current one i have is 3mm but the direction is wrong. i need to change to the other side.
[2024-10-20T05:43:55] haku: look at the rotor direction. i cannot flip it
[2024-10-20T05:44:59] haku: i need new discs. because this one has a built in spacer
[2024-10-20T05:45:11] Yamal: If you turn it around, it remains disc too close to the wheel, right?
[2024-10-20T05:46:04] haku: i cant turn it around. it has a spacer.
[2024-10-20T05:47:18] Noname: It's OK the mount area is universal. The rotor is slotted mabey wrong but not unsafe
[2024-10-20T05:47:48] haku: the surron boys trying to clap me. dam
[2024-10-20T05:47:52] Noname: Slots lean back
[2024-10-20T05:47:56] Noname: Is correct
[2024-10-20T05:48:14] haku: yep. i need new one
[2024-10-20T05:48:33] Noname: New what
[2024-10-20T05:48:56] Yamal: Look nice also the Surron heh
[2024-10-20T05:49:18] haku: they put a hit on me
[2024-10-20T05:49:24] Noname: So uncomfortable though. Like riding a kitchen table
[2024-10-20T05:49:40] Yamal: They can use for 2 people like legal..?
[2024-10-20T05:49:58] haku: rotors. my rotors for right side only rotors but i put it in left
[2024-10-20T05:50:16] Noname: No they look correct
[2024-10-20T05:50:26] haku: are you sure
[2024-10-20T05:50:41] haku: isnt it the other way
[2024-10-20T05:51:16] Noname: The mounting ares of scooter rotors are angled. Point wrong way the center collapses. Your center is universal but slots are on braking surface
[2024-10-20T05:51:27] Noname: Slots lean back on cars anyway
[2024-10-20T05:51:36] Noname: It can't collapse there
[2024-10-20T05:51:38] haku: true
[2024-10-20T05:52:50] Yamal: you still go without lights
[2024-10-20T05:53:25] haku: i drove
[2024-10-20T05:54:00] Yamal: some light to see something at night xD
[2024-10-20T05:54:22] haku: need to wire some

[2024-10-20T06:16:58] haku: is that photoshopped or real

[2024-10-20T06:17:31] Yamal: Real I think from one group facebook pev performance or something like that
[2024-10-20T06:17:50] Yamal: Look cool for see the tv too
[2024-10-20T06:18:09] haku: thats some creative stuff. he prolly welded that frame
[2024-10-20T06:18:50] Yamal: Is emoto?
[2024-10-20T06:19:04] puneDir: 27mm
[2024-10-20T06:19:34] Noname: Tiny
[2024-10-20T06:19:34] haku: minibike scoot maybe. im not sure
[2024-10-20T06:20:09] haku: i would like one someday. i really need to learn to weld
[2024-10-20T06:20:11] haku: and cad
[2024-10-20T06:20:22] puneDir: Yes sad
[2024-10-20T06:20:42] haku: i want a sidecar for the minibike scoot
[2024-10-20T06:21:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_18731@20-10-2024_06-21-30.jpg>
[2024-10-20T06:21:33] haku: hey theres a market for pocketbikes like this. asains #1 love this stuff
[2024-10-20T06:22:43] haku: we have to match the size of our you know whats
[2024-10-20T06:26:13] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/5EQItrkFBAA?si=ZYpsPZdh_DHTnrq9
[2024-10-20T06:26:36] haku: is this a emoto or a kids bike? what is it?
[2024-10-20T06:29:46] Yamal: HyperEmoto hehe
[2024-10-20T06:30:13] haku: garage monster?
[2024-10-20T06:32:26] haku: these razors are meant to be kids ebikes. crazy what they do to it. that sotion kit is available in ali just bolts on
[2024-10-20T06:33:35] haku: sofa kings of america
[2024-10-20T06:37:36] Yamal: What kits ?
[2024-10-20T06:38:20] haku: sotion upgrade kit
[2024-10-20T06:40:29] haku: they also sell the swimgarm for that motor.
[2024-10-20T06:48:41] Noname: Damn link please
[2024-10-20T06:48:48] Noname: My motor looks bigger lol
[2024-10-20T06:51:45] haku: sotion just became popular overnight. i wonder who makes thier motors or they have a factory. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $358.59 | SOTION H02 Hub Motor Kits 72V 10KW Max 2000RPM Motor https://a.aliexpress.com/_m0cnni8
[2024-10-20T06:52:52] haku: ebikes have so many bramd choices for motors. we only have LY
[2024-10-20T06:54:21] haku: i remember you almost buying a watercooled version of this.
[2024-10-20T06:55:06] Noname: No you wanted me to for 3k$
[2024-10-20T06:56:03] haku: someone with money need to buy these things to test for da boys
[2024-10-20T06:56:12] Noname: About the same. Doesn't say magnet size though
[2024-10-20T07:07:29] Noname: That's a 1500 to 2500 rpm I have a 1,300 rpm rated for 95kmh
[2024-10-20T07:14:40] haku: im sure these bigger stators can do alot
[2024-10-20T07:15:14] haku: your 70h is completely different from my 70h. mine is tiny
[2024-10-20T07:16:08] haku: i just have the thicker phases for "looks"
[2024-10-20T07:28:38] Noname: Yeah I have about 5x the magnets as you
[2024-10-20T07:29:21] haku: yep.
[2024-10-20T07:29:44] haku: your right about the slots on car rotors i had to fact check.
[2024-10-20T07:30:03] haku: is that how its suppose to be on scooter motors too?
[2024-10-20T07:33:00] Noname: Prob not no center hole for air like a car
[2024-10-20T07:33:54] Noname: I wouldn't worry about the slots
[2024-10-20T07:34:26] haku: thats right its one piece
[2024-10-20T07:35:21] haku: i use regen anyway. i just use brakes to fully stop or emergency stop
[2024-10-20T07:36:18] Noname: Use them once in a while they get dirt build up.
[2024-10-20T07:37:02] Noname: I had brake fail so bad one night. New pads and we're OK again
[2024-10-20T07:47:42] puneDir: Wow is this suitable for my moto?
[2024-10-20T07:48:53] haku: im not sure. they make em for the razors they do have other swingarms though for thier mid drives
[2024-10-20T07:50:29] puneDir: I need motor for the moto 😂
[2024-10-20T07:50:37] puneDir: Stock motor not good
[2024-10-20T07:51:52] haku: you can prolly overvolt those
[2024-10-20T08:07:52] puneDir: It will burn
[2024-10-20T08:19:34] haku: even just voltage?
[2024-10-20T08:21:25] haku: if i were in your pisition. i would get a higher voltage battery and vesc/esc and try to push this current motor.
[2024-10-20T08:22:15] haku: even g30 motors can be overvolted
[2024-10-20T08:31:51] puneDir: Hmm
[2024-10-20T08:31:54] puneDir: But 27h
[2024-10-20T08:32:06] puneDir: Very tiny
[2024-10-20T08:42:41] Yamal: Today is the day !!!!!
[2024-10-20T08:42:52] Yamal: 🍿🎉
[2024-10-20T08:48:20] Yamal: Today the 11" scooters from half the world are waiting
[2024-10-20T08:51:02] Yamal: only VESC ONLY YOU!!! Can someone tell Benjamin?😋
[2024-10-20T08:55:56] haku: if it burns get new one. motors should be the last upgrade imo
[2024-10-20T08:57:57] Давно пора: It will burn if you will be going full throttle uphills or with 2 people
[2024-10-20T08:58:07] Давно пора: From overheat
[2024-10-20T08:58:23] Давно пора: If you look for temperature you are good
[2024-10-20T08:59:43] Yamal: from a French circuit to the rest of the world, carbon fiber chains and only 22s!!!! with a jagged star wrapped in flames and a true lion's soul
[2024-10-20T09:02:15] puneDir: What about 30 or 35h
[2024-10-20T09:55:01] GABE: No such thing as overvolting a motor
[2024-10-20T09:55:06] GABE: only overwatting
[2024-10-20T09:55:31] GABE: only super voltage would cause arcing
[2024-10-20T09:55:42] GABE: It'll clog
[2024-10-20T10:02:37] Давно пора: I am ready to go one trip to donate u 50h motor
[2024-10-20T10:02:40] Давно пора: <photos/photo_18734@20-10-2024_10-02-40.jpg>

[2024-10-20T11:37:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What does it has on it ?
[2024-10-20T11:38:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Guys I got less top speed with more amps how does that possible?
[2024-10-20T11:38:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (more acceleration less speed)
[2024-10-20T11:38:41] FreehandZ: On what?
[2024-10-20T11:38:56] FreehandZ: Same scoot you tried less current?
[2024-10-20T11:39:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Phase amps 100a filed is 60a
[2024-10-20T11:39:20] FreehandZ: So you are running fwk?
[2024-10-20T11:39:26] FreehandZ: What did you increase?
[2024-10-20T11:39:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Before was 60a fwk 80pahse
[2024-10-20T11:39:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Was 105
[2024-10-20T11:39:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Now is 98
[2024-10-20T11:39:49] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/JLqZbvQ1FB8?si=Q7wGZbCJJRylI8nf
[2024-10-20T11:39:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But way more acceleration
[2024-10-20T11:40:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2024-10-20T11:40:06] FreehandZ: Unsure, probably something to do with fwk
[2024-10-20T11:40:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or just low battery and i didn't notice
[2024-10-20T11:40:43] FreehandZ: Did you try them back to back?
[2024-10-20T11:40:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No
[2024-10-20T11:41:25] FreehandZ: Ah possible then
[2024-10-20T11:41:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also lowered the positive ramp time on the rear motor
[2024-10-20T11:42:19] Yamal: Have you tried doing a top speed test without fw?
[2024-10-20T11:42:38] Yamal: 120 A FW
[2024-10-20T11:42:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes was badd Don't know why
[2024-10-20T11:43:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 120a and no fwk ?
[2024-10-20T11:43:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I tried 110a phase 25a fwk was slow af (85kmh)
[2024-10-20T11:51:28] Yamal: but you said you were using 60A fw per controller, right?
[2024-10-20T11:56:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes now
[2024-10-20T11:56:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Before I was told to try 110 and 25fwj
[2024-10-20T11:58:23] 'lekrsu': 60 is so much xD, what's your wh/km and how's it affecting your motor temps?
[2024-10-20T11:59:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Let's just say it's affecting 😉
[2024-10-20T12:05:38] Yamal: over current knocking on the door? or it has nothing to do xD
[2024-10-20T12:06:06] 'lekrsu': @shlomda2 What kind of system do you have that won't fry from that? :3
[2024-10-20T12:07:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't know (didn't get that error)
[2024-10-20T12:07:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Zero10x dual motor 60/28
[2024-10-20T12:08:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <animation>
[2024-10-20T12:08:11] 'lekrsu': What kind of battery have you built for it?
[2024-10-20T12:08:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not me build
[2024-10-20T12:08:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I bought it
[2024-10-20T12:08:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 60/28 8c ant bms
[2024-10-20T12:09:06] 'lekrsu': Ye, 60v?
[2024-10-20T12:09:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yep 16s
[2024-10-20T12:10:00] 'lekrsu': Thought about going 20S? Would help with your speeds
[2024-10-20T12:10:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not sure about adding cells to an already used battery
[2024-10-20T12:10:34] 'lekrsu': nono, not to the existing
[2024-10-20T12:10:42] 'lekrsu': either in series or a whole new one
[2024-10-20T12:11:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The speeds I'm getting are ok 😄
[2024-10-20T12:12:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: New no money sires afraid
[2024-10-20T12:12:18] 'lekrsu': Alright for future builds then :)
[2024-10-20T12:13:03] 'lekrsu': Yee, but without fwk is so much more efficient and safer, :D
[2024-10-20T12:13:28] 'lekrsu': One error code and poof, ⛅️, new vesc
[2024-10-20T12:13:51] Yamal: Without fw is real one love
[2024-10-20T12:14:45] 'lekrsu': My temps are still, from 60 to 90C on a 0-65 km/h no fwk 60A phase run, xd
[2024-10-20T12:15:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For me now I don't know why
[2024-10-20T12:16:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I trust god that if I have to get a burny vesc I would get it either way
[2024-10-20T12:21:02] Yamal: <photos/photo_18736@20-10-2024_12-21-02.jpg>
[2024-10-20T12:26:32] FreehandZ: Kv or voltage then
[2024-10-20T12:27:12] FreehandZ: Without fwk, would be much better
[2024-10-20T12:27:58] FreehandZ: Where's this?
[2024-10-20T12:32:06] Yamal: <photos/photo_18737@20-10-2024_12-32-06.jpg>
[2024-10-20T12:34:13] Yamal: A lotttt
[2024-10-20T12:35:15] Yamal: ? 60°C to 90°C?
[2024-10-20T12:36:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I tried wasn't good
[2024-10-20T12:37:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm talking about performance without fwk it's bad for me at least
[2024-10-20T12:38:52] FreehandZ: I mean higher voltage w/o fwk >> lower voltage w/ fwk
[2024-10-20T12:39:10] FreehandZ: Too low kv, or too low voltage then
[2024-10-20T12:39:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: High voltage always good
[2024-10-20T12:39:30] FreehandZ: Yes, 33x2 hehe
[2024-10-20T12:39:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Kv is 30
[2024-10-20T12:39:47] FreehandZ: Cant be right then
[2024-10-20T12:39:53] FreehandZ: 16s right?
[2024-10-20T12:40:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes 16s
[2024-10-20T12:40:12] FreehandZ: Is it 10 inch?
[2024-10-20T12:40:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2024-10-20T12:41:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: One is mantis 10 motor one is zero10x motor buth are 50h
[2024-10-20T12:41:31] FreehandZ: 82kph absolute top speed at nominal voltage
[2024-10-20T12:41:41] FreehandZ: Fully charged will be quicker
[2024-10-20T12:42:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This is fully charged but phase amps are 85 per motor (60fwk also buth?
[2024-10-20T12:42:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: *)
[2024-10-20T12:42:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sorry this is not this
[2024-10-20T12:42:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Opps
[2024-10-20T12:42:45] FreehandZ: Ah makes sense
[2024-10-20T12:42:59] FreehandZ: You want to go 100kph but at 16s with not high enough kv
[2024-10-20T12:43:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm already going 105 kmh
[2024-10-20T12:43:32] FreehandZ: Yeah
[2024-10-20T12:43:36] FreehandZ: 20s would be a good idea
[2024-10-20T12:44:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also better frame or bigger motors
[2024-10-20T12:46:52] 'lekrsu': I don't trust my beta NTC value but ye, maybe.

[2024-10-20T17:45:21] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂 The owner is a disaster, I have to transfer all the electronics, motors and other things from this to a Xiaomi chassis because the police have booked him with this scooter, but I bought the Xiaomi chassis with wide rear supports and an extender but it is both the zcougar and the xiaomi have been ruined, I have a lot of work
[2024-10-20T17:52:25] GABE: You'll parachute before you get any benefits from more than 24s equated voltage
[2024-10-20T17:52:57] GABE: Very long cell?
[2024-10-20T17:53:15] GABE: seems like bad geometry no? if each + and - was 1cell tall, there would be less resistance.
[2024-10-20T17:53:39] GABE: It would be a shorter impeder then.
[2024-10-20T17:53:47] Noname: What? I have 3 batterys
[2024-10-20T17:53:59] GABE: How tf do u get vdrop
[2024-10-20T17:54:06] Noname: 67v
[2024-10-20T17:54:48] GABE: That can't be.
[2024-10-20T17:54:55] GABE: With Super amp cells?
[2024-10-20T17:55:03] GABE: 20s dropping to 1 bar??
[2024-10-20T17:55:10] GABE: 28p?
[2024-10-20T17:56:01] GABE: You have to make the cell shorter length wise.
[2024-10-20T17:56:01] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-20T18:21:14] Noname: That's just driving up driveway full throttle. @Gabzy_x
[2024-10-20T18:22:04] Noname: Amp draw is from 1 battery idk total
[2024-10-20T18:22:30] Face de Pin Sucé: As promised, enjoy world record TRUE escooter speed with 11inch tyres

[2024-10-20T18:33:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What are those motors ? How so cool ?
[2024-10-20T18:36:53] TrentXWB: Good evening. Is there an option in the Vesc Tool to use e.g. 130 phase amps to motor up to 12 km/h and >12 km/h (or rpm) use reduced 80 phase amps to motor?
[2024-10-20T18:38:12] TrentXWB: My wheelway 1000 w motor doesn’t like these high phase amps between ca. 12 and 20 km/h (noise and rattling)
[2024-10-20T18:42:22] Pandalgns: what are you talking about?
[2024-10-20T18:46:46] Face de Pin Sucé: We made those motors
[2024-10-20T18:47:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 3shull?
[2024-10-20T18:47:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sick
[2024-10-20T18:47:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wish I was that smart
[2024-10-20T18:52:09] 'lekrsu': Sounds like a possible solution but the wrong way to execute it. Have you tried solving it another way?
[2024-10-20T19:05:15] haku: what? my pack ir isnt that high
[2024-10-20T19:07:36] haku: i have 2x6 awg cables. a little voltage drop is inevitable
[2024-10-20T19:08:04] 'lekrsu': That's not a lot though right
[2024-10-20T19:09:50] haku: according to the @jamessoderstrom equation this should be ok
[2024-10-20T19:13:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2024-10-20T19:15:01] haku: HERE WE GO! ty
[2024-10-20T19:23:22] haku: damn that was cool! i just skipped to the speed test no subtitles. amazing
[2024-10-20T19:24:01] haku: never doubted you my guy.
[2024-10-20T19:24:40] haku: world title here boys. 180 is the next record. who will do it haha
[2024-10-20T19:26:14] haku: france #1 turkey #2 who is 3rd place spain?
[2024-10-20T19:26:14] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-20T19:57:08] Lieven L.: its a Talaria, so no need to worry
[2024-10-20T20:04:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @FlSHfood @SibClimb
[2024-10-20T20:20:17] haku: hes part of the ops.
[2024-10-20T20:56:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Hope you enjoyed
[2024-10-20T20:57:19] Face de Pin Sucé: ?
[2024-10-20T20:58:38] Noname: Small town problems lol
[2024-10-20T20:59:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Someone asked me who made that masterpiece
[2024-10-20T20:59:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The 175kmh scooter
[2024-10-20T21:02:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh okay ☺️
[2024-10-20T21:07:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What did you think that I'll report u to the European police because the scooter goes over 25kmh by just a little bit ?😉😉
[2024-10-20T21:24:32] Roland 11x: Mine goes for around 130kmh But 175? Its madness
[2024-10-20T21:24:57] Finn: <photos/photo_18746@20-10-2024_21-24-57.jpg>
[2024-10-20T21:36:02] haku: if it was here ill prolly eat it
[2024-10-20T21:36:13] haku: but farmer might shoot me
[2024-10-20T21:36:27] haku: is it branded?
[2024-10-20T21:37:35] Noname: Prob not branded. That's so people can't steal cattle in large areas. More like pets around here
[2024-10-20T21:38:06] haku: yea if its a pet i will not eat it.
[2024-10-20T21:38:29] Noname: Not pet but play farming
[2024-10-20T21:38:33] haku: but in the old country we eat dogs unfortunately
[2024-10-20T21:38:52] haku: not me personally but my people
[2024-10-20T21:38:56] Noname: Ah shit should have saved another video 😆
[2024-10-20T21:40:16] haku: anyways saw this badboy at church. ill will make a gang called heavens angels. only g30s allowed. with or without seats.
[2024-10-20T21:41:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Just a little haha
[2024-10-20T21:42:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Dragy and GPS gave both 173Kmh
[2024-10-20T21:42:41] Face de Pin Sucé: We can't meet exact GPS speed at those speeds on Display, because it is based on wheel size, and wheel size changes at those speeds
[2024-10-20T21:43:02] Finn: Heavens Ang30els
[2024-10-20T21:43:50] Finn: Vesc express with gps is maybe an idea
[2024-10-20T21:53:34] haku: context is theres a badass harley gang here called hells angels.
[2024-10-20T21:53:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, we have our own 25Hz GPS module connected to the display, but we prefer using the wheel speed, because when you go somewhere without good GPS signal, you lose accurate speed, tunnels for example
[2024-10-20T21:55:23] haku: those guys dont fuck around. if they want you dead. it will happen. even if your under protective custody its a wrap
[2024-10-20T22:00:45] Давно пора: Hall sensor settings?
[2024-10-20T22:11:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Thank you mate 😉
[2024-10-20T22:16:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2024-10-20T22:27:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Honestly we could easily remove the steering damper
[2024-10-20T22:31:33] haku: if i find another g30. ill have someone weld 2 frames to make it longer. haha
[2024-10-20T22:55:48] haku: guys i have a question about profiles. howcome when i connect my sons profile it changes mine too.
[2024-10-20T23:02:29] Давно пора: It saves it in app
[2024-10-20T23:02:55] Давно пора: On other phone you will not see any profiles
[2024-10-20T23:04:55] haku: oh i need 2 phones? dam
[2024-10-20T23:05:14] Давно пора: You just need to be careful with them
[2024-10-20T23:05:26] Yamal: 👏
[2024-10-20T23:05:26] Давно пора: Not to put your profile to sons bike)
[2024-10-20T23:05:39] haku: yes. i almost got my boy hurt
[2024-10-20T23:05:52] Давно пора: Set it permanently
[2024-10-20T23:05:56] Давно пора: And don't touch
[2024-10-20T23:06:08] haku: it sets it on mine too
[2024-10-20T23:06:22] haku: yesterday i was limited to 10mph
[2024-10-20T23:06:32] haku: and my boy full blast
[2024-10-20T23:06:41] Noname: Unplug wifi thing when changing?
[2024-10-20T23:06:46] Давно пора: It shouldn't be like that
[2024-10-20T23:07:05] haku: maybe turn off his vesc when on mine
[2024-10-20T23:07:18] haku: and vice versa
[2024-10-20T23:07:21] Давно пора: But how it can connect to both?
[2024-10-20T23:07:33] haku: both vescs are turned on
[2024-10-20T23:07:46] Давно пора: But you choose which one you connect to
[2024-10-20T23:08:06] haku: yes. even when i connect to his it changes mine for some reason
[2024-10-20T23:08:30] Давно пора: Strange
[2024-10-20T23:08:43] haku: yea. ill mess around and see whats going on
[2024-10-20T23:09:10] haku: its both spintend vescs and same bluetooth module
[2024-10-20T23:09:36] haku: but i set names for it so i dont confuse it
[2024-10-20T23:14:45] haku: you should tag that youtube reviewer
[2024-10-20T23:15:35] Yamal: ?
[2024-10-20T23:15:40] Yamal: Tag
[2024-10-20T23:16:05] haku: yes let the newyork reviewer know about this badboy
[2024-10-20T23:16:48] haku: the one that made that inmotion paid video
[2024-10-20T23:17:10] Yamal: Let’s go!
[2024-10-20T23:17:25] haku: for 11 inch 172kmh is insane
[2024-10-20T23:18:06] haku: peak g30 will do 180. just trust and believe yamal
[2024-10-20T23:18:58] Yamal: <photos/photo_18749@20-10-2024_23-18-58.jpg>
[2024-10-20T23:19:01] haku: i have a 20kg tester
[2024-10-20T23:19:16] haku: haha
[2024-10-20T23:21:18] Yamal: ;)
[2024-10-20T23:21:45] 'lekrsu': ;)
[2024-10-20T23:21:57] haku: not my boy but the other kid from the park. hehe
[2024-10-20T23:23:49] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/Igl23SwRPp0?si=HUkLAK_r0VOQMylJ
[2024-10-20T23:24:35] 'lekrsu': Is that a controller on the back? Shouldve gone vesc
[2024-10-20T23:25:27] 'lekrsu': So many ppl build insane things to only say "but eh I don't care about controllers they work" XD
[2024-10-20T23:25:29] haku: that is cool. im just not a fan of the paint on tires and rgb lights
[2024-10-20T23:26:06] haku: what esc is it anyway.
[2024-10-20T23:26:39] haku: i like his phase wires though. very skinny
[2024-10-20T23:29:21] haku: i really like fiidos. they are expensive. and lots of modifications can be done
[2024-10-20T23:30:19] Yamal: Don’t know
[2024-10-20T23:32:53] haku: 5kw motors. i only have 2.8kw. i wonder how 5kw feels
[2024-10-20T23:34:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think it can reach 180/185 the speedometer reaches 173 but it would continue to rise
[2024-10-20T23:35:25] haku: these are the factory specs for them.
[2024-10-20T23:36:27] haku: 70h 2.5kw for 33x2
[2024-10-20T23:36:54] 'lekrsu': I guess continuous and not just peak?
[2024-10-20T23:37:30] haku: yea maybe. factory recomends this kw rating. but it can do more i think
[2024-10-20T23:40:35] haku: aslong as it can do burnouts i dont really care
[2024-10-20T23:40:51] haku: but more kw more smoke
[2024-10-20T23:44:13] Noname: Safety marketing bs. Stock vsett motors handle 7kw with string sized phase cables
[2024-10-20T23:46:11] haku: meanwhile sotion and QS ratings blown up. idk if they claim 20kw is real
[2024-10-20T23:48:49] haku: that one on the fiido looks like falcon pev motors maybe huameng made
[2024-10-20T23:49:05] GABE: cell dropped from 60 to 20%, something is wrong.
[2024-10-20T23:49:16] GABE: I assume the solids dewelded the cell.
[2024-10-20T23:49:38] GABE: I didn't gas it home cause it could've vented, (bypass BMS)
[2024-10-20T23:50:43] GABE: 3.2*** Cont sure, and that's for single. It's more than quadruple for peak and even even more for dual
[2024-10-20T23:51:21] haku: dam. check and show
[2024-10-20T23:51:41] NetworkDir: my zero motor is 1200W 60V rated i push 5kw and 72v yeah overheated but who cares
[2024-10-20T23:52:01] GABE: Would work super well with dual
[2024-10-20T23:52:13] NetworkDir: yeah dual setups for ever
[2024-10-20T23:52:16] GABE: I pushed 3.4kw on a 300w proo 2 motor
[2024-10-20T23:52:19] GABE: Vesc measure
[2024-10-20T23:52:23] haku: you have a smart bms on that?
[2024-10-20T23:52:29] NetworkDir: i say single setups should like 65H 16x4 with +20s
[2024-10-20T23:52:29] GABE: no BMS
[2024-10-20T23:52:34] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2024-10-20T23:52:39] haku: lol
[2024-10-20T23:52:47] GABE: I was too lazy to solder it
[2024-10-20T23:52:57] GABE: I wanted to go outside and look for blunts
[2024-10-20T23:53:35] haku: lets see. i want to see world champ fireworks. right now my hands are world champ after explosion. you need to take my title
[2024-10-20T23:54:04] haku: everyone in ireland smokes?
[2024-10-20T23:54:34] GABE: Not nearly as much as in Spain where I could go out for a stroll and find a gram worth in 15 minutes
[2024-10-20T23:54:44] GABE: good amount
[2024-10-20T23:54:56] GABE: without a scooter"
[2024-10-20T23:54:59] GABE: which is incredible
[2024-10-20T23:56:06] haku: US too because legal. im not a fan of the smell thats why i used to buy edibles like a bitch
[2024-10-20T23:56:35] haku: i cant handle thc tbh. i get too paranoid
[2024-10-21T00:01:03] 'lekrsu': need ))
[2024-10-21T00:01:38] Yamal: I just want to drive a scooter, that's all
[2024-10-21T00:01:55] haku: rent one while on vacation
[2024-10-21T00:02:40] Yamal: Here 👎
[2024-10-21T00:03:39] haku: it like the pornhub colors
[2024-10-21T00:04:03] haku: i like
[2024-10-21T00:10:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Typical American
[2024-10-21T00:11:35] Noname: Just him
[2024-10-21T00:53:06] Jason: xd
[2024-10-21T00:53:09] Jason: i need it
[2024-10-21T01:18:55] haku: theres more to give but my balls shrank today. holy shit the power.
[2024-10-21T01:19:42] haku: i feel like it can do 70-80mph. not today though haha
[2024-10-21T01:21:08] haku: i lost my flag. on the way and chinese flag replaced it
[2024-10-21T01:24:39] Yamal: 🎉💃🪩
[2024-10-21T01:25:54] Yamal: 🤌👻
[2024-10-21T01:34:37] Noname: Yeah 20kw club
[2024-10-21T01:35:25] Noname: Getting up there in motor temp 160f
[2024-10-21T01:36:04] Noname: Imagine if he got the torque motors
[2024-10-21T01:40:56] haku: motor temps not looking good boys.
[2024-10-21T01:41:18] haku: <photos/photo_18754@21-10-2024_01-41-18.jpg>
[2024-10-21T01:41:39] haku: long routs full blast not a good idea
[2024-10-21T01:41:44] NetworkDir: don't worry
[2024-10-21T01:42:00] haku: its limiting my speed for some reason
[2024-10-21T01:42:09] Noname: Safety
[2024-10-21T01:42:13] NetworkDir: bad tune or bad config?
[2024-10-21T01:42:19] NetworkDir: oh yes
[2024-10-21T01:42:26] NetworkDir: vesc start cut off after 85C motor temp
[2024-10-21T01:42:30] haku: maybe ill ride slow and go home
[2024-10-21T01:42:43] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_18755@21-10-2024_01-42-43.jpg>
[2024-10-21T01:42:44] Noname: It's fine just a cool down lap
[2024-10-21T01:42:48] NetworkDir: Vesc is smart :)
[2024-10-21T01:43:05] NetworkDir: put some ferrofluid to motors
[2024-10-21T01:43:12] haku: good idea
[2024-10-21T01:43:33] haku: this motor gets pretty hot
[2024-10-21T01:43:49] NetworkDir: put more zero vector freq
[2024-10-21T01:44:02] NetworkDir: make it this to 35.0 KHz
[2024-10-21T01:44:16] Noname: What's that do
[2024-10-21T01:44:34] haku: let me set it up in a bit. im in the side stteet. need to park
[2024-10-21T01:44:44] Yamal: 39°C?
[2024-10-21T01:45:05] Yamal: Sorry you say motor ^^ 👍
[2024-10-21T01:45:19] NetworkDir: sinewave frequency more freq = lower motor heat - higher controller heat (little bit lower torque and lower sound from motor) lower freq = higher motor heat - lower controller heat (little bit more torque and more sound from motor)
[2024-10-21T01:45:24] Noname: Vesc happy, motor grumpy
[2024-10-21T01:46:10] NetworkDir: if controller fets good better use ~35KHz good for motors
[2024-10-21T01:51:34] haku: where do i find this menu?
[2024-10-21T01:54:42] haku: i love china motors cant handle 300 phase 😭
[2024-10-21T01:56:05] Yamal: ?
[2024-10-21T01:56:48] haku: maybe me and bike too heavy for these tiny motor
[2024-10-21T01:56:58] Yamal: make holes in the covers xD
[2024-10-21T01:57:57] Yamal: haku rider today October 21 is a reality!🗣
[2024-10-21T02:07:06] haku: naw its fixed now.lord james fix wrong setting
[2024-10-21T02:13:30] Yamal: Next weekend I have a wedding! Let's see when one of you gets married and invites us to go and have fun! XD
[2024-10-21T02:15:48] Yamal: It's not my wedding, it's my wife's cousin's, if it were mine I would be invited, the problem is how do I tell him?
[2024-10-21T02:17:38] Noname: What did he fix
[2024-10-21T02:17:49] Noname: Your pro tuned now?
[2024-10-21T02:18:00] Noname: Sweet baby jesus
[2024-10-21T02:18:58] Noname: Learning today
[2024-10-21T02:19:13] Noname: He needs torque motors
[2024-10-21T02:20:25] Yamal: and BV let him be the one to marry the bride and groom!
[2024-10-21T02:21:48] Yamal: Yes!
[2024-10-21T02:22:33] Yamal: Well, if he feels embarrassed, let him be the godfather.
[2024-10-21T02:43:16] haku: charged my phone. yes big improvement thanks bud
[2024-10-21T02:44:10] haku: also had to get another flag a represent.
[2024-10-21T02:47:28] Noname: Is it crazy enough now?
[2024-10-21T02:53:59] haku: dude i raced a talaria mx5. got me off the line but gapped him. i dont have a video but its these guys.
[2024-10-21T02:55:04] haku: the guy closest to me with the black jacket has a 72v mx5
[2024-10-21T02:55:35] haku: yea. hes fast off the line
[2024-10-21T02:56:00] haku: but aftee a few meters its a done deal
[2024-10-21T03:05:59] NetworkDir: Motor config -> FOC -> Advanced
[2024-10-21T03:06:14] NetworkDir: Should handle more 300A phase :)
[2024-10-21T03:06:41] haku: 70h 33x2 its like turbo lag. it just kicks in at 30mph
[2024-10-21T03:07:03] NetworkDir: He put 250A battery current but seems motor doesn't push more 20kW With 500A battery he should have a 40kW peak
[2024-10-21T03:07:37] Yamal: Pretty crazy
[2024-10-21T03:08:36] NetworkDir: Do you check your bms how for much A ?
[2024-10-21T03:10:06] haku: no havent yet. i have to check
[2024-10-21T03:10:36] NetworkDir: Check it because something wrong if you set 250A batt per motor you should have 40kW (55HP) fuckeria peak
[2024-10-21T03:11:09] haku: no way haha
[2024-10-21T03:11:30] haku: 40kw is crazy im already good with 20
[2024-10-21T03:11:49] Noname: Pussy
[2024-10-21T03:13:04] Noname: You have to dominate those talarias get respect. First spend the money, than show the power and get the respect 😆
[2024-10-21T03:13:23] haku: i like it haha
[2024-10-21T03:13:41] haku: but just that once. we burnout for da hoes
[2024-10-21T03:14:05] haku: show them surron boys whos the king of da hood
[2024-10-21T03:14:29] Noname: My buddy smoked a surron with his k6. Trash talk stopped
[2024-10-21T03:14:48] NetworkDir: With 40kW on your city I don't think anyone can beat with you XD
[2024-10-21T03:15:03] haku: i need to get a used gopro or 360cam and document my rise in the hood as a boss
[2024-10-21T03:15:26] Noname: K6 70mph, red thing now does 54. I need to level up as I'm 3rd slowest
[2024-10-21T03:16:43] Noname: Hector is running 2 72v 40ah batterys and a fardriver.
[2024-10-21T03:16:46] haku: im really enjoying this scooter bike. hopefully frame stays intact haha
[2024-10-21T03:16:55] haku: haha
[2024-10-21T03:17:10] haku: ok paul walker
[2024-10-21T03:17:25] Noname: He's got stock and ex30 batterys
[2024-10-21T03:18:50] haku: dominic torreto my neighbor too wtf.
[2024-10-21T03:27:08] Yamal: https://youtu.be/Vq1eNLO-05Q?si=_l8ULE7GuL0PEf-C
[2024-10-21T03:40:27] Yamal: 172!!!
[2024-10-21T03:42:48] NetworkDir: He should full throttle 😂
[2024-10-21T03:43:21] NetworkDir: MTPA on high kv dont works well ?
[2024-10-21T03:45:46] NetworkDir: So I think using low kv with more voltage + fwk is best idea for acceleration and efficiency
[2024-10-21T03:47:20] NetworkDir: Yeah vedder should write dont use at hub motors and etc ..
[2024-10-21T03:48:33] haku: lots of learning for me today. idk if my smooth brain can handle it
[2024-10-21T03:48:50] haku: so many abreviations
[2024-10-21T03:48:51] NetworkDir: lol
[2024-10-21T03:49:45] NetworkDir: https://www.mathworks.com/help/mcb/ref/mtpacontrolreference.html
[2024-10-21T03:49:56] NetworkDir: Too much math my brain can't handle lol
[2024-10-21T03:50:47] NetworkDir: So vesc can work with PMSM/IPM
[2024-10-21T03:52:21] NetworkDir: I see some 6 phase pmsm on EV I think vesc can't support 6 phases (at least hardwares)
[2024-10-21T03:53:13] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_18760@21-10-2024_03-53-13.jpg>
[2024-10-21T03:53:13] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. NetworkDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-21T03:53:43] haku: i need a vesc logo to represent. maybe a vesc flag
[2024-10-21T03:54:05] haku: give the surron boys the pride flag now
[2024-10-21T03:54:40] haku: dam 6 phases
[2024-10-21T03:55:03] haku: evs have 6 too i think
[2024-10-21T04:03:31] NetworkDir: XD
[2024-10-21T04:04:41] NetworkDir: And canbus
[2024-10-21T04:04:54] NetworkDir: I need 2x 75100 for test this lol
[2024-10-21T04:58:38] Yamal: 🐬?
[2024-10-21T04:59:16] haku: vesclord talk. we need to study more son.
[2024-10-21T05:00:03] Yamal: I need UBOXXXXXXXX XD
[2024-10-21T05:01:25] haku: i like it tbh. just enough for what i need. im sure 18fet will come. when the need arises
[2024-10-21T05:02:23] haku: havent rode like this since i first got my laotie. forgit the feeling but more secure because seated
[2024-10-21T05:03:25] haku: need to push the 12fet to its limits too bad i have 33x2 so i need high speeds 😭
[2024-10-21T05:04:24] haku: 62miles or 100km is already scary af. i wonder how 70miles feels like
[2024-10-21T05:06:19] Yamal: The fastest I have ever gone on a scooter was 135kmh
[2024-10-21T05:06:37] haku: scary stuff
[2024-10-21T05:07:13] Yamal: I hope that in 2025 we will beat that ceiling
[2024-10-21T05:07:13] haku: did you kneel down for that?
[2024-10-21T05:07:29] Yamal: No
[2024-10-21T05:08:01] Yamal: legs semi-bent and weight on the handlebars
[2024-10-21T05:09:37] haku: thats on 22x3?
[2024-10-21T05:10:29] Yamal: Yea 😂
[2024-10-21T05:10:36] haku: and tronic? wow
[2024-10-21T05:11:06] Yamal: Yes but 💥🌋
[2024-10-21T05:11:22] haku: oh thats the day it kaboom?
[2024-10-21T05:11:39] Yamal: 120/125 okey with out FW
[2024-10-21T05:11:45] Yamal: Yes
[2024-10-21T05:11:51] haku: oh i see
[2024-10-21T05:13:18] haku: i think the spinny also might be giving me a slow start.
[2024-10-21T05:13:47] haku: i might need thumb throttle for precision
[2024-10-21T05:14:13] haku: but bye bye regen
[2024-10-21T05:18:54] Yamal: If you wanted a lot of torque and power output, you should have gotten the 22/3
[2024-10-21T05:22:29] haku: nah we can surpass that with more phase
[2024-10-21T05:22:45] haku: torque isnt too bad now
[2024-10-21T05:23:36] haku: Noname did you wire your whole systems lights and stuff on adc adapter? or you got stepdown?
[2024-10-21T05:30:31] Noname: Vsett is step-down. Moped is stock just ditched controller. It's like 4a output on adc not a lot really
[2024-10-21T05:31:57] Noname: Use another for regen. I have 2 300x throttles
[2024-10-21T05:35:52] Yamal: Same me
[2024-10-21T05:36:17] Yamal: He can use the one for Surron
[2024-10-21T05:36:42] Yamal: Nice for minibike I think, like moto
[2024-10-21T05:45:33] Rose: Hey there Pascal, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-10-21T06:06:25] haku: Noname powertool world champ how do i use this bolt extractor? i rounded my es3 stem bolt.
[2024-10-21T06:06:26] haku: <photos/photo_18762@21-10-2024_06-06-26.jpg>
[2024-10-21T06:07:08] Noname: Smack in hole and reverse
[2024-10-21T06:07:20] haku: gotcha
[2024-10-21T06:07:26] Noname: Or cut slot dremel and flat screwdriver
[2024-10-21T06:08:06] haku: good idea. this just drills a bigger hole in it
[2024-10-21T06:08:28] Noname: Prob not deep enough to catch
[2024-10-21T06:08:33] haku: this is battery compartment though so need to be careful
[2024-10-21T06:08:44] haku: do i drill deeper?
[2024-10-21T06:08:46] Noname: But drilling could snap off head of bolt
[2024-10-21T06:08:58] haku: i see
[2024-10-21T06:09:12] Noname: Just make a slot
[2024-10-21T06:09:24] haku: ok ty
[2024-10-21T09:40:38] Yamal: HyperVoro!!!
[2024-10-21T09:42:11] haku: gimme half the price of one of those. ill match its speed
[2024-10-21T09:43:11] haku: merikans just buy the fastest and no need for modding. only add leds lol
[2024-10-21T09:44:07] haku: but that voro build quality is nice though. carbon giant
[2024-10-21T09:44:28] Yamal: it's a little sad inside
[2024-10-21T09:44:52] Yamal: They could have put the battery in the middle xD
[2024-10-21T09:45:27] haku: lol. i wonder how this will do in the track against the french. with a good driver ofcourse
[2024-10-21T09:45:45] Yamal: and the stem is horrible brother
[2024-10-21T09:46:26] haku: i like that grey langfiety look more better the turks have.
[2024-10-21T09:46:49] haku: minus the leds
[2024-10-21T09:47:41] haku: 13 inch standing is too much though. too fast to be stsnding for me
[2024-10-21T09:48:02] Yamal: which is clear that it is superior to the entire dualtron kaabo range etc.
[2024-10-21T09:48:20] haku: im sure for 11"
[2024-10-21T09:48:38] haku: but 13" that lanfiety is nice
[2024-10-21T09:49:45] haku: 11 i think is the standard rules for track
[2024-10-21T09:50:07] Yamal: 11” is portable xD
[2024-10-21T09:50:12] haku: even for me now 11 seems big
[2024-10-21T09:51:15] haku: even the laotie size too big and bulky looking and it hss a smaller deck compared to others
[2024-10-21T09:51:48] haku: g30 10" i think is perfect size.
[2024-10-21T09:52:08] haku: vsett too long and heavy
[2024-10-21T09:52:20] Yamal: Do you have the torobike charging for tomorrow?
[2024-10-21T09:52:27] haku: the small g30lp i kinda like
[2024-10-21T09:52:44] Yamal: For me now only think in 11”
[2024-10-21T09:53:00] haku: yes. but have to wire lights too. and put my boys regen.
[2024-10-21T09:53:29] Yamal: I use rechargeable bike lights for the Nami...
[2024-10-21T09:53:32] haku: 11 is cool. pmt tires seems to be the best
[2024-10-21T09:54:04] haku: too expensive for burnouts all day haha
[2024-10-21T09:54:59] haku: i like cheap thrills tbh. i dont care for big branded stuff. i rather make my own. much cheaper
[2024-10-21T09:55:23] haku: find a blank frame and go from there
[2024-10-21T09:56:02] Andrei Albert: Leds everywhere
[2024-10-21T09:56:16] haku: im doing it for fun. now that i prove the surron boys im content
[2024-10-21T09:56:29] Yamal: I like the best the best and the best the superior as "Ali G" says
[2024-10-21T09:57:02] haku: nice painting
[2024-10-21T09:57:06] Yamal: Nice scooters man!
[2024-10-21T09:57:14] Andrei Albert: Thankss😆

[2024-10-21T10:04:30] Andrei Albert: Decent to afford some parts at a time, but need more haha
[2024-10-21T10:04:55] haku: i asked ly about 80h 22x3 with 155mm axle. no reply yet
[2024-10-21T10:04:55] Andrei Albert: But work pretty hard and a lot of responsibilities
[2024-10-21T10:06:35] Yamal: RFP frame/ ubox22s/22s11p battery. but first I have to get the Nami up and running with ubox and a new heatsink and little by little make the other one
[2024-10-21T10:08:21] Yamal: Hugo ubox 24/7

[2024-10-21T10:37:12] crimeware: With 500 eyes?/
[2024-10-21T10:37:19] Yamal: I'm kidding brother xD, ez ubox 85/250 modified for 22s
[2024-10-21T10:38:09] haku: baby angels like in the old paintings
[2024-10-21T10:39:04] crimeware: <photos/photo_18765@21-10-2024_10-39-04.jpg>
[2024-10-21T10:39:35] crimeware: Honestly I dig those bible accurate angels more than those child friendly irritations.
[2024-10-21T10:40:13] crimeware: Brother, satan shall be afraid when he sees Thrones dashing at him with 500 eyes in the fire of the sun
[2024-10-21T10:49:33] crimeware: I don't know why but I find them mesmerizing

[2024-10-21T21:15:35] haku: 1k phase is peanuts to big qs stators.
[2024-10-21T21:16:49] Noname: Middle of their suggested speed is 110kmh that's still blazing fast
[2024-10-21T22:12:09] haku: vsett 10+ for $700 in my area. thats good price. too bad i just need motors

[2024-10-21T22:24:21] Noname: You don't need motors you want
[2024-10-21T22:25:52] haku: there will be another deal for those motors. last time i saw them 100ea shipped
[2024-10-21T22:26:03] haku: but 16x4 single also is nicw
[2024-10-21T22:28:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's not about the shame it's about the strength of the frame

[2024-10-22T01:02:50] Yamal: These people don't understand that going 20kmh in traffic is dangerous.

[2024-10-22T02:04:01] haku: i was just riding in the highway. i did not know if i had enough juice to get home so i turned back.
[2024-10-22T02:07:20] haku: yep.
[2024-10-22T02:07:29] Yamal: You have to memorize your voltage table well and take averages of the kilometers you drive, but you already know that at a constant 100 kmh you don't get many kilometers
[2024-10-22T02:07:34] haku: it can do more.
[2024-10-22T02:08:02] haku: but motor temps at keeping up at 55mph speeds is my concern
[2024-10-22T02:08:07] haku: yes very safe
[2024-10-22T02:08:13] haku: can do 1 hand
[2024-10-22T02:08:53] haku: motorcycle dudes do that hand signal to me thinking its a motorcycle haha
[2024-10-22T02:13:05] Noname: Not bad it's a freaking minibike
[2024-10-22T02:13:29] haku: its a minibike scoot. thats its pronouns

[2024-10-22T02:16:11] haku: im not sure. it had more power but the f150 next to me is scaring me
[2024-10-22T02:16:45] haku: hes matching my speed for some reason
[2024-10-22T02:17:05] Noname: Looking in disbelief
[2024-10-22T02:20:43] Yamal: Being able to test your vehicles on the highway legally and safely is cool, we have to do it clandestinely at night
[2024-10-22T02:21:16] haku: ill try to go 80-85 next time.
[2024-10-22T02:21:55] haku: cant do it at night scary here

[2024-10-22T02:29:44] haku: this was the highway i took.
[2024-10-22T02:30:06] haku: 36mile range at highway speeds is bad
[2024-10-22T02:30:20] haku: i need to wire 40t
[2024-10-22T02:34:45] Yamal: 58km
[2024-10-22T02:35:04] Yamal: What voltage did you arrive with?
[2024-10-22T02:35:22] haku: i dont know why avarage speed says 21mph thats inacurate
[2024-10-22T02:35:36] Noname: Time vs speed
[2024-10-22T02:35:42] haku: i see
[2024-10-22T02:35:47] Yamal: You can see in your BMS vesc tool

[2024-10-22T02:36:32] Yamal: <photos/photo_18816@22-10-2024_02-36-32.jpg>
[2024-10-22T02:36:44] haku: 50ish mph
[2024-10-22T02:37:27] haku: after the highway at 65 it turns into 50mph
[2024-10-22T02:38:06] Noname: That actually sounds good for range
[2024-10-22T02:38:13] haku: then when almost home i was just doing 35
[2024-10-22T02:38:57] haku: nice. im not familiar with pev range. i know my vsett and ebike cant do it. but my car can lol
[2024-10-22T02:38:58] Noname: Lot of wind resistance at 50.
[2024-10-22T02:39:12] Noname: Try a 35mph day.
[2024-10-22T02:40:42] haku: i will get ferofluid i dont know if my motor can sustain those speeds 65mph without overheating
[2024-10-22T02:40:46] Noname: 6700wh gets me like 70 miles going 38. Your doing 4000wh 40 miles doing 50 😆
[2024-10-22T02:41:33] Noname: Oh yeah you don't have hills
[2024-10-22T02:41:51] haku: when i get ferofluid and parrallel the 40t i will gun for max speed
[2024-10-22T02:42:03] haku: see what it can do
[2024-10-22T02:42:22] haku: its pretty stable at those speeds dude

[2024-10-22T04:23:27] Yamal: American Chinaman with the e-toroloco
[2024-10-22T04:24:44] Yamal: Outside of nonsense, you could put some horns on the minibike to protect the brakes.
[2024-10-22T04:25:44] Yamal: <photos/photo_18821@22-10-2024_04-25-44.jpg>
[2024-10-22T04:27:07] haku: i will install this backrest tommorow for extra comfort.
[2024-10-22T04:27:25] haku: whats the point of that anyway?
[2024-10-22T04:28:03] haku: only quality of life upgrades like softer seat and stuff yamal. im not racing
[2024-10-22T04:28:20] Yamal: https://youtu.be/4448FSmiJoM?si=3sEsmybu71Qmk4-V

[2024-10-22T04:31:31] Yamal: The idea was not to protect the haku brake levers, but simply to place two large bull horns in their place, the same as the ones worn by the man who stormed the capitol xD
[2024-10-22T04:32:03] haku: i like that
[2024-10-22T04:32:28] Yamal: I know anyway you know I'm joking Haku Rider!

[2024-10-22T08:10:34] haku: qs 60h is completely different beast than scooter 60h.
[2024-10-22T08:10:44] haku: even 50h qs is powerful

[2024-10-22T08:35:27] haku: the new one
[2024-10-22T08:35:51] Yamal: Now I only have time for scooter
[2024-10-22T08:36:30] haku: once you ride seated you will never go back
[2024-10-22T08:37:35] Yamal: 😑
[2024-10-22T08:39:37] Yamal: Sad yes !
[2024-10-22T08:42:13] Paolo ⁭: Does Singaporean speak Chinese?
[2024-10-22T08:43:24] haku: what does that mean
[2024-10-22T08:45:45] Yamal: Generally speaking, the official language is British English, but there is a strong mix between Chinese, Malays, Indians, etc. All cultures and their holidays are respected. In fact, in the subway they warn you through the loudspeakers in the three languages apart from in English and everyone knows a little about all the languages
[2024-10-22T08:46:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I tried to put a hex key stuck in with the hammer and then tried to loosen it
[2024-10-22T08:46:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_18827@22-10-2024_08-46-51.jpg>
[2024-10-22T08:47:37] Yamal: It's like if you see any non-regulatory scooter or doing something wrong, you warn the police, they directly exterminated all the scooters, I've only seen 2 in the time I've been here
[2024-10-22T08:47:59] Paolo ⁭: You are here for holiday?
[2024-10-22T08:48:20] Yamal: And I remind you that Dualtron started manufacturing for Singapore and Australia...
[2024-10-22T08:48:23] Yamal: Yes ..
[2024-10-22T08:49:46] Yamal: My wife is from here, and now she is living here for I don't know how many months, I'm returning to Spain in November with the scooters, the garden and the cats...
[2024-10-22T08:52:32] haku: so basically tell on people and get rewarded?
[2024-10-22T08:53:07] haku: ide be so rich. ill show em everything. snitch to death
[2024-10-22T09:00:03] Yamal: Wharever
[2024-10-22T09:01:06] Maximus Brokus: So, I had this idea. Since dualmotor isnt that nice to turn I thought about using the gyroscope in the vesc to determine if the scooter leans and than decrease front motor power acordingly. Futhermore I was curious if we could turn off tractioncontroll automatically at a certain speed, since TC takes some acceleration and topspeed. Is that possible? What do you think?
[2024-10-22T09:10:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: R us
[2024-10-22T11:07:23] Finn: I would take it but idk abt shipping cost😭
[2024-10-22T11:11:43] Finn: Traction control is applied in the motor config. If you want to modify it in the lisp script the motor needs to be stopped before the config is applied
[2024-10-22T11:17:21] Maximus Brokus: Hrrrm
[2024-10-22T11:17:24] Maximus Brokus: Thats not good :D

[2024-10-22T13:16:04] puneDir: Help please
[2024-10-22T13:34:06] Maximus Brokus: Could be fooled by the test, but its like 2kph slower with tc
[2024-10-22T13:37:34] Hackintoshhhh: Front stock?
[2024-10-22T13:45:42] NetworkDir: Its also depends because sometimes with TC you can make a better start without tire slip
[2024-10-22T13:46:51] Maximus Brokus: Yeah, I would like to use it until like 40kph, where my tries propably wont start slipping
[2024-10-22T15:08:28] Yamal: the g2 is elegant 🤌

[2024-10-23T23:02:27] Yamal: Mini drone
[2024-10-23T23:03:00] haku: yea.
[2024-10-23T23:04:18] haku: unless there are better drones out there at this pricepoint. this tech just keeps getting cheaper and smaller. almost bought a dji phantom back then
[2024-10-23T23:06:30] Finn: Yeah i got that
[2024-10-23T23:06:34] Finn: Pretty cool
[2024-10-23T23:07:10] haku: very nice. no remote needed?
[2024-10-23T23:07:16] Finn: No only phone
[2024-10-23T23:07:23] Finn: <video_file>
[2024-10-23T23:07:26] Finn: 4k30
[2024-10-23T23:07:36] haku: wow amazing
[2024-10-23T23:07:53] Finn: 200€ only
[2024-10-23T23:07:57] haku: that is sharp even at telegram resolution
[2024-10-23T23:08:06] Finn: <photos/photo_18858@23-10-2024_23-08-06.jpg>
[2024-10-23T23:08:25] haku: ill get one black friday sale
[2024-10-23T23:08:31] sombre_enfant: Dji ?
[2024-10-23T23:08:33] Finn: I dont have the fly more combo tho
[2024-10-23T23:08:36] Finn: Yeah the neo
[2024-10-23T23:08:42] haku: what is that?
[2024-10-23T23:09:07] Finn: Two more batts and a remote
[2024-10-23T23:09:11] Noname: So how do you fly without remote?
[2024-10-23T23:09:20] haku: how much more is that?
[2024-10-23T23:09:30] Finn: 150€ more
[2024-10-23T23:09:35] Finn: Yeah
[2024-10-23T23:09:52] Finn: You can hold it in front of you and it will register your face and body and follow you
[2024-10-23T23:10:05] Finn: Ill try it with my scooter when im back home
[2024-10-23T23:10:07] Noname: But how that high?
[2024-10-23T23:10:09] haku: can it follow a scooter?
[2024-10-23T23:10:17] Finn: If can follow you sure
[2024-10-23T23:10:30] Finn: Not sure bc of wifi limit
[2024-10-23T23:10:48] Noname: Using your phone for remote now?
[2024-10-23T23:10:58] haku: tech baby.
[2024-10-23T23:11:00] Finn: Yeah or select preset on the drone
[2024-10-23T23:11:08] Finn: And it will execute it
[2024-10-23T23:11:10] Noname: Ah. I had a dji zoom
[2024-10-23T23:11:15] Finn: Land on your hand to stop its so nice
[2024-10-23T23:12:29] Noname: Like dji but not toys just flying cameras. Sold because of the new beacon laws Geo fencing and registration was a pain
[2024-10-23T23:13:19] Noname: What's the flight time?
[2024-10-23T23:15:21] haku: this neo doesnt need permits i think. its tiny 180 grams
[2024-10-23T23:16:45] Noname: Yeah but I used mine to get a rope.in trees to pull.down branches
[2024-10-23T23:19:18] haku: smart
[2024-10-23T23:19:39] Finn: Not sure didnt fly it for that long
[2024-10-23T23:19:51] Finn: Yeah sub 250
[2024-10-23T23:20:05] Noname: I also dropped parachute army men 😆
[2024-10-23T23:20:49] haku: i really thought dji mini was going to be the smallest cheapest. what is better?
[2024-10-23T23:21:13] Finn: Not sure
[2024-10-23T23:21:22] Finn: Im not into the dji ecosystem
[2024-10-23T23:22:23] Face de Pin Sucé: We still use Hope on most scooters, because of price
[2024-10-23T23:22:41] Finn: Thats my drone 130kmh max with gopro
[2024-10-23T23:23:28] haku: dang.
[2024-10-23T23:23:54] Finn: 5 lipos rn for 35-45min fly time
[2024-10-23T23:25:23] Yamal: Now you talk about the price 🤯, come on
[2024-10-23T23:27:22] Yamal: Why not pitbike brake..?
[2024-10-23T23:29:37] haku: different hole mounting
[2024-10-23T23:29:59] haku: also for these guys need the lightest best performing brakes
[2024-10-23T23:30:15] haku: every gram counts i think
[2024-10-23T23:30:44] haku: but it would be cool to see moto brakes on scooter motors
[2024-10-23T23:40:05] Noname: I like the 30$ holy stone Amazon ones. Cheaper to crash and they're pretty strong.
[2024-10-23T23:44:41] haku: look at this powertool champ.https://youtube.com/shorts/vx8c5zUHDJA?si=onA5KQoXDrFFeGSR
[2024-10-23T23:50:21] Noname: Yeah don't try that lol.

[2024-10-23T23:55:33] haku: mainly just testing out battery balance and bike. no speed tests yet
[2024-10-23T23:55:58] haku: maybe up phase to 320 we will see
[2024-10-23T23:56:15] Yamal: good good,! You are in a testing period!
[2024-10-23T23:56:55] haku: mainly today will be focused on the peak g30 regen and laotie assembly.
[2024-10-23T23:57:05] haku: but i will ride for da boys
[2024-10-23T23:57:23] Yamal: I plan not to raise more than 200A of phase :(, the wiring does not allow it..
[2024-10-23T23:57:43] haku: mine? why not?
[2024-10-23T23:57:54] Yamal: I say me

[2024-10-23T23:58:40] haku: this little motors get hot
[2024-10-23T23:58:53] Yamal: How to mount SEVEN… sad ..
[2024-10-23T23:59:19] haku: not with these motors. you prolly wont use full potential i think
[2024-10-23T23:59:31] haku: need a legit highway cruiser with big motors
[2024-10-24T00:00:16] haku: maybe 80h has better cooling
[2024-10-24T00:03:29] haku: gotta say. i love this frame so far. youve seen it here folks. first one to build on this frame. worlds first title
[2024-10-24T00:04:33] Yamal: Also with VESC💯

[2024-10-24T00:43:40] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-24T00:50:15] Yamal: Lucky
[2024-10-24T00:51:29] Yamal: I don't understand how a motorcycle can wobble so strongly when it is supposed to be very stable.
[2024-10-24T00:52:01] haku: its a mystery to me too.
[2024-10-24T00:52:30] haku: they say you just let go off the handle and dont fight it. it will fix itself
[2024-10-24T00:52:30] Face de Pin Sucé: too large
[2024-10-24T00:55:42] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_18860@24-10-2024_00-55-42.jpg>
[2024-10-24T00:55:54] Face de Pin Sucé: This one is coming for Spain haha
[2024-10-24T00:57:13] haku: did you really drill holes on that motor? or just cooling fan?
[2024-10-24T00:58:33] haku: that fan acts as an intake blower. very smart
[2024-10-24T00:59:00] haku: french always ahead of the game.
[2024-10-24T01:00:45] Face de Pin Sucé: other side we have venturi effect to extract air from motor
[2024-10-24T01:01:10] haku: wow. some engineering right there
[2024-10-24T01:02:18] haku: have you messed around with bigger stators like emoto stators? or your exclusive to scooter racing?
[2024-10-24T01:04:14] Yamal: Nice !
[2024-10-24T01:05:46] haku: this setup is perfect for me
[2024-10-24T01:05:47] Yamal: The anchoring of the stem is cool!
[2024-10-24T01:07:31] Yamal: I would like to do something similar by 2025!
[2024-10-24T01:08:39] Yamal: but of course I will try to do it myself, except for the battery, I am a humble worker and also the bank does not lend me money xD
[2024-10-24T01:09:10] Yamal: Also with the Nami…
[2024-10-24T01:09:19] haku: let james build you a battery worthy of racing

[2024-10-24T04:37:57] Noname: Put in truck, unload, split, stack, put in wheelbarrow, stack in house put in stove. Clean ash and chimney
[2024-10-24T04:38:08] Yamal: This year I'm not going to go crazy, burning firewood, since there are no children involved, I'll burn just the right amount.
[2024-10-24T04:38:13] Noname: If it's horizontal

[2024-10-24T04:39:05] Noname: It's hard to find now on Facebook. Always free stuff. But I've burnt sticks and wood off my walls to keep warm
[2024-10-24T04:39:27] haku: can you cut a tree down and haul to your house?
[2024-10-24T04:39:42] Noname: If you have permission to cut

[2024-10-24T04:41:49] Yamal: this winter is going to be the second that I use an economical wood stove like when I lived in the northern Spain, it is heated and this year we want to do the installation because we have the radiators and everything...

[2024-10-24T04:46:26] Yamal: If it also has an oven, and it is heatable, that is, you can connect a radio system with a water circuit that runs through the wood stove to heat the house.
[2024-10-24T04:47:53] Yamal: but well let's say that in the south of Spain the Cold is not a big problem.
[2024-10-24T04:49:29] Noname: Im buying heated slippers this year. I keep.my house slightly above freezing 🥶
[2024-10-24T04:49:37] Yamal: now the truth is, what I think about most is setting up the electronics!

[2024-10-24T05:12:06] haku: my bottom vesc is pretty open but has a cover. i just dont want to bother the fender
[2024-10-24T05:13:07] Yamal: Like this xD
[2024-10-24T05:13:08] haku: for aesthetic reasons too i want to change the bolts to black bolts so the bolts blend in with the color

[2024-10-24T06:53:40] Yamal: I don't like politics, and it has never been lived in my house, in fact my father, who is 60 years old, has never voted in his life xD
[2024-10-24T06:53:57] Yamal: He considers himself an anarchist xD
[2024-10-24T06:54:42] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-10-24T06:58:01] Yamal: I'm simply not interested, they fill their pockets at our expense, and many with lifetime salaries xD, I have a conservative tendency, that's clear! I like the usual, the normal and the natural, I discard the craziness of today nothing more..
[2024-10-24T06:59:21] haku: unfortunately thats how government runs. you need to find the correct candidate with the same values as you
[2024-10-24T07:00:20] Yamal: Let someone else find it!
[2024-10-24T07:00:26] Yamal: 😂

[2024-10-24T07:07:42] haku: its unfortunate that LY is the only option that i know off for these 6.5 motors

[2024-10-24T07:10:59] Yamal: Why don't you consider installing QS engines and putting the minibike at 250kmh?
[2024-10-24T07:11:38] haku: i would but would be better on a different frame.
[2024-10-24T07:11:49] haku: no modifications
[2024-10-24T07:13:30] haku: i still want the wepoor minibike scoot to still be considered as a scooter. its the only parts i know
[2024-10-24T07:14:39] Yamal: and be able to cross parks without intimidating anyone hehe
[2024-10-24T07:14:45] haku: yes

[2024-10-24T07:18:31] Yamal: This is the good thing about e-scooters and mini bikes, portability, versatility, effectiveness, in the end they make you a free person xD

[2024-10-24T07:23:46] haku: yes when going slow i can reach very far. but going on 100kmh highways it drains fast
[2024-10-24T07:23:52] Yamal: About 100 or a little more for one charger
[2024-10-24T07:24:53] Yamal: and with my new charger it will be the rod, I want to put it into action at 20A
[2024-10-24T07:25:49] haku: i dont have a fast charger. only 5a watte charger. it takes overnight to charge 50ah
[2024-10-24T07:26:10] haku: 50a charger would be nice

[2024-10-24T20:02:28] Noname: Now your lights speedo etc won't work
[2024-10-24T20:06:47] puneDir: It will
[2024-10-24T20:07:04] puneDir: Its controlled with another 12v regulator For speedo we can use lisp code
[2024-10-24T20:07:16] puneDir: Im trying to identify this
[2024-10-24T20:08:03] Noname: Or 10$ GPS speedometer
[2024-10-24T22:11:11] haku: todays project is brought to you by wepoor brand.
[2024-10-24T22:12:25] haku: just like rage mechanics but with no budget

[2024-10-24T23:45:36] haku: peak g30 works with regen. nice.
[2024-10-24T23:46:22] William Tremblay: Good evening everyone, is there a dedicated area where I can ask very newbie questions? I'm brand new to this! Best regards.
[2024-10-25T00:01:16] William Tremblay: Thank you very much!
[2024-10-25T00:10:56] William Tremblay: Good evening everyone! I recently had my electric scooter controller break down on me. It was a Vsett10+ controller and I did try to repair it by changing the mosfets but the circuit was just so annoying to work with. Anyway, I learned from reddit that Vesc controllers were a blessing if you took the effort it needed and I am completely up for the challenge. I know very little about circuits and I have done some soldering in my life but I am far from an expert (extreme newb). So firstly I just had few little questions! What Vesc controller would you guys recommend for my Vsett10+ with default battery 25.6Ah 60 Volts. I also wanted to know if it was possible to use the central display after changing the controller, because I heard it might not be possible. I also live in Canada Quebec and wanted to know where was the best place to buy a Vesc controller. To finish, (for now) I also wanted to know if anybody might be willing in the future to guide me through the rewriting and such. Thank you everyone for reading!
[2024-10-25T00:22:46] Yamal: Hello, how are things in Canada? Welcome to the Vesc group! Like you, I'm new to this! but from what the guys say, your best option is called Ubox 85/150, the site to buy it from your country, its official website! spintend.com/y regarding him display hear that vesc is compatible with vsett displays
[2024-10-25T00:37:04] haku: pick one @yamal. send me your mailing address.
[2024-10-25T00:37:05] haku: <photos/photo_18885@25-10-2024_00-37-05.jpg>
[2024-10-25T00:37:19] haku: what color dude. i got you
[2024-10-25T00:41:08] Yamal: Wouhh
[2024-10-25T00:43:43] Noname: Where's the trucks?
[2024-10-25T00:44:59] Noname: Turn left there's Bentley also
[2024-10-25T00:46:39] Yamal: I prefer a good e-scooter with a real vesc, I'm being honest, to this day I have no interest in other vehicles...
[2024-10-25T00:55:20] Noname: @Bradhaku Looking for a cool place to make you go. What the hell is this lol
[2024-10-25T01:03:28] haku: thats grove street from gta san andreas
[2024-10-25T01:03:39] haku: we dont go there.
[2024-10-25T01:04:11] haku: im just riding in traffic. suspension sucks on this. hit 2 potholes and bottomed out
[2024-10-25T01:16:42] haku: you have to be shitting lock broke again. all my stuff in there.
[2024-10-25T01:37:29] Yamal: Do you put some type of silicone on the joints when you attach the original Dt supports, front and rear, to the box?
[2024-10-25T01:39:04] haku: nothing a hammer cant fix. china is going to replace that again
[2024-10-25T02:10:30] haku: oh no. thats not good
[2024-10-25T02:19:10] Yamal: No good
[2024-10-25T02:20:02] Yamal: The same thing happened to me in the Nami, and it is one of the things that puts me back a little, in putting the Ubox if everything is not well insulated....
[2024-10-25T02:20:44] haku: i can put s fender
[2024-10-25T02:20:52] haku: or cover the bottom
[2024-10-25T02:23:59] haku: didnt tronic break because of too much FW?
[2024-10-25T02:28:46] Yamal: The first one, it broke in the circuit, I had quite a few high temperature spikes, and I also had dirt on the controller, we assume that both things were mixed, the second time it directly exploded in a speed test with 200A phase per controller and 37A fw lor controller
[2024-10-25T02:31:03] haku: need to cover that bottom area
[2024-10-25T02:31:09] Yamal: This time the truth is that I am thinking about it a lot and I would like to do things as best as possible, because I could get to Spain to put the electronics with a new heatsink and a plastic cover as a protector and start walking and enjoy the life on a scooter, but I'm not 100x100 sure, my head is going to explode XD my friend
[2024-10-25T02:33:18] haku: well spintend is very affordable. so thats a good choice but i know you a fancy lad so seven for you
[2024-10-25T02:34:32] haku: i havent had any problems with any of my spintend even the dual 100 v2. the spinny is the only one broken
[2024-10-25T02:35:07] Yamal: I have another option and that is to delay the controllers for another month and assemble the Thunder with a long box so that at the end of November I can take the electronics and give the Nami a break and work on it from scratch starting with the steering axle and do things without rushing and well.....
[2024-10-25T02:35:58] Yamal: So I don’t know yet what to do,, next week start! 🤲
[2024-10-25T02:36:31] haku: why only big standing scooters? no g30 no quality of life?
[2024-10-25T02:37:34] Yamal: It doesn't fit into what I'm pursuing today.
[2024-10-25T02:47:46] William Tremblay: Thank you so much for the swift and great responses! For the Ubox, I assume I need to get the dual one since the Vsett has two motors right? Or maybe I need two Single? Also wanted to know if the heatsink is worth it?
[2024-10-25T03:03:14] Noname: Singles are easy to replace one or set up in a different configuration. No heatsink, use thermal.paste and bolt to frame.
[2024-10-25T03:14:51] William Tremblay: Alrighty thank you again for the amazing responses! :))
[2024-10-25T03:32:00] haku: i think i will wire this one. very simple. brake and turn signal light.
[2024-10-25T03:32:58] haku: i hate wiring lights. but necessary
[2024-10-25T03:58:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha
[2024-10-25T03:59:14] Face de Pin Sucé: No we don't
[2024-10-25T04:01:38] Yamal: I thought it for protection against water ^^'
[2024-10-25T04:02:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, not needed
[2024-10-25T05:22:36] haku: tough chinese negotiators.
[2024-10-25T05:23:14] haku: they wanted me to pay 30 for shipping. i showed them this in ali express lmao.
[2024-10-25T05:24:49] Yamal: Hehe
[2024-10-25T05:26:10] haku: learn yamal. thats how you negotiate with china. trump style baby
[2024-10-25T05:27:49] haku: they are all about the reviews you know. they dont care about the money
[2024-10-25T06:16:45] Yamal: Alibaba Jungle
[2024-10-25T06:24:00] haku: every seller is different man. some good some bad. just need to find the right ones
[2024-10-25T06:24:36] haku: this seller is not bad tbh. but thier locks keep breaking.
[2024-10-25T06:24:45] haku: and they know it too
[2024-10-25T06:24:59] haku: they use cabinet locks 😭
[2024-10-25T06:59:04] haku: this good for winter and aerodynamics? will it lessen the drag?
[2024-10-25T06:59:05] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-10-26T01:18:19] NetworkDir: 80mph crazy but mosfet temp dont looks fine :(
[2024-10-26T01:18:32] NetworkDir: How you mount controllers
[2024-10-26T01:19:05] haku: i see. on a thin sheet of metal connected to frame
[2024-10-26T01:19:15] NetworkDir: Also your motor need ferofluid
[2024-10-26T01:19:18] haku: ill post my first run too
[2024-10-26T01:19:27] NetworkDir: Do you use thermal paste??
[2024-10-26T01:19:36] haku: yes. but cheap one haha
[2024-10-26T01:20:00] NetworkDir: Hmm anyway shouldn't +60C
[2024-10-26T01:20:40] NetworkDir: Maybe better mount here
[2024-10-26T01:20:53] NetworkDir: Also your frame stable at 80mph?
[2024-10-26T01:21:11] NetworkDir: Be careful anyway use good helmet and protections :)
[2024-10-26T01:26:53] NetworkDir: Yes steel sucks for cooling
[2024-10-26T01:31:23] Noname: 22kw holy cow
[2024-10-26T01:40:00] haku: yes thats where its mounted
[2024-10-26T01:40:30] haku: its very stable imo
[2024-10-26T01:41:21] haku: i was trying to beat the last record 24kw. idk why it did not peak at that
[2024-10-26T01:41:44] haku: also i cannot vesc log for some reason. it keeps shutting app down
[2024-10-26T01:43:32] Noname: 24 I missed that one
[2024-10-26T01:43:34] Yamal: Bullminibike
[2024-10-26T01:44:37] Yamal: It would be likely that with the mcomponents you have you would reach around 30kw that I think...
[2024-10-26T01:45:57] Noname: Thought vesc was only reliable to 10kw.
[2024-10-26T01:47:11] Yamal: Ubox?
[2024-10-26T01:49:33] haku: what is that beeping sound on my video btw?
[2024-10-26T01:50:17] haku: nvm i set gps limit to alarm at 65mph
[2024-10-26T01:52:49] haku: i see. prolly need to mount on alu heatsink
[2024-10-26T01:52:55] haku: gotcha
[2024-10-26T01:53:19] haku: also the frame is open too. good airflow
[2024-10-26T01:53:41] 'lekrsu': Water 😭
[2024-10-26T01:54:12] haku: do i add or subtract mm on tire diameter if i want to add speed?
[2024-10-26T01:54:26] haku: because doesnt match gps
[2024-10-26T01:54:37] 'lekrsu': increase
[2024-10-26T01:54:54] haku: gotcha. wierd china tire size
[2024-10-26T01:55:36] haku: so far im impressed with the performance. before i up phase amps do i need heatsink for vesc?
[2024-10-26T01:56:42] 'lekrsu': Yeah cool it better
[2024-10-26T01:57:27] haku: its at 250 battery too.
[2024-10-26T01:58:31] 'lekrsu': 8 times more than me
[2024-10-26T02:04:28] Yamal: 1 controller?
[2024-10-26T02:06:35] Noname: Or move to Alaska
[2024-10-26T02:10:15] haku: do you think i can do 90mph with proper cooling with my current setup? or is peak performance?
[2024-10-26T02:13:30] haku: also at my weight and bike weight would that be possible with these motors?
[2024-10-26T02:21:46] haku: todays hood adventures boys.
[2024-10-26T02:22:13] haku: ali helmet and tanktop.
[2024-10-26T02:22:50] haku: they say minibike scoot + tanktop + ali helmet= girls
[2024-10-26T02:23:07] haku: thats good to know
[2024-10-26T02:28:11] Yamal: The cold doesn't seem to reach Las Vegas xD
[2024-10-26T02:32:21] Yamal: In my city we are having maximums of 20°C and minimums of 9°C
[2024-10-26T02:38:20] haku: perfect truck for the wepoor.
[2024-10-26T02:41:44] haku: photo sesh only. whatever i see in the hood stays here lol.
[2024-10-26T02:41:48] Noname: Happy your having so much fun. Seems like burnouts died out quick 😆
[2024-10-26T02:42:18] haku: i still do it but the rubber sticking to the back is bad news
[2024-10-26T02:42:33] haku: and i dont like the fender
[2024-10-26T02:49:49] haku: dirt bike boys need to know who runs this hood now
[2024-10-26T02:49:53] haku: in the hood racing is now my new lifestlyle.
[2024-10-26T02:50:49] haku: but they just shifting like shit. they couldve beat me
[2024-10-26T02:50:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-26T03:08:59] Yamal: Wouh

[2024-10-26T03:22:01] Yamal: This man looks like he is enjoying his new scooter! I like it!
[2024-10-26T03:23:51] Noname: Sound like cheap pit bikes.
[2024-10-26T03:26:33] haku: theres one for sale in my area.
[2024-10-26T03:27:05] haku: i really need a camera to document hood adventures
[2024-10-26T03:28:19] haku: emove roadster also LY motor?
[2024-10-26T03:28:40] Yamal: Me too man
[2024-10-26T03:28:41] Noname: Damn neck bearings close enough? Probably wobble within a weekend
[2024-10-26T03:28:57] Yamal: Don’t know Zz
[2024-10-26T03:29:20] haku: the emove?
[2024-10-26T03:30:00] haku: they claim worlds fastest production scooter.
[2024-10-26T03:30:21] Yamal: I think Velity
[2024-10-26T03:30:37] Yamal: Or I don’t know
[2024-10-26T03:30:42] Yamal: Weped sonic?
[2024-10-26T03:31:00] haku: idk. you tubers say it.
[2024-10-26T03:31:06] haku: paid ofcourse haha
[2024-10-26T03:31:35] Yamal: I have seen some reviews of emove and in none of the speed tests has it reached 80mph...
[2024-10-26T03:31:45] haku: no way im doing 80 mph standing
[2024-10-26T03:32:02] haku: true
[2024-10-26T03:33:34] Yamal: I don't know why weped velity or even Momen get into a circuit like Slack did in their day and do top speed by GPS.....
[2024-10-26T03:34:02] haku: america only believes youtube amd reddit
[2024-10-26T03:34:12] Yamal: Maybe it's not a good thing depending on how the current situation is for scooters in the world.
[2024-10-26T03:35:48] Yamal: I would really like to take a camera and take some tests and adventures, with my phone. I can't, it's from 2018, and it was already second-hand when I bought it and it vibrates a lot in the videos above it. scooter
[2024-10-26T03:35:53] haku: my wepoor scooter bike you dont even feel like your going 80.
[2024-10-26T03:36:15] Yamal: Seat.. not the same man
[2024-10-26T03:36:31] haku: scooter parts though hehe
[2024-10-26T03:36:44] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/gkexRHGYXDM?si=NsuFAqiXZCvT5SLX
[2024-10-26T03:38:06] haku: i like electric tbh. wepoor pulls like a tesla. just keeps going
[2024-10-26T03:38:43] haku: i just need a better cooling solution.
[2024-10-26T03:40:53] haku: yea it is i think
[2024-10-26T03:41:09] haku: where is the traction controll tab under?
[2024-10-26T03:41:27] haku: i just want to know if i have it on or off
[2024-10-26T03:41:27] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-26T03:45:23] Yamal: Have you already taken the fast charger?
[2024-10-26T03:49:43] haku: gotcha thanks
[2024-10-26T03:52:40] Noname: Would the spintend heatsink allow air to pass behind and help?
[2024-10-26T03:55:33] haku: i have this. should this be enough if i get it cut?
[2024-10-26T03:55:50] haku: or need more fins?
[2024-10-26T03:56:39] haku: nice.
[2024-10-26T03:56:45] Noname: Hoarder
[2024-10-26T03:57:07] haku: see. you never know what you gonna need
[2024-10-26T03:57:30] Noname: When's the sign going up? Pev repair
[2024-10-26T03:58:18] haku: lol. when i learn from the vesc lords. i cant even figure out the laotie wiring for esc
[2024-10-26T03:58:43] Noname: All.stock wiring is cursed
[2024-10-26T04:00:02] haku: no money for that. need more other important things for projects
[2024-10-26T04:00:47] haku: the g30 i really want it built.
[2024-10-26T04:12:20] haku: look at this china tech Noname https://youtube.com/shorts/Bi-wOeeAGNo?si=fKk_9xFbYbemsZ9e
[2024-10-26T04:14:12] Noname: Prob American tech just made affordable in china
[2024-10-26T04:14:54] haku: whats it called. this looks easy to learn
[2024-10-26T04:15:04] Noname: Laser welder
[2024-10-26T04:15:17] haku: cool. let me check ali haha
[2024-10-26T04:15:43] haku: i can make my own frame with this one
[2024-10-26T04:16:53] haku: thats not bad I just found this on AliExpress: $451.20 | Laser 1.5kw 2kw Metal Portable Handheld Optical Fiber Laser Lazer Soldering Welding Welder Machine https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNIuLco
[2024-10-26T04:18:45] Noname: I'll stick with my miller mig welder. It's a lot cheaper
[2024-10-26T04:23:11] haku: that ali lazer welder you can use it to strip paint and rust too. pretty cool
[2024-10-26T04:23:36] haku: same price as a glitter 811h
[2024-10-26T04:25:58] Noname: Hum 45k for a miller or 400$ for Ching Chong? Think you'll get a brick sent to your house 😆
[2024-10-26T04:26:43] haku: you never know. paypal is great. also ali will help too
[2024-10-26T04:27:16] haku: so far china tools not bad. exept that one time glitter broke
[2024-10-26T04:27:44] haku: maybe next year it will be cheaper
[2024-10-26T04:28:37] haku: but next year tarrifs are coming
[2024-10-26T04:29:58] Yamal: https://youtu.be/4ILVNPpMPDs?si=jhoD_ecFqf1c1y7H
[2024-10-26T04:31:11] haku: what country so nice
[2024-10-26T04:32:52] haku: there is no race. bs video
[2024-10-26T04:34:44] Yamal: Czech Republic
[2024-10-26T04:35:51] haku: is that sweden?
[2024-10-26T04:38:34] Noname: What language is that
[2024-10-26T04:39:18] Noname: Czech
[2024-10-26T04:43:40] haku: europe would be cool to visit. just so expensive
[2024-10-26T04:44:20] haku: unlike asia.
[2024-10-26T04:44:55] haku: $10 buys you 3 meals
[2024-10-26T04:47:20] haku: i mean 3rd world parts of asia.
[2024-10-26T04:56:30] haku: holy cow. finally happened. https://youtu.be/hBMoPUAeLnY?si=1vTkw3iP2OJ5233K
[2024-10-26T04:56:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-10-26T05:01:20] Yamal: 😑
[2024-10-26T05:01:36] haku: gps?
[2024-10-26T05:01:37] Yamal: August , remember ?
[2024-10-26T05:01:43] Yamal: Nop
[2024-10-26T05:01:47] Yamal: Vesc tool
[2024-10-26T05:01:57] haku: nice
[2024-10-26T05:02:12] Yamal: I show you what it’s nice
[2024-10-26T05:02:55] haku: what max kw on that run?
[2024-10-26T05:03:48] Yamal: <photos/photo_18910@26-10-2024_05-03-48.jpg>
[2024-10-26T05:03:49] Yamal: <photos/photo_18911@26-10-2024_05-03-49.jpg>
[2024-10-26T05:03:58] Yamal: XD
[2024-10-26T05:04:12] haku: i cant even do 95 duty
[2024-10-26T05:04:37] Yamal: I don’t know I think never see after that on vesc tool I check
[2024-10-26T05:05:45] haku: dam you beat my record on 22x3
[2024-10-26T05:05:51] haku: good work
[2024-10-26T05:06:08] Yamal: Only this/ this is Saturday day before with 27A FW/ next day all the same but with37A FW and boom
[2024-10-26T05:08:38] Yamal: Also I have the video
[2024-10-26T05:09:24] haku: nice
[2024-10-26T05:09:31] haku: i need to learn to log.
[2024-10-26T05:09:37] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-10-26T05:10:51] haku: lol i called this woke trans dude a sir in the drivethru. he got triggered lmao
[2024-10-26T05:11:32] Yamal: Who?
[2024-10-26T05:12:13] haku: dude in the drive thru window. he will spit on my food next time
[2024-10-26T05:12:36] Yamal: …
[2024-10-26T05:13:43] Yamal: change food establishments, do you mean the worker who served you?
[2024-10-26T05:15:15] haku: yea.
[2024-10-26T05:20:34] haku: i call it how i see it.
[2024-10-26T05:23:19] Yamal: Ninja warrior
[2024-10-26T05:23:24] Noname: Are there a lot of weirdos there
[2024-10-26T05:34:23] haku: not alot. but they stand out
[2024-10-26T05:35:14] haku: earlier i saw a dude in a raised 4 runner wearing a wig and lipstick. i really need a camera. good youtube content
[2024-10-26T05:57:50] haku: btw why did your vesc not limit you before it blew up? isnt it suppose to do that?
[2024-10-26T06:08:11] haku: this is my second out of 3 runs btw. its on an incline. anything out of the ordinary here?
[2024-10-26T06:09:17] haku: voltage drop looks bad too
[2024-10-26T06:09:17] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-26T07:03:47] haku: maybe throw dry ice in the controller box 😜
[2024-10-26T07:05:12] haku: just for 1 run to test top speed
[2024-10-26T07:19:12] haku: gotta love youtube comments haha https://youtube.com/shorts/OVElGwtUBjs?si=Dxdxzl6XpSHmE9DV
[2024-10-26T07:28:51] Yamal: The controller could not resist the Mohican dance
[2024-10-26T07:30:43] Yamal: but if they supposedly have their protections, perhaps with 0 FW it would NEVER have happened even with 200A phase
[2024-10-26T07:30:48] Yamal: I think…
[2024-10-26T07:31:57] haku: i see. so FW is aways the culprit for exploding vescs? or spintend just smart and limits it?
[2024-10-26T07:33:08] Yamal: For me I don’t like
[2024-10-26T07:33:55] Yamal: and I have had to learn it with "trial error"
[2024-10-26T07:35:14] Yamal: one has the hp he has, let's learn from this,,, xD
[2024-10-26T07:43:39] haku: they say for 33x2 you do not need FW. its just raw phase amps
[2024-10-26T07:44:04] haku: how much FW you used?
[2024-10-26T07:44:33] haku: its like turbo vs natural aspirated i guess
[2024-10-26T07:45:03] Yamal: I use last time 37A fw
[2024-10-26T07:45:15] haku: ok. thats alot?
[2024-10-26T07:45:15] Yamal: So total is 74A fw
[2024-10-26T07:45:39] Yamal: Nop I think ,,
[2024-10-26T07:46:38] haku: FW only kicks in at high rpms yea?
[2024-10-26T07:46:53] haku: or you also get torque from it?
[2024-10-26T07:47:24] Yamal: Since I installed them I have been running without fw with 150A phase and obtaining top speeds between 120 and 126kmh full battery, that was a simple weekend at night trying to extend my top speed somewhat, and with 200A phase
[2024-10-26T07:47:52] Yamal: 22/3 with 200A phase it’s so funny xD
[2024-10-26T07:49:51] haku: you get torque from FW? is that waht your saying?
[2024-10-26T07:53:06] Yamal: Nop
[2024-10-26T07:53:58] Yamal: The torque was given to me by the 22/3 winding and the phase amps.
[2024-10-26T07:54:35] haku: crazy you using 150. i use double and top speed similar. how much battery?
[2024-10-26T07:55:26] puneDir: <photos/photo_18913@26-10-2024_07-55-26.jpg>
[2024-10-26T07:55:47] puneDir: Why that
[2024-10-26T07:55:51] haku: just weld over it
[2024-10-26T07:55:53] puneDir: I always clean them lol
[2024-10-26T07:55:54] Yamal: 200A total
[2024-10-26T07:56:05] puneDir: <photos/photo_18914@26-10-2024_07-56-05.jpg>
[2024-10-26T07:56:14] haku: dam no way. im at 500 total
[2024-10-26T07:56:34] puneDir: Im happy with 150a 😂
[2024-10-26T07:56:51] Yamal: with 150A there is torque // but with 200A when you start to notice the madness
[2024-10-26T07:57:01] puneDir: My phase is set to 120 lol
[2024-10-26T07:57:06] haku: show gps dude
[2024-10-26T07:57:34] Yamal: Gps?
[2024-10-26T07:57:50] puneDir: Gps speed i think he meant
[2024-10-26T07:57:53] haku: gps top speed
[2024-10-26T07:58:03] Yamal: Only one time with gps but out FW
[2024-10-26T07:58:36] haku: gps always side by side when testing
[2024-10-26T07:59:26] haku: i just cant believe it. crazy speeds with less phase
[2024-10-26T07:59:41] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-10-26T08:00:17] Yamal: <photos/photo_18915@26-10-2024_08-00-17.jpg>
[2024-10-26T08:00:55] Yamal: Always gps is like 6/7kmh less
[2024-10-26T08:01:35] haku: mine oppoesite. wrong tire size
[2024-10-26T08:01:46] Yamal: So with 150A phase and 100A battery can get 120
[2024-10-26T08:01:58] haku: no way
[2024-10-26T08:02:15] haku: crazy
[2024-10-26T08:02:33] Yamal: Anyway 22/3 is torque..
[2024-10-26T08:02:41] haku: maybe my tune not properly for me
[2024-10-26T08:03:05] Yamal: I have many vídeo can see the acceleration
[2024-10-26T08:03:44] haku: i need to fix my cooling
[2024-10-26T08:04:27] haku: mount on alu fins
[2024-10-26T08:04:29] Yamal: I no longer consider 22/3, only 33/2, why do you want 350/400A phase in 22/3, I think it's stupid
[2024-10-26T08:05:11] haku: no what i meant for 33x2 you need more phase to get acceleration
[2024-10-26T08:05:13] Yamal: to disintegrate the wheels or that in a careless acceleration the scooter killed you
[2024-10-26T08:05:35] haku: i dont need screeching tires
[2024-10-26T08:07:43] Yamal: Until I test well well 33/2 I will not be able to speak,; but before making the change I will spend some time with 22/3 to see if we can make more popcorn xD
[2024-10-26T08:07:44] haku: i want to increase to up to 350 a when i get parralel battery and fix cooling. but 320a first
[2024-10-26T08:09:04] haku: i dont even know why im trying to go for top speed. so stupid.
[2024-10-26T08:09:10] Yamal: solving the cooling issue, you have a very powerful and special minibike, there is no rival on American soil right now
[2024-10-26T08:09:26] haku: minibike scoot bro
[2024-10-26T08:09:46] haku: nah theres faster bikes out there
[2024-10-26T08:09:58] haku: 100mph bikes
[2024-10-26T08:10:09] Yamal: It's normal, we all want to know how much our machines are capable of delivering
[2024-10-26T08:10:10] haku: with pedals 😂
[2024-10-26T08:11:22] haku: also faster scooters like voro
[2024-10-26T08:11:41] Yamal: VORO!? 😂
[2024-10-26T08:11:55] haku: sorry emove roadster
[2024-10-26T08:12:25] haku: YT say its fast. also k6
[2024-10-26T08:12:59] Yamal: then ok! You are slower than the bad guy's horse, as they say xD
[2024-10-26T08:14:12] haku: my goal is 90mph. after that no more speed tests
[2024-10-26T08:14:31] Yamal: Gps?
[2024-10-26T08:14:37] haku: ofcourse
[2024-10-26T08:14:50] haku: gps always accurate
[2024-10-26T08:15:44] haku: i need to match my tire size to get the right speed
[2024-10-26T08:16:51] haku: i see. only getting 75 duty
[2024-10-26T08:17:46] haku: motor is good until 120c for ly too so no need to worry
[2024-10-26T08:20:27] haku: actually draggy is the most accurate.
[2024-10-26T08:20:42] haku: but no money for that
[2024-10-26T08:22:48] Yamal: Highway 👍
[2024-10-26T08:25:46] haku: i think next speed test ill borrow a truck and get to the area so the wepoor is fully charged and cooled. maybe i can squeeze a bit more that way
[2024-10-26T08:26:07] Yamal: You can do early in the morning
[2024-10-26T08:26:17] Yamal: Normally I do at night
[2024-10-26T08:26:34] Yamal: But in winter no problem
[2024-10-26T08:26:37] haku: too dangerous here at night
[2024-10-26T08:26:57] Yamal: Morning
[2024-10-26T08:27:08] Yamal: People still sleeping
[2024-10-26T08:28:49] Yamal: don't forget to put on the buzz lightyear suit
[2024-10-26T08:29:46] haku: agreed. no more sleeveless shirts. my arms and chest adds drag haha
[2024-10-26T08:30:46] Yamal: ;)
[2024-10-26T08:32:50] Yamal: One week for back !
[2024-10-26T08:34:24] Yamal: The shire awaits
[2024-10-26T08:35:00] haku: im from gondor.
[2024-10-26T08:35:27] haku: or a rider for rohan baby
[2024-10-26T08:38:49] Yamal: The Shire is my environment now it is clear, I live in the middle of the countryside with all the peace and tranquility in the world, which I love!

[2024-10-26T09:12:05] Yamal: 242 cells for 22s11p right?
[2024-10-26T09:25:33] 'lekrsu': Yes, 22*11=

[2024-10-26T12:18:50] pasvik: 🔑 😔
[2024-10-26T12:22:21] Yamal: ?
[2024-10-26T12:23:19] pasvik: Bommm
[2024-10-26T12:25:30] Yamal: 🍿?
[2024-10-26T12:30:35] Yamal: ?
[2024-10-26T12:32:55] Yamal: you annihilated the dolphin and I annihilated the pink panther
[2024-10-26T12:41:04] Yamal: Here there are more than one who can buy a house with the Vesc controllers who told him "xao xao bellaxao"
[2024-10-26T15:20:36] GABE: lol
[2024-10-26T15:20:59] GABE: I was so drunk
[2024-10-26T15:24:43] Yamal: How the g30 going man
[2024-10-26T15:24:58] GABE: Money on Thursday
[2024-10-26T15:25:47] Yamal: the dance will start soon
[2024-10-26T15:27:09] GABE: I'll have the 20s mijia as well.
[2024-10-26T15:27:22] GABE: Weld 20s2p
[2024-10-26T15:37:36] GABE: not minibikes
[2024-10-26T15:37:49] GABE: Ur mini bike is insane.
[2024-10-26T16:10:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Friends, a question
[2024-10-26T16:10:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I want to connect a 5cm LED to the controller and use that LED as a brake light. The positive on this board would be pin 20/22, but what would be the negative, 19/21?
[2024-10-26T16:11:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_18919@26-10-2024_16-11-30.jpg>
[2024-10-26T16:23:28] Finn: 2,6,10,14,18,23,24
[2024-10-26T16:23:38] Finn: Any of those
[2024-10-26T16:29:14] Finn: Also output 20/22 is always on
[2024-10-26T16:30:20] Finn: You can grabb the signal from brake and turn on with a mosfet when voltage of brake so pin 7 is bigger then 1,5V
[2024-10-26T16:39:50] NetworkDir: Funny.. Before doing this mods you should learn basic electronics and solder skills 😬
[2024-10-26T16:43:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I mean I can use any negative but as a positive I would have to use 20 or 22, ok thank you very much
[2024-10-26T16:43:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Output 20 has a voltage of 12v 3a enough for a 5cm led the front and rear lights are connected to a reducer
[2024-10-26T16:52:05] haku: razor rsf650 also a minibike. you can put big sotion motors on those. but its not as small as my wepoor
[2024-10-26T16:53:01] haku: i dont know of mine is a minibike or a seated scooter. wtf is it
[2024-10-26T16:58:41] pasvik: modding and soldering was completely done by cengizhan 😁🙃
[2024-10-26T16:58:51] pasvik: .
[2024-10-26T17:03:04] NetworkDir: Anyway, the picture is not clear, but it seems that something has been manipulated :))
[2024-10-26T17:03:14] NetworkDir: Shitsky moment
[2024-10-26T17:39:19] Finn: Okay
[2024-10-26T18:01:50] Cengiz Han GENÇALİ: That's all you get for free
[2024-10-26T18:35:00] GABE: there is no reason for this to happen?
[2024-10-26T19:01:00] haku: FW i think
[2024-10-26T20:06:53] Yamal: Haku 2025!!!!!!!!
[2024-10-26T20:08:20] Finn: 44x1 and lets go on the highway
[2024-10-26T20:12:56] haku: hahaha
[2024-10-26T20:13:29] haku: that is peak quality of life right there.
[2024-10-26T20:45:30] haku: dam china knows america demand too well. https://youtu.be/wJ7oqa1aIv0?si=4IdcuIIcvujPuzDy

[2024-10-26T20:56:09] haku: las vegas so many dirt trails.
[2024-10-26T20:56:09] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-27T01:03:24] Yamal: Also not crazy expensive?
[2024-10-27T01:18:55] haku: not like how it used to be.
[2024-10-27T01:20:08] haku: dam i thought i was gonna sell this gay ass today.
[2024-10-27T01:20:30] Yamal: People buy?
[2024-10-27T01:20:51] haku: not as interested as the bike unfortunately
[2024-10-27T01:21:30] haku: my 48v ebike sold in 2 days.
[2024-10-27T01:21:48] Yamal: This is portable too xD

[2024-10-27T02:27:10] Yamal: Did you mount the heat sink?

[2024-10-27T02:32:50] haku: i need one of those turk displays. phone battery drains too fast
[2024-10-27T02:32:56] haku: look ma no hands.
[2024-10-27T02:37:04] haku: lots of cops around and no surron boys to race.
[2024-10-27T02:59:03] Yamal: It’s okay too, some time it’s nice go like 45/50kmh,, it’s my speed for Daly life and for very long route
[2024-10-27T02:01:55] haku: yea. battery also last long. i rode for 2hrs and only dropped to 90%
[2024-10-27T02:02:27] haku: when i see cops i go in the bike lane and slow down haha
[2024-10-27T02:06:09] haku: riding the vsett right now. such a big difference when standing up. center of gravity is off. top heavy.
[2024-10-27T02:08:27] Yamal: Power cells
[2024-10-27T02:19:12] haku: even with high discharge cells. i go far with it if i dont pin it that much. 50.4 ah pack
[2024-10-27T02:22:47] Yamal: 50.4 molicel at 50kmh is crazy, your cells are literally sleeping
[2024-10-27T02:23:45] Yamal: POWER CELLS ❗️⚠️
[2024-10-27T02:26:26] Yamal: I'm looking forward to doing a few kilometers with the scooter, I miss it, that freedom it gives you at any time of the day. day or any day of the week
[2024-10-27T02:29:01] Yamal: A guy once said some words that I loved about his e-scooter: -"what started out as a necessity became a hobby......and the hobby became a passion"
[2024-10-27T02:29:07] Yamal: 😭
[2024-10-27T02:29:07] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-27T02:30:07] haku: i need to wire lighting so i can see night time hood activities
[2024-10-27T02:31:05] haku: never rode at night in a long time
[2024-10-27T02:31:56] Yamal: For me magicshine best solution
[2024-10-27T02:33:07] haku: what about rear light?
[2024-10-27T02:33:37] Yamal: Same magicshine :)
[2024-10-27T02:35:33] haku: guys is it possible to wire a 5v USB port on the adc adapter or vesc?
[2024-10-27T02:44:28] Noname: Use car power port usb adapter and wire to 12v port.
[2024-10-27T02:44:56] Noname: The tip is + side is -
[2024-10-27T02:46:42] haku: whats that?
[2024-10-27T02:48:20] Noname: <photos/photo_18924@27-10-2024_02-48-20.jpg>
[2024-10-27T02:48:37] haku: oh gotcha
[2024-10-27T02:48:58] haku: is that what you use?
[2024-10-27T02:49:41] Noname: Currently a hack job solution in the moped yeah
[2024-10-27T02:50:10] Noname: Stock wouldn't charge phone it just held battery %
[2024-10-27T02:51:37] haku: i see.
[2024-10-27T02:52:14] Noname: Figured you have one
[2024-10-27T02:52:27] haku: oh man i just saw this. ramp time should be 0 yea?
[2024-10-27T02:52:54] haku: is this why im not quick to accelerate?
[2024-10-27T02:52:59] Noname: lol
[2024-10-27T02:53:30] haku: let me put it on zero. wtf
[2024-10-27T02:54:06] Noname: That's what you adjusted for the kids bike
[2024-10-27T02:54:39] haku: thats right
[2024-10-27T02:55:12] haku: what is negative ramp time?
[2024-10-27T02:55:22] Noname: Brakes prob
[2024-10-27T02:57:47] haku: holy cow. front tire slips now
[2024-10-27T02:58:51] haku: are burnouts easier wtf
[2024-10-27T02:59:12] haku: im so dumb for not checking that
[2024-10-27T03:04:53] haku: i thought non tuned vesc is always set to 0
[2024-10-27T03:06:38] haku: learning new stuff everyday with this vesc. crazy so mamy settings
[2024-10-27T03:06:39] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-27T03:07:06] Noname: It's never ending faster
[2024-10-27T03:08:01] Noname: 0 time is probably not good but fun
[2024-10-27T03:09:11] haku: maybe ill just add ramp time to front. front wheel slip is not good
[2024-10-27T03:09:24] haku: ill test
[2024-10-27T03:10:31] haku: it has some torque like a mofo now
[2024-10-27T03:12:44] Noname: 4/10s of a second ramp and it's that big of a change wow
[2024-10-27T03:13:15] haku: it is. i never get wheel slip on front. and burnouts start off weak
[2024-10-27T03:18:04] haku: ima try 2 wheel burnouts tomorrow
[2024-10-27T03:21:30] Yamal: 33/2….
[2024-10-27T03:21:49] haku: ?
[2024-10-27T03:24:47] Yamal: I mean it's because of the winding with 22/3 you start skidding from zero
[2024-10-27T03:25:40] haku: i see. i get some now. crazy how that 1 setting changed it
[2024-10-27T03:26:42] haku: if you push 600 phase. winding prolly doesnt matter
[2024-10-27T03:27:28] haku: can anyone confirm this? push enough amps on 33x2 and get the same as 22x3?
[2024-10-27T03:33:47] Yamal: https://youtu.be/aUa5AnP3PnA?si=MlB6YPa9Bvj4azkx
[2024-10-27T03:33:57] Yamal: 22/3🤓
[2024-10-27T03:34:35] Noname: Dumping clutch in 2nd gear vs 3rd
[2024-10-27T03:37:35] Yamal: 22/3 is extreme acceleration,,
[2024-10-27T03:39:34] Yamal: and with a lot of discharge you have to be careful with the accelerator
[2024-10-27T03:41:31] Noname: Just sucks with 2wd you lift the front and spin always
[2024-10-27T04:07:31] haku: i havent had 22x3 but 33x2 on 300 amps per motor is insane. what more at 350a
[2024-10-27T04:07:59] haku: god forbid 400a when i parallel the 40t
[2024-10-27T04:08:06] Noname: Oooh
[2024-10-27T04:08:32] Noname: Whats the vesc limit?
[2024-10-27T04:08:39] haku: no idea
[2024-10-27T04:08:48] Noname: What model
[2024-10-27T04:08:58] haku: 84/200
[2024-10-27T04:09:02] haku: like yours
[2024-10-27T04:09:12] Noname: Bitch please
[2024-10-27T04:09:18] Noname: I got the 250's
[2024-10-27T04:09:30] haku: aww dam. you got the new new
[2024-10-27T04:09:43] Noname: Webroke not wepoor
[2024-10-27T04:10:09] Noname: You still.beat me lol
[2024-10-27T04:10:13] haku: legend has it according to amy someone pushed 400a
[2024-10-27T04:10:28] Noname: When you grenade the thing
[2024-10-27T04:10:44] Noname: Gore group pics at least
[2024-10-27T04:10:53] haku: but 350 is safe i think.
[2024-10-27T04:11:41] haku: lets ask vesclords. @jamessoderstrom what phase limit of 84/250
[2024-10-27T04:12:25] haku: i think @AJAJ1992 is pushing 350 on his
[2024-10-27T04:13:01] haku: same motor winding as me too
[2024-10-27T04:13:12] Noname: <photos/photo_18926@27-10-2024_04-13-12.jpg>
[2024-10-27T04:13:50] haku: dam. legend
[2024-10-27T04:14:24] haku: always my boy @jamaludin_algarnati the nami hype man
[2024-10-27T04:15:33] Noname: Talking about saturation. Your playing with fire at some.point
[2024-10-27T04:16:01] haku: 33x2 saturate 300-400a
[2024-10-27T04:16:16] haku: thats what ive been told. maybe i should log it
[2024-10-27T04:16:36] Noname: Just don't need a wheel lock up when it dies
[2024-10-27T04:17:19] haku: tbh i dont even know why im doing all this. i have no social media to show the world. it personal enjoyment
[2024-10-27T04:18:03] haku: ill make YT channel when i get camera
[2024-10-27T04:18:13] Noname: Ah im private anyway. Just show lil things here
[2024-10-27T04:19:21] haku: i know if i post this stuff on reddit ill be stoned to death. but i will in a week
[2024-10-27T04:20:03] haku: my laotie got shat on by the mods
[2024-10-27T04:23:13] Noname: Each tribe has different rituals.
[2024-10-27T04:32:59] Yamal: I think the true on 85/250 300A phase it’s safe
[2024-10-27T04:33:24] Yamal: Can push more? Yes…
[2024-10-27T05:06:24] haku: oh fb marketplace.
[2024-10-27T05:09:15] Yamal: 80mph how ?
[2024-10-27T05:09:32] haku: no idea. it just says it
[2024-10-27T05:09:39] Yamal: ……

[2024-10-27T10:36:04] GABE: Hey guys, this guy needs help, he's asking what controller to buy for his kugoo G4,
[2024-10-27T10:36:13] GABE: I told him no flipsky or MKS 🤣
[2024-10-27T10:36:19] GABE: But maybe you guys know better.
[2024-10-27T10:36:31] GABE: He wants to mod from 16s to 20s
[2024-10-27T10:40:20] Finn: G4 has single motor?;
[2024-10-27T10:41:16] MnJKeKW: yes
[2024-10-27T10:41:18] MnJKeKW: 2kw
[2024-10-27T10:41:29] MnJKeKW: sadly very low torque
[2024-10-27T10:41:46] Finn: Ubox lite should be enough
[2024-10-27T10:42:12] MnJKeKW: but im gonna lost the display?
[2024-10-27T10:42:14] MnJKeKW: right?
[2024-10-27T10:42:24] Finn: You could put on a vsett display
[2024-10-27T10:42:40] Finn: I dont know if theres an integration for kugo
[2024-10-27T10:48:02] MnJKeKW: i dont think so
[2024-10-27T10:49:01] MnJKeKW: sadly i cant do nothing cause if i want to change controller its the display and nothing really change, then if i want more battery, if i want dual motor its the fork problem

[2024-10-27T12:09:51] GABE: use your phone
[2024-10-27T12:22:52] GABE: It's a high torque motor, it's a 16x4

[2024-10-27T15:12:14] GABE: Both The m365 and Pro 2 will have exactly 600wh, but in different voltages, 13 and 20s. It'll be interesting to see which one has more range, I assume the 20s will yield some more efficiency obviously Same motor on both.
[2024-10-27T15:29:04] Jan: Only good scooter manufacturer
[2024-10-27T15:29:16] Jan: Its actually a brand not full of retards like the rest
[2024-10-27T16:38:06] puneDir: I want 20s moto
[2024-10-27T17:12:32] haku: do 28s
[2024-10-27T17:19:53] puneDir: Why 28
[2024-10-27T17:24:26] haku: because moto motors are bigger
[2024-10-27T17:26:05] haku: i love china motors
[2024-10-27T17:29:16] puneDir: I want proper hub
[2024-10-27T17:29:28] puneDir: What if i put e bike rim and e bike hub to it?
[2024-10-27T17:31:58] haku: you can if you want. you can still mount moto tires on some of those
[2024-10-27T18:24:36] haku: Noname what is this solution. i need to black my screws so it doesnt stick out. https://youtube.com/shorts/7qmrGrkAcHA?si=30IsyK6daivMpUaa

[2024-10-27T21:16:22] Pandalgns: Jp controllers?? Or yunli?
[2024-10-27T21:16:29] haku: i cut all the laotie stock wiring on the display and controls side. yes jp
[2024-10-27T21:16:46] Pandalgns: U cut all?? 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂ fuck
[2024-10-27T21:16:57] haku: yes. like a idiot
[2024-10-27T21:18:03] Pandalgns: Like a big idiot 😂😂 but no problem,everything has a solution except death
[2024-10-27T21:18:24] Pandalgns: 😂😂 ok send me a photo
[2024-10-27T21:18:32] haku: hopefully i find the correct diagram for my display
[2024-10-27T21:18:44] Pandalgns: If you want I can help you privately

[2024-10-27T21:19:58] Pandalgns: 60v?? Controllers true?
[2024-10-27T21:20:04] haku: yes

[2024-10-27T21:20:42] haku: nice!
[2024-10-27T21:20:57] haku: what is this display called?
[2024-10-27T21:22:00] Pandalgns: I don't know, I know it's the generic JP, before it came as a tf 100 or ts100 or something like that but now they come without a name
[2024-10-27T21:22:12] haku: i have a basic understanding of it. this guy lives in my city too. https://youtu.be/0dnKJScjEUM?si=6XceJbuW90ccXmp_
[2024-10-27T21:23:39] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_18945@27-10-2024_21-23-39.jpg>
[2024-10-27T21:23:39] Pandalgns: Ok first that
[2024-10-27T21:24:26] Pandalgns: Now you don't know where both the display and the buttons are connected to the controller, right?
[2024-10-27T21:24:28] haku: gotcha. thanks so much bud
[2024-10-27T21:24:49] haku: i do. its just the display i need
[2024-10-27T21:25:01] haku: and the controls
[2024-10-27T21:25:34] 'lekrsu': non tuned vesc 😭, you don't just run detection and use it as that
[2024-10-27T21:25:49] Pandalgns: Is it worth it with that photo? In the end it is to match each color with its own, if you need help with any of the wiring to the controller, let me know
[2024-10-27T21:26:00] haku: thats what ive always done haha
[2024-10-27T21:26:14] 'lekrsu': I've only heard of you and another guy doing that
[2024-10-27T21:26:26] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-10-27T21:26:37] 'lekrsu': Can't be nice to use xD
[2024-10-27T21:27:20] 'lekrsu': But yeah, it was quite literally waiting 0.4 seconds before doing full power.
[2024-10-27T21:27:34] haku: no wonder my laotie was slower than stock controllers haha
[2024-10-27T21:27:59] haku: now it launches quickly
[2024-10-27T21:28:17] 'lekrsu': Need that rocketfuel option
[2024-10-27T21:28:59] haku: i might have to add ramp time to the front now because it slips
[2024-10-27T21:29:19] haku: its like i turned off traction control
[2024-10-27T21:32:00] haku: for sure bro. thanks again. that photo should be good
[2024-10-27T21:46:04] Pandalgns: 💪😉
[2024-10-27T22:25:07] GABE: give your son a proper tyre, please
[2024-10-27T22:25:53] haku: i cannot. unless i use tubes
[2024-10-27T22:26:19] haku: its not bad in the road imo. i always use this peak g30
[2024-10-27T22:30:39] haku: how did you strip that paint on the xiaomi btw?
[2024-10-27T22:34:05] Finn: Good to be back in Germany. Scooter Project can continue😁
[2024-10-27T22:34:40] haku: what scooter projects on the pipeline?
[2024-10-27T22:35:51] Finn: Dual 50H G30
[2024-10-27T22:36:14] haku: my dream build
[2024-10-27T22:36:55] haku: let us know the weight of the scooter once done
[2024-10-27T22:44:28] Pandalgns: with stripper and a lot of sandpaper
[2024-10-27T22:44:36] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_18948@27-10-2024_22-44-36.jpg>
[2024-10-27T22:44:54] haku: nice
[2024-10-27T22:45:26] haku: did it take alot of time to do?
[2024-10-27T22:45:41] Pandalgns: but it takes a lot of work for a project that is not for me
[2024-10-27T22:46:23] Pandalgns: The stripper acts for around 20 minutes or half an hour, and you pass it with a spatula or a blade and it comes out very well, but it is very dirty and sticky.
[2024-10-27T22:48:02] Finn: Im not sure if ill do 20s or 16s
[2024-10-27T22:48:05] haku: gotcha
[2024-10-27T22:48:11] Finn: I got cells for 16s6p here
[2024-10-27T22:48:27] haku: nice.
[2024-10-27T22:49:05] haku: 16s is plenty speed imo but 20s is nice. just crowded
[2024-10-27T22:49:23] Finn: Nah 16s on 16x4 isnt that much
[2024-10-27T22:49:36] Finn: Only arround 75kmh😭
[2024-10-27T22:49:51] haku: oh i see. that should be enough for me haha
[2024-10-27T22:50:27] haku: what about just single rear 16x4?
[2024-10-27T22:50:50] Finn: I did single 16x4 on 20s front pro2
[2024-10-27T22:51:02] haku: how that turn out?
[2024-10-27T22:51:05] Finn: 90kmh with fw but still slow
[2024-10-27T22:51:24] haku: thats plenty for me. haha
[2024-10-27T22:52:40] haku: portability and burnouts is what im looking for
[2024-10-27T22:52:41] Finn: 90 yeah but not 75 xD
[2024-10-27T22:53:14] Finn: I was thinking about 22s so 16s internal and 6s external but i need to run 8x10awg through the stem😂
[2024-10-27T22:53:42] haku: nice! what esc?
[2024-10-27T22:54:23] haku: my legs get shaky standing at high speeds. no balls for that
[2024-10-27T22:55:00] Finn: Front ubox lite rear ubox 85150
[2024-10-27T22:55:09] Finn: Thats what i need
[2024-10-27T22:55:21] haku: modified ubox?
[2024-10-27T22:55:31] Finn: No normal ubox
[2024-10-27T22:55:34] Finn: Why modified?
[2024-10-27T22:55:49] haku: oh i did not know ubox can do 22s
[2024-10-27T22:55:57] Finn: Yeah without regen
[2024-10-27T22:56:10] Finn: But the external batt is something i wont do
[2024-10-27T22:56:14] haku: nice
[2024-10-27T22:56:16] Finn: Wire length also suck
[2024-10-27T22:56:26] haku: agreed.
[2024-10-27T22:56:48] Finn: Maybe 16s and if its not enough sell it and build 20s
[2024-10-27T22:56:49] haku: 22s on a g30 would be badass
[2024-10-27T22:57:04] Finn: But not internal
[2024-10-27T22:58:15] haku: isnt that racing g30 22s?
[2024-10-27T22:58:31] Finn: Not sure
[2024-10-27T22:58:43] Finn: Im designing a cellholder when im home
[2024-10-27T22:58:48] Finn: Maybe 21s possible
[2024-10-27T22:59:06] haku: i still need to learn that 😭
[2024-10-27T22:59:44] Finn: Those 40p are littlebit smaller
[2024-10-27T22:59:55] Finn: P42 21.4 40p 21.15
[2024-10-27T23:00:28] haku: i dont like it too tight just enough. because petg might crack
[2024-10-27T23:00:40] Finn: Petg bends before it cracks

[2024-10-28T21:00:17] haku: i might have to put one or drill a hole on the side to have it exposed to air
[2024-10-28T21:00:40] haku: i mean mount it on side with heatsink
[2024-10-28T21:04:50] haku: Noname is this your pavement queen? https://youtube.com/shorts/O7yBz82LMLw?si=IME4U_CG-SCDsjG8
[2024-10-28T21:06:16] haku: in my funeral i aint dying if my coffin isnt in that bed. its in my will
[2024-10-28T21:06:16] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-10-28T21:16:12] Noname: 2wd lol not here bud. Modding cars is such a waste of money when you just drive to work every day
[2024-10-28T21:18:22] haku: i do like these little jap trucks though 80s datsun toyota tacomas
[2024-10-28T21:18:51] haku: for some reason trucks are big now wtf.
[2024-10-28T21:24:39] Noname: I want a kei truck but R hand drive and standard is a bit rough
[2024-10-28T21:40:46] haku: is it even legal to drive there?
[2024-10-28T21:47:03] Noname: Yeah they were gonna ban them but retracted.
[2024-10-28T21:49:32] haku: i wonder how much it is to import those. would be a cool mini truck for the wepoor and the peak g30
[2024-10-28T21:50:30] haku: can you reccomemd any watercooler for vesc
[2024-10-28T21:52:20] haku: look at the travel on this pos dude. too soft and always bottoms out.
[2024-10-28T21:54:42] Noname: Wtf
[2024-10-28T21:58:36] haku: i hope this will fit or we fucked. i really doubt it will though because of the tops have spacers.
[2024-10-28T21:59:47] haku: ill try. it will be a hack job but hopefully that fixes the cooling.
[2024-10-28T22:28:34] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGd8S4waB/
[2024-10-28T22:38:39] Noname: You can buy little cooling plates and radiators on Amazon or prob ali
[2024-10-28T22:39:28] Noname: Then use heat transfer method convection where heat rises cool sinks. Or a small dosing pump
[2024-10-28T22:40:01] Noname: <photos/photo_18971@28-10-2024_22-40-01.jpg>

[2024-10-28T23:06:34] haku: gotcha. ill open it up and make a drawing of where to mount it
[2024-10-28T23:07:17] Noname: Just make sure water can't drip on vesc if it leaks
[2024-10-28T23:07:50] haku: watercooling would be my last option. if i can mount it in a better place ill do that first.
[2024-10-28T23:08:15] haku: it adds weight to an already heavy wepoor
[2024-10-28T23:08:32] Noname: Take a poo before speed runs
[2024-10-28T23:09:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2024-10-28T23:09:57] haku: 90mph and im done with speed runs
[2024-10-28T23:10:16] haku: i just want to see how much you can push this little thing
[2024-10-28T23:11:02] haku: nice capture
[2024-10-28T23:12:26] Yamal: Winter fewer days to go out with the e-scooter
[2024-10-28T23:19:00] Lieven L.: Watercooling will allow for way more surface area, allowing for a lot lower temps.
[2024-10-28T23:19:51] haku: gotcha
[2024-10-28T23:28:09] Noname: Did 90.or want to
[2024-10-28T23:29:59] haku: want to.
[2024-10-28T23:30:47] haku: capped at 80 because coolimg
[2024-10-28T23:44:07] haku: maybe if i drive there then have the wepoor start from cold and full charge it might hit 90
[2024-10-28T23:58:36] Yamal: Winter is coming?
[2024-10-29T00:01:43] haku: imagine if you can capture the power of lighting how many watt is that. someone patent that
[2024-10-29T00:06:51] Noname: <animation>
[2024-10-29T00:08:00] Noname: I've been close enough to a lightning strike it melted steel into my car window from hitting a tree obv with a bolt or something in it
[2024-10-29T00:14:59] haku: lighting such a cool phenomenon but scary
[2024-10-29T00:18:15] haku: i also like those twisters. i forgot what its called tornado?
[2024-10-29T00:19:03] Yamal: Yes
[2024-10-29T00:19:34] Yamal: You know quite a bit of Spanish from what I see!
[2024-10-29T00:23:12] haku: those twisters happen where you live yea?
[2024-10-29T00:30:54] Yamal: Not big
[2024-10-29T00:31:06] Yamal: Only can see like small one
[2024-10-29T00:31:47] Yamal: They disappear quickly, what more than a tornado I think they are called whirlpools
[2024-10-29T00:32:12] Yamal: Don’t know … ^^'

[2024-10-29T00:57:51] Noname: Dirt devils
[2024-10-29T00:59:00] haku: scary stuff. i here that happens alot in some midwest state. rip your roof off and flip your truck
[2024-10-29T01:00:22] Noname: That's a tornado
[2024-10-29T01:01:23] Noname: Dirt devil is like a tiny 5 second circular wind
[2024-10-29T01:01:51] Yamal: I mean small tornado like nothing …
[2024-10-29T01:50:25] haku: my boy met his kin. very rare to see them here.
[2024-10-29T01:50:47] haku: so clean too unlike my scaliwag dog
[2024-10-29T01:55:11] haku: this city is populated by asian breeds. good to see these dogs here
[2024-10-29T02:08:13] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/RiqE2LglsiE?si=b3du6U_nvZAWMy1O

[2024-10-29T02:36:14] Yamal: :(
[2024-10-29T02:36:36] Yamal: Your dog is Kamala xD
[2024-10-29T02:36:50] Noname: He may not have a garage but he can practice parking anyway
[2024-10-29T02:37:37] haku: old owner might be tim walz
[2024-10-29T02:42:17] haku: turkey neck to neck with france in the polls
[2024-10-29T02:43:20] haku: street vs track scooter
[2024-10-29T03:02:14] Yamal: Turkey scooter need the LY MOTOR
[2024-10-29T03:03:02] Yamal: For be complete I think…
[2024-10-29T03:09:37] Yamal: But I really like turkey scooter
[2024-10-29T03:13:55] Yamal: for me it would be ideal scooter to get off the map doing endless routes with a powerful fast charger!🤩 And those carbon fiber elements are also cool, maybe the brakes aren't crazy but for me a 10 shawarma scooter.
[2024-10-29T03:20:27] haku: dam surron boys in vegas ridout. they show of force boys. how we gonna match that with our scooters? they getting shot at crazy stuff. https://youtu.be/WImB4wQx3m8?si=mm6MhZ6cTrQRk44u
[2024-10-29T03:22:43] haku: yea that turk scooter is unique. first one ive seen build in that frame. its prolly faster and better built than the emove roadster. i respect everybodys build. the more unique the better. everyone seems to be copy and paste builds now adays
[2024-10-29T03:23:10] Yamal: Nice many motos
[2024-10-29T03:23:29] Yamal: China frame xD

[2024-10-29T14:24:04] puneDir: I might wanna take that out lol
[2024-10-29T14:24:29] puneDir: That stove
[2024-10-29T14:32:04] Noname: Doesn't it need to change cc cv when charging?
[2024-10-29T14:33:08] Noname: Brand new nobody bought now batterys are dead lol. Wonder what the lowest will be.
[2024-10-29T14:33:15] puneDir: the charger cc cv
[2024-10-29T14:34:23] Noname: Yeah but wrong voltage. Idk how that works anyway
[2024-10-29T14:35:20] puneDir: I think battery pulls down the voltage due internal resistance
[2024-10-29T14:36:53] cihan: Does low tyre pressure like 40-42 psi increase traction? I use ninebot f2 pro at 46 psi front and 48 psi rear. Something strange happened today. Asphalt was really slippery at a U-turn where cars come to a full stop and then accelerate. I was slow but turned a little fast leaning left more than I used to. Rear tyre started skidding and I fell down to the left. Something I never expected to happen since it's just a 900W motor and official firmware doesn't apply full power at once.
[2024-10-29T14:39:22] Noname: Low tire pressure gives more contact area. But less ground pressure per sq in. So the tire can't conform to rough texture and provide grip.
[2024-10-29T14:39:41] Noname: My theory anyway
[2024-10-29T14:41:26] 'lekrsu': Yes
[2024-10-29T14:51:49] GABE: Thinner (higher pressure) less surface area = more speed
[2024-10-29T14:52:06] GABE: Yeah it would increase traction to an extent
[2024-10-29T14:52:17] GABE: but it could also lower it depending on factors
[2024-10-29T14:52:22] GABE: like rain
[2024-10-29T14:53:21] cihan: I guess there's a sweet spot but it's probably not 48 psi for me. I weigh 104 kg so 48 psi doesn't seem high for me but I wouldn't expect tyre to skid at such low power. Probably a little less pressure is better at slippery surface as you say and a little higher is better on gripping asphalt.
[2024-10-29T14:54:32] cihan: Does low pressure provide less grip on wet surface?
[2024-10-29T14:55:25] Noname: Cars drip oil too. You said slippery was it wet? I've driven on pavement like ice in the city when wet
[2024-10-29T14:57:37] cihan: There shouldn't be any oil. Cars apply more force when accelerating from full stop and that part of asphalt was shiny because of constant polishing and tyres leave a lot of residue on the asphalt at parts of asphalt where cars always accelerate.
[2024-10-29T14:59:08] Noname: Polished surface and chinese tire? Is it cold there?
[2024-10-29T15:03:30] cihan: Yes, Chinese tyres, they're stock tyres, CST. Should I replace them? They're probably not the worst tyres, doesn't seem full nylon, has some rubber insude but I don't know the ratio.
[2024-10-29T15:04:08] cihan: They're at 2700 km now. Not cold, it was sunny and 19 degrees outside when I fell. I didn't expect rear tyre skid at all.

[2024-10-29T17:13:11] puneDir: Im vescing the moped
[2024-10-29T17:13:56] Lieven L.: You pretty much have to
[2024-10-29T17:14:13] 'lekrsu': No, that's SmartEsc firmware.
[2024-10-29T17:15:56] haku: swiss papasito mucho dinero
[2024-10-29T17:16:54] puneDir: Btw its screen reads the speed from phases
[2024-10-29T17:17:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: No
[2024-10-29T17:17:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: I saw installing vesc
[2024-10-29T17:17:24] 'lekrsu': Smartesc uses vesc app as a gui
[2024-10-29T17:17:52] 'lekrsu': but it's not actually running vesc
[2024-10-29T17:18:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: <video_file>
[2024-10-29T17:18:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: <video_file>
[2024-10-29T17:19:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: Smartesc only workend on the pro 2 controllers before

[2024-10-29T17:20:55] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_18991@29-10-2024_17-20-55.jpg>
[2024-10-29T17:21:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: You s that is the guy I saw the videos
[2024-10-29T17:21:18] 'lekrsu': Smartesc ran on CamiAlfa's 4 pro months ago as well.
[2024-10-29T17:22:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: So you have link of that
[2024-10-29T17:25:11] 'lekrsu': The convo was in #mi4 in the ScooterHacking Discord
[2024-10-29T17:26:09] 'lekrsu': No, not Ninebot nor Vesc. It's from ST.
[2024-10-29T17:27:29] RicharDON: vesc 75100 controller, mantis motors, 60v 18ah battery
[2024-10-29T17:34:18] NetworkDir: you can use field weakening no problem

[2024-10-29T18:12:22] haku: i would rather have range than speed though
[2024-10-29T18:12:50] GABE: fr
[2024-10-29T18:12:54] GABE: that's why I did 8p
[2024-10-29T18:12:55] haku: but burnouts for the mommies

[2024-10-29T18:13:56] GABE: How old r u btw?
[2024-10-29T18:14:01] haku: 39
[2024-10-29T18:14:07] GABE: Not bad my dad's 50.
[2024-10-29T18:14:09] GABE: Still young
[2024-10-29T18:14:15] GABE: Good u got a son this early
[2024-10-29T18:15:11] haku: you might be one of mine but i dont remember visiting ireland
[2024-10-29T18:15:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2024-10-29T18:15:40] GABE: Lmffao
[2024-10-29T18:15:46] haku: you too old to claim child support anyway
[2024-10-29T18:15:49] Noname: Burnouts on sEscooters is the gayest, unless it's while rolling
[2024-10-29T18:17:17] haku: rolling burnouts really difficult. im heavy af
[2024-10-29T18:19:18] Noname: Need those torque motors.
[2024-10-29T18:19:39] haku: g30 i will 16x4 single
[2024-10-29T18:19:57] Noname: I want a James wheelie machine
[2024-10-29T18:20:32] haku: 16x4 you dont need much amps to burnout yea
[2024-10-29T18:20:42] Noname: You mean wheelie
[2024-10-29T18:28:35] haku: look LY sells this. might be a good idea to put holes and tack weld some fins
[2024-10-29T18:29:15] haku: instead of the watercooled motor or statorade
[2024-10-29T18:34:50] Noname: Cooling the cover doesn't help as much without statorade. There's an insulating air gap.
[2024-10-29T18:35:39] haku: look at this parameter settings on fardriver. wtf is this.
[2024-10-29T18:36:44] haku: need vesc to fardriver attatchment or converter
[2024-10-29T18:37:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Looks fancy but unsure if good for nothing or needed
[2024-10-29T18:37:37] haku: i see.
[2024-10-29T18:38:30] haku: even if the fins airflow pushing to the stator and pulling from other side?
[2024-10-29T18:39:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like how many of you used or know that there is hand test in vesc?
[2024-10-29T18:39:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Where you can test all signals before riding
[2024-10-29T18:39:31] haku: what is a hand test?
[2024-10-29T18:39:39] haku: oh i see
[2024-10-29T18:39:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's in app
[2024-10-29T18:39:57] haku: i dont even know vesc that well tbh. im noob
[2024-10-29T18:40:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Note if you turn on Dont forget to turn off
[2024-10-29T18:40:24] haku: is there auto turn off?
[2024-10-29T18:41:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's why i was looking at foes numbers in % and gear ratio etc in fardriver Most ppl never look on anything
[2024-10-29T18:41:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No have to go back to turn off , that's why i said it
[2024-10-29T18:41:30] haku: i see
[2024-10-29T18:41:33] 'lekrsu': Which option would that be
[2024-10-29T18:42:24] Noname: Didn't see the holes part
[2024-10-29T18:42:38] Noname: But fill motor with dust
[2024-10-29T18:43:01] Noname: Some dirt has magnetic bits.
[2024-10-29T18:44:26] haku: true. not good for street riding
[2024-10-29T18:44:52] haku: that would fuck a motor for sure.
[2024-10-29T18:45:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://youtube.com/shorts/4g2xmK8zSkI?si=UHKTMtFFBCKjrTog
[2024-10-29T18:46:03] Finn: Active airflow better
[2024-10-29T18:46:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Found older Vid from it
[2024-10-29T18:46:23] haku: whats that
[2024-10-29T18:47:14] Finn: Holes in the motor😁
[2024-10-29T18:48:47] 'lekrsu': Hmm, haven't seen that tab before
[2024-10-29T18:52:12] haku: this is my idea or what im thhinking. i think its been done by the french im not sure if same concept.
[2024-10-29T18:53:00] haku: but for street riding ill use ferofluid.
[2024-10-29T18:53:17] haku: i dont go highway all the time anyway
[2024-10-29T19:03:39] Noname: Idk honestly the poles are in the way. There's like mm's for air to pass although I've never looked into it
[2024-10-29T19:05:03] haku: agreed. its like jbd
[2024-10-29T19:07:21] haku: well as an engineer with 10 year experience i think this is really good idea
[2024-10-29T19:08:27] haku: but for street riding. its not a good idea.
[2024-10-29T19:08:35] Noname: Idk my move to a cold climate idea was thrown out.
[2024-10-29T19:09:02] haku: i can imagine summer rides here. im sure ill fry something
[2024-10-29T19:22:30] Lieven L.: Watercooled Stator would be the best. Statorade will also add friction.
[2024-10-29T19:45:50] puneDir: Noname help me
[2024-10-29T19:51:03] Noname: What
[2024-10-29T19:54:22] NetworkDir: Really votol and fardriver also kelly software bullshit
[2024-10-29T19:54:54] NetworkDir: Yesterday i check votol really trash
[2024-10-29T19:55:28] NetworkDir: Fuck the money and spent for vesc

[2024-10-29T20:15:32] NetworkDir: Who knows ? Why you don't measure with mulimeter They are not same
[2024-10-29T20:16:57] puneDir: Ya senin vereceğin aklın amk
[2024-10-29T20:18:11] NetworkDir: Basically skill issues
[2024-10-29T20:18:22] puneDir: Nenen issue
[2024-10-29T20:21:50] Noname: It's just a disconnected plug in frame?
[2024-10-29T20:22:39] Noname: If so prob just a universal wire harness
[2024-10-29T20:56:35] haku: true. im asking LY if they have some left over from weped
[2024-10-29T20:56:55] puneDir: It was connected on original esc

[2024-10-29T21:02:46] Давно пора: After I welded fins to grab air and force it trough rim(it has holes and ribs for cooling)

[2024-10-29T21:03:25] Давно пора: And holes from outside which I drilled under angle to grab air asw(I believe I lost pictures of it in final form)
[2024-10-29T21:11:34] haku: how many holes you drill for that?
[2024-10-29T21:13:15] haku: i have a similar idea but wont be printed. just buy covers for motors and tack weld some fins and drill angled holes
[2024-10-29T21:13:48] haku: prints will melt in the summer here
[2024-10-29T21:26:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Flip has such i think
[2024-10-29T21:26:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is lot ways to do it and also dont use water😅 There are better fluids
[2024-10-29T21:26:42] Noname: Idk mine was like a fardriver with 1 big plug
[2024-10-29T21:27:54] haku: i have spintend

[2024-10-29T21:28:43] puneDir: I just wondered whats that plug
[2024-10-29T21:28:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If green red black,use to be throttle or pedal sensor
[2024-10-29T21:29:16] puneDir: Throttle is connected to red screen plug

[2024-10-30T00:28:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did You ever saw pet bottle melt from the sun? i never did🤷‍♂ Also i made similar thing with two motors non had melting probs In the other hand it's way to fight with heat On some motors you can mount heatsink rings But for such this is what you can do, but its more than one step To understand When motors spins The inside air is pressed to the magnets and mostly to gap between them And that generates extra heat and even the heat is concentrated there a lot, But if you use ferrofluid What sits in the gaps This air heat is more forced on the side plates Than windmills pull air on that and help you cool , also Imagine heat rises when you stop Since the tiny airflow what came from riding stops But if you have this you can cool motor anytime when tires in the air If you dont and motor cap feels warm or more than that , all you can do as " help " is drive a few km more calmLy so when you will stop heat doesnt rise to hell lvls
[2024-10-30T00:29:34] Patrick: Swap the p42a to 40PL

I, the first, have been working like a donkey for years to be able to eat, pay bills and go on vacation one month a year... all the friends I know who have worked for themselves, do not want to work for anyone anymore...

[2024-10-30T10:53:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It has super big shoulders ,like way overused Super dangerous
[2024-10-30T10:55:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I saw similar once , i even warned the fella to replace Than he before new disc he made one last ride And front disc broke on side and in next turn ripped one c arm of the scooter at 50 km/h
[2024-10-30T10:56:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He is ok by now but yeah You can imagine that hurt a lot 😅
[2024-10-30T10:58:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also 3 months under race or normal use?
[2024-10-30T11:04:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: your brake caliper is high look at the disc track
[2024-10-30T11:04:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Race and normal usd
[2024-10-30T11:05:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It is typical of the Hopes
[2024-10-30T11:05:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Not my racing scooter
[2024-10-30T11:07:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have played 3 games of Hope and the same thing happens to all of them, the ounce stays high and does not stop well, the disc breaks it
[2024-10-30T11:09:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Whole is up to pads too ,full metalic eats disc
[2024-10-30T11:10:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: back in dh used to use organic pads
[2024-10-30T11:10:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It is because of the angle of the clamp that is the problem
[2024-10-30T11:10:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And you change after every ride
[2024-10-30T11:10:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean real dh ride
[2024-10-30T11:11:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe i am not into hope
[2024-10-30T11:13:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: In order for the brake pad to press properly, the caliper must be moved so that it presses properly on the disc. Simply raising or lowering the caliper is not enough, it is a huge headache.
[2024-10-30T11:24:00] Rose: Hey there …, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-10-30T11:40:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I run a service,so you say nothing new for me Scooter world still wears child shoe's
[2024-10-30T11:41:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But hey even moped world has this issue Cheaper factory mopeds still have self setting disc brakes Why coz cheap
[2024-10-30T11:42:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And on a fuel one this is less an issue ,coz you have brrrr sound from engine , but on an electric you just hear self setting under work 🤣
[2024-10-30T11:42:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What this means is
[2024-10-30T11:44:51] sombre_enfant: https://rage-mechanics.com/moteurs-trottinettes-/1598-ventilation-moteurs.html @SibClimb u have one for the 60h
[2024-10-30T11:45:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Does two are like axles and brake slides left or righ And hits disc till it finds mid position
[2024-10-30T11:45:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So cheper e mopeds sound like santa is coming 😅
[2024-10-30T11:49:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: if that is a floating caliper
[2024-10-30T11:51:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Floating is sliding on axles
[2024-10-30T11:51:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2024-10-30T11:52:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Craparia exist like 20 years
[2024-10-30T11:52:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or more🤷‍♂
[2024-10-30T11:52:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The worst is when nowdays on some scooters they use drum brake
[2024-10-30T11:52:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Peugeot guy spins in his grave
[2024-10-30T11:53:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That shit he invented in 1905
[2024-10-30T11:53:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And its now 2024, Jesus christ 😅
[2024-10-30T11:53:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, I know that some motorcycles today use a drum on the rear brake, that is backwards.
[2024-10-30T11:53:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not just bikes
[2024-10-30T11:53:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ninebot g30
[2024-10-30T11:54:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ninebot d38

[2024-10-30T11:54:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And could continue
[2024-10-30T11:55:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On bigger bikes unsure if its a thing
[2024-10-30T11:55:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Since you never use them
[2024-10-30T11:55:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I also never understand why they still use drum brakes
[2024-10-30T11:55:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never used rear brake on bigger fuel bike , because that almost means you in super big trouble
[2024-10-30T11:56:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The rear brake on motorcycles when you brake has the effect of sticking the wheel to the ground, the front brake is to stop the inertia
[2024-10-30T11:56:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i am use to huge double disc in front
[2024-10-30T11:56:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 320?
[2024-10-30T11:57:06] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 280?
[2024-10-30T11:57:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like imagine gsxr size speed bikes
[2024-10-30T11:57:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Get used to using the rear brake, I recommend it.
[2024-10-30T11:57:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Have experience from that to Enduro
[2024-10-30T11:57:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nah i already sold all these
[2024-10-30T11:58:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No fuel shit anymore
[2024-10-30T11:58:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I know something about motorcycles, hehe
[2024-10-30T12:23:59] Lieven L.: Cheap and they use them on EVs too because they don't rust up as easy. Especially in the rear, since you never really brake and just use the regen.
[2024-10-30T12:42:44] Noname: Told ya to just put vesc to motor leave stock stuff
[2024-10-30T13:07:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This is one beautiful scooter

[2024-10-30T15:05:06] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i dont want anything in Uart, it's not fit with the performance or our controllers we use
[2024-10-30T15:05:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What is the difference?
[2024-10-30T15:05:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Reliability, safety
[2024-10-30T15:06:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: More reliable connection means ? No lag or disconnections ?
[2024-10-30T15:06:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If u are using can what do I do with the second vesc ?
[2024-10-30T15:06:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes

[2024-10-30T15:07:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: BUS...
[2024-10-30T15:07:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And what is about uart that is not safe ?
[2024-10-30T15:07:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So u just split the connections between them
[2024-10-30T15:08:18] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Short wires > ruin MCU, interference > Ruin MCU, accélération with current > Ruin communication
[2024-10-30T15:08:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i dont like Uart for that type of application
[2024-10-30T15:08:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no, it's Bus
[2024-10-30T15:09:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Aaaaah that is why I heard that the flopsky display ruin vescs

[2024-10-30T15:10:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: At the same time like sending info to display and second vesc ?
[2024-10-30T15:11:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes it's Bus
[2024-10-30T15:12:08] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: on my scooter on the same bus i have 5 Node ESC1 ESC2 Light module BMS module SmartDisplay everything exchange on the same Bus, it's the concept of Canbus
[2024-10-30T15:12:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: And if have electric issue, you kill the Tranceiver Can, not All the MCU on the line, it's more reliable
[2024-10-30T15:12:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Direct Uart are stupid as fuck for reliability

[2024-10-30T15:13:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Uart are ok for like Ble module, or something like is close to the controller
[2024-10-30T15:15:27] Paolo ⁭: Right, uart noise is joke when cable is long
[2024-10-30T15:16:09] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: That's why when yuo have power and UartDisplay you loose every info when you accélérate, and it comeback when you stop to accélérate lol
[2024-10-30T15:17:01] Vesc Project Paradise: I have never tried vesc display, and the one I like is worth almost €500, so I'll stick with the phone and the vesc tool app
[2024-10-30T15:17:03] NetworkDir: mostly i see on high voltage currents on 3shul
[2024-10-30T15:18:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: VescDisplay are dump, you need to have all your esc in 6.05 and installing Lisp code on it, also on the Vescdisplay you need install lisp code, and even if you do everything, it's very ugly display, with big pixels, nothing interesting
[2024-10-30T15:20:18] NetworkDir: the cheap yellow display one canbus version should released coming soon. and for vesc_express platform display i buy 3.5 inch + esp32-c3 after arrive we will see which one better :)

[2024-10-30T18:32:41] Noname: I messaged that I would "repair" 3 batterys as repaired and working is better than dead units.
[2024-10-30T18:33:38] haku: so hes asking 1k for a dead c80 wtf
[2024-10-30T18:57:06] William Tremblay: Good afternoon Vesc Group members, I recently asked a question here about replacing the controller for my Vsett10+. I was recommended the singles ubox 85/150 which sounded great, but I can't help but realize that they have been sold out ever since I asked. Does anybody know when they might be restocked? Anyhow, I started looking for alternatives because I don't know how much time it might take to be restocked and a redditor guided me towards the Vesc 75100 from makerspace. That paired up with a bluetooth module and a BMS to act as a power switch since apparently 75100's do not have one. Is that the same for Ubox's? I wanted to hear your thoughts on this? Is this a good alternative? Would it work? Do the 75100 really not have a power switch because I couldn't find any information on that online. Thank you for reading me and taking the time to answer. It is so appreciated!
[2024-10-30T19:02:26] Noname: 1k for 1 has 4 of them but special price if you buy all
[2024-10-30T19:03:02] haku: oh i see
[2024-10-30T19:03:04] Noname: Wonder what dealer cost was
[2024-10-30T19:04:11] haku: there was one in arizona you showed me back then. i shoulda got that. good price but 12h drive 2 way
[2024-10-30T19:04:29] haku: i dont even know if it will fit in car
[2024-10-30T19:04:38] haku: maybe borrow truck
[2024-10-30T19:22:13] haku: this looks like a good frame for peak g30 v2
[2024-10-30T19:29:00] Noname: Yeah but big wheels
[2024-10-30T19:29:21] haku: i think its 12
[2024-10-30T19:29:43] Noname: 12 is rim size for a bike?
[2024-10-30T19:29:48] haku: drum brakes though
[2024-10-30T19:30:13] haku: no tire size. my son 12" i believe
[2024-10-30T19:30:19] Noname: Not if you replace the rear motor
[2024-10-30T19:30:44] Noname: Then brake only
[2024-10-30T19:31:01] Noname: Could prob swap back to front
[2024-10-30T19:31:10] haku: true.
[2024-10-30T19:31:15] Noname: It's just a torque arm
[2024-10-30T19:31:58] haku: i will add this into the pipeline of projects. after rewiring laotie lol
[2024-10-30T19:32:34] haku: its just the rear looks sketch because no upper support
[2024-10-30T19:35:05] Noname: Na it's steel and short anyway
[2024-10-30T19:36:51] haku: p42 wepoor battery i bet would fit in that space in middle haha
[2024-10-30T19:36:52] Noname: Choose parallel motor cable
[2024-10-30T19:37:31] Noname: <photos/photo_19026@30-10-2024_19-37-31.jpg>

[2024-10-30T20:08:37] Noname: @Bradhaku Need matching wheels or your son grows up to be this guy.

[2024-10-30T20:21:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: My liking is not to have a big and ugly screen with huge pixels like if it were a cathode ray tube from the 90s. And lisp code are really not popular as well so to be something opensource he choice the wrong way, better to make project with Can message exchange like SmartDisplay or else, but with Opensource code
[2024-10-30T20:25:49] haku: my desk 😭 only use is to play minecraft, print and watch youtube. not even vesc
[2024-10-30T20:26:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: let's see the futur on the Vesc Display then
[2024-10-30T20:28:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i said it about let's see the futur of the soft for that display, if it can be interesting one day
[2024-10-30T20:31:41] William Tremblay: omg i can't believe i didn't realize that... Thank you!
[2024-10-30T20:32:03] William Tremblay: good to know thank you!
[2024-10-30T20:33:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: for you a Display with Lisp core and no documentation are easy to build ? all the coder i know refuse to touch of Lisp code, Even François who made the Smartdisplay dont want to touch at this and said it's basically a shit
[2024-10-30T20:33:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: so i trust them because i dont know coding
[2024-10-30T20:35:11] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: by the way it's more than a year Lisp are implemented in Vesc, do you know someone who using it ?
[2024-10-30T20:36:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes it's true for very small application, like adapting display protocol usually, except that nothing crazy
[2024-10-30T20:37:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: really
[2024-10-30T20:38:24] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ok
[2024-10-30T20:39:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yeah but VescExpress you plug and it work, no need to install lisp code to use then
[2024-10-30T20:40:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Ok
[2024-10-30T20:40:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: so, hope ppl with developping Vesc lisp feature so
[2024-10-30T20:41:23] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i guess too specific language
[2024-10-30T20:41:24] Andrei Albert: Lisps for vesc are the same as autocad like?
[2024-10-30T20:41:49] Andrei Albert: Autodesk
[2024-10-30T20:41:52] Andrei Albert: Cad program
[2024-10-30T20:43:23] Andrei Albert: I understand that
[2024-10-30T20:44:59] Andrei Albert: I have someone whose making me lisps for AutoCad that i use at work, basically shortcuts and other functionalities
[2024-10-30T20:45:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but yes Vesc Display are typically a Dev display, relativement cheap, ugly and not ready to use 😆
[2024-10-30T20:46:18] Andrei Albert: I use them since i was in uni 5 years ago
[2024-10-30T20:47:06] Andrei Albert: Tell me an ideea for a lisp, i can talk to my friend maybe he can do something
[2024-10-30T20:48:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: what's rt gui ?
[2024-10-30T20:49:52] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Ahh

[2024-10-31T04:55:46] Vesc Project Paradise: The French do not allow scooters with chains in their competition xD

[2024-10-31T12:13:54] Vesc Project Paradise: You really want to mount 11” motor?
[2024-10-31T12:14:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2024-10-31T12:14:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Want to fit this one
[2024-10-31T12:14:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's not 11 I think

[2024-10-31T13:00:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think that also because of my controllers/battery it's unnecessary to upgrade to more then 65h ?
[2024-10-31T13:00:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 84100 vesc and a60/28 8 c battery

[2024-10-31T17:23:23] Jansblog✨: Does someone know if the eggrider V2 works with Vesc?
[2024-10-31T17:24:49] NetworkDir: Are u sure your config like this?
[2024-10-31T17:44:28] haku: yes gear ratio and magnets correct but tire size 320mm

[2024-10-31T18:05:56] Rose: Hey there Luis, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-10-31T18:06:55] Luis: /start@MissRose_bot
[2024-10-31T18:06:55] Rose: Heya :) PM me if you have any questions on how to use me!
[2024-10-31T18:24:31] Luis: Hello folks, I am Luis, from Portuga, new on this group and with a question. I have a xiaomi pro 2, tunned with custom firmware SHFW , custom 48v20Ah, changed Amps so I can have a bit more torque and almost 50km/h top speed. I ve got another similar Scootech very cheap and now have a second motor, display, controller etc. I want to build a dual motor on my main pro 2 and after a lot of researching I dont really like having two displays and all the cable tricks to be able to use both motors. So I am researching other Solutions for dual motor and I am linking the VESC controllers like ubox flesky and similar. But I dont want to spend the amount of money I am seeing for the products, like 200euros or more for a dual controllers connected. Can I ask you what you sugest for me? I am inclined for a flipsky 75100 FOC 75v 100a (well more like two) but Maybe theres cheaper and similar options that you know is good value? Sorry the long text
[2024-10-31T18:25:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is it a bad brake
[2024-10-31T18:26:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I just smoked a 125cc on my zero10x the felling is crazy
[2024-10-31T18:27:44] Luis: For example this one?
[2024-10-31T18:28:19] Luis: <photos/photo_19052@31-10-2024_18-28-19.jpg>
[2024-10-31T18:28:58] Luis: Or something else?
[2024-10-31T18:29:12] NetworkDir: Hello luis! I don't recommend buying flipsky because mostly crap and bad quality :)
[2024-10-31T18:29:19] NetworkDir: Try dual mini spintend
[2024-10-31T18:29:22] haku: dual mini spintend
[2024-10-31T18:29:43] NetworkDir: https://spintend.com/collections/esc-based-on-vesc/products/dual-ubox-aluminum-controller-100v-100a-based-on-vesc?variant=44641129857176
[2024-10-31T18:29:53] NetworkDir: or buy 2x single https://spintend.com/collections/esc-based-on-vesc/products/single-ubox-aluminum-controller-100v-100a-based-on-vesc
[2024-10-31T18:30:00] Luis: I looked at that too
[2024-10-31T18:30:17] NetworkDir: best controller you can buy for your concept :)
[2024-10-31T18:30:22] Luis: If one brokes I have the second one
[2024-10-31T18:30:59] Luis: Thanks Will have that opinion high on my list
[2024-10-31T18:31:11] NetworkDir: makerbase and flipsky worstest brand for vesc controllers specially the 75100 seris (have a burn issue after battery cut off and etc ..)
[2024-10-31T18:32:23] Luis: Ok sometime I see someone complaining but thought that was already correntes
[2024-10-31T18:32:32] Luis: Fixed
[2024-10-31T18:33:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The 84100 works fine but other models are shit
[2024-10-31T18:33:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Especially that model
[2024-10-31T18:33:34] NetworkDir: On the new versions, they have improvements such as 84100hp But anyway, they call fake or poor quality components and this causes the control to dead by itself :)
[2024-10-31T18:33:47] Luis: Ooops ok
[2024-10-31T18:34:04] NetworkDir: Yes i see but anyway isn't 100% reliable :)
[2024-10-31T18:34:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I know nothing from them is
[2024-10-31T18:34:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But I get the man I also didn't have the money for a good one
[2024-10-31T18:35:36] NetworkDir: 125cc very ez for your zero :D
[2024-10-31T18:35:39] Luis: Ok so put that options away. Beside ubox, another similar pretender or not too much to look at?
[2024-10-31T18:35:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What he needs to do is buy a cheap one (not too cheap) get addicted to the vesc power then he locked into vesc and gets a spintend
[2024-10-31T18:36:28] Luis: Spintend? They dont have and entry level?
[2024-10-31T18:36:37] NetworkDir: On this segment of controllers i think you can't find better thing
[2024-10-31T18:36:39] Luis: Any
[2024-10-31T18:38:36] Luis: Ok so far ubox best solution Will take a look on that spintend to see what is about
[2024-10-31T18:39:21] NetworkDir: the ubox name of product and spintend brand name ubox for spintend
[2024-10-31T18:39:25] Luis: Sorry the dumb question but the AliExpress controllers are out of question right?
[2024-10-31T18:39:36] Luis: Ohh ok
[2024-10-31T18:40:04] NetworkDir: You mean chinese controllers?
[2024-10-31T18:40:10] Luis: Yeah
[2024-10-31T18:40:16] Luis: :)
[2024-10-31T18:40:30] Luis: Too crap?
[2024-10-31T18:41:31] NetworkDir: Yes :)
[2024-10-31T18:41:48] Luis: Just a question about your thoughts on them! Sometimes a gem is born and noone knowns about
[2024-10-31T18:43:43] Luis: Thanks for your opinions they are invaluable
[2024-10-31T18:47:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What scooter do u got ?
[2024-10-31T18:48:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but haven't tried yet
[2024-10-31T18:48:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Till today
[2024-10-31T18:53:23] Luis: Xiaomi pro 2, tunned to 25 amperes or almost and 48v battery. I am getting about 1200w from the motor and it runs really nice
[2024-10-31T18:54:46] Luis: But in steep hills …. I need much torque
[2024-10-31T18:55:10] Luis: So the dual mode experiment
[2024-10-31T18:58:08] Luis: And the vesc controllers looks awesome
[2024-10-31T19:07:44] haku: me and my boy need to go here. no surron boys just legit bikes and ebikes. https://www.youtube.com/live/SjCmFkV8vfY?si=hRH6JIEz9L8G3jid
[2024-10-31T19:09:35] haku: nvm its too dangerous for him. ill just bring the peak g30 amd join this group
[2024-10-31T19:14:39] Noname: Yeah kids in group rides turns into a couple guys surrounding the kid to block them from traffic and loosing the group
[2024-10-31T19:16:07] haku: i dont think they will allow the wepoor here. ill ask
[2024-10-31T19:17:47] haku: aparently there was one last night. dam i missed it
[2024-10-31T19:19:03] haku: with the wepoor battery i can prolly go there and back home at this speed. good range at slow speeds
[2024-10-31T19:25:49] Noname: And you sold the ebike lol
[2024-10-31T19:26:01] haku: hey do you know if zipties become brittle when cold? i noticed peak g30 battery zipties keep breaking
[2024-10-31T19:27:05] haku: i need to find an alternative to zipties. it has to be small like it but metal
[2024-10-31T19:27:07] Noname: Apparently they do dry out. Soak them in water I've heard, mabey store in a container. I've had bags of just useless ones from home depot
[2024-10-31T19:27:21] haku: dam
[2024-10-31T19:27:33] Noname: Velcro?
[2024-10-31T19:27:49] Noname: Hose clamps?
[2024-10-31T19:28:06] haku: hose clamps might work
[2024-10-31T19:28:15] Noname: U bolts?
[2024-10-31T19:28:34] haku: but hose clamps too thick.
[2024-10-31T19:28:44] haku: ill show you how i janked it later
[2024-10-31T19:28:55] Noname: H.F. has metal zip ties
[2024-10-31T19:29:37] haku: good idea. thats what i was looking for. its like a cable brake line yea? but with a clamp
[2024-10-31T19:30:23] haku: with 72v battery it will be heavier too 😭
[2024-10-31T19:42:36] haku: i wonder if there a trump victory group ride after nov5
[2024-10-31T19:42:46] Noname: <photos/photo_19053@31-10-2024_19-42-46.jpg>
[2024-10-31T19:43:30] haku: yes that it! thanks my guy. truly the tool world champ
[2024-10-31T19:44:07] haku: dam i cancelled prime. have to wait for ali 😭

[2024-10-31T19:44:23] Noname: Go to harbor freight
[2024-10-31T19:44:37] Noname: Fuck vegas is only 30mi wide
[2024-10-31T19:45:02] haku: if you include sister city henderson. its pretty big
[2024-10-31T19:46:26] Noname: They have idk what corner you live in that tiny city
[2024-10-31T19:47:20] haku: theres one close me. maybe 7miles away
[2024-10-31T19:48:14] Noname: Perfect ride for the g30 extreme or whatever
[2024-10-31T19:50:20] haku: peak g30. the pinnacle of g30 modifications. the final evolution of g30.
[2024-10-31T20:23:22] haku: this is the frame right here quad single axle LY
[2024-10-31T20:33:14] haku: dam this is cheap af and pretty good frame.
[2024-10-31T20:35:37] haku: no more purchases. just sell stuff. no room for all this crap
[2024-10-31T20:35:37] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-10-31T20:52:03] Pandalgns: made by myself 3d printed
[2024-10-31T20:52:09] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂😂
[2024-10-31T20:52:21] Pandalgns: Soy for speak in spanish in video
[2024-10-31T20:52:28] Pandalgns: But, como dedo en el culo
[2024-10-31T20:52:30] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-10-31T20:52:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Pandalgns has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-31T20:52:33] haku: nice job dude
[2024-10-31T20:54:33] haku: i like that you put the squares ontop to protect nickle strips
[2024-10-31T20:55:38] Pandalgns: to protect the nickel strips and to stop the cells
[2024-10-31T20:57:10] Pandalgns: The assembly of this holder consists of the two cell supports, a cover that covers all the nickel strips once soldered, some columns that are screwed between the two bases of the holder and a base for the bms
[2024-10-31T20:58:04] haku: very nice. never did a triangle battery. im sure its complicated.
[2024-10-31T20:58:25] haku: i need to learn that skill. and cad too
[2024-10-31T20:58:53] haku: since bikes are the prefered comuter here
[2024-10-31T21:00:53] Pandalgns: It is a little complicated to organize the series and parallels with this shape but the good thing I have is that with the printer and giving it a little thought I can get batteries in the shape I want, look how the holder would look more or less assembled
[2024-10-31T21:01:24] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2024-10-31T21:02:04] Pandalgns: The red base is to anchor the BMS there and the red mesh is to cover the nickel strips and protect them
[2024-10-31T21:02:34] haku: nice.
[2024-10-31T21:05:52] Pandalgns: thx bro
[2024-10-31T21:06:53] Pandalgns: If anyone needs a holder design to make batteries, contact me hehehe
[2024-10-31T21:36:46] Ion: Probably wrong place to ask but maybe someone knows. How hackable are Bosch ebikes? Can you get any meaningful improvement in terms of speed and acceleration?
[2024-10-31T21:37:02] Ion: Also preferably without those 200€ scam chips

[2024-10-31T22:30:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Scooter can't be shipped fully assembled to Israel ?
[2024-10-31T22:31:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Only if u have an importer license

[2024-11-01T02:41:37] Vesc Project Paradise: in these times I mean :)
[2024-11-01T02:42:57] haku: when motorcycle riders rest thier hand in thier hips amd riding 1 handed what does that mean Noname
[2024-11-01T02:44:13] Noname: They're old and sore
[2024-11-01T02:44:38] Noname: Or bored
[2024-11-01T02:55:16] haku: it looks cool so i copied it when they were all doing it
[2024-11-01T03:00:21] Noname: Bikers also rub their nipples sometimes when riding next ro cars
[2024-11-01T03:08:48] haku: noted. ill do that too
[2024-11-01T03:16:25] Vesc Project Paradise: you are becoming effeminate haku! It would be good if you started chewing tobacco.
[2024-11-01T03:23:21] haku: i am very ashamed and embarassed to say i vape. need to chew tobaco and a spit bottle
[2024-11-01T03:29:24] Vesc Project Paradise: 🫡
[2024-11-01T03:32:53] Noname: I bought a fag flute. Everytime I light a butt at work my boss comes by 3 seconds later 😆
[2024-11-01T03:35:47] Vesc Project Paradise: Anyway, I'd better keep my mouth shut and leave the party in peace.
[2024-11-01T03:38:28] haku: free speech baby. i dont get offended easy
[2024-11-01T03:39:51] Noname: Why He womanly?

[2024-11-01T04:38:42] haku: minibike like this with a vesc and a big midrive would be cool someday. https://youtu.be/UjAad0cpqS4?si=pDivCkz2-xpg1o4o
[2024-11-01T04:39:04] haku: but with suspension
[2024-11-01T05:00:59] Vesc Project Paradise: Something good about minibikes is also the space you have for batteries and controllers, which is usually quite large.
[2024-11-01T05:07:29] Vesc Project Paradise: around here the majority of electric ones are thin ones that fold
[2024-11-01T05:08:22] haku: same. sidewalk princess. bikelane bitches. i call em 😁
[2024-11-01T05:09:27] haku: but i do ride the sidewalks and bikelanes sometimes though. but we highway capable baby
[2024-11-01T05:11:00] Vesc Project Paradise: There are also many normal bicycles, people use them a lot, it is a perfect island for e-scooters but the laws do not allow it... very sad...
[2024-11-01T05:11:04] haku: my es3 and g30 will be a sidewalk princess. i wont make it fast
[2024-11-01T06:01:27] haku: how do i choose the correct weight for these shocks?
[2024-11-01T06:31:19] Vesc Project Paradise: For me all soft
[2024-11-01T06:31:55] Vesc Project Paradise: If you want really hard suspension
[2024-11-01T06:32:39] Vesc Project Paradise: The maximum LBS you can get , better !
[2024-11-01T06:51:34] Vesc Project Paradise: I say this because the search for harder and shorter suspensions for the Nami has been going on for a long time, and there are many users who have tried it without much success, in the end we chose to leave the original ones, in terms of offroad and comfort are superior, but if you like speed you have to look for that rigidity and hardness of the suspensions to gain stability, I have never tried the high-end air ones either.
[2024-11-01T07:22:44] Vesc Project Paradise: <sticker>

[2024-11-01T16:26:00] haku: ducatis are beautiful bikes. if i were to get one it be that. the one with the steel bars
[2024-11-01T16:28:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 🤣
[2024-11-01T16:29:40] Lieven L.: Many of them have great design. But the V2 engine with dry clutch makes them special. Unfortunately they won't make many tube frames anymore. Just to many disadvantages.
[2024-11-01T16:31:23] haku: oh i see. thats too bad. but still great bikes. the entry level one with tube frames is the one i like.
[2024-11-01T16:33:19] Lieven L.: I mean they still make them for looks but if you wont. Low weight they are not an option anymore

[2024-11-01T17:49:38] haku: like 4 cyl accord or something
[2024-11-01T17:50:00] GABE: Because they have a higher rev and are immune to heat.

[2024-11-01T19:56:26] haku: not at low amps. right?
[2024-11-01T19:56:45] haku: like 30-50a. ill check IR on motor
[2024-11-01T19:57:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2024-11-01T19:58:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: As you well know, I have a broken cam, I only connect to the rear controller and once I saw 22,000 watts plus the watts of the front one, it would be around 43 to 45 watts.
[2024-11-01T19:59:16] haku: oh wow!
[2024-11-01T19:59:32] haku: on 33x2?
[2024-11-01T19:59:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: will propel you to over 150km/h
[2024-11-01T19:59:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2024-11-01T20:00:12] haku: crazy

[2024-11-01T20:01:15] Paolo ⁭: You can see from bms
[2024-11-01T20:01:31] haku: dam! you prolly 2nd worlds fastest then
[2024-11-01T20:01:34] Paolo ⁭: This app is very very inaccurate
[2024-11-01T20:01:51] haku: gps though yea
[2024-11-01T20:01:57] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: that was a long time ago
[2024-11-01T20:02:09] 'lekrsu': I imagine it takes gps / time and gps is spotty xD
[2024-11-01T20:02:25] 'lekrsu': *teleporting across town*
[2024-11-01T20:02:31] haku: whats a accurate app for gps
[2024-11-01T20:02:50] 'lekrsu': 🥰
[2024-11-01T20:03:20] 'lekrsu': That's what happens if I run 70A phase at full speed across town for a couple minutes
[2024-11-01T20:03:22] haku: is this you?
[2024-11-01T20:03:29] 'lekrsu': yes
[2024-11-01T20:03:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_19088@01-11-2024_20-03-32.jpg>
[2024-11-01T20:04:04] haku: did it fry the motor? im paranoid about this
[2024-11-01T20:04:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We can achieve more, we just need more straight line
[2024-11-01T20:04:19] Paolo ⁭: No gps is good but the referesh rate is very low, because is intended for long ride then save phone battery
[2024-11-01T20:04:22] 'lekrsu': Fixed a Xiaomi 1S, and oh my god, it's weak. 20km/h up hills where my G2 goes 50+
[2024-11-01T20:04:50] 'lekrsu': But 1S is so nice for what they are, hit 45kmh on stock parts 😁, needed to take it out for a spin to check if it worked
[2024-11-01T20:04:51] haku: gotcha. so draggy is the only legit form then. too bad its pricey
[2024-11-01T20:05:19] 'lekrsu': No, rotor barley hot.
[2024-11-01T20:05:33] 'lekrsu': Don't have actual specs to tune ntc by
[2024-11-01T20:06:32] haku: how do you check bms for speed
[2024-11-01T20:06:56] haku: enlighten me sir paolo. i need wise words
[2024-11-01T20:07:18] 'lekrsu': wattage not speed 😁
[2024-11-01T20:07:29] haku: oh i see.
[2024-11-01T20:07:48] haku: i have to record mine. but ive seen it pull 300+ a
[2024-11-01T20:08:13] haku: maybe more. im not sure
[2024-11-01T20:10:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you want I can send you a file so that it reaches 31
[2024-11-01T20:11:03] 'lekrsu': Haha no, I'm involved with SHFW. I know damn well how to tune the Ninebot manufactured models.
[2024-11-01T20:11:24] 'lekrsu': I rode 45 km/h on it
[2024-11-01T20:11:56] haku: help me with my es3 my guy. esc arriving soon 😁
[2024-11-01T20:12:08] haku: lets hack that badboy
[2024-11-01T20:12:13] 'lekrsu': Esx parts are weak, wouldn't buy 😁
[2024-11-01T20:12:41] haku: well ill just fix it and flip it. hopefully i can sell it
[2024-11-01T20:13:03] 'lekrsu': You can try out https://github.com/lekrsu/shfw-walkthrough/blob/main/README.md#ninebot-esx-ex
[2024-11-01T20:13:55] haku: dam thats computer programming stuff. i dont have a higher education for that
[2024-11-01T20:15:02] 'lekrsu': It's for those that don't wanna think
[2024-11-01T20:15:10] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-11-01T20:15:35] Paolo ⁭: I mean power
[2024-11-01T20:21:09] haku: oh boy. i feel the jank already. i love it.
[2024-11-01T20:27:43] Noname: Just tighten lock
[2024-11-01T20:28:05] Noname: Or the pin hinge needs larger pin
[2024-11-01T20:29:01] haku: thanks. dismantle it and see whats going on
[2024-11-01T20:29:30] haku: my last ebike has the same handles. too bad i gave it away when i sold it
[2024-11-01T20:33:29] haku: dam im looking at motor options. lets see first how many batteries can fit.
[2024-11-01T20:34:43] haku: the stock jetson bolt motor can go to the peak g30. so it evens the tire size.
[2024-11-01T20:39:08] haku: your 10" qs motor might actually fit hehe
[2024-11-01T20:39:08] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-01T20:48:02] Noname: It's very W I D E
[2024-11-01T20:48:51] Noname: 230mm drop out
[2024-11-01T20:49:08] Noname: Weighs more than that bike
[2024-11-01T20:52:34] haku: dam that sucks. only option is scooter motors then. ill prolly just keep it stock motor and 72v and vesc. i have another spare 6fet
[2024-11-01T20:53:16] haku: the battery area is shaped weird like a bean. who came up with that idea. genius
[2024-11-01T20:53:49] haku: i feel like the its the same guy who designed the es3 designed this too
[2024-11-01T20:59:52] sombre_enfant: True
[2024-11-01T21:04:59] Noname: Because Who cares when battery is tiny
[2024-11-01T21:05:31] haku: dam. is that 10s?
[2024-11-01T21:06:00] haku: looks like the same size as my 10s. i need to try
[2024-11-01T21:06:05] Noname: 36v 6ah
[2024-11-01T21:07:45] haku: but in that bean configuration can prolly fit a folded 20s
[2024-11-01T21:08:20] haku: or 60v atleast
[2024-11-01T21:09:46] Noname: Waste. Use for dog walker
[2024-11-01T21:10:58] haku: eh. its a nice bike to go to the park and fold. just need paint. can finally ride with my boy in parks
[2024-11-01T21:10:59] Noname: Or when kid grows a bit
[2024-11-01T21:11:14] haku: agreed
[2024-11-01T21:11:58] haku: it was going to be the es3 or g30 for parks but this one has a seat son. no upgrades needed
[2024-11-01T21:13:08] haku: i dont need to hurry up the g30 anymore. can wait. still in the pipeline though. for da boys
[2024-11-01T21:14:25] haku: projects. beaner bike> laotie assembly> es3> g30
[2024-11-01T21:18:28] haku: here 20s 3p haha.
[2024-11-01T21:18:29] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-11-01T21:34:21] haku: heres the current king of the jetson bolts. we need a vesc one. this one sabvoton
[2024-11-01T21:34:41] haku: watercooled and everything
[2024-11-01T21:35:30] Noname: Oh good lord what is that thing, quick go to church for bad thoughts
[2024-11-01T21:36:30] Noname: The bike version of the super busy looking scooter world
[2024-11-01T21:36:39] haku: that thing hit 80mph. guy said. idk if legit but the setup looks like it can do it
[2024-11-01T21:36:50] Noname: Stock motor?
[2024-11-01T21:37:02] haku: no i think
[2024-11-01T21:37:16] Noname: Yeah all set with that
[2024-11-01T21:38:39] haku: dude theres a whole community for this minibike wtf
[2024-11-01T21:39:36] Noname: Not surprised.
[2024-11-01T21:46:16] haku: folks say motor can handle 30a at 72v but watch temps haha
[2024-11-01T21:47:55] haku: we gonna make it all internal with vesc baby.
[2024-11-01T21:47:56] 'lekrsu': bomb controller, 🔫
[2024-11-01T21:48:16] haku: thats that old school
[2024-11-01T21:48:28] haku: sabvoton 72150 i think
[2024-11-01T21:48:30] 'lekrsu': *Lets buy another controller to increase amperage from 10A to 30A!!!*
[2024-11-01T21:48:33] 'lekrsu': I need vodka
[2024-11-01T21:48:42] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-11-01T21:49:24] haku: you know what. the 40t battery is perfect fit if i bag it infront like this lol
[2024-11-01T21:51:17] Noname: For test yeah, external shit is whack though.
[2024-11-01T21:52:20] Noname: After test sell to me cheap because used
[2024-11-01T21:59:25] haku: ahaha
[2024-11-01T22:00:21] haku: guys even sell stls for a bigger battery compartment dam. this bike is serious
[2024-11-01T22:01:20] haku: its a money sinkhole though. im just using parts that i have
[2024-11-01T22:01:34] haku: hoarded 😜
[2024-11-01T22:03:23] haku: so hyped right now. good score
[2024-11-01T22:03:24] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-01T22:04:53] 'lekrsu': hypee
[2024-11-01T22:07:46] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Looks thats it's getting time to look for other motors ... the GT ones cant be pushed harder without cooking them .... https://youtu.be/YB-rnpboUX8
[2024-11-01T22:08:32] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): 4 $ale a Kidney ... little bit worn out by Booze ... but a rub and shine and it's as new ....
[2024-11-01T22:10:10] haku: this the current king of the gt series yea
[2024-11-01T22:27:17] Finn: Ubox lite ?
[2024-11-01T22:28:37] Finn: Whats your DC Amps at Peak?
[2024-11-01T22:29:37] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): 55-60 per motor (pack is max 120A)
[2024-11-01T22:29:55] Finn: Thats pretty efficient
[2024-11-01T22:30:55] Finn: Maybe you should display Real Time Data from vesc.
[2024-11-01T22:31:27] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Log file to that trip (+ more as video is just a cutout) (part of 750-1250 seconds is rougly the part in the video)
[2024-11-01T22:31:57] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): See log :) ... cant overlay it in video as i had no screen record active
[2024-11-01T22:32:07] Finn: Gotcha
[2024-11-01T22:32:11] 'lekrsu': How much phase?
[2024-11-01T22:32:53] Andrei Albert: Lets get to workkk
[2024-11-01T22:34:32] haku: the regular 6fet if it fits
[2024-11-01T22:34:35] Finn: Chungus controlla
[2024-11-01T22:35:08] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Set was about 160 140 per motor but see only peaks of about 100
[2024-11-01T22:35:31] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): <photos/photo_19094@01-11-2024_22-35-31.jpg>
[2024-11-01T22:35:38] haku: thats 350 battery amps yea?
[2024-11-01T22:37:18] Finn: Are the Batt cables awg 10?
[2024-11-01T22:37:49] Apo: do these fit into magura mt5 or are they too thicc?
[2024-11-01T22:39:18] Noname: Idk? Just posting cool stuff
[2024-11-01T22:39:42] Apo: ah i thought u might know, cuz im running maguras and i wonder if these will fit without much issues
[2024-11-01T22:44:54] haku: this deserves magura. sad about red wheels but beggars cant be choosers.
[2024-11-01T23:31:45] 'lekrsu': nice
[2024-11-01T23:58:48] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: How much S is your battery?
[2024-11-02T00:03:27] Noname: Damn kinda far away. I'll wait it out for a lowball offer
[2024-11-02T00:07:21] haku: went to my old hood today. 20miles away.
[2024-11-02T00:07:59] haku: thats a steal dude
[2024-11-02T00:08:51] Noname: Freaking meowtains are cool
[2024-11-02T00:27:05] haku: las vegas strip in the background. we in a different city baby.

[2024-11-02T02:53:38] haku: is this it @jamaludin_algarnati. the non garage build "hyperscooters"? https://alienrides.com/products/rion-apex-fastest-electric-scooter
[2024-11-02T02:54:26] haku: 9k i rather have a fleet of wepoors tbh
[2024-11-02T02:54:53] Noname: I'd rather build my own
[2024-11-02T02:56:01] haku: for 9k you can get a used ducati.
[2024-11-02T02:56:28] haku: 9k also will build you an insane emoto
[2024-11-02T02:57:09] haku: or minibike or scooter
[2024-11-02T02:57:24] Vesc Project Paradise: Hyper scooter
[2024-11-02T02:58:00] haku: what makes this so special? rion controllers?
[2024-11-02T02:58:12] haku: motor?
[2024-11-02T02:58:31] haku: or made in USA?
[2024-11-02T02:59:29] Vesc Project Paradise: I was surprised that Jonh Richardson found wobbles in his driving, therefore it is not completely stable. He said that a steering damper is needed, and that Leo was already working on it, I don't know if it was the steering damper or the steering damper. scooter geometry
[2024-11-02T02:59:34] Vesc Project Paradise: Yes
[2024-11-02T02:59:41] Vesc Project Paradise: Motor LY
[2024-11-02T03:00:03] Vesc Project Paradise: Also can’t push safe more than 200A with 4mm phase
[2024-11-02T03:02:21] Vesc Project Paradise: <sticker>
[2024-11-02T03:02:21] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Vesc Project Paradise has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-02T03:03:02] haku: what ly motor 80h? watercooled?
[2024-11-02T03:05:04] haku: 4mm phase is small isnt it?
[2024-11-02T03:05:19] haku: big fat wires better from what i was told
[2024-11-02T03:05:59] Vesc Project Paradise: Haku 60h 22/3
[2024-11-02T03:08:09] Vesc Project Paradise: and of course it is not a competition or racing scooter, people who understand engines have really already said on the one hand that they are good and light and on the other hand that the Rion engines are good but outside of competition
[2024-11-02T03:08:58] haku: i see. so its a luxury scooter then
[2024-11-02T03:10:26] haku: i would consider the price it if all parts made in US. but dam china parts for 10k
[2024-11-02T03:10:32] Vesc Project Paradise: I also have to say that I was lucky enough to try the carbon one and put it at maximum speed and I did not find any wobbles of any kind, it will be the Apex that has them.
[2024-11-02T03:11:00] Vesc Project Paradise: but for expensive scooters I would stay velity or momen
[2024-11-02T03:12:13] haku: till today is rion still a scam? or they dont do that anymore?
[2024-11-02T03:15:34] Vesc Project Paradise: They are making the Rion Apex
[2024-11-02T03:16:00] haku: isnt that the apex i linked
[2024-11-02T03:16:07] Vesc Project Paradise: Leo Apex hyperscooter new name
[2024-11-02T03:16:14] Vesc Project Paradise: No more Rion
[2024-11-02T03:16:27] haku: oh i see
[2024-11-02T03:17:31] haku: i gotta say that apex looks very elegant though. maybe because no paint
[2024-11-02T03:17:51] Vesc Project Paradise: https://leopev.com/products/rion-apex%e2%84%a2-hyperscooter
[2024-11-02T03:19:12] haku: it looks like a modified g30 frame. maybe thats why i like it
[2024-11-02T03:19:23] Vesc Project Paradise: a lot of controversy with the American scooter😂
[2024-11-02T03:19:55] haku: is it because its a scam? or because performance?
[2024-11-02T03:21:19] Vesc Project Paradise: It has had a bad reputation since its inception and now with the wobbles of instability it is already complete
[2024-11-02T03:21:40] Finn: 24s and only 123kph?
[2024-11-02T03:22:00] Vesc Project Paradise: but the tronic x12 work very well and are very small!
[2024-11-02T03:22:25] Vesc Project Paradise: 130 can..
[2024-11-02T03:22:38] Finn: Hm quite slow for 24s no?
[2024-11-02T03:22:47] Vesc Project Paradise: But don’t forget is just 22/3
[2024-11-02T03:22:49] Finn: 22x3 can do dual 20s 115kmh
[2024-11-02T03:22:58] Finn: So its quite bad lol
[2024-11-02T03:24:02] Vesc Project Paradise: The limit of the motor is the limit of the motor, it does not have speed motors but the acceleration, which is what it is based on, is very good.
[2024-11-02T03:24:16] haku: tbh the rion buissness looks like a money laundering operation
[2024-11-02T03:24:29] Finn: Yes
[2024-11-02T03:24:42] Finn: Ai generated scooter😂😂
[2024-11-02T03:26:27] haku: oh i see. now i remember. those are motors you have so you know it well
[2024-11-02T03:27:04] haku: what is max temps on these motors?
[2024-11-02T03:27:25] Vesc Project Paradise: 4mm phase ?
[2024-11-02T03:27:38] Vesc Project Paradise: 180/200
[2024-11-02T03:27:59] haku: you have that same exact motor yea? winding and magnet size
[2024-11-02T03:29:09] Vesc Project Paradise: Let's see, you could raise the A phase for a moment to give them some strong starts, but it is clear that to drive daily with the scooter and push it to the limit, you cannot because the phases are very thin, they told me A for safe phase 180/ 200 max
[2024-11-02T03:29:48] Vesc Project Paradise: So need to buy new LY engines
[2024-11-02T03:29:53] haku: i see. idk why rion chose this motor then.
[2024-11-02T03:30:08] Vesc Project Paradise: I like momen and velilty because they have 👍

[2024-11-02T12:16:15] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Not same
[2024-11-02T12:16:18] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: so far not haha
[2024-11-02T12:17:13] Vesc Project Paradise: Crazy good the x12
[2024-11-02T12:17:42] Vesc Project Paradise: I want to see working 18 seven..
[2024-11-02T12:17:44] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and 3 hall on phase are advantage for low inductor motor and silent HFI fonction
[2024-11-02T12:18:11] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and also more efficient not power loose on shunt so
[2024-11-02T12:18:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: good design the X12
[2024-11-02T12:18:38] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's funny Tronic make very shit one long time, and then make very good one haha
[2024-11-02T12:18:47] Vesc Project Paradise: Good goal for Tronic system
[2024-11-02T12:18:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: not many controllers, juste one shit and then one very good xD
[2024-11-02T12:18:52] Vesc Project Paradise: 🤲
[2024-11-02T12:19:14] Vesc Project Paradise: You can get and try them
[2024-11-02T12:19:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Too expansive for me, but i suppose that it's very good one
[2024-11-02T12:19:44] Vesc Project Paradise: Also Julien ,,
[2024-11-02T12:22:52] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's 500$ with shipping for just the PCB, it's the price for expansive parts so but not my budgets
[2024-11-02T12:23:55] Vesc Project Paradise: The other day Julien asked me if I was the one who made the SEVEN controllers, I guess because I had a photo of them on my profile xD
[2024-11-02T12:24:58] Vesc Project Paradise: I could see it answered, if I am the same! how many do you want
[2024-11-02T12:25:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: if i have cl350.v 4 just connect the brake led
[2024-11-02T12:27:46] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: SEVEN 18 ?
[2024-11-02T12:27:49] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i never saw the design
[2024-11-02T12:28:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but the bigger one seem to be based on MP2 project so far 😆
[2024-11-02T12:28:42] Vesc Project Paradise: Bigger one same feet than x12
[2024-11-02T12:29:02] Vesc Project Paradise: 18seven not… but is 18 I don’t know..
[2024-11-02T12:30:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes it's white for the 30 one Mosfet Number & Type: 30 Infineon TOLT (331A - voltage dependent).
[2024-11-02T12:30:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but it's not very impressive when C1000 are also 30 mosfets for 1000A phase 1200 setpoint when the Seven are juste 950 setpoint pity
[2024-11-02T12:31:48] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no case, not waterproof, not 12v 5V integrated but much more expansive, then Seven have not advantage about it
[2024-11-02T12:32:56] Vesc Project Paradise: But do you think SEVEN18 can work better than Tronic x12..?
[2024-11-02T12:35:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: More power probably, it's 18 mos toll, 750A setpoint, yes it's more powerfull than X12 but also more big, i dont know if it's IMS and with hall sensor or no, but if it's TOLL on IMS we can imagine can using it at 600A at répétition without issues, but i dont know if the design is good or not i dont know this brand never saw any of them
[2024-11-02T12:36:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Depend wish V4 😆
[2024-11-02T12:37:28] Vesc Project Paradise: also a good size for your thunder frame :)
[2024-11-02T12:38:42] Vesc Project Paradise: Continuos current 400A…
[2024-11-02T12:38:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i have my own project for my own =)
[2024-11-02T12:40:51] Vesc Project Paradise: And the championship that they say was won by a guy with Alu ubox...? XD
[2024-11-02T12:41:15] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no by R350 who are not basic Alu ubox
[2024-11-02T12:41:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's modified Alu ubox by me
[2024-11-02T12:42:20] Vesc Project Paradise: <sticker>
[2024-11-02T12:42:24] Vesc Project Paradise: ;)
[2024-11-02T12:43:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yeah
[2024-11-02T12:43:42] Vesc Project Paradise: However, the best scooter in the competition has a c350 x)
[2024-11-02T12:44:25] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: if you want one Team try with Alu ubox you have Fastride, they blow up the controller on track so many times 😆
[2024-11-02T12:44:59] Vesc Project Paradise: What ?
[2024-11-02T12:45:08] Vesc Project Paradise: They start using VESC ?
[2024-11-02T12:45:14] Vesc Project Paradise: I can’t believe
[2024-11-02T12:45:16] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: depend how you classify besc scooter, the 1 and 2 at the french competition has R350, the 3 and 4 has C350
[2024-11-02T12:45:21] Vesc Project Paradise: They are Kelly lover
[2024-11-02T12:45:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: at final, it's very equal, 12 mos Toll on IMS, not such design
[2024-11-02T12:45:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: same performance, 400A phase, more than 250 battery
[2024-11-02T12:46:27] Vesc Project Paradise: I only talk about the things I hear and read, but all with love and a lot of humor xD
[2024-11-02T12:47:12] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes they start, the boss contact me for controllers when i was working on R350, and when i saw it the Spinted modified, he did not trust me and buy direct Spinted and installed it on all his pilot, all blow up them controllers on track 😆
[2024-11-02T12:47:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: And after i put the G300 on my webside 1 month after they all buyed G300 and used it 😆
[2024-11-02T12:48:44] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: But i not using that one because it's not IMS and then even if it's 18 mos it's have less continious current capacity than my R350 due of the Thermal heat
[2024-11-02T12:50:20] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: And some of them Also blow the G300 like Aymar with Ambrosini and others it's funny to see them always trying to copy and say they are better and failing miserably on track
[2024-11-02T12:51:05] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 🆁aphaël has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-02T12:51:47] Vesc Project Paradise: I still reading xD ..

[2024-11-02T12:53:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: oh i was muted haha
[2024-11-02T12:54:04] Vesc Project Paradise: I want to build ubox 85/250 soon given my battery and it won't be until I build the thunder project, when I use the ungovernable ones
[2024-11-02T12:54:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Original 85/250 perform well on 20S max without regen
[2024-11-02T12:55:08] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but dont try more than 20S with Spinted version you will just loose money
[2024-11-02T12:55:20] Vesc Project Paradise: interesting stories from the world of competition
[2024-11-02T12:55:21] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and damage your scooter with the fire
[2024-11-02T12:55:42] Vesc Project Paradise: Yes just 20s
[2024-11-02T12:59:00] Vesc Project Paradise: How much do you think from your experience is the maximum that 85/250 can sustain continuously both off-piste and off-piste? A batt A phase
[2024-11-02T13:00:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Continious it's do not exist but something like 200A phase 150A batt probably
[2024-11-02T13:00:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but in peak 400A phase 260A battery
[2024-11-02T13:00:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: in your own risk of course
[2024-11-02T13:04:00] Vesc Project Paradise: but I'm talking about the maximum configurable in vesc tool
[2024-11-02T13:04:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Spinted one i dont remember, i make my own firmware
[2024-11-02T13:05:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: by the way OEM firm not allow 20S lol, it's limited at 83v maximum
[2024-11-02T13:05:22] Vesc Project Paradise: Maybe 350 for phase and 200 batt I don’t know
[2024-11-02T13:07:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no they dont allow 350 that sure
[2024-11-02T13:07:16] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 300 if i remember
[2024-11-02T13:07:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but anyway, you will need use no limit firm and say bye bye to any warranty
[2024-11-02T13:07:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that's why they make 83v max xD
[2024-11-02T13:08:54] Vesc Project Paradise: I know for my battery I can push 150A per controller , but phase 200A Max until I change the motors
[2024-11-02T13:09:16] Vesc Project Paradise: With the thunder proyect I try to do everything perfect
[2024-11-02T13:09:32] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Many OEM motors yeah 200A phase are like OEM controller and large enough
[2024-11-02T13:09:44] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Nami or Dualtron are 200A phase
[2024-11-02T13:10:05] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: combined with good battery value it's same torque but more power
[2024-11-02T13:18:09] Vesc Project Paradise: My battery is 20s10p 40t And my motor 60h 22/3 Rion type
[2024-11-02T13:18:50] Vesc Project Paradise: <sticker>
[2024-11-02T13:18:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you can up 250A

[2024-11-02T13:23:00] Vesc Project Paradise: Your brown one ?
[2024-11-02T13:26:40] Vesc Project Paradise: In the same way, these kinds of covers give meaning to my life xD
[2024-11-02T13:27:28] sombre_enfant: Anybody know why marking of tire on moped scooter are that way would it be great for e scooter ?
[2024-11-02T13:56:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I don't know where I read 12v 3A
[2024-11-02T13:56:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: but I only use one LED as a brake light from the controller for the rains I use a voltage reducer
[2024-11-02T13:57:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it was so far false
[2024-11-02T13:57:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you can consider C350 have not 12v, except the last one Babibel adding double regulator, one for the controller and one for the user with at least 1A capacity (maybe less i did not tested it)
[2024-11-02T13:58:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: understood
[2024-11-02T14:01:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Before doing the new installation I turned on all the lights powered by the voltage reducer in the BMS it showed me a consumption of 0.46 A from there I thought of connecting only the brake LED to the controller and the lights to the voltage reducer. I've been like this for two or three days, so far no problems.
[2024-11-02T14:01:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: should be ok
[2024-11-02T14:02:09] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: remove the plastic cover and take picture of your C350 and i will told you wish one you have
[2024-11-02T14:02:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: take everything apart? nooooo hahaha
[2024-11-02T14:03:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no, just 4 plastic screw
[2024-11-02T14:10:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: not only disassemble the battery, remove the cable cover.... it's a Nami
[2024-11-02T14:10:52] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ah ok
[2024-11-02T14:10:59] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: so, connect, you will see
[2024-11-02T14:11:21] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 0.4A should be ok
[2024-11-02T14:14:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It is an LED like a brake light, the ones have very little consumption, I don't think it reaches more than 0.2 a
[2024-11-02T14:15:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you undervaluate led so far 😆 My rear light is 18W wish is 1.5A and ma front light 25W wish is 2A in 12V
[2024-11-02T14:16:08] Face de Pin Sucé: He has latest
[2024-11-02T14:16:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Ok then 1.2A claim by Babibel, should be enough for one rear light led
[2024-11-02T14:17:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: This is the LED that is only used 10cm
[2024-11-02T14:17:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 2,35€ | Tira de luces LED COB impermeable IP68, cinta de neón Flexible, 12V, 24V, 320LEDs/m, 0,5 m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 20m, blanco, azul, rojo, Rosa https://a.aliexpress.com/_EII3YQp
[2024-11-02T14:19:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: It's white here, 6~10W per meter
[2024-11-02T14:20:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: all the lights on I have a consumption of 0.46 and I only connected the LED to the controller that only the LED will not even reach 0.5
[2024-11-02T14:20:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Red

[2024-11-02T15:24:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: C700 and 1000 are now with 3 Hall phase typology
[2024-11-02T15:27:09] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: No many versions had low side shunt
[2024-11-02T15:27:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Firt version had 2 Hall on phase, after he passed on low side shunt, many version, and now it's again 3 phase hall typology
[2024-11-02T15:28:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Low side shunt are more cheap and easy to do
[2024-11-02T15:29:05] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: depend for what, for all my application Low side shunt perform perfecly
[2024-11-02T15:30:02] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: BTW Torp 500 G300 Spinted Flipsky C350 Old C700 and 1000 Use low side Shunt, and it work perfect
[2024-11-02T15:33:59] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i never played with good phase hall typology, i dont think it was be a miracle on HFI mode, HFI are still far from hall sensor for big hub motor or Escooter
[2024-11-02T15:34:21] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: so for this application i am not sure have 3 phase current sense change anything
[2024-11-02T15:35:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: That's the only bénéfit of 3 phase mesure, with low motor inductor but i dont know what is low inductor motor ? and the last one is to have more FOC frequency for high speed motor, i have not high speed motor
[2024-11-02T15:37:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Even on bike, at least it turn at like 10k Rpm maximum maximum for 5 poles, not that much ERPM
[2024-11-02T15:39:35] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i saw pictures but never try, btw i dont like the design, normal it's flipsky 😆
[2024-11-02T15:40:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i dont want pay to try, i did it for the new MKS and i loose more than 200€ for nothing so i'm done with the test of shit

[2024-11-02T17:56:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And it's no good ?
[2024-11-02T18:03:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What's this one. ?

[2024-11-02T18:05:34] Andrei Albert: Still victor
[2024-11-02T18:05:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Still doesn't ring a bell is he an Israeli guy ?
[2024-11-02T18:05:56] Andrei Albert: Yes, the nucular guy
[2024-11-02T18:06:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I have to know him
[2024-11-02T18:16:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Dawm shit not, Dualtron 1 Fuck dualtron 2 🖕
[2024-11-02T18:16:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: And there are so far not dualtron anymore, have more not dualtron parts than dualtron parts
[2024-11-02T18:18:21] Andrei Albert: You dont like the thunder 2?
[2024-11-02T18:21:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://www.minimotors-nyc.com/products/dualtron-thunder-frame-only?variant=40502013165638
[2024-11-02T18:21:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is that expensive?
[2024-11-02T18:21:57] haku: we need to spread the vesc olive branch to this community. they need to learn the ways
[2024-11-02T18:22:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also motors are a problem to import to here besides the fact that I'll need better ones and maybe a bigger deck if it exists
[2024-11-02T18:24:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @albeeeerttttt if you could get another chasy would you chose different?
[2024-11-02T18:51:54] Apo: Hey :D
[2024-11-02T18:52:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Only good in straights
[2024-11-02T18:54:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But it is good u gotta to admit it
[2024-11-02T18:56:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I doubt u don't know but this is the maker account https://www.instagram.com/pevmadness?igsh=aW02NGZjNTRrMGRk
[2024-11-02T19:08:24] haku: for anyone that used this suspension. is it possible to remove that spacer in the side of the hole?
[2024-11-02T19:09:57] Andrei Albert: Mm idk honestly, I’ll improve this one
[2024-11-02T19:10:21] Andrei Albert: Better higher hinge, column, long body
[2024-11-02T19:11:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: by the way i can't say like Thunder, Thunder it's motor controller deck tube everything on thunder i like juste 6~10 parts from all the scooters, only the main frame parts from Thunder 1, the rest not so far
[2024-11-02T19:11:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Long body hard on turns no ?
[2024-11-02T19:12:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What u saying is the nothing is og/new expet the deck ?
[2024-11-02T19:12:49] Andrei Albert: The chassis yes
[2024-11-02T19:13:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If there is parts for hinge get them it's important
[2024-11-02T19:13:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And when u say column what part is it ?
[2024-11-02T19:13:40] Andrei Albert: Thats the problem, its not, i gotta make one
[2024-11-02T19:14:29] Andrei Albert: Only the thunder one has good replacement parts
[2024-11-02T19:18:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ken parts ?
[2024-11-02T19:18:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He is also a bit expensive
[2024-11-02T19:18:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It'll be hard to sell the zero10x
[2024-11-02T19:55:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @albeeeerttttt my only problem with all of the dualtrons is the suspension format why all of them are hard af and a pain in the ahole to change
[2024-11-02T20:08:42] Apo: yes
[2024-11-02T20:09:19] Apo: but underneath is a sleeve where the rod goes thru
[2024-11-02T20:09:26] Apo: so what do you plan on doing after removing it?
[2024-11-02T20:13:27] haku: ima install it on the wepoor.
[2024-11-02T20:13:50] haku: pos suspension
[2024-11-02T20:14:25] haku: hopefully it fits if i get the 150mm version
[2024-11-02T20:39:00] haku: would it fit you guys think? its a necessary upgrade
[2024-11-02T20:43:21] haku: <video_file>
[2024-11-02T20:43:22] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-02T21:05:42] GABE: mp2 is supposed to be 10cm tall but its actually less than 9cm because Zuna fitted it vertically into the frame
[2024-11-02T21:06:09] GABE: dunno why it's spread around it's 100x70
[2024-11-02T21:07:39] haku: show photo and dimensions
[2024-11-02T21:07:59] GABE: saw the pic
[2024-11-02T21:08:05] GABE: but can't find it In logs anymore
[2024-11-02T21:08:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2024-11-02T21:08:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_19127@02-11-2024_21-08-13.jpg>
[2024-11-02T21:08:14] GABE: Zuna posted it
[2024-11-02T21:08:22] haku: ive never seen a mp2. show
[2024-11-02T21:08:26] GABE: I've asked him but he hasn't responded in days
[2024-11-02T21:08:50] GABE: fits PERFECTLY
[2024-11-02T21:08:53] GABE: like it was made for it.
[2024-11-02T21:09:08] GABE: Means 22s2p all internal is possible with ebrake
[2024-11-02T21:09:54] GABE: instead of risking 22s ebrake
[2024-11-02T21:09:54] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-02T21:10:04] haku: 2p where you going? the corner store?
[2024-11-02T21:10:42] haku: daym. thats single motor?
[2024-11-02T21:11:30] haku: you cannot outrun the police with that range little outlaw
[2024-11-02T21:12:07] GABE: It's 650wh.
[2024-11-02T21:12:18] GABE: On a 250w high speed motor.
[2024-11-02T21:12:46] GABE: To put in perspective a 300w gave me 40km range with 800wh Switching to an 800w motor reduced it to 12km lolz
[2024-11-02T21:13:03] GABE: I expect 35km range atleast on this one at 70kmh no FWK at all if im lucky, it'll be like my previous scooter with FWK. Fwk makes the stator heat X 150% so less heat issues
[2024-11-02T21:14:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes motor rear
[2024-11-02T21:15:13] haku: lawd. i cant wait to see dual motor values. thats insanity
[2024-11-02T21:16:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Fron motor but when the wheel spins the watts do not increase and do not generate force
[2024-11-02T21:18:47] GABE: the reason I'm going mp2 route is for safe ebrake haha and 24s could work with the 6 21700s under the esc in a gay asss position, so 700wh all internal ig
[2024-11-02T21:19:58] haku: 30 40kw is crazy standing up. is that the new standard/bar now to be considered fast?
[2024-11-02T21:20:19] haku: 20kw is so 2022?
[2024-11-02T21:25:22] haku: cool man! lets see it baby. when is eta and unveiling date?
[2024-11-02T21:26:35] haku: dont make the same mistake as me and took a year to build alright
[2024-11-02T21:26:43] haku: fans are waiting.
[2024-11-02T21:26:44] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-02T21:29:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 20 thousand W is very good too
[2024-11-02T21:29:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's like MotoGP before 500cc now 800cc hehe
[2024-11-02T21:30:52] haku: electric just keeps on improving. batteries and controllers. we are just at its infancy right now i think
[2024-11-02T21:30:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When I go a few days without using the scooter, when I use it again I get scared 🤣🤣🤣
[2024-11-02T21:31:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I think the same, there is still a lot to improve, you can always improve something that already works very, very well.
[2024-11-02T21:32:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: My friends ask me but I tell them if they want to kill themselves, go ahead hahaha
[2024-11-02T21:33:17] haku: yea i have 33x2 but not 40kw. it pulls. seems like its never ending acceleration just limited by controllers
[2024-11-02T21:34:13] haku: i would never try that standing up at those speeds. big balls you guys
[2024-11-02T21:34:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Remove the limitation and try just for the sake of trying, then lower the parameters
[2024-11-02T21:35:38] haku: i just have to change the position of the controller. it gets hot sandwiched to the battery.
[2024-11-02T21:35:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You have to keep trying, I could never put it at full throttle, the engines are endless
[2024-11-02T21:36:25] haku: safest way to do it is on a scooter dyno if there is ever one lol
[2024-11-02T21:36:35] haku: dual motor dyno haha
[2024-11-02T21:37:05] haku: its faster than some 4cyl cars tbh
[2024-11-02T21:37:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When you go over 125 km/h, that's when you know and realize what speed is and what can happen to you if you have an accident 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2024-11-02T21:38:11] haku: yea. i never do that alot. i think highest i got was 80mph. thats 128-129kmh i think
[2024-11-02T21:38:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, I know I've tried it, but when I stop at the next traffic light they ask me how it can go so fast that they can't catch me hahahaha
[2024-11-02T21:38:44] haku: for me it feels like your not going fast since its low so the ground sitting
[2024-11-02T21:39:13] haku: scary still haha
[2024-11-02T21:40:01] haku: on my next speed run ill borrow motorcycle armor
[2024-11-02T21:40:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's very scary to go over 130, when you reach 140 you think about how fast I'm going, it seems like I'm going at 250 hahahahaha
[2024-11-02T21:41:26] haku: goal for me 90mph 144-145kmh. after that no more speed test.
[2024-11-02T21:42:00] haku: i have a child haha. i cant leave him
[2024-11-02T21:43:24] haku: i think with proper cooling and 250bat 320 phase it might be possible at 72v
[2024-11-02T21:44:52] haku: also first to try on this frame lol. world title there
[2024-11-02T21:57:41] Finn: Haku next mute when
[2024-11-02T22:02:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I just want to know when I can reach it. When I know it, I won't do any more tests.
[2024-11-02T22:03:52] haku: when yamal wakes up. he always bails me out of rose jail
[2024-11-02T22:04:19] haku: we have a mutual understanding
[2024-11-02T22:16:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAoAh5YASmN/?igsh=MWV0eXZvd2d1b3U2NQ==
[2024-11-02T22:20:26] haku: thats the stuff you take if going 170kmh

[2024-11-02T22:39:34] Noname: I randomly asked if he had one, was not selling
[2024-11-02T22:39:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I tried dreaming but Israeli cell prices shut my dreams down
[2024-11-02T22:39:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: F

[2024-11-02T22:41:18] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Shlomozero10🇮🇱 has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-02T22:42:07] haku: there are better ones for less. ask james if he would ship to your area

[2024-11-02T22:45:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What better ones ?
[2024-11-02T22:46:41] haku: good guy. im not sure but there arw newer cells for less now. better than p42
[2024-11-02T22:47:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm also thinking about the 50s by Samsung but there not available here I think
[2024-11-02T22:49:37] haku: you want that new stuff.
[2024-11-02T22:49:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Importing probably goona be hard
[2024-11-02T22:50:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't really understand project also never built a battery more then 12v and what I built was shit so I don't know what i need if I need
[2024-11-02T22:51:38] haku: if you getting batteries. make sure its properly built. lots of good builders here
[2024-11-02T22:52:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like most of battery builders ask u how much amps u expecting to pull for how long etc etc and that I don't really know so I don't know if I need that high performance stuff
[2024-11-02T22:53:01] 'lekrsu': The eve 40p cells don't cost more than 50e does, 4Ah instead of 5Ah but twice the current.
[2024-11-02T23:03:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Lots of shttiy builders in my area
[2024-11-02T23:03:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: More of a capacity guy myself I have enough current on the current build I need maybe a little more

[2024-11-02T23:16:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or just find a better job 😉
[2024-11-02T23:21:51] haku: premium scooter parts is expensive. magura pmt all that stuff. i really dont care for brands aslong as the battery is well built.
[2024-11-02T23:28:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Pmt is a problem because it's not lasting long
[2024-11-02T23:28:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But we have plenty of cmts

[2024-11-03T09:05:25] TrentXWB: Hello friends - can somebody give me a recommendation for a very strong scooter motor (strongest within this dimensions)? I am more into acceleration not top speed. At the moment I use „wheelway 1000 w“ motor and I am not happy (70 phase amps is maximum without rattling during acceleration).
[2024-11-03T09:05:26] TrentXWB: <photos/photo_19144@03-11-2024_09-05-26.jpg>
[2024-11-03T09:40:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or the dualtron spider I found one cheap
[2024-11-03T09:46:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Second hand good condition price is 465€ @albeeeerttttt
[2024-11-03T10:10:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not mine
[2024-11-03T10:10:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think it's a city called ashkelon
[2024-11-03T12:02:34] Давно пора: Try changing/shortering phase wires before taking new motor
[2024-11-03T12:02:59] Давно пора: Also what vesc and settings?
[2024-11-03T12:03:19] TrentXWB: Flipsky 75200 V2 Pro
[2024-11-03T12:03:37] TrentXWB: 40A/70 Phase Amps
[2024-11-03T12:04:04] Давно пора: Filters are off?
[2024-11-03T12:04:08] TrentXWB: MX Lemming/BEMF
[2024-11-03T12:04:09] TrentXWB: Yea
[2024-11-03T12:04:26] Давно пора: Played with hall sensor transition?
[2024-11-03T12:04:32] TrentXWB: It’s only in range 15-20 km/h if you go higher than 70 phase amps
[2024-11-03T12:04:40] TrentXWB: 70 phase amps all fine
[2024-11-03T12:04:47] Давно пора: With what amps you did detection
[2024-11-03T12:04:53] TrentXWB: Motordetection says 56 phase amps
[2024-11-03T12:05:14] Давно пора: Flipsky bad at detection
[2024-11-03T12:05:40] Давно пора: Usually I did from motor settings tab one more time manually
[2024-11-03T12:05:49] Давно пора: Setting bit more phase amps
[2024-11-03T12:06:05] TrentXWB: Yes I always did. Tried everything
[2024-11-03T12:06:12] Давно пора: Or in detection to set power loss 1000w and more
[2024-11-03T12:06:33] Давно пора: What wire it has
[2024-11-03T12:07:35] Давно пора: Awg12 and thicker if wire goes from back to front it needs
[2024-11-03T12:08:57] Давно пора: Or to mount controller closer to motor
[2024-11-03T12:14:07] Давно пора: Motor wires must be much beefier than battery wires cuz motor amps always more than battery amps
[2024-11-03T12:14:07] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Давно has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-11-03T12:55:25] NetworkDir: Motor detection phase amps incorrect

[2024-11-03T21:17:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Don't think there would be 1.5 cm of fin between the base and the fins
[2024-11-03T21:18:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It doesn't need to be that big

[2024-11-03T22:46:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So you buy another frame not replacing the nami for dualtron
[2024-11-03T22:46:24] Vesc Project Paradise: the good thing about him zero 10x which is lighter, and that is also appreciated
[2024-11-03T22:46:54] Vesc Project Paradise: No i want finish Nami and start with Dt thunder
[2024-11-03T22:46:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't know how much mines Is light
[2024-11-03T22:47:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So u have money 🤑
[2024-11-03T22:47:26] Vesc Project Paradise: No really
[2024-11-03T22:47:52] Vesc Project Paradise: all with work, effort and little by little
[2024-11-03T22:55:38] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no motor temp, will burn in 3 ——2 ——1———
[2024-11-03T23:01:48] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: But so, if you dont need fins, you maybe won't be able to burn motors cuz of the ESC will maybe overheat first 😆
[2024-11-03T23:08:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: You was talked about power Standard, now yes the power standard are around 30-35kw without make efforts, since 2 years already if you are not upper than that you have nothing "special" in 2024 soon 2025 here we have even just ppl who make preparation for go to Mcdo and cruising in street with that specs, the difference is how long they can handle it, and that's is big difference the "Powerfull" préparation actually are large upper 40kw in practice at peak, and can handle 35kw for long, Exemple the Rage scooter, cuising at 35kw @ 170km , not the same deal than peak to 35 for 0.5sec
[2024-11-03T23:09:55] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but to be clear, it's still not ridiculous, 30-35kw even in peak are far enough and even too much for 99% of ppl, it's still very strong, Strong yes, but not spécial anymore
[2024-11-03T23:18:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it is evolving but we find ourselves limited by the energy density of current accumulators now, even using the best technology, with our power we empty our already heavy 20kg batteries in 10 minutes
[2024-11-03T23:18:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 🆁aphaël has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-03T23:22:52] Andrei Albert: But who’s willing to put that much money in a scooter?
[2024-11-03T23:23:52] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: More and more ppl, look at my exemple, ppl who never go supper than 80 kmh now want 30kw config
[2024-11-03T23:23:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: dont ask me why, i dont know
[2024-11-03T23:24:19] Andrei Albert: I was always curious, in races, there is money prizes? I mean thats worth the effort and money
[2024-11-03T23:24:55] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no, it's 100% loosing money
[2024-11-03T23:25:03] Andrei Albert: Maybe because some of them dont know how 30kw feels like
[2024-11-03T23:25:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ppl just do that by passion, by sport or by pride
[2024-11-03T23:26:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, it's not reasonable power, and bu the way 2/3 of ppl claming 35+ like the vidéo is just a little lie
[2024-11-03T23:26:38] Andrei Albert: The passion and the sport i get it, me here too but im trying to spend as little as possible
[2024-11-03T23:26:59] Andrei Albert: I know that vesc app only register very high peaks
[2024-11-03T23:27:13] Andrei Albert: Not like the smart display
[2024-11-03T23:28:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: look at the exemple, small 20S9P and not cooled Spinted like this... it's not real 35kw and even not + look at my own scooter, i get 34kw at least, 22S11P, double 400A phase and double 300A battery on setting, never get in practice more than 450A battery
[2024-11-03T23:30:20] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, that's why when ppl claim 35+ they are at like 20 lol, when i said 34kw i am at 34 ... but if i consider the same base of information i am at 40kw on Vesc stats in spikes, but i dont care if this value
[2024-11-03T23:31:45] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i would love see all that's scooter on real Bench, i would love it, to see the real power on wheel, without all the power looses in any points
[2024-11-03T23:31:59] Andrei Albert: Only experienced people know that, until read that here I didn’t know either
[2024-11-03T23:32:51] Andrei Albert: Gotta dyno run those scooters😆😆
[2024-11-03T23:33:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: problem is we can't using classic Dyno, need spécial Dyno, with double roll adjustable in distance, enough short
[2024-11-03T23:34:44] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: on Dyno the power will always be more than Real life also, because in real life it's not possible to grip the front tyre on floor, then we can never get 100% of capable torque on front, but on Dyno yes because you belt the scooter on the dyno
[2024-11-03T23:35:39] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: So on bench i guess easy to get 40kw, and possible to get 50-60kw
[2024-11-03T23:36:56] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but in real life, better to seach to have even more torque on Rear wheel, it's never enough
[2024-11-03T23:37:59] Andrei Albert: C700 and 90h rear🤣🤣🤣
[2024-11-03T23:38:38] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yeah the big 90h seem insane, but it's 7" rim not 6.5 so not any interesting tyre exist for this motor 😆
[2024-11-03T23:38:52] Andrei Albert: Unfortunately
[2024-11-03T23:38:55] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and C700 are too heavy and too big
[2024-11-03T23:39:21] Andrei Albert: U saw that guy with storm and dual cl700?
[2024-11-03T23:39:25] Andrei Albert: Crazy
[2024-11-03T23:39:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: espécially for 24 mos, better to buy C1000 for this format
[2024-11-03T23:39:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no lol, can you show me ?
[2024-11-03T23:39:47] Andrei Albert: Wait

[2024-11-03T23:41:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: C700 on Stock minimotors Storm motor HAHAHAHA
[2024-11-03T23:41:39] Andrei Albert: At least he put 8awg
[2024-11-03T23:41:41] Andrei Albert: Or 10
[2024-11-03T23:41:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: That's are the exemple of stupidity typically
[2024-11-03T23:41:51] Andrei Albert: Thats too much
[2024-11-03T23:42:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: That's just stupid
[2024-11-03T23:42:02] Andrei Albert: And on stock batt
[2024-11-03T23:42:45] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: he add 5.6kg of controller wo can get 700A for motor who can't accept much more than 200, it's just Stupid
[2024-11-03T23:42:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Performance for this crafting are négative
[2024-11-03T23:43:25] Andrei Albert: Dang heavy af
[2024-11-03T23:43:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i would see the face of guy like this when they are ridiculized by twice Flipsky lol
[2024-11-03T23:43:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, Each C700 are 2.8kg
[2024-11-03T23:44:08] Andrei Albert: Im happy with my little box😆
[2024-11-03T23:44:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Weight/Perf are not good for C700, i dont like that product, espcially when you know that the C700 are only 24 mos, in size and weight of 30 mos
[2024-11-03T23:45:36] Andrei Albert: Then why surrons with c700 and not c1000
[2024-11-03T23:46:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Cuz it's enough, and more cheap, but the 2.8kg are problem for me, Light bee should be weight
[2024-11-03T23:47:05] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i care so much of Size/weight per performance
[2024-11-03T23:48:01] Andrei Albert: Im keeping mine under 60kg
[2024-11-03T23:48:17] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and on Escooter it's ever worst, double C700 on OEM storm i am shock haha
[2024-11-03T23:48:29] Andrei Albert: And on stem

[2024-11-03T23:50:20] Andrei Albert: Whats the no1?😆

[2024-11-03T23:51:07] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: btw, it's the norme, and the smart way to prepare Escooter are the exception in that world
[2024-11-03T23:51:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but that's are on the Top 3 i guess ! 😆 with the loop key etc 😆everything is insane

[2024-11-04T02:02:09] NetworkDir: Buy 12x6 big wheel motors they 60H and 12x6 and resistance something like photo
[2024-11-04T02:02:38] NetworkDir: This on 20s should insane torque and Vmax 55kmh (without fwk) i think
[2024-11-04T02:05:05] haku: nice. 12x6 where can you get that? 16x4 should be enough yea?
[2024-11-04T02:06:23] haku: but dual 16x4 is that a good idea?
[2024-11-04T02:09:19] haku: so higher resistance means more windings yea?
[2024-11-04T02:11:19] haku: Noname you shouldve never told me about marketplace.
[2024-11-04T02:28:37] NetworkDir: Higher resistance mean lower kv if i found 12x6 i will send you 16x4 fine but still not enough i think but you should love 12x6 lol

[2024-11-05T21:17:35] William Tremblay: Hi guys! I'm back with more questions (sorry). Anyhow just quick question this time so I was about to buy the two single controllers ubox 85/150 for my Vsett10+ but when I got to the payment the price bumped by a lot I can only assume it converted itself from USD to CAD. And so now it's somewhat out of my budget and I was wondering if getting the dual ubox 100/100 would also do the trick for me? because it does seem to be $100USD cheaper. And would it have the same functionality as two singles with a power switch and the Vsett display mod and maybe an IMU? Thank and have a nice day!

[2024-11-05T21:30:52] haku: no need for dampers on these motorcycle fork style scooters seems like
[2024-11-05T21:32:17] haku: is this 12 fet bro? doesnt max temp at all
[2024-11-05T21:33:08] Yamal: I think 85/150
[2024-11-05T21:34:15] haku: dam no way. amazing
[2024-11-05T21:41:08] haku: this guy riding on the highway without overheating. what a boss. 90mph. https://youtu.be/ad-iL2zGHlE?si=Jl4iSD_Dha6KFnfR
[2024-11-05T21:56:35] Apo: it jumps cuz of shipping cost, check the cost there
[2024-11-05T23:08:43] haku: enough with politics for now. going hiking.
[2024-11-05T23:16:05] Lieven L.: Hiking, means no wheels. Means no fun, means time for a surron or even better a varg 😁
[2024-11-05T23:18:03] Jason: 1
[2024-11-05T23:27:10] haku: <photos/photo_19230@05-11-2024_23-27-10.jpg>
[2024-11-05T23:57:07] haku: the western frontier gents.
[2024-11-06T00:14:23] William Tremblay: well like with shipping it was 328 then when i log into paypal it says 477
[2024-11-06T00:15:42] William Tremblay: but do u know if the ubox dual 100/100 does the trick?
[2024-11-06T00:15:47] 'lekrsu': Still just 328 USD
[2024-11-06T00:17:05] 'lekrsu': Alu Lite can do 150A batt/phase, I heard. Each motor if it's dual then.
[2024-11-06T00:19:22] Noname: William you sure you didn't select quantity 3 instead of 2
[2024-11-06T00:19:51] Noname: Mabey clear cart and try again
[2024-11-06T00:20:54] Noname: Looks uninhabitable
[2024-11-06T00:24:33] William Tremblay: yeah i'm certain I just tried it again, pretty sure it's just the conversion which I was unaware of
[2024-11-06T00:25:08] Noname: Where do you live?
[2024-11-06T00:25:18] William Tremblay: yeah but that's over my budget I thought it was 328CAD
[2024-11-06T00:25:28] William Tremblay: Canada
[2024-11-06T00:27:15] William Tremblay: so do you recommend getting the dual one instead? cuz the dual is in my budget
[2024-11-06T00:28:06] 'lekrsu': How much current will you draw? Or do you have a prior conversation where you talked to anyone here about it?
[2024-11-06T00:28:57] William Tremblay: well yeah i asked here a few weeks ago give me a minute to find
[2024-11-06T00:29:09] William Tremblay: this
[2024-11-06T00:30:21] William Tremblay: i think the battery is 25.6 amps tho and 60V
[2024-11-06T00:30:39] William Tremblay: and dual motor 1400 watts
[2024-11-06T00:30:46] William Tremblay: *each
[2024-11-06T00:30:46] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. William has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-06T00:31:38] 'lekrsu': I'm asking amps, not amp hours. And motor label won't tell you much.
[2024-11-06T00:32:19] 'lekrsu': I just don't know that specific system nor what your bms would allow.
[2024-11-06T00:32:29] Noname: Stock is dual 35a controller
[2024-11-06T00:32:48] Noname: Bms will give more its the same as my vsett 11
[2024-11-06T00:33:02] 'lekrsu': No activation needed?
[2024-11-06T00:33:27] 'lekrsu': If you're only drawing 35A battery current per VESC, alu lite would do more than fine.
[2024-11-06T00:33:53] Noname: 35a on turbo for 2 min
[2024-11-06T00:33:57] Noname: 30a normal
[2024-11-06T00:33:58] 'lekrsu': Mine's not reaching above 39C at 3000W, cooled onto painted steel.
[2024-11-06T00:34:54] Noname: No prob cooling just bolt to floor of scoot it's a lot of aluminum
[2024-11-06T00:35:20] 'lekrsu': Great
[2024-11-06T00:37:05] Noname: William think 2 singles are a few dollars cheaper. Spread any heat out better seperated
[2024-11-06T00:41:35] William Tremblay: okay perfect that's what i needed to hear! sorry bout the confusion i'm not brand new to electrical systems but I haven't worked with stuff as complicated as this so yeah my fault
[2024-11-06T00:42:20] William Tremblay: you sure?
[2024-11-06T00:42:55] 'lekrsu': If mounting is easier, you can get the dual. You can potentially swap one of the lites inside if one would break.
[2024-11-06T00:43:25] 'lekrsu': If you need them spread out, go singles. The bonus of reusing in two single driven systems as well.
[2024-11-06T00:43:56] William Tremblay: two singles would def be more costly unless there's another model of singles which i could use?
[2024-11-06T00:43:56] William Tremblay: <photos/photo_19233@06-11-2024_00-43-56.jpg>
[2024-11-06T00:44:47] William Tremblay: makes sense yeah I don't need them spread out so i'm good for a dual but it's really just a price issue for me i would go two singles if i could
[2024-11-06T00:44:47] Noname: Two 100/100
[2024-11-06T00:44:57] Noname: William
[2024-11-06T00:47:06] William Tremblay: oh that's perfect well thank you for your help again guys! and sorry about any confusion
[2024-11-06T00:47:16] haku: this i where ill be in the end of days. theres a creek
[2024-11-06T00:47:30] Noname: Omg I'm tired that's more for 2 lol.
[2024-11-06T00:48:24] William Tremblay: yeah no but dw it's a small price jump it's not 100+ xd
[2024-11-06T00:48:33] 'lekrsu': They're very cheap considering the market alternatives
[2024-11-06T00:48:58] William Tremblay: also i see on the screenshot u put without fuse, should i get with or without?
[2024-11-06T00:49:10] 'lekrsu': You don't need a fuse.
[2024-11-06T00:49:14] Noname: No problem with space that stock controller is huge
[2024-11-06T00:49:25] 'lekrsu': However you should get BT module.
[2024-11-06T00:50:31] Noname: Oh god that's horrible then
[2024-11-06T02:12:33] Paolo ⁭: Lol 350 shipped with me it cost
[2024-11-06T02:12:42] Jason: damn
[2024-11-06T02:35:17] Jason: mm
[2024-11-06T02:36:49] Jason: should I go above 3 shunt to like 4~5 shunts

[2024-11-06T16:45:17] haku: i am so proud of the young people who voted they showed up. america is sick of this woke BS.
[2024-11-06T16:56:52] GABE: I think trump is woke.
[2024-11-06T16:57:04] GABE: to my standards anyway.
[2024-11-06T17:01:55] haku: i respect your opinion. he is anti culture i know. but america has spoken and this is what it is. guy got impeached twice, buissneses destroyed, court cases and mug shots, shot at and he still fights for the american people
[2024-11-06T17:06:09] Pandalgns: At least you don't have a Pedro Sanchez in your government.🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
[2024-11-06T17:06:32] Pandalgns: that is a disgrace
[2024-11-06T17:06:57] haku: with all due respect @SirModAlot stop taking those hormone blockers. you have a big future ahead of you
[2024-11-06T17:11:34] Andrei Albert: Fuck all political shietttt

[2024-11-06T17:44:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can someone help me find a motor cable (with sensor wiring) for those motors ?
[2024-11-06T18:03:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm more searching for the sensor plate for the sensored wolf motor because they do have one version of it whare it is sensored

[2024-11-06T18:59:03] haku: oh lawd. atleast use the clips from this channel
[2024-11-06T19:02:33] Yamal: They told me that there was a good video editor but I haven't found the one yet, as I see it, this is a bit of a bummer...
[2024-11-06T19:10:22] haku: i barely do bicep curls but today is a good day to do it baby. beutiful day
[2024-11-06T19:20:46] Yamal: Training in your own gym
[2024-11-06T19:21:41] haku: i work everwhere baby. in the park in a public gym or what weights i have at home
[2024-11-06T19:22:11] haku: i deadlift the wepoor all the time

[2024-11-06T19:38:02] haku: do you guys play pickleball in EU?
[2024-11-06T19:45:28] Yamal: only professional parchís
[2024-11-06T19:49:24] haku: dam these things are cheap used. i think i got duped for paying $50 without a battery.
[2024-11-06T19:50:18] haku: mine is also the smallest model. wich i like
[2024-11-06T19:51:01] Yamal: the seat looks like a camel's saddle
[2024-11-06T19:51:54] haku: this also looks like its easier to build a battery on.
[2024-11-06T19:53:08] haku: Noname what you think of this model?
[2024-11-06T19:53:47] Andrei Albert: What’s that
[2024-11-06T19:54:23] haku: aparently its a popular game in the US. kinda like tennis and table tennis combined
[2024-11-06T19:55:04] Andrei Albert: Aaahhh i know but its not that popular here
[2024-11-06T19:55:39] Andrei Albert: Clasic tennis and ping pong and football i play
[2024-11-06T19:56:29] Andrei Albert: Romanian things
[2024-11-06T20:06:13] haku: how about a camel toe saddle? is this better?
[2024-11-06T20:07:35] Yamal: They look like the hooves of a camel,
[2024-11-06T20:07:54] haku: indeed.
[2024-11-06T20:08:23] Yamal: The other seat is better, more comfortable but I liked the shape it has xD
[2024-11-06T20:08:45] haku: i want a big fat seat. not enough.
[2024-11-06T20:10:49] Noname: Mama said
[2024-11-06T20:11:32] haku: 20s can fit easily look at the frame. just cut that middle part
[2024-11-06T20:11:41] Noname: My vsett 11 has the spots for them
[2024-11-06T20:12:17] haku: nice. so you can install on any motor aslong as theres slots for it
[2024-11-06T20:12:23] Noname: That seat looks like it cups your balls and cheeks at the same time
[2024-11-06T20:13:14] Noname: Need a board/ holder or get creative with securing halls
[2024-11-06T20:20:28] haku: good lawd. these people bwahahaha. https://youtube.com/shorts/Vsy9rp3_N4w?si=gloZOC-XGN1x_tx2

[2024-11-06T20:33:08] GABE: Paid. That'll get James a little something
[2024-11-06T20:33:21] haku: pay with interest
[2024-11-06T20:33:27] haku: 10%
[2024-11-06T20:33:35] haku: make it 30%
[2024-11-06T20:53:45] crimeware: @SirModAlot what money you got?
[2024-11-06T20:54:08] GABE: 2/3 and last 1/3 next Thursday
[2024-11-06T20:54:20] GABE: 700, already spent 105 and spending 50 and another 150 now.
[2024-11-06T20:54:27] GABE: so it really flows through the hands
[2024-11-06T20:54:51] GABE: Misc off Ali is gonna put a dent
[2024-11-06T20:55:18] GABE: After the MP2s, 100v100a and speedforks are ordered I'll have basically nothing

[2024-11-07T06:32:33] yoann tsobanoglou: I have built a vsett 10 with the dual lite vesc. You will have great results in performance. The only pain is powering up the adc board because it only has 5v output and I had to use a relay to trigger a 12v converter to power the lights and stuff. Scooter runs with all stock lights/signals/screen.
[2024-11-07T06:32:33] yoann tsobanoglou: <video_file>
[2024-11-07T06:33:51] yoann tsobanoglou: I strongly advise upgrading shocks and tires as stock vsett 10 front system is crazy dangerous.
[2024-11-07T06:56:16] Rose: Hey there Blue, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-11-07T06:56:46] Rose: Hey there Oghlo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-11-07T07:23:07] Yamal: Lite Vesc 🤯
[2024-11-07T07:24:48] Yamal: How many A of battery and phase motor do you have configured?
[2024-11-07T07:27:55] yoann tsobanoglou: This started with 80a stock bms, now we upgraded to 72v by just adding cells to existing battery and to make things fit, we used stock bms from nami scooter (80a but don’t know peak) the scooter cuts off from bms when pushed over 120a battery. So we keep it in the 100/120 range (50/60 amp per controller)
[2024-11-07T07:32:29] Yoni Master: Oh bro you from Israel ?
[2024-11-07T07:32:47] Yoni Master: Wish you victory soon man
[2024-11-07T07:33:34] yoann tsobanoglou: Scooter has added lisp code that increases phase amps depending on rear motor erpm to avoid spining. Beats any stock nami in the group. 😂

[2024-11-07T09:03:05] Yamal: Is okay here, second hand 1800€ 2000 +-
[2024-11-07T09:04:55] FreehandZ: Seems pretty good to me then
[2024-11-07T09:05:29] FreehandZ: It does have a bit of mileage
[2024-11-07T09:05:57] FreehandZ: But GT2s soooo rarely pop up used here, and new ones cost 3700 euros
[2024-11-07T09:06:08] FreehandZ: I think it'd be good for future projects

[2024-11-07T09:13:03] FreehandZ: Ah your message said 28s killer sound earlier
[2024-11-07T09:14:09] FreehandZ: Idk if I have the budget to cop it or even whether I can get it at all, local shipping company does not ship any lithium ion at all (for us normies) and it's located too far from me for a trip
[2024-11-07T09:14:27] Yamal: It's a way of talking/saying that a scooter with a 28s battery sounds good! will be powerful

[2024-11-07T09:16:29] FreehandZ: Design custom motor arms and stem tube, fit 80h motors 🤔
[2024-11-07T09:18:42] Yamal: I like the Gt2! and the mere fact that it has very good geometry and stability attracts even more...
[2024-11-07T09:19:57] FreehandZ: Only issue I've seen is the front stem tube, and possibly a front top shock mount
[2024-11-07T09:20:24] FreehandZ: Where they snapped at the top of the front suspension
[2024-11-07T10:02:51] NetworkDir: <video_file>

[2024-11-07T11:35:08] FreehandZ: Did you use AliExpress branded shipping? Or choice? Pretty much anything else other than cainao super economy?
[2024-11-07T11:48:31] GABE: all says 3 weeks max
[2024-11-07T11:49:54] FreehandZ: Cainao super economy is by sea. Takes about 3 months ime
[2024-11-07T11:50:07] FreehandZ: Anything else is under 2 weeks, usually one week for me
[2024-11-07T12:11:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Should I try to fit 8mm motor cable inside?
[2024-11-07T12:11:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_19248@07-11-2024_12-11-10.jpg>
[2024-11-07T12:12:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also does someone knows whare do I get the sensor plate for that motor (I think it's a kaabo wolf 1gen motor)
[2024-11-07T12:33:34] Basti: how much can the alu lite make in phase amps
[2024-11-07T12:41:46] 'lekrsu': 150
[2024-11-07T13:16:53] Basti: And dual 300a
[2024-11-07T13:18:50] 'lekrsu': Dual is just two Lite's, still 150A per motor.
[2024-11-07T13:29:30] Basti: Thanks
[2024-11-07T14:15:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 4,24€ | 60 ° Sensor Hall de motor de bicicleta eléctrica, Hall de Motor de vehículo eléctrico de dos ruedas con tablero de circuito de cable, sensor Hall 41f https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ex5Cjil

[2024-11-07T17:20:35] GABE: Stock everything

[2024-11-07T17:21:11] GABE: stock motor 250w
[2024-11-07T17:21:11] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-07T17:21:15] Pandalgns: Mine is gonna look 100% modified ilegal and probably go to jail 😂😂
[2024-11-07T17:21:36] haku: how much can you push 250w motor?
[2024-11-07T17:21:50] Marius: what country?
[2024-11-07T17:21:58] Pandalgns: Spain
[2024-11-07T17:22:00] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-11-07T17:22:26] Marius: just full throttle
[2024-11-07T17:22:48] Pandalgns: Full always
[2024-11-07T17:22:49] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-11-07T17:23:21] GABE: 8x
[2024-11-07T17:23:24] GABE: 2kw.
[2024-11-07T17:23:31] GABE: around to saturate
[2024-11-07T17:23:49] GABE: we were learning about motor saturation today
[2024-11-07T17:23:59] haku: my project is a experiment bike. learning to cool a motor amd such
[2024-11-07T17:24:23] GABE: Vesc is slower than xesc
[2024-11-07T17:24:28] GABE: Might not be able to break 50
[2024-11-07T17:24:39] GABE: I believe I can tho tbh
[2024-11-07T17:24:52] GABE: 58ish with xesc,
[2024-11-07T17:25:03] haku: xesc squarewave?
[2024-11-07T17:25:08] GABE: No it's just different
[2024-11-07T17:25:15] GABE: the waves are less pure
[2024-11-07T17:25:29] GABE: I need 50
[2024-11-07T17:25:37] GABE: Only starts to get relatively good then
[2024-11-07T17:26:40] GABE: ACC with 20s and that high ass rpm motor
[2024-11-07T17:26:40] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-07T17:26:41] haku: i notice that on stock laotie esc too. for some reason at 50 if that were true laotie squarewave motor is faster
[2024-11-07T17:27:09] haku: but vesc smoother
[2024-11-07T17:28:12] haku: my top speed with stock laotie motor and battery is 55mph with stock esc and 48mph with vesc. maybe just tuned like shit.
[2024-11-07T17:29:23] GABE: I wonder how good it'll be to ride it when I'm done cos I haven't had a real scooter in ages
[2024-11-07T17:29:32] GABE: 13s was so slow
[2024-11-07T17:30:12] haku: 13s is okay imo. can reach 20mph. good for parks and walking dogs
[2024-11-07T17:30:21] GABE: Could do 22s if I risk it
[2024-11-07T17:30:56] GABE: 35kmh
[2024-11-07T17:31:01] GABE: On demand
[2024-11-07T17:32:41] haku: do 28s. your not limited by racing
[2024-11-07T17:32:53] haku: someone has to do it on vescs
[2024-11-07T17:33:09] haku: mp2 can do it yea
[2024-11-07T17:33:44] GABE: Not enough space for mp2 with more than 22s
[2024-11-07T17:34:03] GABE: I don't wanna go vertical
[2024-11-07T17:34:19] GABE: Tbh could do an external at some point to try it out
[2024-11-07T17:34:36] GABE: 30s on the 250w 💀
[2024-11-07T17:35:07] haku: your fiido bike hoe big are the tires?
[2024-11-07T17:36:30] haku: if 14 you can put a qs motor and jank a battery setup
[2024-11-07T17:38:09] GABE: Yeah I was thinking about that
[2024-11-07T17:38:15] GABE: For the next project.
[2024-11-07T17:38:18] GABE: But I'd rather do a gokart..
[2024-11-07T17:38:36] GABE: 40kw kart or smth with mp2
[2024-11-07T17:39:12] haku: minibike blends in the public not gonna stand out
[2024-11-07T17:39:22] haku: covert
[2024-11-07T17:40:08] haku: also would be cool to see qs motor builds on vesc
[2024-11-07T17:40:27] GABE: Id rather mod a pit bike frame than use the jank fiido
[2024-11-07T17:40:34] GABE: Make a surron like vehicle then.
[2024-11-07T17:40:50] haku: that will stand out for sure. haha
[2024-11-07T17:41:14] GABE: frame probably weight a bit
[2024-11-07T17:41:16] haku: mini sleeper bike is where its at
[2024-11-07T17:41:54] haku: but surrons are cool. dont get me wrong
[2024-11-07T17:42:20] GABE: I think theyre jank
[2024-11-07T17:42:49] haku: some are. but new e dirt bikes comming out fast af
[2024-11-07T17:43:00] haku: crazy. from the factory
[2024-11-07T17:43:32] GABE: The speed of a 300w motor with a sprinkle of fwk
[2024-11-07T17:43:40] haku: i would like one someday but just to expensive project
[2024-11-07T17:44:19] haku: the old ones are. the new ones like e ride ss 3.0 talaria mx5 fast
[2024-11-07T17:44:49] GABE: Imagine a genuine 50kw kart build
[2024-11-07T17:44:59] GABE: Unspeakable that would be
[2024-11-07T17:45:12] GABE: Horsepower of a car.
[2024-11-07T17:45:27] haku: haha true
[2024-11-07T17:45:32] GABE: Pull trucks and shit
[2024-11-07T17:45:57] haku: that be ultimate project. need to be a welder and all the tools to make frame
[2024-11-07T17:46:03] GABE: I think scooters stand out the least
[2024-11-07T17:46:13] GABE: there are frames around
[2024-11-07T17:46:25] haku: maybe in eu yea.
[2024-11-07T17:46:27] GABE: make a video of you riding it
[2024-11-07T17:46:33] GABE: Like not onboard tho
[2024-11-07T17:46:55] haku: scooters in the sidewalk blends in but scooters in the road stands out.
[2024-11-07T17:47:04] haku: here atleast
[2024-11-07T17:47:40] Marius: same here
[2024-11-07T17:48:18] Marius: but u kinda have to use the road, most sidewalks arent safe to go fast, at least where i live
[2024-11-07T17:48:21] haku: when i can afford a gopro/360 camera. ill make youtube videos.
[2024-11-07T17:49:48] GABE: just use your phone
[2024-11-07T17:49:56] GABE: ride on your road and show us how yo look like on it

[2024-11-07T17:50:48] GABE: i think the pack I thought of has Impossible copper placement
[2024-11-07T17:50:58] GABE: I'm gonna have to do it the traditional way
[2024-11-07T17:51:03] GABE: all side by side, the cellls
[2024-11-07T17:51:07] haku: as a former photographer and videographer. stabilization is important
[2024-11-07T17:51:26] GABE: Little longer then but ubox lite is smalll
[2024-11-07T17:51:49] haku: i have big cameras and big gimbals but no way to do that while going full speed haha
[2024-11-07T17:52:20] GABE: from the pov of other people I mean
[2024-11-07T17:53:26] haku: no one i know knows how to use a camera. and adjust settings.
[2024-11-07T17:54:18] haku: also if i put it all in my bag and ride. if i crash thats alot of gear destroyed
[2024-11-07T17:55:49] haku: but for you gabe ill do it. just for you buddy

[2024-11-07T18:30:07] haku: yea longer bolts
[2024-11-07T19:10:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can someone suggest good heat shrinks?
[2024-11-07T19:27:50] haku: i like the ones that has glue but never removed a wire with one. might be permanent
[2024-11-07T19:28:25] haku: they are thick too. and shrinks really well
[2024-11-07T19:29:04] haku: any heat shrink from ali is okay i guess
[2024-11-07T19:52:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: On Ali ?

[2024-11-07T19:53:17] haku: exept solder. i have US made one
[2024-11-07T20:17:23] GABE: the pro 2 will be worth 350 euro but tbh that for a scooter is actually a great price.
[2024-11-07T20:17:32] GABE: Thats cheaper than a new pro 2
[2024-11-07T20:18:24] haku: its funny how our parts costs more than our rides
[2024-11-07T20:19:43] haku: considering getting LY or qs motors on my new $50 bike
[2024-11-07T20:20:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Do u have link

[2024-11-07T20:22:39] haku: i risk it all for elon baby. burnt hands was my sacrifice
[2024-11-07T20:22:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: then we'll see each other behind bars 🤣

[2024-11-07T20:40:12] 'lekrsu': thats just filled with shit
[2024-11-07T20:43:10] haku: it needs ali subwoofers to be complete
[2024-11-07T20:45:37] haku: i need to wire lighting but scared of wiring. i need to ride at night
[2024-11-07T20:46:18] haku: not scared but intimidated
[2024-11-07T20:47:04] 'lekrsu': external lamp »»
[2024-11-07T20:50:19] haku: i need brake light and signal light too. just to be seen at night
[2024-11-07T20:51:22] 'lekrsu': I need that too, all my 6 built in lights are unplugged, 😭
[2024-11-07T20:51:52] haku: i think that the worse part of building a scooter. is lighting haha
[2024-11-07T20:53:11] 'lekrsu': I'd need like 5-10 more wires and somehow wire adc module without 12v. Not sure how that thing works. I can power it with a manual 12v stepdown right? Ubox Alu Lite has no 12v ports.
[2024-11-07T20:53:51] haku: i dont know any wiring dude. specially step downs haha
[2024-11-07T20:54:35] 'lekrsu': <sticker>

[2024-11-07T21:49:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have a controller that I can't get the hall to work, I thought it would have some kind of chip
[2024-11-07T22:36:54] haku: not all holders are created equal. this one weak.
[2024-11-07T22:37:47] haku: <photos/photo_19255@07-11-2024_22-37-47.jpg>

[2024-11-08T21:57:13] Face de Pin Sucé: This one was supposed to come to my workshop for a preparation

[2024-11-08T22:04:51] haku: yes. alot of different versions. but not an expert on this.
[2024-11-08T22:05:37] haku: ask ninebot lords on g30 chat. they experts on this
[2024-11-08T22:06:45] haku: haha 😜
[2024-11-08T22:07:20] haku: i thought you were asking what kind of signal lights i have not adc module
[2024-11-08T22:18:35] 'lekrsu': Completely different yet similar
[2024-11-08T22:18:50] 'lekrsu': Same amount of power ~
[2024-11-08T22:23:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Like the Nami as you well know, it is just a matter of putting a stainless steel shaft
[2024-11-08T22:23:46] haku: nami has this issue?
[2024-11-08T22:26:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The first versions had an axis made of a sensitive material, then they released an update to replace the axis, the arm, and the bearings…just changing the axis for a steel one is more than enough, I did it.
[2024-11-08T22:26:53] haku: nice!
[2024-11-08T22:27:04] haku: nami seems like its a solid frame
[2024-11-08T22:27:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Some users had very bad accidents
[2024-11-08T22:27:46] haku: ive never seen nami gore photos before

[2024-11-08T22:40:55] haku: i mean the frame itself is solid maybe just stem issue
[2024-11-08T22:43:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If it's just the stem, I only need to change the stem. They did it for me for €60. The kit they sell costs €150 if I remember correctly, but you only have to change the shaft. Yamal hasn't changed it yet, he's crazy hahaha
[2024-11-08T22:44:11] haku: yamal a wild boy.
[2024-11-08T22:46:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope, we will decide if we make custom parts for it, or if I tell customer to change frame to a Rage one

[2024-11-08T23:15:32] 'lekrsu': Likely worse.
[2024-11-08T23:15:47] 'lekrsu': If you want high performance, go with a better bigger motor.
[2024-11-08T23:17:51] cihan: Thanks, I think bigger dual motor is a must for me on the long term.

[2024-11-09T17:08:24] Pandalgns: I understand 😂😂
[2024-11-09T17:08:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When I don't accelerate it's to try to control the front wheel
[2024-11-09T17:08:57] Pandalgns: 😂😂 scaping from Trumps gay club 😂😂
[2024-11-09T17:09:46] Pandalgns: Dont come to spain, here got the most gayest politic club and president
[2024-11-09T17:09:48] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂
[2024-11-09T17:10:16] haku: i really wanted to stop talking about politics. but the left tears just healed my leper hands. it has magical powers
[2024-11-09T17:11:31] haku: maybe put some ramp time on it
[2024-11-09T17:14:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Next week if all goes well I will fix the cam and I will be able to activate the traction control. I already did the ramp time but at 100 km the front wheel starts to skid again. The only solution I find is to put the cam on.
[2024-11-09T17:26:32] Yamal: “ VESC project” no es una broma
[2024-11-09T17:27:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <sticker>
[2024-11-09T17:28:00] haku: yea 33x2 no joke. even at high speeds you can feel it kinda lifts the front end and almost pops a wheelie
[2024-11-09T17:29:04] haku: i have to shift my weight to the front end at 50+mph.
[2024-11-09T17:30:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's like you say it, I've never been able to stop it from skidding. I've tried with the accelerator but it's impossible. 33x2...70h 180 a in the rear 120a in the front plus something else. It's impossible to stop it from skidding, at least I can't.
[2024-11-09T17:31:14] Yamal: <photos/photo_19289@09-11-2024_17-31-14.jpg>
[2024-11-09T17:32:41] haku: what a fancy boy
[2024-11-09T17:32:54] haku: poppy seed?
[2024-11-09T17:32:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I do it but at 145 it keeps skidding I can't put the scooter at full speed I don't have a spot but soon we'll see the spot Yamal knows where it is, it's 3.9 km straight but until I have the cam I don't want to try that spot if someone sees me I can appear on TV 📺 🤣
[2024-11-09T17:35:38] Yamal: You have the look of a gaches inspector!
[2024-11-09T17:37:22] Yamal: It is important to test how much you can handle your scooter, when you reach your top speed and you know that this is your ceiling you start to relax!
[2024-11-09T17:39:20] Yamal: 3shull!!!🤩
[2024-11-09T17:39:47] haku: 80mph is where i top off. but might need to tweek some settings and fix cooling. 90mph is goal. then im done
[2024-11-09T17:40:29] Yamal: 400A phase / 200 A battery is just amazing
[2024-11-09T17:40:35] haku: ill test in a cold day maybe that will change it
[2024-11-09T17:40:55] Yamal: Really mount your heatsink?
[2024-11-09T17:41:16] haku: havent done it yet. getting sidetracked by new projects

[2024-11-09T17:52:49] Marius: 90mph Would be insane
[2024-11-09T17:56:49] haku: thats the goal.
[2024-11-09T17:57:29] haku: look at this. electric converted mini moto gp bike. very cool. https://youtu.be/IHZ_E8h_KZc?si=MAxHeJNM8FD4bS34
[2024-11-09T17:58:26] haku: it turns so well wow
[2024-11-09T18:34:04] Noname: Ruined it, sounds like shit with the gear slap
[2024-11-09T18:34:43] haku: there is something about this bike thats urging me to build on it. laotie motors will fit. why must i be different
[2024-11-09T18:35:16] haku: he blown the motor lmao
[2024-11-09T18:36:13] Noname: Idk skimmed the vid but prob overfilled with oil
[2024-11-09T18:37:02] Noname: Good weather and neighborhood riding that's why.
[2024-11-09T18:37:22] Noname: That'd get no use here
[2024-11-09T18:37:40] haku: this bike i can go to the store and the bike will fit in a cart go shopping and go home
[2024-11-09T18:38:18] Noname: Not enough battery space to power it far
[2024-11-09T18:38:52] haku: there is a longer version but still mini fat bmx. 72v hailong case might fit
[2024-11-09T18:39:24] haku: its the disk brake mounting will be the problem. need a welder
[2024-11-09T18:40:17] Noname: <photos/photo_19292@09-11-2024_18-40-17.jpg>
[2024-11-09T18:40:39] haku: yea baby. when i get one test that badboy
[2024-11-09T18:40:54] haku: ill send you frame. sandblast it aswell
[2024-11-09T18:41:12] Noname: No that sucks
[2024-11-09T18:41:27] haku: rust? it doesnt happen here
[2024-11-09T18:41:43] Noname: I refuse to sandblast powdercoating
[2024-11-09T18:44:31] Noname: Get a tom thumb mini bike they're tiny. Lots of room for battery
[2024-11-09T18:45:10] haku: yea but frame expensive and through axles
[2024-11-09T18:45:47] haku: im a cheap thrills kinda man
[2024-11-09T18:47:36] haku: even when i first saw the weepor frame last year. ive always stayed in my head. like thats the frame to build on
[2024-11-09T18:48:37] haku: can this weld aluminum too?
[2024-11-09T18:49:29] Noname: Idk we didn't need that option. Aluminum is a bit different wire is to soft to push through long cable and need different gas
[2024-11-09T18:50:11] haku: that lazer welder badass though. looks easy to use. even the ali version seems good
[2024-11-09T19:04:59] haku: do you use side mirrors? i want wepoor to be street legal
[2024-11-09T19:05:31] haku: and safety too
[2024-11-09T19:06:58] Noname: Moped has them. Don't need mirrors on a bike and scooter is jumbled in that classification but I need somethimg 4 safety
[2024-11-09T19:07:34] haku: i ride with traffic.
[2024-11-09T19:08:35] haku: never shoulder or bike lane. its more dangerous on those if going speed limit
[2024-11-09T19:09:48] Noname: There's no bike lanes here only some in the city.
[2024-11-09T19:11:01] haku: i just want it fully street legal atleast if i get questioned by cops. the crackdowns will begin i feel like.
[2024-11-09T19:11:44] haku: its a good thing because kids on surrons in the freeway. no helmets.
[2024-11-09T19:12:25] Noname: Yes and no. It's gonna kill the sport and have a bunch of unusable toys.
[2024-11-09T19:14:24] haku: im sure our new supreme leader will be merciful. just atone your sins to elon and he will make pevs
[2024-11-09T19:15:52] Noname: Keeping it either tagged or pedals not much they can do. Vsett needs to go
[2024-11-09T19:16:13] haku: wepoor hopefully will pass as moped
[2024-11-09T19:16:33] haku: i guess it will be up to the state
[2024-11-09T19:16:44] haku: no crackdowns here yet
[2024-11-09T19:19:15] haku: blue cities will have it good haha. idk why this turned out like this tbh
[2024-11-09T19:25:28] Yamal: all your neighbors are Kamala
[2024-11-09T19:25:53] haku: not in my hood.
[2024-11-09T19:28:06] haku: its the californians moving here because so expensive to live there and they still keep voting that way. so dumb
[2024-11-09T19:28:34] haku: but we in the land of the free. vote however you want baby.
[2024-11-09T19:29:30] haku: just keep rainbow day off school and tampons off in boys bathrooms is all i want.

[2024-11-10T14:43:07] Marius: does anyone know if i need v4 or v5 suspension to fit with speedforks? or does it not matter
[2024-11-10T14:47:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When you do the throttle detection you have to accelerate so that the controller detects it, otherwise it will never work.
[2024-11-10T15:17:25] NetworkDir: Turn on traction control
[2024-11-10T15:21:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: To do that I have to make the cam work if everything goes well next week we will do it

[2024-11-10T17:04:56] haku: Noname does your niu and c80 have a vin#
[2024-11-10T17:06:07] Noname: Yes
[2024-11-10T17:06:30] haku: damn. mine doesnt. im fucked
[2024-11-10T17:06:45] haku: can i just fake stamp a vin?
[2024-11-10T17:07:11] Noname: No lol
[2024-11-10T17:07:53] haku: how can i get plates for mine. i want it street legal
[2024-11-10T17:07:58] Noname: At that point it's better to not as it's just a toy. Faking it is a crime
[2024-11-10T17:08:48] haku: true. as a law abiding citizen i will not do that. i will atone to elon for even having those thoughts
[2024-11-10T17:11:06] haku: i might have to build on a legit motorcycle frame with vin if i want a real cruiser
[2024-11-10T17:20:20] Noname: You might be able to register as home made vehicle but that involves a inspection and certification. Would need D.O.T. tires
[2024-11-10T17:23:00] haku: maybe i can just write D.O.T on the tires. my brakes already DOT rated
[2024-11-10T17:28:33] Noname: No
[2024-11-10T17:29:19] haku: is pmt D.O.T rated?
[2024-11-10T17:29:46] haku: ill put 11 inch just for inspection
[2024-11-10T17:30:57] haku: i really want a plate. i feel like an illegal alien in the road when i ride with motorcycles
[2024-11-10T17:32:46] Noname: <photos/photo_19308@10-11-2024_17-32-46.jpg>

[2024-11-10T17:34:03] haku: thanks. ill look into it
[2024-11-10T17:34:37] haku: register as a moped would be good
[2024-11-10T17:36:24] Noname: Not at 80mph
[2024-11-10T17:36:47] Noname: But least theres a plate so who's gonna look
[2024-11-10T17:37:27] Noname: Plus they have to look up vin and manufacturer for a plate
[2024-11-10T17:37:35] haku: i dont ride that fast all the time. atleast 55-65mph. and just stay with that traffic
[2024-11-10T17:37:55] haku: its only speed tests i go 80mph
[2024-11-10T17:38:12] Noname: Moped is legal to 30mph
[2024-11-10T17:39:54] haku: i figure it out. aslong as its plated no one will care aslong as im law abiding citizen. im done with the outlawz life
[2024-11-10T17:40:45] haku: when i rode to the strip this motorcycle cop who pulled over someone looked at me. those are the cops to look out for
[2024-11-10T17:41:27] haku: regular car metro doesnt care. they seen me so many times never got pulled over
[2024-11-10T17:42:49] Yamal: Nice
[2024-11-10T18:11:17] haku: Noname a motorcycle frame with a clean title will pass if converted electric yea?

[2024-11-10T22:06:48] Noname: Yeah it's got lights and gives out voltage. You need just on off sw to work. And no modding it is a pain I tried
[2024-11-10T22:12:05] Yamal: Haku is the one who dominates the neighborhood now, don't forget it
[2024-11-10T22:19:40] haku: for signals?

[2024-11-10T22:21:51] haku: i dont understand. so the signal buttons do not work with adc module? what do i need?
[2024-11-10T22:22:31] Noname: Simple switches. No indicator light for buttons. Your second Pic should work
[2024-11-10T22:22:37] haku: what about this module?
[2024-11-10T22:22:42] haku: ok

[2024-11-11T18:53:06] haku: a nami with a seat and a chopped stem is where its at baby. only way im getring one
[2024-11-11T18:57:12] Matthew: I have a 10" 65h scooter hub motor. I recently installed it. How do I get the scooter to start and accelerate a lot stronger for full torque start. I've been using FOC. Also what kind of seems like cogging at speed. Say I'm going 40mph and push accelerator to full 100% i will feel a bit of a fluttering and the scooter seems to lose some power but if I back off the throttle to around 50% the advance the throttle to maybe around 75% of full throttle. My motor current is set at 150 amps and battery amps is set at 90 amps rn. I am using a Spintend single ubox 85150 on 18s. The motor is from lannyo and people regularly push 300 amps through the motor, yet, I get what feels like power the vesc doesn't seem to like. The scooter will accelerate fine until ~35mph then the fluttering or cogging happens. What I'm needing is full torque start and address the fluttering for what values I can mess with. I had to raise dvr value because trying to start multiple times the vesc displayed over current and also over voltage.
[2024-11-11T18:59:12] Yamal: engulfed the giant Minimotors in terms of quality and greatness
[2024-11-11T18:59:50] haku: and segway too
[2024-11-11T19:00:29] haku: segway pretty quality too imo
[2024-11-11T19:00:58] haku: some models are over engineered shit though
[2024-11-11T19:01:08] Yamal: How do you explain it!? How do you explain that a man with 14 workers in a small warehouse and very few machines achieves something like this, manages to illustrate the new era of electric mobility on scooters?

[2024-11-11T19:02:12] haku: idk. i was thinking this last night tbh. if i had all the tools and welding skills i would make my own minibike frame too.
[2024-11-11T19:02:58] haku: there is a market for small super mini bikes. i know im not alone

[2024-11-11T19:58:05] haku: dam. haha
[2024-11-11T19:59:58] haku: what winding motor do you have?
[2024-11-11T20:00:46] haku: if you have 33x2 winding you need more phase and battery
[2024-11-11T20:04:42] Yamal: Also 12 Vedder fet
[2024-11-11T20:11:46] Matthew: I have 22x3. I have 90 battery amps and 150 phase amps without flux weakening
[2024-11-11T20:13:11] haku: oh i see. what is your what is your absolute limit that you set for phase?
[2024-11-11T20:13:18] Matthew: Near future I have planned to bring battery amps to 150 and also phase 150 as I only have an 85150 currently
[2024-11-11T20:13:18] 'lekrsu': Remove throttle smoothening (0.3s to 0s). Low end torque is purely limited by phase unless battery current & voltage isn't enough to generate the phase.
[2024-11-11T20:14:11] Matthew: 150 phase and absolute max phase is 230amps. I have 31.5ah 90 amps bms.
[2024-11-11T20:14:44] 'lekrsu': Low for that motor isn't it?
[2024-11-11T20:14:51] haku: wait for more vesc lords to respond to this. im no pro but theres something with your settings.
[2024-11-11T20:15:14] 'lekrsu': A 90A bms (continuous) at 20S is less than 40€
[2024-11-11T20:16:34] 'lekrsu': & check logs to see what it's doing on the vesc
[2024-11-11T20:17:03] Matthew: It is low.. but it is what I have rn. I feel like there's some sort of setting that helps it push off the line harder between sensored and uncensored transition. Until the transition happens the start torque isn't that strong.
[2024-11-11T20:17:53] Matthew: I'm a newb, I have 16s with 90 amps bms and a 2s6p external pack in series.
[2024-11-11T20:18:19] Matthew: Why do you consider it a bad choice?
[2024-11-11T20:20:39] Matthew: I have yet to try 20s. I'm sure I'll have a much more good kick on the start but was just wanting to get input on possible settings to optimize what's going on rn. All I did for the most part is use what vesc tool setup wizard set me and that's been all I have done other than battery and motor amps
[2024-11-11T20:22:17] Matthew: Is there a setting you know that is an area i should adjust to optimize? I know everything is unique I'm just wondering what values would be what I am concerned to adjust
[2024-11-11T20:26:17] 'lekrsu': Try the Ortega Original foc observer if mxlemming doesn't behave properly by default
[2024-11-11T20:28:03] Matthew: I'm trying to learn stuff. I've found so far the motor as a single has been good. I did notice though that it i try to cruise over 40mph depending on the road the stator temp goes up... I'm feeling based on how well statorade helped my vsett 10 motors that all I need to do is add statorade to the motor and other than getting more amps jammed in there i don't want a high top speed. I was wanting around 40mph without flux weakening and maybe ~55 with field weakening.
[2024-11-11T20:28:41] Matthew: Thank you. Will try in a few hours when off work and will get back at ya.
[2024-11-11T20:30:39] 'lekrsu': How high temps?
[2024-11-11T20:32:21] Matthew: <photos/photo_19328@11-11-2024_20-32-21.jpg>
[2024-11-11T20:33:08] haku: what temp sensor do you have?
[2024-11-11T20:33:12] Matthew: Another reason I have certain thoughts or expectations of this motor is based off how fast my yume y11 gets off the line
[2024-11-11T20:33:52] Matthew: <photos/photo_19329@11-11-2024_20-33-52.jpg>

[2024-11-11T20:38:09] Matthew: Definitely
[2024-11-11T20:38:25] Matthew: <photos/photo_19331@11-11-2024_20-38-25.jpg>
[2024-11-11T20:39:02] Matthew: I went based off what the manufacturer told me on those different winding configurations
[2024-11-11T20:39:15] Matthew: I went 22x3
[2024-11-11T20:40:03] Yamal: Dual 85/150?
[2024-11-11T20:42:12] haku: this is why surrons necessary in my city. so much trails and desert to go on. https://youtu.be/xZ7fLjCH5Z8?si=3UA8W7MMQyqKA4Gj
[2024-11-11T20:42:24] 'lekrsu': Higher kV = less torque
[2024-11-11T20:42:59] 'lekrsu': How much was the shipping btw
[2024-11-11T20:43:02] Matthew: Was dual vsett10+. Somehow my other vesc died omw to work. Instead of buying another vesc I want single motor from the beginning. I find i don't like dual motor much. I'm too used to traditional rwd everything and have been thrown onto the ground once and then have had many other close calls and it's all because it's fwd and I'm expecting different results from throttle lol
[2024-11-11T20:44:37] Matthew: Yes, I realize that... I was given 5 different windings and was given free spin on 72v on all the 5 and I made them aware I will be 16s and don't know what a loaded rpm would be and that was their response.
[2024-11-11T20:45:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2024-11-11T20:46:02] Matthew: $218 motor and $100 shipping ups

[2024-11-11T21:08:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't think there is marking on my motors what is their winding
[2024-11-11T21:10:05] Matthew: There are not markings on mine either other than 10" 65h
[2024-11-11T21:10:56] Matthew: As for hazardous materials it was inspected and moved on. I got the motor in 1 week.
[2024-11-11T21:11:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I know what motor I have just not the winding
[2024-11-11T21:11:52] Matthew: Cool cool. Not being sarcastic. I really am a newb. I'm glad I know more what to expect though is what my main concern is.
[2024-11-11T21:12:14] Matthew: *same
[2024-11-11T21:12:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: In Israel its different

[2024-11-11T21:24:42] Matthew: 16x4 or 22x3 are the 2 different windings I was told to consider. How much of a difference in torque would 16x4 be over the 22x3?

[2024-11-11T21:54:16] GABE: 1/3 or so
[2024-11-11T21:56:33] Matthew: 16x4 being the motor with more torque?
[2024-11-11T22:02:49] Matthew: Do I use MTPA settings? Or disable?
[2024-11-11T22:03:41] Matthew: How about speed tracker?

[2024-11-12T16:27:55] Face de Pin Sucé: he's an accrobate x)
[2024-11-12T16:42:34] Patrick: Eve 40P lifetime shit
[2024-11-12T16:43:18] Patrick: But it's a Budget cell if you want both discharge and decent lifetime get p42a
[2024-11-12T16:43:32] Patrick: But p42a noticable more expensive then eve 40P
[2024-11-12T16:44:01] haku: i have both 40t and p42. but i havent tested the 40t yet
[2024-11-12T16:44:44] haku: i want 40pl next when im buying or the new bak cells
[2024-11-12T16:45:35] haku: have to get it before the tariffs hit. its inevitable
[2024-11-12T16:45:56] Patrick: Me too for g30 but i wait little longer before buying them
[2024-11-12T16:46:05] Patrick: Hopefully they drop a good amount from the price
[2024-11-12T16:46:46] JPPL: Feels good
[2024-11-12T16:47:11] haku: 40pl just 4ah yea?
[2024-11-12T16:51:11] haku: sorry vesc noob here. what does mtpa mean
[2024-11-12T16:51:38] haku: so many abbreviations i need to learn
[2024-11-12T16:57:34] haku: oh dam. welcome to da boys club baby
[2024-11-12T17:00:15] JPPL: Max torque per amp
[2024-11-12T17:27:44] 'lekrsu': Not for our motors
[2024-11-12T17:27:57] 'lekrsu': The name of the toggle is trolling you
[2024-11-12T17:28:08] 'lekrsu': Inefficient as hell
[2024-11-12T17:44:55] haku: its good for surron inrunners?
[2024-11-12T17:45:19] haku: or any midrive?
[2024-11-12T18:03:32] haku: self drive improved so much since last year.
[2024-11-12T18:12:03] haku: i can trust elon to drive my boy alone to school. he doesnt need me anymore

[2024-11-12T20:09:07] David: Hi guys Anyone having here a zero 10x? I'm looking for the measurements of the frame empty space(where battery are located)
[2024-11-12T20:12:26] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-11-12T20:33:01] haku: gotcha
[2024-11-12T20:34:17] JPPL: Placebo then
[2024-11-12T20:41:24] haku: if i turn that on to experiment would it burn my motor at 300 phase?
[2024-11-12T20:43:05] haku: got it. i wont mess with it. maybe with other builds. or different windings
[2024-11-12T20:43:47] haku: i need to learn all the vesc settings.

[2024-11-12T22:43:12] haku: first 80h project ive seen
[2024-11-12T22:43:21] haku: beatiful
[2024-11-12T22:43:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not a fan of bottom mounted controller but very good work
[2024-11-12T22:43:52] Andrei Albert: Me neither but thats the only option that works
[2024-11-12T22:44:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: U don't have space inside for 1 even ?
[2024-11-12T22:44:33] Andrei Albert: I dont have space even for a finger
[2024-11-12T22:44:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Must have some big battery
[2024-11-12T22:45:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why not stem mounted ?
[2024-11-12T22:45:40] Andrei Albert: Ugly
[2024-11-12T22:45:44] Andrei Albert: I like a clean look
[2024-11-12T22:46:17] haku: where is the controller?

[2024-11-12T22:55:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Surely a missile 🚀
[2024-11-12T22:57:08] haku: nicely made!
[2024-11-12T22:58:15] haku: lets get this badboy on the road soon! cant wait to see numbers on these motors
[2024-11-12T22:59:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: a beast the incredible hulk
[2024-11-13T01:38:17] haku: are dualtrons the best in the industry? racing dudes seem to choose these frames. or atleast the forks
[2024-11-13T01:39:25] NetworkDir: no
[2024-11-13T01:39:36] NetworkDir: frames - design - forks bullshit
[2024-11-13T01:40:10] haku: i see. ive notice the french race league racers choose this platform to build on
[2024-11-13T01:40:32] NetworkDir: yes but fully moddifed
[2024-11-13T01:40:47] haku: gotcha
[2024-11-13T01:41:14] haku: what about stock minimotors motor? are they any good?
[2024-11-13T01:43:12] NetworkDir: lol and people thinks they made own motors (minimotors)
[2024-11-13T01:44:23] NetworkDir: xD?
[2024-11-13T01:44:34] NetworkDir: lmfao
[2024-11-13T01:50:20] haku: thats good to know. i thought they had thier own factory
[2024-11-13T01:51:46] haku: its a 110 diameter stator yea?
[2024-11-13T01:52:35] Noname: Eeew dualtron
[2024-11-13T01:52:52] haku: ive been fooled thinking they made thier own motors. the truth always in this channel
[2024-11-13T01:53:14] Noname: Why would they
[2024-11-13T01:53:39] Noname: They don't make tires either lol
[2024-11-13T01:53:44] haku: because the motor branding looks legit lol
[2024-11-13T01:54:03] haku: what stator size these motors?
[2024-11-13T01:54:14] Noname: My chevy is on an Isuzu chassis so what's it called?
[2024-11-13T01:54:28] haku: is it really wtf.
[2024-11-13T01:55:10] haku: i thought gmc chevy and cadillac all same chasis
[2024-11-13T01:55:13] Noname: Acura is honda. To expensive to make what is available just reliable. Like "I love china" brand motors
[2024-11-13T01:55:42] haku: i knew that. but not chevy isuzu
[2024-11-13T01:55:51] haku: gotcha
[2024-11-13T01:56:38] Noname: Isuzu hombre, chevy s10 and gmc Sonoma were all the exact truck with different grilles.
[2024-11-13T01:56:52] Noname: So it continues
[2024-11-13T01:57:09] haku: okay. like toyota matrix and that one pontiac
[2024-11-13T03:51:45] haku: this is just my opinion but these is how e motos should look. get rid of that gastank without fuel. https://youtu.be/6W8LvG_mc4c?si=GaHaxaxhe4FCsbhs
[2024-11-13T03:55:57] haku: if i knew how to weld and have all the tools i would make a frame worthy of the vesclords
[2024-11-13T04:01:00] haku: this bmw 8k. rion and weped is priced higher.
[2024-11-13T06:19:57] haku: hawt dawg. free speech is now back on the menu boys. it never was off the menu for me though.
[2024-11-13T06:19:57] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-13T07:33:43] Finn: I hope the blade works good without halls😭
[2024-11-13T10:37:32] Lieven L.: They are nice but way to expensive. I'd rather get a surron ultra bee.
[2024-11-13T11:43:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Guys glue for sticking sensor plate Sensors themselves Motor cable
[2024-11-13T11:47:53] Finn: Silicone
[2024-11-13T11:49:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Hot silicone
[2024-11-13T12:03:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hot ? Or for hot temp ?
[2024-11-13T12:09:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_19361@13-11-2024_12-09-46.jpg>
[2024-11-13T12:10:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Always use this so that the silicone melts, the sensors would break sooner.
[2024-11-13T12:10:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hot glue ?
[2024-11-13T12:14:09] Yamal: 🤙🔥
[2024-11-13T12:17:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Did it arrive broken? I'll send you another one tomorrow but I don't have the mold, you have it hahaha
[2024-11-13T12:18:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: if hot silicone
[2024-11-13T12:19:12] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: that's for the steering damper bracket
[2024-11-13T12:26:22] 'lekrsu': That's just hot glue
[2024-11-13T12:27:06] 'lekrsu': 180C~ range rather than 200-300C that silicone that actually hardens has.
[2024-11-13T12:27:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: In Spain we call it hot silicone ☺️
[2024-11-13T12:27:39] 'lekrsu': It's silicone based
[2024-11-13T12:27:49] 'lekrsu': Please dont hot glue halls
[2024-11-13T12:28:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He was referring to the plate, that's my recommendation.
[2024-11-13T12:30:07] 'lekrsu': Which plate? ;)
[2024-11-13T12:30:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: For the sensor that can't be used, many people do it with superglue but I personally don't like to do it with superglue.
[2024-11-13T12:31:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: this
[2024-11-13T12:31:42] 'lekrsu': Halls
[2024-11-13T12:31:54] 'lekrsu': Hot glue that you showed has too low melting point compared to just silicone
[2024-11-13T12:32:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Sorry for the translator
[2024-11-13T12:33:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: regular silicone?
[2024-11-13T12:33:50] 'lekrsu': Or this, high temp silicone
[2024-11-13T12:33:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, I understand, but I don't think the engine will reach 180 degrees.
[2024-11-13T12:34:15] 'lekrsu': Hot glue melts so easily, it's insane.
[2024-11-13T12:34:28] 'lekrsu': Low temp hot glue melts even at 120C.
[2024-11-13T12:35:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's never happened to me before, but that doesn't mean it couldn't happen to me. Thanks for the advice.
[2024-11-13T12:35:28] 'lekrsu': I guess larger motors may not hit these temps that easily.
[2024-11-13T12:35:55] 'lekrsu': Silicone has the advantage of not being insanely hot while applying it too
[2024-11-13T12:36:34] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: thanks for the clarification
[2024-11-13T12:37:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: España 😤
[2024-11-13T12:42:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So ?
[2024-11-13T12:43:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And for the sensors themselves?
[2024-11-13T12:44:48] 'lekrsu': Don't know
[2024-11-13T12:45:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think epoxy will be enough
[2024-11-13T12:47:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: A lot of people do this with this one but I don't like it personally.
[2024-11-13T12:47:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 11,49€ | LOCTITE SUPER BOND ORIGINAL Pack de 3 Pegamentos fuerte 4 g https://a.aliexpress.com/_EwLJQd3
[2024-11-13T12:49:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Before soldering the cables, check that the sensors are in good condition.
[2024-11-13T12:50:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Some come broken, it is not usual but it can happen
[2024-11-13T12:59:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wait what sensor is for 1200w ?(60h)
[2024-11-13T13:00:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 4,28€ | 60 ° Sensor Hall de motor de bicicleta eléctrica, Hall de Motor de vehículo eléctrico de dos ruedas con tablero de circuito de cable, sensor Hall 41f https://a.aliexpress.com/_EHCdAyv

[2024-11-13T13:14:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Orderd those

[2024-11-13T14:48:24] Face de Pin Sucé: I know one that does :p
[2024-11-13T14:54:02] Jan: From the stats he gave me its not possible in physics unless he is a very aerodynamic guy ^^
[2024-11-13T16:30:44] haku: 100mph rion. dam
[2024-11-13T16:31:27] haku: only way to test is dyno or got out in a highway
[2024-11-13T16:37:02] Jan: How would you setup the dyno to account for air resistance?
[2024-11-13T16:38:18] Jan: Air resistance is basically all there is, everything else is nearly neglectable
[2024-11-13T16:39:09] Jan: Technically you could make it work to make accurate measurements, i doubt that anyone every setup one for scooters
[2024-11-13T16:41:50] haku: true. i did not put that into consideration. i guess just measure hp on the wheels.
[2024-11-13T16:44:07] haku: 110mph is crazy fast. people happy with 100mph here. ill be happy with 90mph. controller cooling is the only issue. i know its possible if i fix cooling.
[2024-11-13T16:49:39] Lieven L.: Water + radiator 🛴💨
[2024-11-13T17:05:48] haku: yes since you told me about that back then its stuck in my head. if better vesc placement doesnt work this will be next. its just too bulky
[2024-11-13T17:18:59] Lieven L.: It all comes down to surface area. Even if the vesc is placed within the airflow it will never have the surface area of a radiator.
[2024-11-13T17:51:28] haku: this bike is legit. look at all that storage racks.
[2024-11-13T18:17:21] 'lekrsu': Real bike ^^
[2024-11-13T18:17:26] 'lekrsu': Love practical builds
[2024-11-13T18:24:12] haku: i like the impractical jank mini builds lol
[2024-11-13T18:25:22] haku: i hope there is more out there like me. if im the only one dam 😭
[2024-11-13T18:25:31] Noname: It's a safety rail, kid passenger bike
[2024-11-13T18:26:22] haku: i see. but you can prolly switch that to a big rack to carry an impracrical mini e bmx
[2024-11-13T18:26:26] Noname: <photos/photo_19373@13-11-2024_18-26-26.jpg>
[2024-11-13T18:26:47] haku: holy cow thats expensive for what your getting
[2024-11-13T18:27:27] Noname: China men get .30c cut. Corporations get most
[2024-11-13T18:28:37] haku: imagine a wepoor minibike scoot with a big rack that can carry the peak g30 and a 5yr old. thats the dream
[2024-11-13T18:28:53] haku: while dog tied to my hip
[2024-11-13T18:29:55] Noname: Trailer
[2024-11-13T18:30:08] Noname: Your suspension blows
[2024-11-13T18:31:34] haku: true
[2024-11-13T18:31:59] haku: need dual 2klbs one
[2024-11-13T18:37:10] haku: im telling you fellas the next evolution of 2 wheel pevs is super minibikes. cross between a scooter and a bike. mini bike frame on scooter 11" or 13"
[2024-11-13T18:38:40] haku: remember when i told you guys trump will win and elon will cure woke mind virus. i was right. and im im feeling right about this idea too
[2024-11-13T18:40:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Common don't do me like that my credit card allrady crying 😭

[2024-11-13T18:41:00] haku: why not 4 dampers?
[2024-11-13T18:43:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ask ambrosini
[2024-11-13T18:43:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why 2 ? Why on one side ?
[2024-11-13T18:43:43] haku: why not 6?
[2024-11-13T18:44:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: There is an adapter for the dualtron the gives you 1 on each side
[2024-11-13T18:45:27] haku: 6 dampers would be cool. it would look like those old ww2 anti air guns
[2024-11-13T18:46:14] Lieven L.: I don't get why the steering geomitry sucks so much on all the scooters. It's like using a shopping cart in reverse
[2024-11-13T18:47:06] haku: who thought of these c type suspensions lol
[2024-11-13T18:49:18] Andrei Albert: Box onnnnn
[2024-11-13T18:49:18] Andrei Albert: <photos/photo_19377@13-11-2024_18-49-18.jpg>
[2024-11-13T18:49:53] haku: lots of clearance
[2024-11-13T18:50:17] Andrei Albert: Yeaa, i can lower the scooter more
[2024-11-13T18:50:44] haku: how you lower on dualtron?
[2024-11-13T18:51:09] Andrei Albert: Thunder version has adjustable arms
[2024-11-13T18:51:26] haku: oh thats cool
[2024-11-13T18:56:57] Lieven L.: Looks good but the fins have the wrong orientation 😭My OCD is triggered hard
[2024-11-13T18:58:36] Noname: With a classic minibike you could fit 25kw battery easy
[2024-11-13T18:59:31] haku: thats true.need drop in dropouts to use hub motors
[2024-11-13T19:00:09] Andrei Albert: Had to cut to put them 100 correct but didn’t want do that rn
[2024-11-13T19:00:26] haku: midrive would be cool. but not small enough. you want that micro builds
[2024-11-13T19:01:14] haku: something that can fit in a shopping cart and ride it home after shopping
[2024-11-13T19:02:22] Lieven L.: Yeah I figured. But will work fine either way i guess.
[2024-11-13T19:02:38] Andrei Albert: Well see, if not ill cut then
[2024-11-13T19:02:50] haku: remember that honda motocompacto. that size but better looking and fast
[2024-11-13T19:03:40] Lieven L.: Would be so cool
[2024-11-13T19:12:07] Noname: Buy a H.F. welder like 300$ and learn
[2024-11-13T19:12:47] haku: yes. thats part of my project 2025 list
[2024-11-13T19:13:09] haku: i also need tube benders and stuff
[2024-11-13T19:13:57] haku: the ali lazer welder before tarrifs hit is on the list
[2024-11-13T19:16:55] Noname: Laser welder needs gas. You need to rent a bottle of argon/Co and have an account. Mig welder can use flux core no gas but a lil messy. Need a wire brush after
[2024-11-13T19:16:57] haku: that hf mini lathe and drill press on the list too.
[2024-11-13T19:17:54] haku: do you need documentation/certification to buy gas? or you can just walk in amd buy one
[2024-11-13T19:18:15] Noname: Depends on the guy behind counter
[2024-11-13T19:18:33] Noname: Sometimes you need to prove a business etc
[2024-11-13T19:18:46] haku: ill use my country accent. not ching chong accent. maybe he will sell me
[2024-11-13T19:21:46] haku: dam nice! YT making a review of a stock wepoor.
[2024-11-13T19:22:13] haku: big suspension difference from road runner
[2024-11-13T19:23:34] haku: <photos/photo_19379@13-11-2024_19-23-34.jpg>
[2024-11-13T19:27:07] haku: cant get more micro than this though.
[2024-11-13T19:27:08] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-13T19:39:04] Yamal: Haku rider 🤙
[2024-11-13T19:41:06] haku: this will be project 2025. dual 50h 20s4p p42 and dual 100/100
[2024-11-13T19:48:37] Matthew: So I have a ly 10" 65h 22x3 wind motor with a temp sensor. I was running with mtpa settings not aware "you guys" say it should be disabled for the hub motors. My setup was running great other than I wanted to see about more start up torque like full torque start. I put some messages up here and people were suggesting to turn off mtpa and some other settings including the Ortega original from I was using the last option in the list on vesc tool 6.05. And I kinda forget what else. Now I am having over current and over voltage on start up or even while cruising. My start up torque became even worse. I just finished reading some article saying these motors are just fine to run mtpa. Why is there conflicting information for this. I just want my scooter to run good again. And it was running good before. Please someone explain in as vague a way possible or shoot me a link to read up on because I'm a newb and lost.... and actually really bummed out cause I couldn't even ride my scooter to work today. Tia
[2024-11-13T20:00:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Does ramp time change acceleration?
[2024-11-13T20:02:35] 'lekrsu': Yes, it delays.
[2024-11-13T20:12:00] haku: yes turn it to zero. big difference
[2024-11-13T20:12:23] 'lekrsu': loll
[2024-11-13T20:12:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's on 10.0 I think
[2024-11-13T20:13:59] haku: 10 seconds? thats lag
[2024-11-13T20:14:11] haku: vtec will not kick in
[2024-11-13T20:21:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have something similar with this device 🤣
[2024-11-13T20:23:40] haku: i have a similar size of that too. but want something outrageuosly small and stupid.
[2024-11-13T20:24:25] haku: yours is nice solid frame though and comfy seat
[2024-11-13T20:27:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I can put Nami electronics ☺️
[2024-11-13T20:28:03] haku: haha that be very cool.
[2024-11-13T20:28:10] haku: just my opinion
[2024-11-13T20:29:04] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: then we think well 🤣
[2024-11-13T20:30:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have 4 controllers, 2 of 50a 72v and another two of 30a 72v, which one would I put the 50a two motors 🤣🚀
[2024-11-13T20:33:15] haku: 50a lol. or fix the tronics haha
[2024-11-13T20:34:41] haku: how does watercooled motors work? where does the water go? around the windings?
[2024-11-13T20:35:05] haku: do you need a special cover for those electric motors?
[2024-11-13T20:36:12] haku: summer here will fry my motor 100% unless i get 80h or reduce phase
[2024-11-13T20:45:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: tronic is where it is best right now ☺️
[2024-11-13T20:46:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Nami controllers are 50a with active turbo or are they 60ax2
[2024-11-13T20:48:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGdF6hpEM/
[2024-11-13T20:50:28] haku: is that watercooled motor? sorry dont have tiktok
[2024-11-13T20:58:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2024-11-13T20:59:52] haku: very interesting. thanks dude. the liquid probably is non conductive or something
[2024-11-13T21:00:09] haku: or just very well insulated motor
[2024-11-13T21:03:12] haku: i wonder why the racing guys dont do this maybe because of waterweight and short races. but this seems like a good idea if your long commuting at high speeds
[2024-11-13T21:06:22] haku: you can request LY to make watercooling holes too just like they did for weped
[2024-11-13T21:22:12] Noname: @Bradhaku did you get those metal zip ties?
[2024-11-13T21:22:29] haku: yessir
[2024-11-13T21:22:33] haku: its good
[2024-11-13T21:25:51] GABE: Project waiting for the BMS...
[2024-11-13T21:25:58] GABE: And g30 cell waiting for the copper and kapton
[2024-11-13T21:26:31] GABE: @jamessoderstrom helped me out by printing the cell spacers as always
[2024-11-13T21:33:18] haku: did he print it for you?
[2024-11-13T21:39:30] haku: need to build a real work bench with all this wood. its rotting away.
[2024-11-13T21:40:30] haku: plastic folding table no good for putting scooters or heavy battery. it bows
[2024-11-13T21:45:16] Jan: I dont know much about electric motor cooling but this doesnt seem right to me. The liquids would make quite the resistance in the motor. The friction heats it, i guess its pretty much useless
[2024-11-13T21:46:58] haku: thats a good opinion. has anyone tried this?
[2024-11-13T21:47:58] Jan: If i design one, it would be somewhat of a closed loop system without removing too much of the ferite core material
[2024-11-13T21:48:19] haku: that be badass.
[2024-11-13T21:49:05] haku: also on the video how does the liquid get out to the radiator there must be some pressure there
[2024-11-13T21:50:33] haku: tesla uses watercooling too i think but its a different motor and im not sure how they do it
[2024-11-13T21:50:59] haku: or maybe thats the battery or esc.
[2024-11-13T21:52:09] Jan: Makes only sense to watercool if you got all connected to a system. 2x motors 2x esc 1x battery
[2024-11-13T21:52:36] haku: yea thats what i was thinking esc and motors
[2024-11-13T21:52:51] haku: lots of space on my frame for watercooling
[2024-11-13T21:53:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: https://nexun.pl/en/products/statorade-10ml-motor-cooling-system-ferrofluid-775.html
[2024-11-13T21:53:06] Jan: But expect to throw some mid 4 digit money on developing motors and watercool brackets and loop
[2024-11-13T21:53:32] Jan: Not enough
[2024-11-13T21:53:43] Jan: Its still passive cooled motor
[2024-11-13T21:53:46] haku: i was going to use cheap cpu watercooler 😭
[2024-11-13T21:53:59] Jan: You just made it easier for the stator to reach the rotor housing
[2024-11-13T21:56:04] haku: ill try it first on a different motor and see if i can put watercooling holes. just to experiment
[2024-11-13T21:59:25] haku: Noname this one looks legit. if i only knew how to weld.
[2024-11-13T22:00:31] haku: gotcha. our hubs difficult to pull this off?
[2024-11-13T22:04:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll show settings in a sec
[2024-11-13T22:04:42] haku: how long will they mourn me.
[2024-11-13T22:09:58] Noname: Push button swirl molten metal.
[2024-11-13T22:11:16] haku: is it just like welding batteries?
[2024-11-13T22:16:16] Noname: Yeah machine uses electricity that's the same
[2024-11-13T22:17:13] haku: alright. about time for me to learn. ive been dreaming of learning it
[2024-11-13T22:17:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_19388@13-11-2024_22-17-13.jpg>
[2024-11-13T22:17:37] haku: the green one from HF is good?
[2024-11-13T22:20:56] haku: thats not too bad.
[2024-11-13T22:21:28] haku: i set mine to 0. a little delay is good if you like somekind of traction control
[2024-11-13T22:22:20] haku: my front im have to add though since it starts spinning
[2024-11-13T22:27:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't have traction control on
[2024-11-13T22:28:14] Noname: Idk
[2024-11-13T22:28:23] Noname: Watch YouTube videos
[2024-11-13T22:28:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Mine is at 20 for front (I think)
[2024-11-13T22:39:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2024-11-13T22:40:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @albeeeerttttt Benji's thunder
[2024-11-13T22:43:00] haku: those fardrivers can get those watercooling blocks as an option
[2024-11-13T23:20:58] GABE: new sticker
[2024-11-13T23:22:06] Noname: Wheels keep getting smaller on his want list. When is the wheel removed and just bearing on ground happen?
[2024-11-13T23:23:02] haku: remember that trend when rims getting bigger? 30" rims. im opposite
[2024-11-13T23:23:29] Noname: Your not black
[2024-11-13T23:23:48] Noname: <animation>
[2024-11-13T23:24:02] haku: lmao
[2024-11-14T01:34:08] haku: fuck my vesc wont turn on
[2024-11-14T01:34:36] haku: i mightve blown it
[2024-11-14T01:39:00] JPPL: Vesc souls
[2024-11-14T01:39:58] haku: i mightve fucked it. doing front wheel burnout
[2024-11-14T01:40:57] NetworkDir: check bms
[2024-11-14T01:45:02] haku: i did.
[2024-11-14T01:45:35] NetworkDir: gg controller
[2024-11-14T01:46:38] NetworkDir: ShortCircuit Protection seems turns on don't open discharge manually if you open your controller will damage much more
[2024-11-14T01:47:50] haku: is it fucked 😭
[2024-11-14T01:48:26] haku: sad day.
[2024-11-14T01:49:59] NetworkDir: you block motor turn to much?
[2024-11-14T01:50:12] NetworkDir: ah fucking high kv motor very sad for burnouts bro
[2024-11-14T01:51:33] haku: i have to check when i get home. walking dog using peak g30
[2024-11-14T02:18:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Tell me what exactly you did so I know what to not do please
[2024-11-14T02:25:34] haku: do not do front burnouts on 33x2
[2024-11-14T02:52:17] haku: what could be the problem here.
[2024-11-14T02:54:51] haku: its slave rear wheel vesc
[2024-11-14T02:57:15] haku: <photos/photo_19392@14-11-2024_02-57-15.jpg>
[2024-11-14T03:09:32] NetworkDir: Logic board seems fine but fets cocked i think
[2024-11-14T03:10:50] haku: how you check for that?
[2024-11-14T03:11:34] haku: there is no voltage coming out of the vesc
[2024-11-14T03:12:09] NetworkDir: First put multimeter to buzzer (short circuit mode) Check check the batt + - is shortted or no
[2024-11-14T03:12:22] NetworkDir: And check phases with ground one by one
[2024-11-14T03:13:07] NetworkDir: If you listen BUZZER sound that's mean the bad news
[2024-11-14T03:13:47] haku: how i check phases ground?
[2024-11-14T03:14:55] haku: yea theres a short on the qs8
[2024-11-14T03:16:38] NetworkDir: Fuck
[2024-11-14T03:16:41] NetworkDir: GG
[2024-11-14T03:17:14] haku: yes one phases shorting too. dammit
[2024-11-14T03:17:31] NetworkDir: But i think it's repairable by changing fets if opamp and etc doesn't fucked
[2024-11-14T03:17:41] NetworkDir: Yeah 2 fets dead
[2024-11-14T03:17:48] NetworkDir: You overheated i think
[2024-11-14T03:18:08] NetworkDir: Or maybe your motor cocked and phase shorted???
[2024-11-14T03:18:28] NetworkDir: Check your motor see after shorting phases turns hard like regen or no
[2024-11-14T03:18:28] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. NetworkDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-14T03:18:32] haku: damn. not even a long burnout. 1 second long
[2024-11-14T03:28:00] haku: motor is good
[2024-11-14T03:28:17] haku: dam hmm fardriver or another vesc is the question
[2024-11-14T03:29:26] JPPL: How did you burnout? How was front wheel?
[2024-11-14T03:29:49] haku: i raised it and used brakes on rear
[2024-11-14T03:30:12] JPPL: So both were on?
[2024-11-14T03:30:26] haku: yea
[2024-11-14T03:30:38] 'lekrsu': Vesc obviously
[2024-11-14T03:31:07] haku: i cannot betray the vesc lords but i still have some vescs around
[2024-11-14T03:31:26] 'lekrsu': fardrivers are 🤢
[2024-11-14T03:31:49] JPPL: And ebrake is off I can see, it's something that can happend, you were giving power and holding the motor
[2024-11-14T03:31:51] haku: true. cheap brute power though. runs cool too
[2024-11-14T03:32:26] haku: yep exactly that. i always do it in the rear but never front
[2024-11-14T03:32:50] haku: i have a spare 6fet vesc but saving that for a different project 😭
[2024-11-14T03:33:59] JPPL: Cheap and rocking maker base 84200
[2024-11-14T03:34:13] 'lekrsu': You can hide real issues by just adding more mosfets. Junk.
[2024-11-14T03:34:19] 'lekrsu': Big & useless.
[2024-11-14T03:34:46] haku: well RIP vesc. you dont reach vesclord status unless you blow atleast 3. i need 2 more to go
[2024-11-14T03:35:34] haku: its just the 2 mosfets thats shorting is the problem?
[2024-11-14T03:35:37] 'lekrsu': Waiting for my vesc to die so I can reach vesc lord status
[2024-11-14T03:35:55] haku: i thought you blew a few already
[2024-11-14T03:35:58] 'lekrsu': None
[2024-11-14T03:36:05] 'lekrsu': All my ESCs have survived
[2024-11-14T03:36:24] haku: put 250a and 300 phase and do what i did lmao
[2024-11-14T03:36:30] 'lekrsu': Then my motor would die
[2024-11-14T03:36:33] 'lekrsu': no thonks
[2024-11-14T03:37:25] haku: atleast it did not short at 80mph.
[2024-11-14T03:37:44] haku: thats a death sentence.
[2024-11-14T03:37:57] Noname: Did your wheel lock up?
[2024-11-14T03:38:21] haku: i did not notice because it just turned off
[2024-11-14T03:38:29] haku: also i was holding brakes
[2024-11-14T03:38:48] 'lekrsu': That's why regen-only without physical brakes is so scary to see
[2024-11-14T03:38:57] 'lekrsu': it.. wouldn't stop
[2024-11-14T03:39:06] haku: true
[2024-11-14T03:39:41] haku: dam i had high hopes for this setup.
[2024-11-14T03:39:57] haku: lessoned learned
[2024-11-14T03:39:59] Noname: Did you push the bike?
[2024-11-14T03:40:27] haku: i dont remember. maybe by raising the front wheel
[2024-11-14T03:40:33] 'lekrsu': It'll be reborn
[2024-11-14T03:40:55] Noname: Well.it died then what you rode it away?
[2024-11-14T03:41:27] haku: i have a spare but cant push 250a and i dont think its good for 33x2.
[2024-11-14T03:41:46] haku: it died in the middle right after 1 second burnout
[2024-11-14T03:43:18] haku: sell me one of your 12fet.
[2024-11-14T03:43:24] haku: lol
[2024-11-14T03:44:44] haku: can i just take the mosfet from the 6fet and put it on the 12fet?
[2024-11-14T03:44:44] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-14T03:50:16] 'lekrsu': Can't mix fets
[2024-11-14T03:51:37] haku: is it easy to replace one on an aluminum board?
[2024-11-14T03:52:28] haku: 150v mosfets and caps so it can do 22s
[2024-11-14T03:55:09] 'lekrsu': One of the hardest things to replace aren't they?
[2024-11-14T03:55:44] haku: never done it. i would love to try
[2024-11-14T03:56:13] haku: <video_file>
[2024-11-14T03:57:06] haku: i wish @jamessoderstrom was my neighbor. he can prolly fix this overnight
[2024-11-14T03:57:28] 'lekrsu': I've not tried either, haven't invested in a hot air station for soldering
[2024-11-14T03:57:44] haku: i have one but its ali jank
[2024-11-14T03:58:31] haku: even if i change the mosfet. i still have to reprogram vesc yea? need a st link or something?
[2024-11-14T04:01:58] haku: its been a good run. 80mph isnt bad imo. but 90 is still the goal in this frame.
[2024-11-14T04:06:52] haku: i have no working pev now. crap. only the peak g30 but thats my boys bike.
[2024-11-14T04:07:30] haku: i need to re evaluate my actions as a broke poor man. this hobby is exoensive and i have to buy the right parts
[2024-11-14T04:07:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-14T04:11:00] Noname: Put the small vesc on and don't be an asshole for.now
[2024-11-14T04:14:58] haku: need to make a youtube channel do document all these experimental fails
[2024-11-14T04:16:29] haku: i really have no idea what happened. is it overvoltage or amps that killed it
[2024-11-14T04:17:13] Noname: Sudden spike of power from doing dumb shit.
[2024-11-14T04:21:58] haku: maybe this is a sign from above. telling me this is how you learn to fix vescs
[2024-11-14T04:22:56] Noname: Well ya can't really brake it if you try now
[2024-11-14T04:22:58] haku: exactly that
[2024-11-14T04:23:24] Noname: Locked rear spin front though
[2024-11-14T04:23:25] haku: ive been doing it with my rear burnouts though. never killed it
[2024-11-14T04:23:41] haku: now i know
[2024-11-14T04:24:27] haku: i see.
[2024-11-14T04:25:05] haku: is it hard to replace mosfet on alu board?
[2024-11-14T04:25:47] haku: can i just put it in oven😭
[2024-11-14T04:26:43] haku: someday ill have a good soldering setup
[2024-11-14T04:27:58] haku: should i wait for the new 12fet to come out?
[2024-11-14T04:28:13] haku: ill wait anyway im broke
[2024-11-14T04:29:52] haku: ill use 6fet for now and take it easy like Noname said
[2024-11-14T04:31:41] Noname: I'll watch a vid and do this shit on my George Forman grill with the skillet plate 😆
[2024-11-14T04:33:57] haku: lmao
[2024-11-14T04:34:23] haku: wtf people still use those haha
[2024-11-14T04:35:53] Noname: Poor people do
[2024-11-14T04:36:07] haku: im poor i dont use one
[2024-11-14T04:36:39] Noname: Your house is nice I bet you have a full kitchen

[2024-11-14T04:37:38] haku: damn no ride right now
[2024-11-14T04:37:55] haku: all is broken flat or dissasembled
[2024-11-14T04:55:01] haku: looking like rage mechanics yea?
[2024-11-14T05:04:15] Noname: <animation>
[2024-11-14T05:05:25] haku: if i cant sell the vsett i will solid tire it.
[2024-11-14T05:55:28] haku: vsett motors are 40h. thats good to know. i might use this on the clown bike
[2024-11-14T06:34:03] haku: get out of my feed you son of a bitch fardriver.

[2024-11-14T11:51:18] Yamal: Good morning people, do you know if there is a notable difference between the 8 mm bullet connectors and the Amass 8 mm bullet connectors, it is that the Controllers come with a 10awg double phase cable and people install them with the Amass” why don't the normal ones fit...?
[2024-11-14T11:51:59] Yamal: I have looked at measurements and they are very similar
[2024-11-14T13:15:15] haku: i used 10mm on mine but you can prolly fit it in a 8mm. just solder then shave some off to fit i guess
[2024-11-14T14:18:15] cihan: Does anyone have an idea about Kaabo wolf warrior x? Does it have any manufacturing problems, frequent failures?

[2024-11-14T18:19:54] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-14T18:19:56] haku: i will continue your legacy of blowing up controllers while your away champ
[2024-11-14T18:20:28] Noname: Try a vsett 10 tube. I think the Lil ones stretch to much
[2024-11-14T18:20:57] haku: vsett 10 is bigger i have one for g30
[2024-11-14T18:21:13] Noname: Jam it in there
[2024-11-14T18:22:14] GABE: I've blown more escs than him
[2024-11-14T18:22:30] GABE: he knows
[2024-11-14T18:22:30] haku: vescs?
[2024-11-14T18:22:45] GABE: HAHA, I did blow one.
[2024-11-14T18:22:53] GABE: Count that 3 if you count the stolen ones
[2024-11-14T18:23:02] haku: pundir notorious for blowing up vescs
[2024-11-14T18:23:03] GABE: Forgot to put foam

[2024-11-14T18:23:44] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-14T18:24:21] haku: i think im one of the pioneers who blew a 12fet doing a 1 second burnout. thats a world title
[2024-11-14T18:27:16] haku: i might have to pause the jetson 72v and use that 6fet vesc on the wepoor
[2024-11-14T18:43:13] haku: i guess when you want to get in the pev biz in america you have to learn all controllers. cant be just exclusive to vesc.
[2024-11-14T19:49:25] haku: phase
[2024-11-14T19:51:28] haku: i just dont want to fry my motor with fardriver. idk if these scooter motors are okay with it
[2024-11-14T19:52:28] pasvik: <video_file>
[2024-11-14T19:56:26] haku: have you messed with this fardrivers before?
[2024-11-14T19:57:18] haku: whats your opinion on the 450a. i know as a vesc lord you arw biased but is it worth to mess around with?
[2024-11-14T19:57:47] haku: is it pure shit?
[2024-11-14T20:04:03] haku: yea the software is shit. lol

[2024-11-14T21:14:51] sombre_enfant: She must left reading here once y all spammer came here🤣🤣🤣
[2024-11-14T21:16:23] haku: all spam here is knowledge and facts. mostly in offtopic.
[2024-11-14T21:17:18] haku: how many people have fucked a 12fet spintend?
[2024-11-14T21:17:47] haku: ive been looking at search cant see anyone
[2024-11-14T21:18:30] haku: maybe rafael rfp performance

[2024-11-14T21:33:24] haku: highway capable vehicle. https://youtu.be/RhtE-5Q8xyU?si=-HHWik4zFriFlvCf
[2024-11-14T21:40:27] Noname: Bastard child of a cheating hoe scooter that ran off with a beginner motorcycle
[2024-11-14T21:40:57] haku: lmao
[2024-11-14T21:41:22] haku: looks like a comfy cruiser though
[2024-11-14T21:41:53] haku: you can prolly register this too
[2024-11-14T21:47:46] Noname: I don't really care for sitting back with legs and arms out. Comfy but worst position for defensive driving
[2024-11-14T21:49:51] haku: what. your just cruising highway speeds have a 5 car space infront of you. lots of time to react
[2024-11-14T21:50:14] haku: its like a chopper style position
[2024-11-14T21:51:57] haku: prolly hard to turn with this position though
[2024-11-14T21:58:25] haku: damn you tronic. why cant you cater to the poor.
[2024-11-14T22:04:51] haku: is tronic all western micro components? or china components still
[2024-11-14T22:04:51] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-14T22:16:59] Mirono escooters: Have a guess
[2024-11-14T22:19:25] haku: chinuh?
[2024-11-14T22:20:36] haku: its an american company wich i like. im curious about the parts the use. anyone done tests on this?
[2024-11-14T22:21:29] haku: 24s wepoor sounds good. have space in rear compartment for 4s12p but bms will be hard to find
[2024-11-14T22:23:59] Noname: Here it's 5" of space or people trying pass you when your going 85 in a 65.
[2024-11-15T00:28:46] haku: today is a day of mourning my dead vesc so we blast our triceps to get even.
[2024-11-15T00:37:32] Marius: sigma
[2024-11-15T00:38:10] Marius: how much weight is that
[2024-11-15T00:38:13] Marius: cant tell

[2024-11-15T00:41:03] haku: lmao.
[2024-11-15T00:42:09] Marius: ill do push tomorrow as well
[2024-11-15T00:45:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Do calisthenics feel the vesc pain
[2024-11-15T00:46:39] haku: nothing to ride right now so sad
[2024-11-15T00:47:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Me too
[2024-11-15T00:47:37] haku: i was suppose to join first group ride tommorow too. dam
[2024-11-15T00:47:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But because I'm lazy
[2024-11-15T00:48:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe try to get a ride from one of them just for the ride
[2024-11-15T00:48:31] haku: i hope vsett tubes come. ill maybe fix that
[2024-11-15T00:48:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I spunn the front on empty tube so she escaped in
[2024-11-15T00:48:56] Marius: i still have a stock pro 2 i can use 🫡
[2024-11-15T00:48:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I didn't find the thing for pumping
[2024-11-15T00:49:29] haku: nice. good to have a spare ride just incase. any ride will do
[2024-11-15T00:49:54] Marius: with solid tyres 😂
[2024-11-15T00:50:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I have bike and one more 10x but no keys
[2024-11-15T00:50:17] haku: bypass key
[2024-11-15T00:50:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The keys are probably at my bro (in yeshiva)
[2024-11-15T00:50:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: My bros rides
[2024-11-15T00:50:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Aka anti grip tyrs
[2024-11-15T00:56:27] JPPL: G300 22s capable
[2024-11-15T02:43:15] haku: your the only one that has one here yea? how is it?
[2024-11-15T03:11:24] JPPL: Don't ride it for a while cuz my battery for some water 🌊😭
[2024-11-15T03:17:05] haku: dam. that was a good ride and motors
[2024-11-15T03:17:53] haku: that was the scooter that inspired me to build laotie and turned to wepoor minibike scoot
[2024-11-15T03:19:56] haku: anyways got the vsett flat fixed and for some wierd reason it feels faster standing up than sitting down. going 25mph feels like 40. and minibike scoot 65 feels like your not going fast at all
[2024-11-15T03:22:51] haku: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-11-15T03:24:57] Noname: Use the bigger tube?
[2024-11-15T03:25:33] haku: nah. the amazon arrived today. the bigger one was chewed by dog
[2024-11-15T03:26:19] Noname: Gasp, U used Amazon?
[2024-11-15T03:26:24] haku: i also rotated the tires because poor

[2024-11-15T03:28:23] haku: bikelane at night scary. can see rocks in the way
[2024-11-15T04:12:51] haku: cant sell this pos.
[2024-11-15T04:15:51] Noname: Give you 5$
[2024-11-15T04:20:30] haku: trade you for the 11
[2024-11-15T04:21:20] Noname: Let me sleep.on it
[2024-11-15T04:21:25] haku: ill cut the stems on that badboy and put a seat
[2024-11-15T04:21:33] Noname: By that I mean you can have it when I'm dead
[2024-11-15T04:22:41] Noname: If I had batterys I'd be more willing to keep it. 20kw would be fun
[2024-11-15T04:22:59] haku: ebikes selling in a week in marketplace.
[2024-11-15T04:24:27] haku: scooters not so much. it pisses me off. earlier i was so cold riding this single motor scooter passed me. he gave me a smirk at the stop light
[2024-11-15T04:24:40] haku: im just going 16mph.
[2024-11-15T04:25:21] haku: why does it have to be that way. cant we just all be friends as scooter folk

[2024-11-15T05:43:43] FreehandZ: Also 500c hot air too
[2024-11-15T05:44:01] Jason: make sure
[2024-11-15T05:44:02] FreehandZ: I think the hot plate is 800w or smth

[2024-11-15T05:46:04] FreehandZ: Maybe it's copper plated 🤔
[2024-11-15T05:46:14] Jason: tbh
[2024-11-15T05:46:16] Jason: for hotplate

[2024-11-15T05:46:52] FreehandZ: Just need to be even temp and accurate temp
[2024-11-15T05:46:54] FreehandZ: Lol

[2024-11-15T05:48:07] haku: funny thats on my list too
[2024-11-15T05:49:28] Jason: lol
[2024-11-15T07:03:54] haku: vesc lords are a different breed.
[2024-11-15T07:05:38] Yamal: ?
[2024-11-15T07:05:43] haku: why cant we get stuff like this mass produced. fardrivers have oled screens now. all we really need is a good display
[2024-11-15T07:07:23] haku: i mean people make and program this displays at home. crazy
[2024-11-15T08:01:36] NetworkDir: Mostly this reviews paid xD
[2024-11-15T08:03:27] haku: everything he said is true though exept the suspension bottoming out. frame is solid
[2024-11-15T08:06:22] haku: also locks always break
[2024-11-15T09:52:44] Lieven L.: Where did you get the frame?
[2024-11-15T11:43:26] Yamal: ?
[2024-11-15T13:37:37] Jason: what do yall think of the phase wire solder job
[2024-11-15T14:06:26] Patrick: Looks special
[2024-11-15T14:08:40] Jason: spiiiiiiin
[2024-11-15T14:21:42] 'lekrsu': Tire! :D
[2024-11-15T14:22:59] pasvik: <video_file>
[2024-11-15T14:25:51] Jason: damn
[2024-11-15T14:26:10] pasvik: 😂
[2024-11-15T14:45:51] Yamal: Mosnter, How many A phase and battery does that controller handle?
[2024-11-15T15:11:50] Jason: idk
[2024-11-15T15:11:59] Jason: <photos/photo_19412@15-11-2024_15-11-59.jpg>
[2024-11-15T15:12:04] Jason: I need more lead and power
[2024-11-15T15:57:59] haku: looks good. have you tested it
[2024-11-15T15:58:17] Jason: it works
[2024-11-15T15:58:27] Jason: btw i think I got scammed by lonnyo
[2024-11-15T15:58:42] Jason: ordered 100k ntc, came 10k ntc now the kv doesn't seem to match
[2024-11-15T15:58:48] Jason: <photos/photo_19413@15-11-2024_15-58-48.jpg>

[2024-11-15T15:59:08] haku: gj dude. that one you working on the blueprints. make it
[2024-11-15T15:59:10] Jason: 16x4 winding is 25kv from what they told mines 17x4 so prob bit higher kv but wtf
[2024-11-15T15:59:25] Jason: 19.xxkv
[2024-11-15T15:59:27] Jason: <sticker>
[2024-11-15T16:00:04] haku: geofought
[2024-11-15T16:00:43] haku: if it works it works
[2024-11-15T16:35:39] Lieven L.: Put a speaker in it and attach it to the mini bike
[2024-11-15T17:49:58] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: ☺️
[2024-11-15T17:54:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍👍
[2024-11-15T18:33:37] sombre_enfant: No 16x4 is 50h thats why higher kv with 65h and 1 more turn you have less rpm so 19kv seems about right
[2024-11-15T19:15:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_19417@15-11-2024_19-15-40.jpg>
[2024-11-15T19:16:15] haku: dam thats nice
[2024-11-15T19:16:36] haku: chi battery
[2024-11-15T19:17:42] haku: these electric groms getting popular here
[2024-11-15T19:17:58] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, I think it has to work very, very well.
[2024-11-15T19:19:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Loading to do a speed test to see how fast we can go. I'm going to do it between 22:00/23:00h
[2024-11-15T19:20:52] haku: lets see some. be safe buddy!
[2024-11-15T19:22:24] haku: i rather build one of these than a pitbike tbh. you can register these
[2024-11-15T19:23:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: For me I see him doing a lot of work
[2024-11-15T19:24:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: but you could do something like this with a Yamaha Vmax
[2024-11-15T19:24:17] haku: yep lots of work modding these to electric. these normally modded to hub motor but this is midrive wich is cool
[2024-11-15T19:25:30] haku: i was considering those e grom frames before but tge budget is not there 😭
[2024-11-15T19:53:09] haku: do i make adapters to fit this into a 6fet? also qs8 to xt90
[2024-11-15T19:53:09] haku: <photos/photo_19420@15-11-2024_19-53-09.jpg>
[2024-11-15T19:54:50] haku: what size bullet is the 6fet again?
[2024-11-15T19:56:11] 'lekrsu': 4mm innit
[2024-11-15T19:56:43] haku: i might have some left. but its the banana plugs style
[2024-11-15T19:57:14] haku: what a waste of qs8 and xt90 for this adapter. 10mm bullets too
[2024-11-15T20:02:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Save them for the future, they never hurt
[2024-11-15T21:00:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: @jamaludin_algarnati how do you handle the scooter
[2024-11-15T21:28:36] Yamal: Working !
[2024-11-15T21:51:21] haku: speed test with gps that badboy
[2024-11-15T22:42:33] haku: like a mini cheap super 73. i like https://youtu.be/xUKOmq0AJUM?si=eunn3YCLSPZ2qv1v
[2024-11-15T22:45:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I need a place with more straightness, Duty only reaches 80%, I have also realized that when the engines start to "pull" I have to brake with that 15% we could reach more or less 145/155 I think no more
[2024-11-15T22:45:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_19421@15-11-2024_22-45-28.jpg>

[2024-11-15T22:46:28] haku: wow thats values single motor?
[2024-11-15T22:47:29] haku: why is duty not going higher?
[2024-11-15T22:47:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If these are the values ​​for the rear engine, these are for the front engine.
[2024-11-15T22:47:48] haku: oh good lawd
[2024-11-15T22:47:58] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Next week I will fix the cam
[2024-11-15T22:49:07] haku: how was the motor. did you feel it? is it hot to the touch?
[2024-11-15T22:49:43] haku: we have the same motor i think. and mine already gets to the 100+ at 300a
[2024-11-15T22:50:55] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I put 400 a phase
[2024-11-15T22:51:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 180a
[2024-11-15T22:51:25] haku: 400 phase and 180 battery?
[2024-11-15T22:51:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2024-11-15T22:51:34] haku: nice
[2024-11-15T22:51:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 40 fw
[2024-11-15T22:51:47] haku: i see
[2024-11-15T22:51:55] haku: i dont use fw
[2024-11-15T22:52:08] haku: you have 33x2 70h yea
[2024-11-15T22:52:12] purp: i used to work for fluid free ride. the most common issue i’d see was wires from the forks into the deck being pinched on the neck of the scooter when using its full turn radius. and second would be water damage lolll
[2024-11-15T22:52:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I use it only for testing then I deactivate it
[2024-11-15T22:53:03] haku: maybe wepoor just heavy and im already 100kilos
[2024-11-15T22:53:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I am medium weight 75kg
[2024-11-15T22:54:12] haku: also nami is light with 11"tires
[2024-11-15T22:54:27] haku: i have heavy 13"
[2024-11-15T22:55:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: much more weight on the wheel, larger diameter, more speed
[2024-11-15T22:58:28] haku: its not fast. only 128-129kmh
[2024-11-15T22:58:50] haku: compared to the some 11 or 10" setups
[2024-11-15T23:03:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If the wheel is bigger it has more speed, you just have to let it reach speed.
[2024-11-15T23:04:47] haku: controller mounting is limiting it. need better cooling
[2024-11-15T23:20:34] haku: i dont know if i believe this hype man youtuber now after that worlds fastest scooter video. https://youtube.com/shorts/SC9b8Dz8SvM?si=GGGq2izgmJaAP3aw
[2024-11-15T23:21:44] haku: its a car hub motor i think
[2024-11-15T23:42:24] Yamal: Hello //3.3v, ground and adc1// In what order are they welded to the accelerator?
[2024-11-16T00:17:53] Yamal: 3,3v is the positive wire red one ,,?
[2024-11-16T00:18:37] 'lekrsu': On the throttle side, red is 3.3v, black is gnd, remainder is adc1.
[2024-11-16T00:32:31] Yamal: and the bluetooth module?
[2024-11-16T00:45:55] Yamal: <photos/photo_19424@16-11-2024_00-45-55.jpg>
[2024-11-16T00:48:49] Yamal: NRF?
[2024-11-16T00:49:28] Yamal: Where is the bluetooh module connected to the ubox?
[2024-11-16T00:51:19] haku: need to find this cat need new vesc
[2024-11-16T02:22:26] 'lekrsu': You should see a port named nrf
[2024-11-16T09:30:49] Yamal: Hallooo good morning

[2024-11-16T14:20:22] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Hey guys, is that module important at all? Having some problems with putting it inside scooter
[2024-11-16T14:24:42] NetworkDir: No useless
[2024-11-16T14:29:04] Jason: damn
[2024-11-16T15:00:15] SirGeoff: No, its not. Leave it, and you will have a 0-24 powered on vesc. 😁
[2024-11-16T15:41:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When you say something like this ,you count the amount of vesc you guys burned?
[2024-11-16T15:41:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If he doesnt have other option or make a key solution,thats what he can use
[2024-11-16T15:42:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: While i never saw such burned or having issues ,in our hands
[2024-11-16T15:43:06] Yamal: Battery current max regen =0 right ?
[2024-11-16T15:43:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Models from flip exist where you have other possible ways by factory
[2024-11-16T15:43:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you want no regen than yes
[2024-11-16T15:44:07] Yamal: Thanks
[2024-11-16T15:44:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sure thing bro
[2024-11-16T15:46:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But note, when no regen You dont suck power up when you e brake But since how it works you always make energy,but in this case, mosfets will make heat out from that
[2024-11-16T15:53:05] 'lekrsu': There wont be any e-brake at all if regen is set to 0.
[2024-11-16T16:32:52] NetworkDir: ??
[2024-11-16T16:33:06] NetworkDir: I don't burn any vesc on my life but ok :)
[2024-11-16T16:34:34] NetworkDir: Since you can do it with 2 resistor and 2 peice of cables why you would use this stupid thing? waste of space waste of money :)
[2024-11-16T16:38:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 24/7
[2024-11-16T16:52:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He already has it and i also added that he can do that also
[2024-11-16T16:54:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You guys ment with punedir And maybe not just vesc or maybe him maybe more than you , dir end makes a confusion in the memory
[2024-11-16T16:55:24] NetworkDir: Yeah he stole my nickname xD
[2024-11-16T16:56:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can dissable all this, but not there

[2024-11-16T21:39:03] haku: has anyone tried vesc on sotion or big qs motors?

[2024-11-16T21:44:53] haku: like qs273 60h or the sotion hubs
[2024-11-16T21:45:33] haku: 12 fet is enough or need the bigger ones
[2024-11-16T21:46:18] haku: like the 3shull or seven
[2024-11-16T21:56:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is the stem shortened?
[2024-11-16T22:01:32] haku: yes because he will add a seat
[2024-11-16T22:02:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: All the racers are short stem
[2024-11-16T22:05:15] haku: but he not racing. it will be a seat. he knows what quality of life is
[2024-11-16T22:06:30] haku: also racers cut smaller
[2024-11-16T22:06:40] haku: that one is seat height
[2024-11-16T22:08:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Seat is shit bro it's a scooter not a bike
[2024-11-16T22:09:24] haku: why is seat bad? its comfortable. im just speaking facts
[2024-11-16T22:09:46] haku: would you rather stand in line or sit?
[2024-11-16T22:10:13] haku: also standing your center of gravity is bad
[2024-11-16T22:11:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Scooter is a performance vehicle not comfort
[2024-11-16T22:12:23] haku: why havent we seen performance standing vehicles then. scooters are made for commuters originally not meant to go fast
[2024-11-16T22:13:04] haku: why would you want to kneel at high speeds or crouch to get performance
[2024-11-16T22:13:48] haku: sitting down you could tuck better.
[2024-11-16T22:14:21] haku: just facts my boy

[2024-11-16T22:20:46] haku: no fines here. we ride like bosses
[2024-11-16T22:20:54] Yamal: Mini Moto/ mini bike/ emoto
[2024-11-16T22:21:49] haku: why is seated so bad in the scooter community. i do not understand
[2024-11-16T22:22:13] haku: even eucs have a seat
[2024-11-16T22:22:39] Noname: It's a different vehicle at that point. No seat is scooter seat it motorcycle. Euc is new and in a grey area
[2024-11-16T22:23:37] haku: wtf kinda rules is that. countrys want thier citizen to stand like peasants
[2024-11-16T22:24:40] Yamal: Ride scooter stand its cool, more tired than seat but cool I don’t know..
[2024-11-16T22:25:40] Noname: Because scooters are allowed in bike lanes. You have a seat and it's a mcycle they are not allowed because then honda cbr 1000 can also use bike lane
[2024-11-16T22:26:07] haku: but is it comfortable in long commutes and your body acts like a parachute if you dont kneel when fast
[2024-11-16T22:26:52] haku: center of gravity standing up sucks too
[2024-11-16T22:27:02] Noname: Well then join an emoto race not the escooter one
[2024-11-16T22:27:21] haku: escooters can have seats is all im advocating
[2024-11-16T22:28:10] haku: when i get appointed in elons office. i will make sure all citizens gets seats and ride with cupholders and vapes in the other hand
[2024-11-16T22:28:43] Noname: But escoot with seat is dumb. Just get emoto.
[2024-11-16T22:29:13] Noname: Wobbly pole seat high handlebars and lil battery and wheels
[2024-11-16T22:29:32] haku: what if all you have is scooter? can you just put a seat
[2024-11-16T22:29:45] haku: thats why cut the stems
[2024-11-16T22:30:07] Noname: Depends on laws. Nobody would care here
[2024-11-16T22:30:38] haku: i guess all of eu has seated laws
[2024-11-16T22:30:49] haku: thats unfortunate
[2024-11-16T22:31:13] Noname: We do
[2024-11-16T22:31:49] haku: do we. its never enforced
[2024-11-16T22:32:22] haku: lots of kids have scooter on seats going to school
[2024-11-16T22:33:06] Yamal: Seat no seat all its okay if you like
[2024-11-16T22:33:45] haku: i will not push my ideology. but give it a try boys. its gamechanger
[2024-11-16T22:34:17] Noname: What cop is gonna be a dick and ticket a child.
[2024-11-16T22:34:28] haku: wepoor so comfy scooter. you dont even feel your going fast
[2024-11-16T22:38:05] haku: even adults seated on the bikelane or sidewalk never gets ticketed
[2024-11-16T22:39:06] Noname: You live in a city of drugs crime and prostitution, yeah let me waste my time on a lady running errands going 12mph
[2024-11-16T22:39:53] haku: prostitute drug lords on seated scooters never gets pulled over though
[2024-11-16T22:40:31] haku: they will only get you here if you fuck with the casinos money
[2024-11-16T23:04:38] Yamal: Vesc project !!!
[2024-11-16T23:19:11] haku: this is the quality of life king here.

[2024-11-16T23:48:17] Yamal: <photos/photo_19437@16-11-2024_23-48-17.jpg>

[2024-11-17T01:59:01] haku: my first choice was a durag but this looks better
[2024-11-17T01:59:52] Ion: Still looking to sell this dual UBOX, would also trade for a single UBOX 85/150, or sell it for how much a single ubox costs currently
[2024-11-17T02:03:11] haku: how many phase and battery can that do?
[2024-11-17T02:03:30] haku: its 60v only yea?
[2024-11-17T02:04:26] Ion: Probably @jamessoderstrom knows exactly but I think it can handle up to 75V and about 150A phase If I remember. But I'm sadly EU tho, not sure if I could ship to you xD
[2024-11-17T02:05:47] haku: thats the OG one that folks say is the best dual one
[2024-11-17T02:14:22] Ion: Yep ❤️

[2024-11-17T03:41:06] Finn: Even awg 8 phase wires and not so expensive
[2024-11-17T03:42:35] haku: lower current than old version 240 battery
[2024-11-17T03:44:26] haku: i wonder if 10 battery amps make a difference at the same phase
[2024-11-17T03:52:37] haku: why spintend doesnt want to make 18 or more fets
[2024-11-17T03:53:45] Noname: Lower your and try

[2024-11-17T03:54:14] haku: thats substancial amount
[2024-11-17T03:54:53] Noname: Not really you were hitting 14kw? And it wasn't turned up full
[2024-11-17T03:55:12] Noname: Wouldn't matter if you can't reach top draw anyway
[2024-11-17T03:55:32] haku: yea but cant burnout. now i put to 250/300phase easy burnout. more torque
[2024-11-17T03:56:04] haku: i think my motor is good up to 400phase.
[2024-11-17T03:57:46] haku: they also sell i love china 80h. https://spintend.com/products/72v-6000w-powerful-hubmotor-for-scooter-racing
[2024-11-17T03:58:40] haku: they need a controller to saturate one of those 33x2
[2024-11-17T03:59:39] Noname: Either way your not maxing out what you have so 10a os nothing
[2024-11-17T04:00:12] haku: true
[2024-11-17T04:00:36] haku: when i can ill still get the older version 12fet though
[2024-11-17T04:00:39] Noname: What was your peak power
[2024-11-17T04:00:49] haku: 24kw
[2024-11-17T04:01:07] haku: at 77mph
[2024-11-17T04:01:17] Noname: Woof but still not maxed
[2024-11-17T04:01:38] haku: this was the very first speed run on highway
[2024-11-17T04:01:59] haku: then it went down to 22kw at 80mph. very wierd
[2024-11-17T04:02:20] Noname: Battery sag or lower V
[2024-11-17T04:02:25] haku: maybe yea
[2024-11-17T04:02:54] haku: next time ima borrow grammas truck drive there and test full battery
[2024-11-17T04:02:57] Noname: Accelerating pulls power mabey it wasn't as windy
[2024-11-17T04:03:06] haku: true
[2024-11-17T04:06:25] haku: need to make that mini bmx dream happen. riding my boys peak g30 over standing scooter. such a nice ride even with solid and hardtail
[2024-11-17T05:12:45] haku: is it possible to have 2 different magnet width motors but the same windings? example 80h in rear and 70h in front?
[2024-11-17T05:13:50] haku: also the seven vescs do you have to make a milled case for it? they only sell pcb?
[2024-11-17T05:47:45] Noname: Same winding fine. It's no worse than changing ramp time or whatever. Just same winding so one isn't pushing the other past it's ability

[2024-11-17T22:22:04] haku: maybe yea. try it 20s 4p 18650 folded is a tight fit
[2024-11-17T22:23:26] Pandalgns: I will have to remove the bags from inside the backpack and all the fabrics and leave only the outside and even then it will fit very very tight
[2024-11-17T22:53:56] haku: wich 5l bag is it?

[2024-11-18T00:46:53] haku: looks good.
[2024-11-18T00:53:51] NetworkDir: Expensive asf but i understand you live in israil and on your situation normal price generally not bad and not very good just its fine
[2024-11-18T01:00:40] haku: surron boys wilding out today. im in hiding
[2024-11-18T01:17:22] haku: fresh off the chop shop.
[2024-11-18T01:24:01] haku: is langfiete kugoo rebrand?
[2024-11-18T01:24:31] haku: the designs look good imo.
[2024-11-18T01:48:00] haku: whats the difference between the older ly tubed rim motors and the new tubeless split rims? is it the same exact stator? if it is this is a good deal imo.
[2024-11-18T01:48:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-18T01:48:00] haku: <photos/photo_19466@18-11-2024_01-48-00.jpg>
[2024-11-18T05:53:54] Jason: tbh id recommend buying directly from ly
[2024-11-18T05:55:29] haku: this is LY sister company i think. this is where they sell old stock
[2024-11-18T05:57:09] haku: this is the old version non removable motor. 70h. its prolly the same exact stator just different housing and rim
[2024-11-18T06:05:38] haku: they even use momen motor as an example lol
[2024-11-18T06:10:39] Jason: xd
[2024-11-18T07:22:50] Yamal: Good morning, it is normally the traction control used in the competition. @Foujiwara, @SibClimb

[2024-11-18T08:17:03] Yamal: The way to come work
[2024-11-18T08:38:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It has nothing to do with the situation now it'll be same price normal times in isreal
[2024-11-18T08:38:24] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Mongolian Yurt?

[2024-11-18T12:40:32] cihan: Did you have the chance to open deck of wolf warrior x? I wonder if those no name cells are any good since price difference between wolf warrior x gt and regular model is pretty high.

[2024-11-18T13:42:25] 'lekrsu': It's a toggle in the App - ADC tab
[2024-11-18T13:44:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'll take a look and see what I can get, hehe, thanks a lot, machine
[2024-11-18T13:46:20] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_19475@18-11-2024_13-46-20.jpg>

[2024-11-18T15:13:57] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: watch him do it with the phone when he sets it all up
[2024-11-18T15:14:52] 'lekrsu': You should only set ADC and traction control on the local VESC, rather than on the one connected in can as well.
[2024-11-18T15:27:44] JPPL: ONLY on astectic cuz specs are old school!
[2024-11-18T15:42:51] Yamal: Lets GO
[2024-11-18T15:51:30] Yamal: But the first one wich esc have ? I still remember your “11x” have g300, your scooter with seat maker x 2x1 esc but this..?
[2024-11-18T15:51:52] Yamal: Purple one
[2024-11-18T15:59:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is it a rion ?
[2024-11-18T16:00:24] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have to wait, they have to bring black silicone for joints, the plague the other day and that's what always happens hahaha
[2024-11-18T16:01:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When I opened the controllers, there was sand on the beach between the lid and the controller. I have never been to the beach with the scooter, but I have passed very close.
[2024-11-18T16:02:03] Yamal: it's wonderful to share starting experiences with the different types of vesc that exist, because otherwise they would do more to them and teach us to know them, and of course everything is interesting from the temperatures of the ESC to the general A's that they work and support, peak watts,
[2024-11-18T16:02:07] Yamal: No
[2024-11-18T16:03:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then ?
[2024-11-18T16:36:19] haku: thats a good tire. i use the 13" of that
[2024-11-18T16:37:43] Ms Cars: Hey Guys hopefully you can help me, i wanna start tuning my Kukirin G2 Master (2x1000W) 52V, 20.8Ah. But im new to tuning and really dont know anything like i can work with electricity but with tuning im likely new. I heard that VSEC is good and i need like 2x Ubox Lite or smth someone proposed it, idk if thats correct but can u guys tell me what i need and where i can maybe watch tutorials what i need at all and stuff or can someone explain me. I would be very thankful
[2024-11-18T16:42:14] Ms Cars: what kind of tuning is mean is probably better accelleration and top speed, but top speed isnt that important
[2024-11-18T16:42:52] Ms Cars: i mean*
[2024-11-18T16:45:22] Max Rainlogix: for better acceleration you need better controller (vesc), and better battery on high-current cells (preferably)
[2024-11-18T16:50:44] cihan: Is that OFFBONDAGE headlights on the top of the stem? :)
[2024-11-18T16:53:03] Ms Cars: so better battery is a must
[2024-11-18T16:53:11] Ms Cars: wich obe you recommend
[2024-11-18T16:53:30] Ms Cars: for the g2 master
[2024-11-18T16:54:22] Ms Cars: and for example what would i need if i wanted more speed
[2024-11-18T16:59:51] Yamal: on the way back testing a little with 76v in 20s

[2024-11-18T17:16:04] Yamal: Better to change the connector, right? Last night I realized that I had one of the two a little inside.
[2024-11-18T17:23:34] Max Rainlogix: battery on samsung 21700 50S or E cells and switch to 60v
[2024-11-18T17:27:53] Rose: Hey there Holy, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-11-18T17:36:18] Max Rainlogix: from your 52v battery to 60v to more speed
[2024-11-18T17:36:29] Max Rainlogix: 14s to 16s
[2024-11-18T17:43:49] Rose: Hey there roscheeee, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-11-18T17:49:57] Max Rainlogix: 14s - 52v 16s - 60v 16*4,2(max capacity of 1 cell) =67,2v(max capacity of battery) 20s - 72v
[2024-11-18T17:54:25] Max Rainlogix: That’s very good cells, If you suddenly want to put more powerful controllers, then these cells have a large resource
[2024-11-18T17:59:07] Ms Cars: thanks so this are perfekt
[2024-11-18T17:59:28] Ms Cars: but its enough for VESC controller?

[2024-11-18T19:32:56] Max Rainlogix: during winter
[2024-11-18T19:33:07] Yamal: Nice
[2024-11-18T19:34:00] Max Rainlogix: where is it))
[2024-11-18T19:35:06] Yamal: My next project is a dt thunder too, it will arrive next month
[2024-11-18T19:35:13] Yamal: Romania
[2024-11-18T19:36:08] Max Rainlogix: nope
[2024-11-18T19:37:40] Yamal: I told you because a boy from this group posted a photo of several Thunder and not of them he was wearing a vesc that's why I told you xD
[2024-11-18T19:40:46] haku: lonnyo is 110mm isnt it?
[2024-11-18T19:41:30] Max Rainlogix: dropout size 142mm
[2024-11-18T19:41:38] haku: i mean stator size
[2024-11-18T19:41:55] Max Rainlogix: lonnyo has only one motor with those specs
[2024-11-18T19:42:10] rosheee: 115mm @ 60mm
[2024-11-18T19:42:24] Max Rainlogix: not sure but i heard that it has 115 stator
[2024-11-18T19:42:35] rosheee: 70h 110mm
[2024-11-18T19:42:48] haku: gotcha
[2024-11-18T19:43:17] Max Rainlogix: oh k
[2024-11-18T19:43:29] haku: so 60h is 115 and 70h-80h is 110
[2024-11-18T19:44:06] rosheee: from what i have - see
[2024-11-18T19:44:24] rosheee: have to check other documents but not today
[2024-11-18T19:44:42] haku: whats the difference between the old 70h and the new 70h? is it still the same stator size?
[2024-11-18T19:44:52] haku: i have the tubeless split rim
[2024-11-18T19:45:22] haku: if its the same exact stator the old one is pretty cheap
[2024-11-18T19:48:15] Max Rainlogix: thats the best technology that people ever made
[2024-11-18T19:49:08] haku: it is but if your just buying just for cheap performance the old one is still relevant if its still the same stator
[2024-11-18T19:50:09] Max Rainlogix: ill buy it from tao for only 200$
[2024-11-18T19:50:49] haku: dam thats cheap

[2024-11-18T19:52:55] haku: i hate overpaying but thanks for that advice
[2024-11-18T19:53:03] Yamal: 200 its very good price

[2024-11-18T22:30:26] Yamal: Now its he time for ride there !
[2024-11-18T22:30:42] Andrei Albert: The world of scooter has fallen
[2024-11-18T22:30:49] Yamal: You now are the surron killer
[2024-11-18T22:30:50] Andrei Albert: At least here in Ro
[2024-11-18T22:31:12] haku: it just evolved
[2024-11-18T22:31:14] Andrei Albert: I barely sell
[2024-11-18T22:31:23] Yamal: Who ^^’

[2024-11-18T22:31:35] Давно пора: Illegal boyzz
[2024-11-18T22:31:46] Andrei Albert: Yep
[2024-11-18T22:31:50] NetworkDir: Yes very big but in my opinon shitty real top speed should 135kmh :) but really push 40kW on low kv motors and insane torque
[2024-11-18T22:32:21] Andrei Albert: Hows the controllers handling the temps
[2024-11-18T22:32:30] Andrei Albert: At that weight and power
[2024-11-18T22:32:35] NetworkDir: if he have a 33x3 or something proably can reach 170km/h but with langfeite trail lol he will dead
[2024-11-18T22:32:42] Yamal: The 3Shulless
[2024-11-18T22:32:44] haku: i actually like how frame looks and the color. the aftermarket screws and all the other stuff added not so much
[2024-11-18T22:33:19] NetworkDir: it's depends outside temp also on 400A phase 200A batt and some fwk it's reach on 70C so not happy with max limits
[2024-11-18T22:33:33] NetworkDir: the capasitors on 3shul seems little bit shitty
[2024-11-18T22:33:35] Yamal: Why can’t ride ?
[2024-11-18T22:33:46] NetworkDir: 12V dc-dc unreliable much noise on UART and etc ..
[2024-11-18T22:34:15] Yamal: He need get motor for complete the machine ,,
[2024-11-18T22:34:20] NetworkDir: Yeah
[2024-11-18T22:34:36] Yamal: 80h33/2
[2024-11-18T22:34:44] haku: holy shit this one crazy! https://youtu.be/ldnIdPyjFBU?si=rmd0dykz0x2tsKbX

[2024-11-18T22:36:21] NetworkDir: 😆 ebike low kv motors with chinese controller
[2024-11-18T22:36:54] NetworkDir: yes
[2024-11-18T22:36:57] haku: its ebike/moped motor haha
[2024-11-18T22:37:00] NetworkDir: but temp go brrrrrrrrr
[2024-11-18T22:37:05] NetworkDir: +70C
[2024-11-18T22:37:37] Andrei Albert: A lot of weight thoo
[2024-11-18T22:38:51] Andrei Albert: I hope mine will be around 60kg
[2024-11-18T22:39:09] Yamal: No need use fw..
[2024-11-18T22:41:39] haku: up to how many vescs can you connect in can?
[2024-11-18T22:43:46] 'lekrsu': Read just now that the predefined limit was set to four if going by can
[2024-11-18T22:49:50] haku: so cant build one of those electric tank tracks then 😭
[2024-11-18T22:53:01] Finn: <photos/photo_19488@18-11-2024_22-53-01.jpg>
[2024-11-18T22:53:01] Finn: Finally it seems to run very well on 34,9V rn
[2024-11-18T22:56:56] haku: how do you control it with your phone?
[2024-11-18T22:57:07] haku: the throttle
[2024-11-18T23:08:21] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_19489@18-11-2024_23-08-21.jpg>
[2024-11-18T23:08:21] 'lekrsu': Disable adc and you can control it via the "controls" tab
[2024-11-18T23:11:27] Rose: Hey there azzi, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-11-18T23:40:32] haku: gotcha thanks. thats pretty cool

[2024-11-18T23:41:42] haku: print titanium frames
[2024-11-18T23:48:33] Yamal: Wifi
[2024-11-18T23:55:26] Finn: Nice antenna
[2024-11-18T23:55:38] Finn: I made this mess
[2024-11-19T00:10:04] haku: anyone try this exa?
[2024-11-19T00:16:58] 'lekrsu': Nice ))
[2024-11-19T02:22:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes, I guess
[2024-11-19T03:24:18] haku: incredible. built his own scooter from ground up. https://youtu.be/jOvg6N2LQx4?si=yQcLSI55pIYXmoKR

[2024-11-19T04:13:36] haku: must be nice to ride by the ocean
[2024-11-19T04:14:20] JPPL: Só good this night! 30min just for chill
[2024-11-19T06:51:21] Yamal: Very nice ! What app is this? Display ,,?
[2024-11-19T08:13:50] Yamal: <photos/photo_19494@19-11-2024_08-13-50.jpg>
[2024-11-19T08:13:50] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-11-19T08:18:47] Yamal: little by little testing the new electronics everything remains the same from its assembly 130A battery //// 200A phase. (x2)
[2024-11-19T08:23:00] Lieven L.: <photos/photo_19495@19-11-2024_08-23-00.jpg>
[2024-11-19T10:24:18] Yamal: V nominal on 22s = 84v?
[2024-11-19T10:27:25] 'lekrsu': 22*3.6
[2024-11-19T10:33:48] Yamal: 79,2?
[2024-11-19T10:35:38] 'lekrsu': ye
[2024-11-19T10:37:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, and we say 80V usually
[2024-11-19T10:39:40] Yamal: 80v x 400 A battery= watt continuos ?
[2024-11-19T10:40:20] 'lekrsu': Scooters won't operate in a continuous matter
[2024-11-19T10:41:32] 'lekrsu': However a battery outputting 400A at 80v, including voltage drop, would be 32000W.
[2024-11-19T10:42:58] Max Rainlogix: 23 if I remember right
[2024-11-19T10:43:08] Max Rainlogix: 23s - 84v nominal
[2024-11-19T10:43:30] Max Rainlogix: 20s - 72v nominal
[2024-11-19T10:45:22] 'lekrsu': 82.8, simple multiplication
[2024-11-19T10:45:42] 'lekrsu': No reason to get inaccurate
[2024-11-19T10:45:45] Max Rainlogix: 23×4,2
[2024-11-19T10:46:00] 'lekrsu': 4.2 would be full charge rather than nominal
[2024-11-19T10:46:09] Max Rainlogix: Yeah right
[2024-11-19T10:46:18] 'lekrsu': Nominal would be at 50%.
[2024-11-19T10:46:25] Max Rainlogix: 3,6
[2024-11-19T11:04:23] Yamal: All this very interesting
[2024-11-19T11:05:23] Yamal: No its the same peak WATTSSSS than wattss your scooter can handle and work for (x) time
[2024-11-19T11:34:20] Yamal: Omega 3 xD
[2024-11-19T11:46:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I would have to activate it on both controllers or only on the front one so that it detects the rear one

[2024-11-19T11:47:44] 'lekrsu': Only the one marked as "local", not both.

[2024-11-19T13:29:19] RicharDON: Guys, does anyone know why if I accelerate all the way from a standstill the engine stutters? But if I give a little initial push then it works perfectly, do you know how to fix it?
[2024-11-19T13:32:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Your scooter doesn't use a hall sensor
[2024-11-19T13:43:30] Yamal: https://youtu.be/xc7MB2rc6IU?si=1e8FdYyNVg7ocuKs

[2024-11-19T18:38:52] 'lekrsu': Looks insanely satisfying
[2024-11-19T18:41:17] Pandalgns: Nah... i dont like peace, i like problems, always 😂😂

[2024-11-19T18:44:41] haku: thats awsome
[2024-11-19T18:45:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wolf ?
[2024-11-19T18:45:29] Pandalgns: Halo t107pro
[2024-11-19T18:45:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How did you fit such larg phases ?
[2024-11-19T18:46:30] Pandalgns: Drilling the hole from 8 to 10
[2024-11-19T18:47:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Scary stuff bro
[2024-11-19T18:47:05] haku: thats prolly difficult with hardened steel
[2024-11-19T18:47:19] haku: what bit did you use?
[2024-11-19T18:47:44] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_19511@19-11-2024_18-47-44.jpg>
[2024-11-19T18:48:15] haku: ill try that on laotie motor if bigger cables cant fit
[2024-11-19T18:48:45] Pandalgns: I put 12awg but now have another problem and i dont know how to fix that
[2024-11-19T18:49:01] haku: did you do it for both motors?
[2024-11-19T18:49:12] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_19512@19-11-2024_18-49-12.jpg>

[2024-11-19T18:49:44] Pandalgns: The axle and the cables do not pass through the bearing I want to cry

[2024-11-19T18:50:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I ordered one but the thickness is shit I prolly made a maistake
[2024-11-19T18:50:39] haku: what did you end up doing to fit it
[2024-11-19T18:51:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This thick for wolf motor
[2024-11-19T18:51:11] haku: ill prolly just end up putting a harness with temp cable
[2024-11-19T18:51:11] Pandalgns: I still don't fit it, I'm thinking of a solution.
[2024-11-19T18:51:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (60h)
[2024-11-19T18:51:55] Pandalgns: I am thinking of looking for bearings with the same external diameter but larger internal diameter
[2024-11-19T18:51:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is it enough or wait for the thickner one ?
[2024-11-19T18:52:20] haku: get one with a temp sensor imo
[2024-11-19T18:52:23] Pandalgns: no, I thought wrong... it wouldn't work
[2024-11-19T18:52:41] haku: gotcha
[2024-11-19T18:52:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Had temp sensor vesc didn't like
[2024-11-19T18:53:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Was Inaccurate
[2024-11-19T18:53:27] haku: what sensor you have?
[2024-11-19T18:53:43] Pandalgns: I think I already know the solution, take out a phase cable, put the cover in, put the phase cable back in
[2024-11-19T18:53:50] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂
[2024-11-19T18:54:24] Pandalgns: It's a pain but it's the only solution I see possible.
[2024-11-19T18:54:45] haku: i want to mess around with these motors. need temp cable and see if what kind of cooling solutions available
[2024-11-19T18:56:21] haku: im put out scientific data for da boys
[2024-11-19T18:56:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I had and I don't remember
[2024-11-19T18:56:45] haku: ntc10k?
[2024-11-19T18:56:57] Pandalgns: I have a very very good temp sensor
[2024-11-19T18:57:10] Pandalgns: My temp sensor 😂😂😂
[2024-11-19T18:57:32] Pandalgns: If it burn my hand... its overheat 😂😂

[2024-11-19T19:35:38] haku: nice.
[2024-11-19T19:35:51] haku: that looks really clean
[2024-11-19T19:35:58] Pandalgns: I just needed to remove the cable covers, a little lubricant and patience
[2024-11-19T19:36:26] haku: test it. jump on curbs and see first if it holds up before you speed test
[2024-11-19T19:42:31] haku: this is next level but it needs a seat. https://youtube.com/shorts/gsCIggR1DLQ?si=kS7lA49TtI8l5O_s

[2024-11-19T20:45:34] 'lekrsu': battA * battV would be the same as motorA * motorV. Unless you're going at top speed, motorV's lower than battV.

[2024-11-19T22:46:53] Pandalgns: 1 sub more 💪
[2024-11-19T22:47:32] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-11-19T22:48:27] Yamal: this deserves a speed test
[2024-11-19T22:49:00] Jason: just use big motor with smaller vesc
[2024-11-19T22:49:10] Jason: go to the edge of current limit lol
[2024-11-19T23:08:47] Max Rainlogix: 70h isn’t big?
[2024-11-19T23:08:57] Max Rainlogix: 16*4
[2024-11-19T23:09:16] Jason: isnt that big for 85150
[2024-11-19T23:09:39] NetworkDir: but on limits
[2024-11-19T23:09:49] Jason: mm
[2024-11-19T23:10:00] NetworkDir: 70H 16x4 can handle +200A phsae and 80A batt very easily
[2024-11-19T23:10:06] Jason: mmm
[2024-11-19T23:10:14] Jason: nice
[2024-11-19T23:10:16] NetworkDir: top speed will 70 i think on 20s but fuckeria torque fwk needed
[2024-11-19T23:10:35] NetworkDir: 85150 can't handle 200A phase and +70A fwk cont i think
[2024-11-19T23:10:38] NetworkDir: so better use 85250
[2024-11-19T23:12:24] Max Rainlogix: Sizes don’t allow
[2024-11-19T23:12:53] Max Rainlogix: All sizes are designed for 85150
[2024-11-19T23:13:06] haku: the new 12 fet might fit. its smaller
[2024-11-19T23:13:20] haku: <photos/photo_19524@19-11-2024_23-13-20.jpg>
[2024-11-19T23:14:42] haku: shit mounting holes though
[2024-11-19T23:14:45] Max Rainlogix: From the front side of the deck to the battery is about 5cm
[2024-11-19T23:19:15] Jan: 34mm instead of 24mm is already a no go for me
[2024-11-19T23:19:49] Jan: In any case its reducing packaging density in a fully built vesc scooter
[2024-11-19T23:20:36] haku: yea not good for your setup.
[2024-11-19T23:54:38] Pandalgns: Whatafak, i put 180a phase and 60a battery on my 45h 1000w 😂😂 and i gonna put 350 a phase more or less on my 60h 22x3 3000w call me crazy 😂😂
[2024-11-19T23:55:53] NetworkDir: XD but your temp should reach +90C Also low kv motors on high currents get warm, not like 22x3 cool
[2024-11-19T23:58:13] Pandalgns: No, my 1000w motor, if I'm honest, it hardly heats up at all, it's incredible but true, it must also be said that I run it at 52v, but I have it set to 180a phase and 60 battery but it barely heats up, it reaches about 70kmh and it accelerates, it's a pleasure
[2024-11-19T23:59:40] NetworkDir: Voltage depends also
[2024-11-19T23:59:55] Pandalgns: Anyway, I'm glad to know that big motors heat up less 🤣🤣 the big scooter is going to have a lot of power
[2024-11-20T00:00:39] haku: 33x2 heats up too. why is that?
[2024-11-20T00:00:48] haku: too much amps?
[2024-11-20T00:01:14] Pandalgns: 33x2 is a torque motor sure?
[2024-11-20T00:01:49] Max Rainlogix: Ultra speed motor
[2024-11-20T00:02:03] haku: i put 250bat 300phase it turned into a hot torque motor
[2024-11-20T00:02:23] haku: i hear you can even put 400 on 70h
[2024-11-20T00:02:29] Max Rainlogix: Speed motors needs way more amps
[2024-11-20T00:04:03] Pandalgns: As far as I know, high speed motors need more amps to counteract that lack of torque, and high torque motors need more voltage to counteract the lack of speed.
[2024-11-20T00:04:23] haku: thats my understanding too
[2024-11-20T00:05:08] Pandalgns: but I also understand that high torque motors hold amps better than speed ones.
[2024-11-20T00:05:33] haku: what i dont understand is battery and phase amps connection.
[2024-11-20T00:05:56] haku: what does increasing battery amps do if phase is the same
[2024-11-20T00:06:21] Pandalgns: I also have problems understanding that 😂😂
[2024-11-20T00:06:49] haku: help us out boys. educate us about this
[2024-11-20T00:07:14] haku: what is the purpose of increasing battery amps
[2024-11-20T00:07:29] Pandalgns: No matter how much they try to explain it to me, the relationship between phase and battery amperes is not clear to me.
[2024-11-20T00:08:43] haku: theres a graph that @jamessoderstrom shared before but i still dont undersrand. brain is too smooth like bowling ball
[2024-11-20T00:11:28] Pandalgns: Can someone give me an explanation adapted for stupid people?😂😂
[2024-11-20T00:15:28] NetworkDir: Low KV motors provide good torque at lower currents, but their maximum speed (vmax) and top speed are limited. To fix this, you need to use higher voltage and apply field weakening. The benefit is greater range due to better efficiency and strong torque. However, if you push too much current through a low KV motor, it can overheat. So, choosing the best motor winding depends on your specific application. On the other hand, high KV motors can achieve high speeds—like 180 km/h in free wheel, for example—but their torque at lower currents is poor. To compensate, you’ll need to push higher phase currents. If your goal is to set a top-speed record, high KV motors like 33x2 can work, but for activities like burnouts, they’re a bad option. In my opinion, if top speed isn’t your priority, it’s better to use low KV or balanced motors. The torque and power you’ll feel are incredible. You can also try using ferrofluid in your motors, increase the voltage to 20s+, and experiment with field weakening. Personally, I love G30 motors running at 72V with field weakening. After activating field weakening, it feels like turbo mode kicks in—just like a supercharger, haha!
[2024-11-20T00:15:38] NetworkDir: Oh very long text xD sorry
[2024-11-20T00:20:50] Pandalgns: Whatafak.... wait for my Google translate 😂😂
[2024-11-20T00:22:12] haku: thanks coach
[2024-11-20T00:22:43] Pandalgns: I have a 9x g30 motor with adapted disc brake 😏😏
[2024-11-20T00:22:57] haku: fwk and 33x2 is nono yea
[2024-11-20T00:23:08] NetworkDir: Basically useless
[2024-11-20T00:24:12] Pandalgns: ok then in my 22x3 a lot of phase amps a lot of voltage and fwk and let's fly 🤣🤣 pray for me
[2024-11-20T00:27:10] Pandalgns: I'm going to sleep gentlemen, in Spain it's 12:30 at night and tomorrow we're working hard, I'll show you more progress with the hulkinator 🤣🤣 the next thing is to reinforce the chassis and weld the fold to make the fixed fold, good night guys
[2024-11-20T00:27:35] Max Rainlogix: In Russia is 2:30am already
[2024-11-20T00:27:48] Max Rainlogix: Yeah I should go to sleep

[2024-11-20T02:37:26] haku: no monies
[2024-11-20T02:37:56] Noname: Yeah from ordering more parts. I had Ramen yesterday
[2024-11-20T02:56:57] haku: too much torque for the dyno. need to strap it.
[2024-11-20T08:18:04] Yamal: Hello Francesco, how are you my friend? I'm starting now with that electronics... even so the first impressions are monstrous, very happy!
[2024-11-20T08:21:42] Yamal: <photos/photo_19526@20-11-2024_08-21-42.jpg>
[2024-11-20T08:24:23] Yamal: waiting for my speed test, not for my top speed but rather to see the peak power of this electronic based on my configuration, but today I am happy I am beginning to understand some things
[2024-11-20T08:41:04] Yamal: It's my birthday at Vesc, and I'm turning 1 year old. I started in this world with Tronic 250/r/little FOCer for short. and they were the gateway to this great world created by King BV. Based on my experience and that of the teachers who teach us here, I have drawn some powerful conclusions from both electronics, how? multiplying total battery amps by nominal voltage of my battery (72v-20s). With tronic 250 I pushed 200A total battery which meant that my real "sustainable" power was = 200 x72 = 14,400wts, that's why Jan also said that when I posted captures with 18/19/20kw it was really the limit and therefore put peaks,! This morning it came with 300A total battery which means 300x72=21,600wtt which I could be driving without even being able to see the maximum peaks of this ESC based on my configuration of motors, battery and controller
[2024-11-20T08:45:39] Yamal: I do not compare them, they are simple conclusions of power of the 2esc
[2024-11-20T08:45:39] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-11-20T12:46:34] Max Rainlogix: Samsung 50e is good cells
[2024-11-20T12:51:02] francois schempers: you shouldn't, for that price you're just gonna get scammed, ask in this group, they are several battery maker that will make a custom one for you for a fair price
[2024-11-20T12:52:44] Ms Cars: oh i didnt know, do you know some good battery makers
[2024-11-20T12:58:22] francois schempers: @jamessoderstrom @Mirono_escooters for starters already did some work with the g2 format, you could start with them, but they are plenty more in this group

[2024-11-20T20:44:27] puneDir: man gas is amazing
[2024-11-20T20:44:34] puneDir: electric is always anxiety
[2024-11-20T20:45:13] haku: gas will always be superior. but electronics is fun
[2024-11-20T20:46:42] haku: but i think everything has been done to gas motors. electric tech just at its infancy
[2024-11-20T20:47:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Electric pulles more then gas
[2024-11-20T20:48:06] haku: turbo, supercharger, natural aspirated, nos
[2024-11-20T20:48:10] puneDir: Pulles what
[2024-11-20T20:48:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Gas you buy electric you duils
[2024-11-20T20:48:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The rider bro
[2024-11-20T20:48:37] puneDir: i dont want electric for long time
[2024-11-20T20:48:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't you remember ? At any speed you feel full acceleration
[2024-11-20T20:49:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: At least be here to see my zero10x get 11inch 60h dual
[2024-11-20T20:49:40] haku: wait till you get electric motors with gears.
[2024-11-20T20:49:54] haku: and clutch
[2024-11-20T20:50:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Be done in 3 weeks top after that I'll maybe get 72v battery from @ReChargy 😉😉
[2024-11-20T20:51:53] puneDir: yeah but
[2024-11-20T20:51:54] puneDir: Range
[2024-11-20T20:52:04] haku: pistons vs Lgbt transistors. pick your poison
[2024-11-20T20:52:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: You are right In that point
[2024-11-20T20:52:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro that's in cars
[2024-11-20T20:53:07] puneDir: igbt
[2024-11-20T20:53:11] puneDir: used in cars
[2024-11-20T20:53:17] haku: all motors have pistons dude
[2024-11-20T20:53:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But small electric vehicles we rulle
[2024-11-20T20:53:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The varg is doing good without them
[2024-11-20T20:53:41] haku: even tiny has rc motors have tiny pistons and rods
[2024-11-20T20:53:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Electric rc better
[2024-11-20T20:54:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Unless you go jet motor
[2024-11-20T20:54:34] haku: yes. i mean thats what im talkimg about. everything ls been done to gas motors.
[2024-11-20T20:55:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Build*
[2024-11-20T20:55:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll ask again because no answer Is a loose steering damper worse for stem wobble
[2024-11-20T20:55:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like it is sometimes loose sometimes hard
[2024-11-20T20:55:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like its missing oil
[2024-11-20T20:55:44] haku: is it. oh dam. im waiting for seller to reply
[2024-11-20T20:56:08] haku: ive never used one
[2024-11-20T20:57:35] haku: anyways electric tech is still too expensive for consumers. when it becomes mainstream it will be the future. but gas will still have its place. good for long distances
[2024-11-20T20:57:44] haku: oh gotcha
[2024-11-20T20:58:24] haku: so this is huameng not ly
[2024-11-20T20:58:40] haku: dam
[2024-11-20T20:59:18] haku: this is thier version of the big ly motors. just add air cool lol
[2024-11-20T21:04:07] Noname: Cold and buddy's are banged up and healing. No riding latley
[2024-11-20T21:05:01] Noname: Not when battery low. Gas is 100% till out of gas
[2024-11-20T21:06:13] haku: lmao look at this fiido. https://youtu.be/QL6bDBfydh0?si=9IL-fKuYxmjId6U1
[2024-11-20T21:06:48] haku: east coast boys crazy
[2024-11-20T21:15:59] haku: i told you boys there is a market for small bikes. but i will make the super tiny bike trend
[2024-11-20T21:49:45] Yamal: Bailalooooooo
[2024-11-20T21:49:53] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-11-20T21:53:23] cihan: Thank you, I had problem with no brand cells on Navee n65 so I'm afraid to have problem with no name Chinese cells again.

[2024-11-20T22:06:38] haku: idk what that means but i like it
[2024-11-20T22:14:12] Yamal: Says just “ dance it”
[2024-11-20T22:17:10] Yamal: Let's go for the power and speed test! scared the last time I saw fireworks
[2024-11-20T22:17:49] haku: dont be scared 12fet will not fail you.
[2024-11-20T22:18:01] haku: it only fails doing burnouts
[2024-11-20T22:20:17] Yamal: The first time I will use vesc tool much more special for me than GPS
[2024-11-20T22:20:23] haku: gps or it did not happen okay
[2024-11-20T22:21:29] haku: you can cheat vesctool but gps never lies
[2024-11-20T22:22:19] Yamal: You can open gps for take the data and use Vesc tool like prcincipal?
[2024-11-20T22:22:42] haku: yep or do multi window
[2024-11-20T22:23:02] Yamal: Same time 2 window how ?
[2024-11-20T22:23:24] haku: idk. android can do it
[2024-11-20T22:23:41] haku: im not sure exactly how in settings i forgot
[2024-11-20T22:24:31] haku: like this.
[2024-11-20T22:25:02] haku: i also have youtube in the side lmao
[2024-11-20T22:26:37] 'lekrsu': I made an app that only shows the camera for vesc screen recordings 😁
[2024-11-20T22:27:07] haku: yes thats the legit way imo. side by side vesctool and gps
[2024-11-20T22:27:55] haku: or get draggy
[2024-11-20T22:29:05] Yamal: Dont know how
[2024-11-20T22:29:28] haku: thats fine. just have gps running in background to confirm
[2024-11-20T22:32:17] haku: if theres a 3rd person camera that has gps that would be the ultimate confirmation
[2024-11-20T22:38:45] Yamal: Gps for what ?
[2024-11-20T22:38:47] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-11-20T22:39:22] haku: confirmation. gps or it did not happen. only way to legitimize speed test.
[2024-11-20T22:39:31] haku: those are american rules
[2024-11-20T22:40:11] 'lekrsu': kmh > mph
[2024-11-20T22:40:20] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-11-20T22:40:37] Yamal: I dont care if a really get 115/120/125 i want see the POWARRR
[2024-11-20T22:40:38] haku: metric>sae
[2024-11-20T22:40:41] Yamal: BEJAMIN POWER
[2024-11-20T22:40:54] haku: make him proud
[2024-11-20T22:41:04] Yamal: okay this os powar test
[2024-11-20T22:41:09] Yamal: Not sped test xd
[2024-11-20T22:41:31] haku: yea. power doesnt need gps
[2024-11-20T22:41:32] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-11-20T22:42:06] haku: but burnouts require videos just to see how thick the smoke is. those are my rules
[2024-11-20T22:42:51] haku: the thicker the smoke the better the burnout
[2024-11-20T22:44:55] Yamal: Now traccion control , dont have any more burnout😂
[2024-11-20T22:45:44] haku: turn that shit off. BV will be offended if you dont burnout
[2024-11-20T22:45:47] Yamal: XD 🔥
[2024-11-20T22:47:06] haku: good job. full gear!
[2024-11-20T22:47:41] haku: you must have $$$ to afford that. donate to my gofund me
[2024-11-20T22:48:01] Yamal: 🤫
[2024-11-20T22:48:58] haku: bv will be more proud if you ride with no shirt on. 6pack out
[2024-11-20T22:49:34] haku: chest hairs full
[2024-11-20T22:52:01] haku: i like thats how lord BV rides. shirtless with a full beard. and girls on his shoulder
[2024-11-20T22:56:01] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-11-20T23:01:00] cihan: Someone sells used Kaabo wolf warrior x at 7000 km for 1000 USD. New one costs 2200 USD. Should I buy the used one and build a battery or buy new one? Dual stem is highly praised for stability but there are single stem Dualtrons for cheaper price too. I'm not sure what's best scooter to get used or new under 2000 USD. Prices in Turkey are high as usual.
[2024-11-20T23:01:35] cihan: I considered the used one since I don't trust no name cells on the new one.
[2024-11-20T23:03:06] cihan: New one has 1200Wh battery and I think it's small for 4400W power. I'm not sure how long the motors can run at 4400W.
[2024-11-20T23:25:25] Yamal: Nothing happen traccion control fuck me I think
[2024-11-20T23:26:31] haku: i never use that feature
[2024-11-20T23:26:44] haku: i just use ramp time
[2024-11-20T23:29:42] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-11-20T23:31:06] Yamal: Indont cut well the video xD
[2024-11-20T23:32:22] haku: good stuff. your vesc temp is amazing
[2024-11-20T23:32:30] Yamal: I get 17kw , when i go work in the morning I get more with out traccion control
[2024-11-20T23:33:13] Yamal: After speed test i take out straight the traccion control and a get 18kw imagine?
[2024-11-20T23:33:25] Yamal: <photos/photo_19556@20-11-2024_23-33-25.jpg>
[2024-11-20T23:33:28] haku: fuck yea man! turn that shit off
[2024-11-20T23:33:44] haku: balls to the walls
[2024-11-20T23:34:10] Yamal: Its really off.l now tomorrow dont can but Friday can
[2024-11-20T23:34:53] haku: speed test with gps though. then balls to the walls. pin that shit till it cant anymore
[2024-11-20T23:35:00] Yamal: Try again on the highway
[2024-11-20T23:35:19] haku: make BV proud
[2024-11-20T23:36:15] haku: you can prolly 20+ kw that badboy
[2024-11-20T23:36:19] Yamal: 8am for go work,,, so traccion control fuck your power i think….
[2024-11-20T23:36:35] haku: there we go
[2024-11-20T23:37:03] haku: why does traction control limit watts?
[2024-11-20T23:37:07] Oreo huzky: It’s crap I have to
[2024-11-20T23:37:53] haku: ok double confirmation. i will not get one
[2024-11-20T23:37:58] Oreo huzky: It’s 60h
[2024-11-20T23:38:10] haku: ok thanks. good to know
[2024-11-20T23:39:02] haku: im amazed by vesc temps
[2024-11-20T23:39:18] Oreo huzky: Maybe something inside the motor had something similar tiny stone was inside
[2024-11-20T23:41:25] haku: but remember be safe though. but balls to walls okay. gps too
[2024-11-20T23:42:38] haku: whats the weather temperature in your area.

[2024-11-20T23:56:59] Yamal: (Traccion control) does it really affect the power of your esc and top speed? @Foujiwara
[2024-11-21T00:03:18] JPPL: At top speed for sure both wheela are at same rotation
[2024-11-21T00:03:40] JPPL: So dont think so
[2024-11-21T00:04:06] JPPL: If tou want to try topspeee test and make sure it dont afect Turn it off
[2024-11-21T00:09:53] Yamal: I feel like I can get 24/25 kw easily, but tonight only 17 on a nice highway
[2024-11-21T00:10:13] Yamal: Benjamin where are you
[2024-11-21T00:10:45] haku: turn up the amps my boy
[2024-11-21T00:11:45] haku: i just talked to BV. he said turn it up. 300phase. 250battery
[2024-11-21T00:12:47] haku: make the 40t crip walk
[2024-11-21T00:14:20] haku: this aint no 6fet tronic my boy this is 12fet

[2024-11-21T00:26:18] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-21T00:26:52] Noname: Is that a trike?
[2024-11-21T00:28:11] Yamal: No thanks

[2024-11-21T00:30:26] Yamal: No its about the balls
[2024-11-21T00:30:46] Yamal: Its about the money, y dont want broken my motor
[2024-11-21T00:31:20] haku: thats not bad tbh.

[2024-11-21T01:18:40] haku: im still waiting on a vsett11 trade deal
[2024-11-21T01:20:28] haku: or trade for tesla cyber quad
[2024-11-21T01:21:11] Lieven L.: Towing man 😉 Energy density is still a big issue for batteries compared to gas. But I really like to ride with free electrons from my solar roof. 👌
[2024-11-21T01:23:00] haku: yea battery tech needs more improvement. i say use nuclear batteries. thats prolly the best option
[2024-11-21T01:24:37] haku: imagine riding moto sitting on a nuclear battery. radioactive nuts baby. but seriously im sure there are stuff now that prolly protect against radiation
[2024-11-21T01:26:16] Lieven L.: Hard to do if you ask me, many people can't even handle shitty batteries from china 🔥
[2024-11-21T01:26:35] haku: true
[2024-11-21T01:27:36] Lieven L.: Diesel is pretty good in terms of safety and density. It just burns pretty dirty. 😅

[2024-11-21T02:49:24] haku: do you know anything about this new ampace cell.
[2024-11-21T02:49:55] Paolo ⁭: This format exist already
[2024-11-21T02:50:06] haku: this is old?
[2024-11-21T02:50:27] haku: dam. i thought this is new stuff from china

[2024-11-21T02:52:34] haku: china leading in battery tech
[2024-11-21T02:52:52] haku: tesla 4860 not even available to buy
[2024-11-21T04:49:52] haku: agreed. unfortunately the 4860 cells you can never get. even in used market
[2024-11-21T04:50:16] haku: it be cool to mess around with it
[2024-11-21T05:06:15] haku: dam. no front brakes for this. cant do burnouts.
[2024-11-21T06:35:26] Ms Cars: should i get two of these

[2024-11-21T08:22:09] David: 6.02 or 6.05 what's better?
[2024-11-21T08:22:21] David: 6.02 or 6.05 what's better?
[2024-11-21T08:47:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hey Dani what vesc model do u have
[2024-11-21T08:48:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Generally I'm no suggesting to upgrade firmware if everything works the way it supposed to
[2024-11-21T08:52:32] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): 6.06 :) ..... But 6.05 is at least stable.
[2024-11-21T08:55:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I still think staying with factory fw is perfectly fine I used what I had (I think 6.0) on my 84100s and they work goodn
[2024-11-21T08:57:44] David: im running 75200 Pro and 75100 Pro Both came with 5.02 FW
[2024-11-21T08:58:21] David: its first time im setting them up so wanted to know if there are any advantages on those versions ive mentioned
[2024-11-21T09:00:46] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Depends on your esc ... for example using Ubox with CAN profits from 6.05 (updated build) /6.06 as there where some nasty can bugs in older releases.
[2024-11-21T09:01:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not in the futures we use (what fw did they come with ?)

[2024-11-21T09:03:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2024-11-21T09:03:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't have experience with the pro line but the none pro it's not that good
[2024-11-21T09:03:58] David: what bad experience you had with no pro line?
[2024-11-21T09:04:04] David: cooling?
[2024-11-21T09:04:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I had one 75100 that didn't know how to read motor correctly till today and 2 75200 that burned in less than 10km

[2024-11-21T09:31:12] Lieven L.: Well we now have tabless cells with less resistance so we can pull/push more Amps. But density wise we are still not close to gas/diesel. Different cell formats aren't really innovative. 4860 is actually less dense on pack level because the gaps between the cells are much bigger. Additionally bigger cells are harder to cool, that's why the plaid still uses small cells. Bigger cells like 4860 are just cheaper in production, thats it.
[2024-11-21T09:34:52] Lieven L.: Long cells will probably perform worse since they will have more resistance due to their length. But they gonna be cheaper in production.
[2024-11-21T09:35:13] Paolo ⁭: yes but you dont have to consider tank only. but everything together. Ev dont have many of gas car parts
[2024-11-21T09:40:30] Lieven L.: Engine wise yes, the rest is still the same. Electric cars are going to make lots of money for the manufacturers. Batteries are cheap as hell right now and they still cell the cars at rediculous pices.
[2024-11-21T09:42:04] Paolo ⁭: You mean European car
[2024-11-21T09:42:24] Paolo ⁭: In china we get luxury ev for 20k
[2024-11-21T09:42:56] Paolo ⁭: Interior better than bmw rofl
[2024-11-21T09:43:06] Lieven L.: But its the same for ICE cars. The market will collapse very soon if they aren't dropping prices. But currently everybody is laying of people to keep filling their pockets.
[2024-11-21T09:43:44] Paolo ⁭: In china already 70% are electric
[2024-11-21T09:44:23] Lieven L.: Yeah but who is paying for the cars? The chinese government. For them it's just about market share.
[2024-11-21T09:45:40] Paolo ⁭: Yes, because we invested alot on innovation and green transition instead to send money to Ukraine
[2024-11-21T09:47:20] Paolo ⁭: But that’s the actual market price, without government bonus
[2024-11-21T09:47:52] Lieven L.: War is usually a bad investment. 😔
[2024-11-21T09:48:28] Paolo ⁭: I feel bad for us tax payer
[2024-11-21T09:49:02] Paolo ⁭: I am very happy tax payer when I know my money are spent for good things
[2024-11-21T09:53:34] Lieven L.: That's why the rich people don't pay much taxes. 😅
[2024-11-21T10:12:36] haku: dam way to rub it in my face. 2025 we will cut all funding to that BS. i dont give a sgit big country eat small country. way of the world
[2024-11-21T10:14:07] haku: we will all have tesla robots instead. washing our dishes
[2024-11-21T10:15:27] Marius: Lmao
[2024-11-21T10:18:22] Lieven L.: We have dishwashers already 😂 Sorry I couldn't resist.
[2024-11-21T10:23:52] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Oh yeah that fancy model called W.I.F.E sometimes also called Cum Bucket. (Duck and run ......)
[2024-11-21T10:26:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Fainly
[2024-11-21T10:27:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The 11 inch zero10x kit has arrived

[2024-11-21T20:19:52] haku: not you. gabes layout
[2024-11-21T20:21:02] Max Rainlogix: try putting vesc to the wall vertical (back of the deck)
[2024-11-21T20:21:10] Max Rainlogix: and put more cells
[2024-11-21T20:21:29] Max Rainlogix: infront
[2024-11-21T20:26:52] Pandalgns: Guys
[2024-11-21T20:26:56] Pandalgns: I have a question
[2024-11-21T20:27:30] Pandalgns: I can use this motherfucker to solder cooper??
[2024-11-21T20:27:31] Max Rainlogix: what type
[2024-11-21T20:27:36] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_19582@21-11-2024_20-27-36.jpg>
[2024-11-21T20:28:13] haku: try it
[2024-11-21T20:28:21] haku: only way to know
[2024-11-21T20:28:34] haku: start with .1
[2024-11-21T20:28:59] Pandalgns: I use it to solder normal discharge batteries with nickel but I want to make my high discharge battery and I don't know if it's suitable for soldering copper, if anyone knows it and can help me configure it and well, first of all, it's worth it to me.
[2024-11-21T20:30:08] Max Rainlogix: what cells?
[2024-11-21T20:30:23] Pandalgns: In some battery group that I was in a long time ago they told me that he is not a professional welder but that he is very good, it belonged to my brother and I know that it is worth around 100-120 euros
[2024-11-21T20:31:20] Finn: Woulnt do it for front motor
[2024-11-21T20:31:36] Pandalgns: I usually use it with samsung 50e and nickel but I want to use it to make a 20s10p with molicel p45b and copper for high discharge
[2024-11-21T20:32:24] Max Rainlogix: thats great
[2024-11-21T20:34:39] GABE: Theres space for a bms at esc
[2024-11-21T20:35:07] GABE: no need
[2024-11-21T20:35:20] GABE: kek
[2024-11-21T20:35:32] Finn: For ultimate spacesaver you can put vesc on bottom plate
[2024-11-21T20:35:34] GABE: theres space for copper sheets on top.
[2024-11-21T20:35:40] GABE: im doing so
[2024-11-21T20:35:40] Finn: You always do weird layouts lol
[2024-11-21T20:36:24] GABE: it would be comedic to put a 70h with the 2p
[2024-11-21T20:36:24] haku: lets see it then. i want you to build this layout haha
[2024-11-21T20:36:26] GABE: would that even move

[2024-11-21T20:36:48] Finn: Got an old pro2 frame still here
[2024-11-21T20:36:57] GABE: i had to throw my old one out cos i stripped m4
[2024-11-21T20:37:02] Finn: maybe 20s too but with 20s4p
[2024-11-21T20:37:05] GABE: also they werent straught
[2024-11-21T20:37:08] Finn: rip
[2024-11-21T20:37:18] GABE: what motor
[2024-11-21T20:37:20] haku: what motor you using for this?
[2024-11-21T20:37:28] GABE: 250w M365 motor
[2024-11-21T20:37:34] Finn: Not sure
[2024-11-21T20:37:38] GABE: very stronk at HV i tell you
[2024-11-21T20:37:47] GABE: no fwk, nice temp
[2024-11-21T20:37:47] Finn: maybe when my read blade dies ill use front of g30 and put 22x3 on g30
[2024-11-21T20:38:07] GABE: me 2p xd
[2024-11-21T20:38:10] haku: did you add a temp sensor
[2024-11-21T20:38:15] GABE: i got one but meh
[2024-11-21T20:38:17] GABE: dont feel assed
[2024-11-21T20:38:23] GABE: i know how those motors heat
[2024-11-21T20:38:26] 'lekrsu': temp sensors is for the weak
[2024-11-21T20:38:40] haku: how much battery and phase you using?
[2024-11-21T20:38:42] GABE: if outside burns (50) inside is 100
[2024-11-21T20:38:54] GABE: 70a phase ez.
[2024-11-21T20:39:07] haku: at 72v?
[2024-11-21T20:39:09] GABE: if fwk is used, say bye bye.
[2024-11-21T20:39:16] GABE: 30a batt ish
[2024-11-21T20:39:19] GABE: max
[2024-11-21T20:39:23] GABE: thats like 1.7-2.1kw
[2024-11-21T20:39:35] haku: damn i didnt xiaomi motors are good good like that
[2024-11-21T20:39:45] GABE: motor wattage aint real
[2024-11-21T20:39:49] GABE: its like a 30h
[2024-11-21T20:39:53] GABE: do the math on copper volume
[2024-11-21T20:39:59] GABE: the stator height is the same
[2024-11-21T20:41:31] GABE: if you pull over while your motor is hot, itll die. You gotta drive around at 20kmh and vent it. If your scooter dies with a hot motor, youre fucked.
[2024-11-21T20:41:31] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-21T20:43:26] haku: drill holes
[2024-11-21T20:43:34] haku: like le french
[2024-11-21T20:44:26] haku: im going to experiment with that too
[2024-11-21T20:51:20] Rose: Hey there jimbo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-11-21T20:56:01] GABE: good luck destroying your magnets
[2024-11-21T20:56:13] GABE: just dont use fwk.
[2024-11-21T20:56:26] GABE: and heat is almost never an issue
[2024-11-21T20:56:49] haku: thats why we put temp sensors foo
[2024-11-21T20:56:55] GABE: i mean the debris
[2024-11-21T20:57:39] haku: but @jamaludin_algarnati is living testimony of holes on motors are okay
[2024-11-21T20:57:42] GABE: waiting on copper in the mail....
[2024-11-21T20:57:49] GABE: Should come tomorrow..
[2024-11-21T20:57:55] GABE: everything in one massive package
[2024-11-21T20:58:30] haku: the fans are tired of waiting. just post photos. the hype died

[2024-11-21T20:59:47] GABE: been stupid
[2024-11-21T21:00:15] haku: once you finish the g30 and put a seat you will drown in puss. i promise yoy
[2024-11-21T21:00:32] GABE: i believe
[2024-11-21T21:00:34] haku: unless your not into that then just remain standing
[2024-11-21T21:01:06] GABE: i want a seat while zapping around at 60kmh
[2024-11-21T21:01:11] GABE: on a mijia
[2024-11-21T21:01:15] GABE: for sure
[2024-11-21T21:03:19] haku: i only stand on bizniz baby

[2024-11-21T21:10:31] haku: you can give girls in your campus free rides to thier dorm. its up to you what you want to do next.
[2024-11-21T21:12:40] ✨🇪🇸عمر: but it's possible 😭😭😭 + the 250a controller

[2024-11-21T21:14:16] ✨🇪🇸عمر: <photos/photo_19584@21-11-2024_21-14-16.jpg>
[2024-11-21T21:14:53] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I only manage to put 11 cells on my 3d in width
[2024-11-21T21:43:59] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Hey guys, let's see if someone can give us a hand who are learning.
[2024-11-21T21:44:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When activating the traction control, Yamal and I noticed that we had lost top speed and some acceleration.
[2024-11-21T21:44:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: My question is if there is any way to make it softer if it is now at 100x100, how could I make it at 80%
[2024-11-21T22:21:39] crimeware: After an Eternity
[2024-11-21T22:21:58] crimeware: I got it back in my hands, now I am just missing a bat
[2024-11-21T22:35:27] GABE: i sanded the PETG and my brother said i stink of plastic lol
[2024-11-21T22:35:31] GABE: i think i should open my window v
[2024-11-21T22:36:07] GABE: i need to sand the sides of the scooter by 0.1mm each
[2024-11-21T22:36:09] GABE: also.
[2024-11-21T22:36:32] GABE: could not have to and just use no kapton cause its so rigid in there, itll never move.
[2024-11-21T22:36:33] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-21T22:39:04] haku: why did you sand?
[2024-11-21T22:39:14] GABE: so it fits between the rails
[2024-11-21T22:39:16] GABE: on the bottom
[2024-11-21T22:39:29] haku: just print a new one
[2024-11-21T22:39:51] haku: dont disrespect james holders like that boy
[2024-11-21T22:43:30] haku: you use traction control on 33x2?
[2024-11-21T22:48:36] Noname: Can you write a simple set up and pro tricks help book 😆
[2024-11-21T22:52:54] GABE: this is atomic maximum side
[2024-11-21T22:52:55] GABE: for pro 2
[2024-11-21T22:52:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-21T23:00:55] haku: im so smart. dam too much ww2 documentaries ive watched.
[2024-11-21T23:01:48] GABE: 22s IS POSSIBLE if the bms isnt too long, might go ahead and weld it tbh. 22s with ebrake is a risk but the motor is sooo small. it shouldnt fuck up the fets.
[2024-11-21T23:01:52] GABE: officially
[2024-11-21T23:02:00] GABE: so 660wh
[2024-11-21T23:02:20] haku: only way to see is test it

[2024-11-21T23:03:38] GABE: ubox buddies.
[2024-11-21T23:04:20] Noname: What's a good way to seal off dirt? Mines getting a bit dirty
[2024-11-21T23:04:42] haku: what?
[2024-11-21T23:05:02] Noname: The controller
[2024-11-21T23:05:21] GABE: how tall is the 40a 20s bms from jbd? 21s max
[2024-11-21T23:05:23] haku: where you mount it?. outside?
[2024-11-21T23:05:45] Noname: Under seat but the wind blows in its open ish
[2024-11-21T23:06:16] haku: put in a case like peak g30. it will be bulky though
[2024-11-21T23:06:24] Noname: Fuck it plastic wrap
[2024-11-21T23:06:56] haku: ide print you a cover if i knew how to design one
[2024-11-21T23:07:32] haku: just silicone the holes and the ports
[2024-11-21T23:08:02] Noname: Worry about it later no riding now
[2024-11-21T23:08:41] haku: embrace the dirt. rub more dirt on it as the country folk say
[2024-11-21T23:15:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, as I have commented on other days, my front wheel always slides up to 130 km/h.
[2024-11-21T23:15:49] GABE: i gotta print 2 pcs of 2x2 for the 22s lol
[2024-11-21T23:16:11] haku: 22s on the mini ubox?
[2024-11-21T23:16:22] GABE: no ebrake or virtually none,
[2024-11-21T23:16:29] GABE: 250w motor shouldnt destroy it anyway.
[2024-11-21T23:16:43] GABE: its so small and the back frequency is prob so little
[2024-11-21T23:16:43] haku: alright. more power to you
[2024-11-21T23:16:57] GABE: it shouldnt even overload the components even tho its edging it lol
[2024-11-21T23:17:07] GABE: but like a big ass motor definitelt would
[2024-11-21T23:17:15] GABE: think about it
[2024-11-21T23:18:31] GABE: 22s is 80v which is 80/100 with 20% headroom
[2024-11-21T23:18:46] haku: no one has tried it. you prolly first one
[2024-11-21T23:18:50] GABE: james said itll be fine

[2024-11-21T23:20:26] Noname: Short charge it to 91 or whatever
[2024-11-21T23:20:34] haku: i will admit to the group that i copied you
[2024-11-21T23:36:44] GABE: that works?
[2024-11-21T23:37:27] GABE: ill charge the 2s less.
[2024-11-21T23:37:41] GABE: i can charge it to whatever i want
[2024-11-21T23:38:19] Noname: Well figure out % loss if you charge 22s to 20. Might not gain but 1 or 2v less least you have some brake to start
[2024-11-21T23:38:49] GABE: could charge to 21.5s
[2024-11-21T23:38:53] GABE: ye
[2024-11-21T23:38:57] GABE: 4.2x 21.5
[2024-11-21T23:39:24] Noname: Charging my 17s to 16 I loose 8 miles range lol
[2024-11-22T02:28:47] haku: @noname check this out. this motorcycle conversion kit for gas to elecrtric mounts. at 2:00 mark. shandoki company sounds like an african child

[2024-11-22T05:44:00] haku: small man with a big brain and a big heart
[2024-11-22T06:20:42] Yamal: Funny boy
[2024-11-22T06:35:07] Yamal: Finally friday

[2024-11-22T08:02:04] Yamal: I think really can !!!
[2024-11-22T08:02:13] haku: im sure
[2024-11-22T08:02:53] Yamal: In the morning I can put it at full speed for a few seconds, but I can't even find the top speed due to the type of roads/traffic, etc.
[2024-11-22T08:03:05] haku: dont be scared do your old settings on this new 12fet and pin that shit. balls to the walls
[2024-11-22T08:04:25] haku: we pretty much have the same battery i just have 2 more p but prolly same bms output

[2024-11-22T08:09:00] Yamal: Also always check tem bms maxi can see 25 °C but you know never push hard the scooter for a long time yet,,,
[2024-11-22T08:09:03] haku: you can prolly just do 22s 10p 40pl and be king dick around here

[2024-11-22T08:16:09] Yamal: But yes this night i will open gps for you and check data vesc tool later
[2024-11-22T08:16:43] haku: fw at 35a or something
[2024-11-22T08:17:56] Yamal: Becaouse 22/3 can reach for “ my experience” -115/125kmh. Vesc tool with out FW
[2024-11-22T08:18:16] Yamal: Gps max 120 we will see this night ;)
[2024-11-22T08:18:31] haku: with fw how much more?
[2024-11-22T08:18:32] Yamal: I really dont like fw
[2024-11-22T08:18:48] Yamal: If you want go faster just get 33/2 its my opinion
[2024-11-22T08:18:54] haku: fw only bad for 33x2 ive been told
[2024-11-22T08:20:22] Yamal: Yes but fw for what ? For me is like lie your self ,, fw = magishine
[2024-11-22T08:20:54] haku: never tried it. but ill do it when i get 22x3 someday
[2024-11-22T08:21:28] haku: they say it only kicks in at high erpm like vtec
[2024-11-22T08:21:32] Yamal: simply each winding has its characteristics and they are all impressive
[2024-11-22T08:21:45] Yamal: 22/3 crazy torque
[2024-11-22T08:22:07] Yamal: 33/2 is for gentlemen
[2024-11-22T08:22:37] haku: but 22x3 is for the savage that loves burnouts.
[2024-11-22T08:23:01] haku: mix of speed and torque
[2024-11-22T08:23:11] haku: need to try it
[2024-11-22T08:24:03] haku: 33x2 is cool if you ride in highways
[2024-11-22T08:25:50] haku: also 33x2 you need lots of battery and phase to get torque.
[2024-11-22T08:25:50] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-22T08:28:06] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: you like to burn rubber 🤣
[2024-11-22T08:29:50] Yamal: 22/3 is to conquer Nordic blondes ;)
[2024-11-22T08:30:57] haku: single motor 90h 16x4 is BV choice of ride ive heard
[2024-11-22T08:38:12] Yamal: But with your configuration did you notice little acceleration?
[2024-11-22T08:38:34] Yamal: 200/350/33,2
[2024-11-22T09:04:08] cihan: Does anyone used or experimented Dualtron City?
[2024-11-22T10:35:07] Yamal: Big tyre 🤩
[2024-11-22T10:35:25] Yamal: Lets see if somebody mount Vesc
[2024-11-22T11:58:25] cihan: Big tires, LG battery and price is closer to the Europe /US price in Turkey. Also swappable battery charms me, i won't need to carry scooter inside home anymore,it's important for me.
[2024-11-22T11:58:58] cihan: Big tires mean less torque however it's fine for me, 4000W stock is enough.
[2024-11-22T12:12:25] Yamal: But fit Vesc right?
[2024-11-22T12:43:06] JPPL: Fw rocks for speed i use it to reach top speed tests
[2024-11-22T12:44:46] JPPL: Remember that fw Will go continue current for that period off use
[2024-11-22T12:52:58] GABE: sanded to hell. slips in between the rails.
[2024-11-22T12:53:22] GABE: I can now route copper up top instead of sides.
[2024-11-22T12:53:48] GABE: <video_file>
[2024-11-22T12:54:01] GABE: Like lego XD

[2024-11-22T12:58:44] GABE: now that I made it slide in between the rails, None.
[2024-11-22T12:59:02] GABE: Enough height to even use the stock plate. LOL

[2024-11-22T12:59:45] GABE: I'm going with 22s for 660wh fuck it.
[2024-11-22T12:59:50] GABE: I'm used to no ebrake
[2024-11-22T12:59:57] GABE: long as I'm not stupid asf

[2024-11-22T13:15:38] cihan: I'll be probably using the stock controller if I buy it one day. I can think about VESC if I have problems with the controller. Buying new VESC controller is impossible for me with usual postage. I need to request somebody buy and bring it to me or I'll need to get passport, visa and go buy myself.)
[2024-11-22T13:16:25] cihan: I'm happy that I used to buy 2 vesc controllers before limitations. I'll use it for single motor scooter sometime.
[2024-11-22T13:17:37] cihan: Do series cells contact each other by pressure only?
[2024-11-22T13:24:03] GABE: They would so the cell would be compressed and secure
[2024-11-22T13:28:26] Yamal: Sad..
[2024-11-22T13:29:20] Yamal: We will be waiting if someone travels to Turkey
[2024-11-22T13:30:14] Yamal: We prepare a 32 kg suitcase for you, Punedir and Networkdir xD
[2024-11-22T14:34:52] Yamal: XD funny to ride
[2024-11-22T14:34:53] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-11-22T17:01:02] Yamal: The scooter does not leave directly in bad weather, nor with a forecast of bad weather, in two weeks the water scooter arrives
[2024-11-22T17:04:13] Yamal: The Nami has a chassis with too many holes, a custom-made watertight box should have been made with the heat sink underneath, anyway, as I said when it rains, Nami stays at home with the tea and the bakalawa xD
[2024-11-22T17:06:07] Yamal: WaterRr Nami..
[2024-11-22T17:06:45] Yamal: Me Sabana unana
[2024-11-22T17:23:47] JPPL: Minnie mounted on my daily escooter, better graphic vesc info displaying

[2024-11-22T18:19:10] Pandalgns: How much can cost a second hand nami?? Im from spain guys, more or less
[2024-11-22T18:19:37] Pandalgns: Or a frame without motors, controllers and battery
[2024-11-22T18:28:33] haku: would you classify that a scooter? that stem so short you need a seat
[2024-11-22T18:32:08] haku: chopped stem looks cool though. just need a seat
[2024-11-22T18:37:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Not that short, he used it daily without much problems
[2024-11-22T20:09:42] Yamal: Rare to fine only frame ..
[2024-11-22T20:17:32] Yamal: It is easier to find dt thunder chassis,,, the cases of nami second hand chassis were very rare and for this reason: " crack in some part of the chassis, the guarantee orders a new chassis and the owner welds and repairs the old chassis to then sell it, a complete new chassis costs about a thousand one hundred euros, and when I say complete it is only missing motors, controllers and battery,, you can also search in France at -Lebocoin-

[2024-11-22T20:18:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: a 500 m acceleration
[2024-11-22T20:22:13] Yamal: It's amazing, when you accelerate hard it feels like you're on 22/3
[2024-11-22T20:39:43] haku: nice temps
[2024-11-22T20:40:38] haku: pin it balls to the walls. i want to see temp at 600phase
[2024-11-22T20:52:20] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I can't go without traction control, I just tried it but it's better to activate it or the front wheel never gets traction
[2024-11-22T20:57:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I remember when I had 22x3 on 2000w kaabo motors with TRONIC 250r now it is almost the same power but that power never ends it is always the same with 22x3 at 115 +- you run out of motors but with 33x2 it never ends I have been with 33x2 for 2 months or so I have not been able to know the maximum speed yet
[2024-11-22T20:57:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's amazing
[2024-11-22T21:28:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'm going to raise the traction control to 4000 rpm to test
[2024-11-22T21:29:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: you want to see fire 🔥 you are nobody jajajja

[2024-11-22T21:46:35] Yamal: New esc soon?
[2024-11-22T21:47:53] haku: maybe.
[2024-11-22T21:48:19] haku: lots of choices. rice or vesc
[2024-11-22T21:48:35] haku: seven or seven years of rice
[2024-11-22T21:49:10] haku: spintend and be hungry for a month

[2024-11-22T22:12:37] Yamal: x12 is a good top option too
[2024-11-22T22:13:18] haku: fardriver too. but i will never be welcomed here and the vesclords will dronestrike me
[2024-11-22T22:13:42] haku: 72680
[2024-11-22T22:13:53] Yamal: Price per controller ?
[2024-11-22T22:14:11] haku: cheaper than x12 ill tell you that
[2024-11-22T22:14:43] haku: but america economy needs me
[2024-11-22T22:15:51] Yamal: An option for x12 and for you is to order them without the box and make your own custom one with a heat sink...
[2024-11-22T22:16:34] haku: i dont even care for 100+mph. if i achieve 90mph with 12fet spintend im okay with that
[2024-11-22T22:16:51] Yamal: 90?
[2024-11-22T22:16:57] haku: yes
[2024-11-22T22:17:08] haku: miles per hour
[2024-11-22T22:17:10] Yamal: 144 okay
[2024-11-22T22:17:38] Yamal: Spintend 12 fet price / quality 🤯
[2024-11-22T22:18:05] haku: but i think if i dont go higher than 20s it might not hit 90
[2024-11-22T22:18:25] haku: 80mph my 12fet already sweating
[2024-11-22T22:18:47] Yamal: Speed motor , CAN!!!!
[2024-11-22T22:18:52] Yamal: YOU CAN!!
[2024-11-22T22:18:57] Yamal: 😂
[2024-11-22T22:19:13] haku: i try. always balls to the walls when i test. 3x in a row
[2024-11-22T22:19:34] haku: also my test site is on a slight incline
[2024-11-22T22:19:47] Yamal: Really 140 can with 32/2 moli battery/ and good A
[2024-11-22T22:20:16] Yamal: I can get 132gps 65 h 33/2 bad battery…. Its crazy
[2024-11-22T22:20:25] haku: i will fix cooling when i get new vesc then try again. now the weather colder
[2024-11-22T22:20:29] Yamal: Kelly 7218
[2024-11-22T22:20:47] haku: lawd gawd
[2024-11-22T22:21:51] haku: i also have 13" wich should give me more top speed. wierd that i can only get 80mph. 10" scooters can do that
[2024-11-22T22:22:09] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-11-22T22:22:55] haku: this with kelly or tronic?

[2024-11-22T22:24:09] haku: at 20s?
[2024-11-22T22:25:08] haku: i think next time ill lower battery to 200a and raise phase to 320-350
[2024-11-22T22:27:11] Yamal: 33/2 65h 20s stock battery
[2024-11-22T22:28:21] haku: i also think the problem is weight. the wepoor is heavy and me too
[2024-11-22T22:28:38] haku: 13" tires also heavy
[2024-11-22T22:30:19] Yamal: I this moment nami is around 50kg , me 93
[2024-11-22T22:31:55] haku: i have other things to worry about than speed priority. hard times in the hood so ill prolly be making other projects.
[2024-11-22T22:32:17] haku: mini bmx dual 16x4 is haunting my dreams

[2024-11-22T22:42:20] Yamal: Regarding bad times, globally things are hot, and it is none other than BV that has the best wave.
[2024-11-22T22:43:49] Yamal: Soon is the time!!! Power test or speed test

[2024-11-24T23:24:14] Pandalgns: what do you think guys? I designed it yesterday, it is the extender that I am going to put on my halo t107 to separate the battery area from the wiring area of ​​all the electronics, I even put the lights that the halo brings in the frame to the extender making a style similar to the dualtron
[2024-11-24T23:35:57] Yamal: Nice
[2024-11-24T23:36:10] Yamal: For halo t107 tune
[2024-11-24T23:39:51] Pandalgns: Yes, it has holes to pass the phase cables, hall sensor cable, brake cables and handlebar instruments, charging ports, holes to pass the cables of the controllers that go outside the frame
[2024-11-25T00:34:16] Finn: Damn make a youtube vlog out ouf your tours
[2024-11-25T02:23:20] haku: thats nice
[2024-11-25T02:24:20] haku: i have laotie/halo frame no battery. i will make a 72v battery for it but low discharge then sell
[2024-11-25T02:25:27] haku: for some reason that frame has a sentimental value to me. i put so much effort trying to build it but i gave up

[2024-11-25T06:54:14] haku: gents since we are using vesc with imu board or whatever that balancing stuff is called. would that stuff work with our scooter motors small stators? im just wondering if anyone has done that. on a single motor ofcourse. like a minibike just made for wheelies
[2024-11-25T06:55:10] haku: and how do you guys set that up
[2024-11-25T07:31:30] Noname: Mine shows tilt side to side in scooter so needs to be oriented correctly. It would want to be level always so I don't think you can just turn on while wheeling.
[2024-11-25T07:43:57] haku: dam i see. i was thinking puting pegs
[2024-11-25T07:44:18] haku: can you use a profile just for it
[2024-11-25T07:45:34] haku: like activate wheelie mode im command
[2024-11-25T07:49:36] Noname: If you could you would have to be at the right angle in a wheelie or it'd try to be level and you'd get jolted off balance
[2024-11-25T07:51:17] haku: it be a good idea to spread the vesc gospel. through wheelies on minibikes. ill watch videos on how that works
[2024-11-25T07:52:56] Noname: Well on a onewheel when you turn it on I think it slowly levels itself. You could have it turn on tilt to wheelie position and ride on pegs until you got speed and then somehow transition to sitting
[2024-11-25T07:53:51] haku: yep. thats what i was thinking. i wonder if any of you vesclords have done it
[2024-11-25T07:55:51] haku: murikan kids seems to be about the wheelie culture. vesc will be a gamechanger if my idea is possible
[2024-11-25T07:56:37] haku: no more balancing throttle and brake. just wheelie on command
[2024-11-25T08:05:30] haku: check this out boys.
[2024-11-25T08:06:24] haku: plans on a 18fet 22s spintend

[2024-11-25T09:36:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you don't have it in Ortega original but you had it before, they have changed it for you, it doesn't change itself
[2024-11-25T09:37:02] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): 30+30
[2024-11-25T09:38:37] Yamal: Nice scooter and nice set up ❤️‍🔥
[2024-11-25T09:39:05] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Thats 1 motor:
[2024-11-25T09:39:41] Yamal: Only can see this on computer right ?
[2024-11-25T09:40:07] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yes log file via Mobile or VESC Express (i do/can both)

[2024-11-25T09:40:44] Yamal: Via mobile can ? Oh good Later I check
[2024-11-25T09:40:58] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Well would like to push more but the EVE 50E cant deliver more ... time for a new pack and this pack can move to the other GT that runs on single motor
[2024-11-25T09:41:13] Yamal: Nice to see how the current flowing xD
[2024-11-25T09:41:41] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): The purple are the phase currents
[2024-11-25T09:53:33] Yamal: I have ortega original from the first day
[2024-11-25T10:14:02] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, I know. It happened to me that if I didn't put the original, the engine didn't work well, that's why I say that you should check to see if it has been changed.
[2024-11-25T10:14:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2024-11-25T11:17:00] Yamal: You dont have sound””” all okeee

[2024-11-25T12:45:57] GABE: worst holder, they snap
[2024-11-25T12:47:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Metal sound is your phone holder, the sound like minimotors on your motor, it depends of the frequency you put, but if it's new sound then you have something wrong with phases
[2024-11-25T12:48:41] Yamal: Thanks i will check later
[2024-11-25T13:05:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice ,but what's written on your shirt?
[2024-11-25T13:13:01] GABE: You're selling it?
[2024-11-25T14:11:57] GABE: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-11-25T14:19:55] GABE: stock motors go 90?
[2024-11-25T14:37:59] 'lekrsu': 30A FWK
[2024-11-25T15:03:40] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): GT2 motors yes ... They manage 100+ but temp will get an issue
[2024-11-25T15:49:01] Patrick: Go 75°C temp cutoff
[2024-11-25T15:58:29] GABE: does that kill the escs?
[2024-11-25T16:01:38] puneDir: They must be happy their cells not shitted with 75c
[2024-11-25T16:02:41] Patrick: Bms isnt esc
[2024-11-25T16:02:59] GABE: BMS cutoff should kill escs
[2024-11-25T16:03:02] GABE: or does
[2024-11-25T16:03:08] puneDir: No it shouldnt
[2024-11-25T16:03:13] puneDir: Why would it
[2024-11-25T16:03:17] Patrick: You can go up to 80°C for the cutoff but 75°C is the save one
[2024-11-25T16:03:26] GABE: Because fets are synchronized and then suddenly a power surge happens
[2024-11-25T16:03:28] puneDir: I was going 40c max
[2024-11-25T16:03:45] puneDir: Its fine nothing will happen in well designed esc
[2024-11-25T16:03:53] Patrick: Reduces lifetime at these temps too but if you want to go to the max its fine
[2024-11-25T16:04:20] puneDir: happily i dont own anything with cells anymore 😌
[2024-11-25T16:04:28] puneDir: freedom of gas

[2024-11-25T19:16:42] Jan: ^^
[2024-11-25T19:16:48] Jan: Its borrowed time from covid
[2024-11-25T19:17:17] Jan: US printed so much money during covid and artificially kept the economy alive
[2024-11-25T19:18:22] haku: the tariffs will come back to keep it afloat.
[2024-11-25T19:18:39] haku: it will make us buy tronic or seven
[2024-11-25T19:19:31] haku: im just talking out off my ass about economy but i trust and believe
[2024-11-25T19:21:41] Jan: No expert either, however reading some books about keynes economy theory, what we do nowadays its not sustainable
[2024-11-25T19:22:06] Jan: You cant print money as it generates no value, you borrow time by bubbling that collapses later
[2024-11-25T19:22:35] Lieven L.: That's the reason why the stock market is crazy right now 😂 Look at it's history and you will see it will repeat again 😉
[2024-11-25T19:22:56] haku: thats true. but murika will find a way. i dont want my son paying paying for that
[2024-11-25T19:23:12] haku: no more free monies to that one country
[2024-11-25T19:23:47] Jan: Its not about that, you also dont pay taxes to pay US government spending
[2024-11-25T19:24:06] haku: our taxes go to that
[2024-11-25T19:24:42] Jan: You pay it so that the government can pay interest on its money borrowing
[2024-11-25T19:25:03] Jan: To the FED
[2024-11-25T19:25:07] haku: okay. ill look up more into that. thanks for the info
[2024-11-25T19:25:35] haku: but i dont support any monies going to other countries than murikans
[2024-11-25T19:26:30] haku: we have potholes to worry about here. give the tanks and f-16 to tge citizens
[2024-11-25T19:27:05] haku: i could use a javelin too
[2024-11-25T19:32:17] Lieven L.: It's basically always the same. Bull market, record profits, layoffs, stock market crashes 😅
[2024-11-25T19:34:39] haku: the real investment is in lioon batteries, rice and canned foods for when the end of days come. thats worth more than gold
[2024-11-25T19:36:59] haku: that will only happen if this current administration escalates. but under 47 we buy balenciaga baby
[2024-11-25T19:37:28] haku: and gold chains

[2024-11-26T04:54:28] haku: daym
[2024-11-26T04:54:39] haku: how fat is it? width?
[2024-11-26T04:55:04] Noname: 4.10" wide 3.5" sidewall 4" rim 3.5 + 4 + 3.5 =11
[2024-11-26T04:55:15] Noname: It's in freedom units
[2024-11-26T04:55:20] haku: gotcha
[2024-11-26T04:55:28] haku: thanks dude
[2024-11-26T04:56:20] haku: alot of these in marketplace but not wildcat branded. as long as the motor fits i dont care what brand
[2024-11-26T04:57:46] haku: the wildcat one is nice though. some go up to 600 😭
[2024-11-26T04:59:51] haku: this is the website. i would love the silver one for christmas. thanks bud https://wildcatmini.com/collections/wildcatminibmx
[2024-11-26T04:59:51] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-26T05:00:03] Noname: Poor people problems
[2024-11-26T05:55:32] haku: they even have one the standing boys.
[2024-11-26T05:55:41] haku: good geometry?
[2024-11-26T05:56:32] haku: <photos/photo_19668@26-11-2024_05-56-32.jpg>
[2024-11-26T08:59:49] Yamal: @Pandalgns Good morning, what type of cable did you choose for your new motor phases?
[2024-11-26T09:00:23] Yamal: Some say that the AWG silicone cable is not ideal...?
[2024-11-26T09:29:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Copper wire is always better
[2024-11-26T09:30:06] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: did you find the problem?
[2024-11-26T09:31:56] Yamal: Nop
[2024-11-26T09:32:34] Yamal: Today afternoon i will do detection
[2024-11-26T09:58:54] Pandalgns: I use awg 12 on my 60h
[2024-11-26T09:59:10] Pandalgns: Why not?
[2024-11-26T10:01:57] Pandalgns: Lonnyo motors don't use AWG cable? Anyway, I have a couple of smartgyro pro motors that I wired with hob wire, they are silicone copper cables, I still have to test the result but I think they will work very well.
[2024-11-26T10:03:42] Pandalgns: Likewise, the AWG cables are used in batteries, I believe that they can also be used in motors without a problem, the point is knowing which section to put, I have 16AWG in the 1000W motors and 12AWG in the 3000W ones.
[2024-11-26T10:06:48] Jan: AWG is a dumb measurement
[2024-11-26T10:07:26] Jan: 😬
[2024-11-26T10:13:12] 'lekrsu': Budweiser seems like a nice unit though
[2024-11-26T10:17:27] Pandalgns: 😂😂 why??Don't you use silicone cables that use the AWG measurement?
[2024-11-26T10:22:39] GABE: silicone copper should be all phase wires
[2024-11-26T10:23:02] GABE: unsure if even glass wire is better
[2024-11-26T10:23:06] GABE: probably not
[2024-11-26T10:23:29] GABE: Unforch it's engrained now.
[2024-11-26T10:51:12] Jan: mm^2
[2024-11-26T10:53:21] GABE: @Jan it really is a tragedy, but it's not that bad. Using Feet and inches to measure HEIGHT is also so much more adequate and easier
[2024-11-26T10:53:36] GABE: gotta give credit where it's due, but these measurements only work in niche circumstances
[2024-11-26T10:56:18] GABE: cause who the fuck knows what 185cm is for example
[2024-11-26T11:01:06] Jan: You cant work in imperial units in any science
[2024-11-26T11:11:55] Yamal: So okay o no AWG XD
[2024-11-26T11:19:42] GABE: True. But you are forced to work with Kelvin, but at least that's scientifically real.
[2024-11-26T11:20:07] GABE: What unit even is Kelvin? cause it's not imperial
[2024-11-26T11:22:45] Jan: Its celsius scale shifted to the absolute zero point
[2024-11-26T11:23:48] Jan: The most convenient units are the one we grew up with
[2024-11-26T11:24:26] Jan: Machine output - Cars => Horsepower - Scooter => Watt technically.both should be Watts
[2024-11-26T11:25:57] GABE: I think they should both be HP lmao
[2024-11-26T11:26:07] GABE: There is too many watts, it's getting ridiculous.
[2024-11-26T11:43:47] Jan: No because you got mW,W,kW,MW,GW etc
[2024-11-26T11:46:31] NetworkDir: Most cars and motorcycles rated like : x HP (x kW)
[2024-11-26T11:59:45] GABE: Number of 745 you mean
[2024-11-26T12:00:35] GABE: right.
[2024-11-26T12:00:47] GABE: some cars are 1MW then
[2024-11-26T12:00:56] GABE: Like 2000hp Supras.
[2024-11-26T12:04:21] Rose: Hey there Tecak, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-11-26T12:10:29] GABE: Tracking shows the my BMS and copper is out for delivery at local PO
[2024-11-26T12:10:59] Patrick: Germany 2mm² America 2.01937mm²
[2024-11-26T12:11:31] GABE: Pro 2 today maybe? Just gotta tap m4 holes.
[2024-11-26T12:11:50] GABE: or use no screws at all and use zip ties and Hella silicone
[2024-11-26T12:12:09] GABE: couldn't care less and it's just as good
[2024-11-26T12:12:46] GABE: Put some silicone absorbant balls in
[2024-11-26T12:12:49] Patrick: Pro2 has m4?
[2024-11-26T12:12:54] GABE: M3 stripped.
[2024-11-26T12:13:10] Patrick: You fucked the holes?
[2024-11-26T12:13:15] GABE: with stock plate
[2024-11-26T12:13:22] GABE: yep while on Adderall
[2024-11-26T12:13:30] GABE: Squeezed the battery pack in a year ago
[2024-11-26T12:13:37] Patrick: Use duck tape did the same on my pro2 for 1 week
[2024-11-26T12:13:44] GABE: All 3.
[2024-11-26T12:13:56] GABE: Silicone, zip ties and tape
[2024-11-26T12:14:05] GABE: and absorbant surely
[2024-11-26T12:14:37] GABE: So little to do with this scoot
[2024-11-26T12:14:53] GABE: already welded a part of the cell with leftover copper
[2024-11-26T12:14:53] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-26T12:15:22] Patrick: Thanks god that i can afford new copper
[2024-11-26T12:16:09] NetworkDir: 1500kW yeah 1.5MW
[2024-11-26T12:17:09] GABE: Litch only 40 cells.
[2024-11-26T12:17:21] GABE: smallest moli pack ever
[2024-11-26T12:17:26] GABE: Baby Boi
[2024-11-26T12:17:53] GABE: EXPENSIVE
[2024-11-26T12:23:22] Patrick: Nah cheap
[2024-11-26T12:23:50] Patrick: This was my setup i left this gap there and mounted the spacer with tape cause i didnt have 65mm screws
[2024-11-26T12:24:36] Patrick: 52mm spacer now 35mm so much better
[2024-11-26T12:28:14] GABE: That's massive
[2024-11-26T12:45:03] Apo: Ur bearings are done u need new ones
[2024-11-26T12:51:47] GABE: What are you looking to make?
[2024-11-26T13:26:34] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yesterday I was given this camera, a friend brought it to me but he said it, I'm not using it GPro7 ☺️ It's the first video we recorded
[2024-11-26T14:00:33] GABE: I'll put a temp sensor on the 250w motor now
[2024-11-26T14:00:53] GABE: that way I can use a little fwk and adequately measure heat, doing this the safe way.
[2024-11-26T14:01:32] GABE: 4A or so idk lol something to get it to 70 or at least 65. @TherealLizardDoggo would you know the exact amount you used a year ago? Does Fwk work with 20s with brake? Also another question is if it would work at 22s with a ubox provided no brake is used at all
[2024-11-26T14:36:11] Finn: 35 hmmmm
[2024-11-26T14:36:51] Finn: What setup?
[2024-11-26T15:05:00] Noname: Can we start measuring speed in smoots? Might be the way.
[2024-11-26T15:06:20] Noname: Obv not a standing scoot hes just window shopping
[2024-11-26T15:09:11] GABE: 250w with 20s.
[2024-11-26T15:09:22] GABE: Or 22s no fwk.
[2024-11-26T15:12:30] Finn: I had 300W 72V 1s
[2024-11-26T15:12:52] Finn: I think i got 5A of fw and 1200imult with 25A dpc
[2024-11-26T15:15:18] Patrick: This still looks good
[2024-11-26T15:15:37] Patrick: Thought the gopro 7 looks worse
[2024-11-26T15:15:54] Patrick: But Bad once it gets dark right?
[2024-11-26T15:15:54] GABE: on vesc?
[2024-11-26T15:16:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You dont understand for real?
[2024-11-26T15:18:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean i like such and i like to know
[2024-11-26T15:37:31] Noname: <photos/photo_19671@26-11-2024_15-37-31.jpg>
[2024-11-26T16:13:15] Finn: No 72V xiaomi controller
[2024-11-26T16:15:51] 'lekrsu': Start speed matters. Might be 0A or 50A without mentioning it.
[2024-11-26T16:16:10] 'lekrsu': imult is the linear increase.
[2024-11-26T16:16:12] Finn: Not sure
[2024-11-26T16:16:26] Finn: But eh xiaomi controller not the best
[2024-11-26T16:16:27] 'lekrsu': Fw per kmh above start speed
[2024-11-26T16:17:05] Finn: Also somehow i never burner my motor even tho i got cutoff every time
[2024-11-26T16:17:22] 'lekrsu': Just learn what you're actually setting.
[2024-11-26T16:17:31] 'lekrsu': It's not duty based on xiaomi controllers firmware, but rather speed based.
[2024-11-26T16:22:41] haku: im going to habe someone weld a top to that like a square frame
[2024-11-26T16:24:23] haku: its a old nike jacket from 15 years ago. before i boycotted them. it blue ribbon sports
[2024-11-26T16:25:40] haku: i do not buy new nike branded stuff anymore
[2024-11-26T18:29:45] Cutlas: Does it apply to Makerbase VESC 84200HP 84V 200A?
[2024-11-26T19:10:05] Yamal: <photos/photo_19672@26-11-2024_19-10-05.jpg>
[2024-11-26T19:28:19] haku: we scored today boys. about to see some wild shit soon.
[2024-11-26T19:30:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thanks
[2024-11-26T19:31:30] haku: this is a retro style nike jacket. before they became nike. they used to be called blue ribbon sports
[2024-11-26T19:31:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And damn cool btw
[2024-11-26T19:32:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Reminds me of general blue From the red ribbon Original series of dragon ball Guy was fun called blue ribbon 🤷‍♂👌😅😁
[2024-11-26T19:33:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_19674@26-11-2024_19-33-25.jpg>
[2024-11-26T19:33:28] haku: i only rep red now unfortunately.
[2024-11-26T19:33:41] haku: i changed gangs
[2024-11-26T19:33:45] JPPL: <video_file>
[2024-11-26T19:33:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔
[2024-11-26T19:34:26] haku: no more c-walk for me
[2024-11-26T19:34:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: https://youtu.be/Mq0IKmqNIaw?si=_cfOMhK9ZOexrr_U
[2024-11-26T19:34:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Listen
[2024-11-26T19:34:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😎
[2024-11-26T19:35:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sexy
[2024-11-26T19:35:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tell some stats pls, interested to hear
[2024-11-26T19:36:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also will make something similar ,with a more rat like bike like this , Frame already kept half years out just to have rust
[2024-11-26T19:36:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤣😅
[2024-11-26T19:36:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But will be something small ,not wild like this
[2024-11-26T19:37:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also unsure about how stable is middle folding on that speed ,pls stay safe
[2024-11-26T19:48:41] JPPL: I made 90 alteady and its rocks, today Will test this motor

[2024-11-26T19:59:56] GABE: <photos/photo_19681@26-11-2024_19-59-56.jpg>
[2024-11-26T19:59:59] GABE: that's the negative lmfao
[2024-11-26T20:00:07] GABE: entire cell is a wrap around
[2024-11-26T20:00:42] GABE: Finishing the welding now. Mount BMS, XT and charge port and get James help on the ubox lite
[2024-11-26T20:00:51] GABE: possibly all done before midnight
[2024-11-26T20:00:51] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-26T20:03:47] haku: seated > standing
[2024-11-26T20:04:43] haku: its just facts. comfort baby. dont be a science denier. bigot facist sexist homophobe.
[2024-11-26T20:07:16] haku: the collection is growing.
[2024-11-26T20:12:31] haku: it is 11 but might have to stretch dropouts or get thinner tire.
[2024-11-26T20:15:59] GABE: this hurts my brain
[2024-11-26T20:16:13] GABE: I'll have to solder BMS as I go on cause when the cell is welded it'll effectively be sealed
[2024-11-26T20:16:51] GABE: cell almost caught fire, copper started to Stink the PETG. caught it in time.
[2024-11-26T20:17:09] GABE: put kapton over the incident
[2024-11-26T20:17:20] haku: what layout is this
[2024-11-26T20:17:23] GABE: 3.6v.. no sparks.
[2024-11-26T20:17:26] GABE: 20/22s2p
[2024-11-26T20:17:47] haku: can you explain what younare trying to do. why does it have long copper
[2024-11-26T20:18:45] GABE: Cause the negative is inside the cell
[2024-11-26T20:18:48] GABE: it's a wrap around
[2024-11-26T20:19:27] GABE: If I didn't do this I would need copper on sides
[2024-11-26T20:19:30] GABE: which I don't have space for copper allowed on top only
[2024-11-26T20:19:38] haku: im too smooth brained to understand that layout
[2024-11-26T20:20:00] Yamal: Where the change direction motor?
[2024-11-26T20:20:09] GABE: in the app surely
[2024-11-26T20:25:43] haku: i saw this giant turbo blower today. what is it?
[2024-11-26T20:26:10] Max Rainlogix: thats engine for an miata
[2024-11-26T20:26:58] haku: lmao
[2024-11-26T20:29:33] Noname: Pump
[2024-11-26T20:29:56] haku: for water?
[2024-11-26T20:30:04] Noname: See "global pump" on back of trailer 😆
[2024-11-26T20:30:31] Noname: Yeah prob flooded work area etc.
[2024-11-26T20:30:54] haku: lol i dont know how to read sometimes
[2024-11-26T20:33:37] haku: im so pumped to build peak g30 v2. so many ideas going thru my head right now. it might break me
[2024-11-26T20:34:30] haku: i dont even want to ride the wepoor anymore. this one is better
[2024-11-26T20:46:17] Noname: Now I know your nuts. Wepoor is awesome. How much was the mini?
[2024-11-26T20:46:42] haku: $40 cash money baby
[2024-11-26T20:47:28] haku: peak g30v2 will be my portable one wepoor will be the cruiser
[2024-11-26T20:47:56] haku: i need a truck for the wepoor
[2024-11-26T20:53:33] Noname: You have a trailer hitch on car? Bike Cargo carrier would work
[2024-11-26T20:54:04] haku: no i have a bike cargo carrier. wepoor too heavy
[2024-11-26T20:54:30] Noname: No it plugs into the hitch.
[2024-11-26T20:54:58] haku: oh those ones. yea maybe maeketplace has em
[2024-11-26T20:55:58] Noname: Do you have a hitch though
[2024-11-26T21:05:50] haku: yes
[2024-11-26T21:06:32] haku: this one yea?
[2024-11-26T21:09:14] haku: im not gonna attatch a trailer to car just for wepoor to go further. thats why i got the mini bike for it. question is the battery placement. hailong case or mounted in stem
[2024-11-26T21:09:42] haku: handlebars. forgot we have short stem now 😜
[2024-11-26T21:10:36] haku: also i have the 40t to range extender the wepoor if i want it to go really far
[2024-11-26T21:10:36] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-26T21:10:57] Noname: Idk mabey bring it to CA or whatever
[2024-11-26T21:16:50] haku: i have this one but tires wont fit.
[2024-11-26T21:17:05] haku: for normal ebikes
[2024-11-26T21:18:17] haku: i dont know exactly how you classify wepoor. seated scooter or minibike? is it a they/them. what is it?
[2024-11-26T21:26:52] haku: the guy im bought the minibike is repping hard. even gave me a flag.

[2024-11-26T22:44:22] haku: there is a clear coat on the sticker.
[2024-11-26T22:45:30] haku: fatboy is just such a toxic masculine brand.
[2024-11-26T22:57:15] Lieven L.: Sand it down with a belt sander an blast the rest with a cheap sand blaster if you have a compressor at home.
[2024-11-26T22:57:45] haku: i dont have those tools unfortunately
[2024-11-26T22:58:22] haku: ill find someone that can sandblast it for cheap hopefully. i have to make sure all of components fit first
[2024-11-26T22:59:34] Noname: Well.if the sticker hurts you just razor blade it off. The sticker not your wrist
[2024-11-26T23:00:19] haku: its not gender confirming. and fat shameful name

[2024-11-27T00:03:50] haku: dam. sweden anti elon or what?
[2024-11-27T00:04:56] 'lekrsu': It's the design not meeting the requirements
[2024-11-27T00:04:59] haku: what is the reason. i thought sweden is all about "green energy"
[2024-11-27T00:05:18] haku: lawd
[2024-11-27T00:05:34] 'lekrsu': quick google showed one Cybertruck was modified to be legal at the cost of 500000€
[2024-11-27T00:05:47] 'lekrsu': Visited a Cybertruck at Tesla in Malmö, never seen something like it before
[2024-11-27T00:06:21] 'lekrsu': They drove it down the street from truck delivery into the shop, even then those 50 meters was illegal 😁

[2024-11-27T06:20:28] haku: i think moped culture is alteady in the US but more in the east coast
[2024-11-27T06:24:06] haku: last time i tried that on the wepoor vesc went kaboom
[2024-11-27T06:25:26] haku: these are fardriver kings im sure. cheap china bang for buck builds
[2024-11-27T06:32:13] Noname: Motor is spinning its fine it doesn't know anything other than spin. You stalled 1 and spun the other
[2024-11-27T06:36:56] haku: best believe mini bmx/peak g30 v2 will be doing dual motor burnouts with 16x4

[2024-11-27T07:29:46] haku: you saw it first here boys. i dont follow the trend. i am the trend. 5yrs from now this setup will be the final evolution of stamding scooters
[2024-11-27T07:35:36] haku: wtf is this. why pokemon? why? cant i just read a book to my kid without any of this woke bs.
[2024-11-27T09:10:40] Jan: Some legendary one-off have no gender, that has been like this for nearly 30years
[2024-11-27T09:11:01] Jan: Mew, Mewto to.my knowledge have no gender
[2024-11-27T09:11:23] Jan: Same for the 3 legendary birds of the first gen
[2024-11-27T09:11:23] haku: mewto is a dude.
[2024-11-27T09:12:34] Jan: It never had a gender, it is a clone of a genderless pokemon, its been genderless for like 30years before the woke bullshit came
[2024-11-27T09:13:47] haku: true. but mewto talks like a dude acts like a dude. definalty a dude.
[2024-11-27T09:26:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: send a screen theme from the mobile app
[2024-11-27T09:26:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: edit your own screen theme
[2024-11-27T09:27:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_19707@27-11-2024_09-27-16.jpg>

[2024-11-27T09:30:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>
[2024-11-27T09:33:56] Yamal: Wouhhh

[2024-11-27T09:34:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: live screen theme switch with buttons
[2024-11-27T09:34:46] Lieven L.: The reason why it's illegal in the EU is mainly because of pedestrian safety. It's getting messy when sharp hard edges meat soft pedestrian bodies. 😅
[2024-11-27T10:19:07] GABE: LOL
[2024-11-27T10:19:26] GABE: slow scooters cause the most crashes
[2024-11-27T10:19:38] GABE: it gives people the illusion it's safer when it isn't
[2024-11-27T10:21:04] Lieven L.: I'll tell this to the cops next time they stop me
[2024-11-27T10:28:37] GABE: whose idea was it to force someone to go 20kmh on a cross or roundabout. Man
[2024-11-27T10:28:52] GABE: Think even a person with DS can figure this out very quickly.
[2024-11-27T11:28:48] Yamal: 🔥
[2024-11-27T11:31:08] Yamal: Im really noob ,,,, but look amazing.
[2024-11-27T11:32:49] David: So my piece of 💩 vesc just died
[2024-11-27T11:33:15] David: Connected a 74V Tried in air some test, left rest without any load for 20sec and boooom
[2024-11-27T11:33:21] David: <photos/photo_19708@27-11-2024_11-33-21.jpg>
[2024-11-27T11:33:40] David: Eventually took it apart and removed blown cap and one that is about to blow as well
[2024-11-27T11:33:42] 'lekrsu': Flipsky moment unfortunately
[2024-11-27T11:33:46] David: <photos/photo_19709@27-11-2024_11-33-46.jpg>
[2024-11-27T11:33:46] David: <photos/photo_19710@27-11-2024_11-33-46.jpg>

[2024-11-27T11:33:56] David: Now I'm having 2 types of caps
[2024-11-27T11:34:00] David: <photos/photo_19713@27-11-2024_11-34-00.jpg>
[2024-11-27T11:34:00] David: <photos/photo_19714@27-11-2024_11-34-00.jpg>
[2024-11-27T11:34:06] David: Which one better to put?
[2024-11-27T11:34:41] JPPL: 1st is used normally
[2024-11-27T11:34:49] 'lekrsu': nichicon is a good brand
[2024-11-27T11:34:58] David: I don't know what is the 1st for you hehe
[2024-11-27T11:35:12] David: The nichicon or the samxon
[2024-11-27T11:35:19] David: That's what I'm thinking
[2024-11-27T11:35:32] 'lekrsu': Is the board functioning?
[2024-11-27T11:35:41] David: I think is the lower esr?
[2024-11-27T11:35:44] David: Yes
[2024-11-27T11:35:58] David: But vesc acting strange
[2024-11-27T11:36:01] David: Sending video
[2024-11-27T11:36:07] JPPL: Nichicon
[2024-11-27T11:36:13] David: <video_file>
[2024-11-27T11:36:18] 'lekrsu': Flipsky's qc is *special*
[2024-11-27T11:36:21] David: This ofcourse without the blown cap
[2024-11-27T11:36:31] David: But this behavior was before blow as well
[2024-11-27T11:36:41] David: I'm thinking something is fucked up here
[2024-11-27T11:36:52] David: And sorry for the Hebrew in video
[2024-11-27T11:37:44] JPPL: Yeah, seems like interference, how os your ADC low input que you are configuring? 0 or some volts?
[2024-11-27T11:37:46] David: The 3 pin connector is throttle while 2pin is the brakes I've done resistor mod using 10K resistor connected between adc2 and 3.3V for allowing "motor cutoff" when brakes are pressed
[2024-11-27T11:37:59] David: 0 i think
[2024-11-27T11:38:29] Max Rainlogix: What kind of display is that?
[2024-11-27T11:38:38] JPPL: Check that value, and other ADC input, give some margin, if its 0 start at 0.2
[2024-11-27T11:40:25] David: 🤮
[2024-11-27T11:41:06] David: Too big
[2024-11-27T11:41:34] David: I can solder but it not making his way through the Aluminum case
[2024-11-27T11:42:50] JPPL: You can find news, or make them "portable", move them from there to other space you have, with wires 😊
[2024-11-27T11:43:25] David: Easy just buy matching caps
[2024-11-27T11:43:46] David: Regular caps will be enough Or it's need to be low ESR and etc?
[2024-11-27T12:21:48] David: By suggestion of a group member I've been told to put 1 that should cover both original caps
[2024-11-27T12:23:29] David: New "throttle mod" 😂😂😂😂😂

[2024-11-27T17:40:15] Face de Pin Sucé: If you can't afford yourself something, don't say it's bullshit because it's Rage Mechanics
[2024-11-27T17:40:42] Max Rainlogix: Give me facts that makes it cost at least 500€

[2024-11-27T17:42:43] Yamal: <photos/photo_19728@27-11-2024_17-42-43.jpg>
[2024-11-27T17:44:50] Face de Pin Sucé: The display you shows is looking good, and it's the only thing that is close to smartdisplay It doesn't have : - Theme change fully personnalizable - Navigation GPS - CANBUS !!! - Android Music control - Acceleration Mode ( I don't speak of power nor speed) - Tyre pressure support - Android and IOS application - Telemetry Offline - Telemetry Live - VESC Bridge - Aluminium CNC case - 2mm thick no reflects glass to be rocksolid when experience big crashes - Compatibility with multiple controllers technology - Throttle Calibration - In-built DAC for throttle - Canbus Expansion Boards to control all lights of your vehicle, connect different BMS, connect a 25Hz GPS - So much more I can't remember
[2024-11-27T17:45:41] Face de Pin Sucé: So please, before comparing 2 products by their price because the look is similar, take in consideration, that, MAYBE, one has something that the other doesn't have, justifying the price
[2024-11-27T17:46:03] Max Rainlogix: Have
[2024-11-27T17:46:20] Max Rainlogix: Also have
[2024-11-27T17:47:02] Face de Pin Sucé: For your information, an Alfano that only does the telemetry part, is +500€ and looks like nothing compared to a smartdisplay
[2024-11-27T17:48:06] Face de Pin Sucé: yes, ble uart, we can connect vesc tool over wifi like vesc express, it's nothing close to smartdisplay
[2024-11-27T17:48:58] Face de Pin Sucé: 500€ is, actually, not expansive regarding all the features implemented in SmartDisplay
[2024-11-27T17:49:39] Face de Pin Sucé: And it costs a lot more to produce that the cost of the display you shows, because it's not a 3D printed FDM case, or anything like that
[2024-11-27T17:51:10] Max Rainlogix: If needed case may be alu or anything you want
[2024-11-27T17:52:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Are you that dumb ? so, I list 16 features the other display doesn't have, your answer is (if needed case may be alu or anything you want) seriously ?
[2024-11-27T17:55:26] Max Rainlogix: Yeah 👍
[2024-11-27T18:00:19] Face de Pin Sucé: yeah okay

[2024-11-27T19:44:31] David: @SirModAlot @SirModAlot So not to order the 75200 Pro V2 right?

[2024-11-28T10:29:13] GABE: keep in mind the snsc can't fold so it's non transportable. Trains and sending as a package to another country, sending the cell separately
[2024-11-28T10:33:40] GABE: <photos/photo_19768@28-11-2024_10-33-40.jpg>
[2024-11-28T10:33:50] GABE: Outside mine.
[2024-11-28T10:34:33] GABE: Welder started to work after I let it sit. I didn't know it had storage instructions and a discharge
[2024-11-28T10:34:47] GABE: let it sit all night at 0v
[2024-11-28T10:34:47] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-28T10:40:26] Jason: ik thats why I'm going full on for snsc
[2024-11-28T10:40:44] Jason: I can't fold it so I can't go around with those so I don't have to really worry about weight
[2024-11-28T10:41:51] GABE: Chonker 55kg for sure
[2024-11-28T10:44:29] Jason: xd
[2024-11-28T12:21:11] Andrei Albert: Want a vesc shit like thisssssssss boy
[2024-11-28T12:21:30] Andrei Albert: <video_file>
[2024-11-28T13:46:18] Rose: Hey there Jean, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-11-28T13:47:42] Jean Bilbao: Hey guys nice to meet you! I have a Vsett 11+ and I’m planning to vesc it. Building a 60V50ah battery so had to come here
[2024-11-28T14:07:41] GABE: How did you find us.
[2024-11-28T14:07:51] GABE: what motors
[2024-11-28T14:08:11] GABE: 60v50ah says nothing
[2024-11-28T14:08:30] GABE: what celll
[2024-11-28T14:09:28] Jean Bilbao: TikTok, someone sent me the link because I asked for some advice. And stock motors 2000W. 21700 LG if I’m not mistaken. I’m a big noob on this, my friend is helping me build the battery etc
[2024-11-28T14:23:27] GABE: At what cell amperage bro
[2024-11-28T14:23:46] GABE: And winding?
[2024-11-28T15:03:06] JPPL: <video_file>
[2024-11-28T15:13:47] Apo: hes new, hes a noob in this as he already said himself, i bet he doesnt know what most of these mean, so throwing these questions at him straight away wont help i guess :D
[2024-11-28T15:14:41] 'lekrsu': holy fuck xD
[2024-11-28T15:14:48] 'lekrsu': donate motors to me instead))
[2024-11-28T15:15:10] Apo: Jean what he means to say is simly knowing its LG doesnt mean anything, we need to know the cells itself, the full name and more infos on the motors too if possible, just wattage rating is not helpful as it doesnt mean much, just what the motor is safely rated for
[2024-11-28T15:15:52] Jean Bilbao: Sorry, in the office so slow replies. Will send a message with all the details in a second! Thank you so much guys
[2024-11-28T15:18:57] 'lekrsu': )) goal is 500w per amp 😁

[2024-11-28T16:51:21] Noname: Most common lg when I searched is m50lt so 14a x 10p probably. Can only fit about 16 in a row with space for controllers. He'd be about 9kw safely. Fine for stock motors
[2024-11-28T18:32:47] haku: happy thanksgiving
[2024-11-28T19:00:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>

[2024-11-28T19:00:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You have to do everything to avoid getting bored
[2024-11-28T19:01:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If it is to make discharge teas
[2024-11-28T19:01:58] haku: polishing some copper also helps with boredom
[2024-11-28T19:03:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 68,51€ | Probador de CC de 180W, monitor de capacidad de batería de litio de carga electrónica, medidor de potencia de carga de descarga, comprobador de suministro + disparador PD/QC https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ez9k4JW

[2024-11-28T19:09:16] JPPL: Mm
[2024-11-28T19:09:22] Noname: Well it's 3.5 tire tread but the center is narrow with rim at 73. It's kinda up to how the tire fills out when on rim.
[2024-11-28T19:09:29] haku: theres a 80 thays good to know
[2024-11-28T19:09:48] JPPL: Pmt italian, let check

[2024-11-28T21:12:24] Yamal: We'll soon say goodbye to the year, brother. How has the 24th been?

[2024-11-28T21:17:23] haku: holidays coming. donate to my christmas charity
[2024-11-28T21:18:19] Yamal: have you put up the christmas tree?
[2024-11-28T21:27:39] haku: yes. i also splurge a bit for thanksgiving meal.
[2024-11-28T21:28:02] haku: ribeyes baby. in celebration of 47
[2024-11-28T21:47:38] Pandalgns: 47 what?? Years?? Its ur bday @Bradhaku ?
[2024-11-28T21:47:59] Pandalgns: U look like a baby 😏😏
[2024-11-28T21:52:38] haku: 47 president baby.
[2024-11-28T21:53:26] Pandalgns: Was Trump proclaimed president today?
[2024-11-28T21:56:09] haku: no. its a late celebration and giving thanks to him being back in the throne for thanksgiving
[2024-11-28T22:00:05] Pandalgns: Any reason is good to celebrate something, especially if it is with ribeyes like those🤤🤤
[2024-11-28T22:00:48] haku: just splurging a bit. bull market. economy getting better. the future looks bright.
[2024-11-28T22:01:05] haku: i havent had these since jan 2020
[2024-11-28T22:02:17] Pandalgns: I think that Trump is going to improve the economy and avoid major conflicts. He is a wise guy with knowledge of economics since before being a politician he is a great businessman.
[2024-11-28T22:03:04] Pandalgns: Unfortunately in Spain we have a piece of shit in power who the only thing he does is laugh at the people
[2024-11-28T22:04:26] haku: more important to me than the economy and conficts is the 2 gender policy. no more of that bs taught in schools
[2024-11-28T22:06:10] Andrei Albert: I have a kamala here in ro
[2024-11-28T22:06:19] Andrei Albert: And a trump
[2024-11-28T22:06:33] Andrei Albert: Fucking history its happening here
[2024-11-28T22:06:56] Andrei Albert: I think ill go out to punch some 🏳️‍🌈
[2024-11-28T22:07:25] haku: my dog was actually a real transgender. woke vet cut off his manhood when he was a puppy. now he wants to be a boy dog again and is depressed
[2024-11-28T22:08:06] haku: that hormone stuff is ireversable
[2024-11-28T22:31:53] Pandalgns: gender laws gender ideologis.... that is a very big piece of shit that here in Spain is very fashionable, 50 different types of gender and accept it or else you are the bad guy in the movie... anyway... the world is crazy
[2024-11-28T22:33:14] haku: yes. 2 genders only. the one you are born with. you cant change unless your an adult. but you cant force that shit on kids
[2024-11-28T22:33:37] haku: its so trendy to have pronouns now its crazy
[2024-11-28T22:34:07] haku: males fighting females in combat sports and beating the shit out of em
[2024-11-28T22:34:44] Pandalgns: That's the worst, that they want to put that shit into children's heads even in schools.
[2024-11-28T22:35:53] haku: in the US if you have that ideology they call you a facist bigot homophobe and cancel you. finally things are changing
[2024-11-28T22:36:25] Pandalgns: Here in Spain to refer to the masculine the pronoun "el" is used for the feminine "ella" now the fashion is for the "neutral" elle" what the hell?
[2024-11-28T22:36:43] Pandalgns: in Spain too
[2024-11-28T22:37:26] Pandalgns: In Spain, if you don't think like them and act like them, you are a homophobic and racist fascist Nazi.
[2024-11-28T22:37:40] haku: US is tired that BS. i feel it in society.

[2024-11-29T03:54:17] haku: thers turkey too but i fucked it up. too dry.
[2024-11-29T03:55:02] Noname: Gravey is the answer
[2024-11-29T04:37:45] haku: would this fit my rim? I just found this on AliExpress: $14.15 | 70/65-6.5 Outer Tire for Ninebot 9 Self-Balanced Vehicle Accessories 10 Inch Pneumatic Tire https://a.aliexpress.com/_mO5oFVz
[2024-11-29T04:39:08] Noname: 2.75 wide 10" tall
[2024-11-29T04:39:24] haku: thats 2.75 wide?
[2024-11-29T04:39:32] haku: im okay with 10"
[2024-11-29T04:39:55] Noname: 70mm my dude
[2024-11-29T04:40:02] haku: ill get this. I just found this on AliExpress: $44.64 | 10 inch Tubeless Tire 10x3.0-6.5 Vacuum for 10 Inch Electric Scooter Replacement Parts https://a.aliexpress.com/_m0psAmb
[2024-11-29T04:40:09] haku: 3"
[2024-11-29T04:40:24] haku: 10 is okay aslong as it doesnt rub
[2024-11-29T04:41:01] haku: im hoping this one will fit my rim easily. its tubeless too
[2024-11-29T04:44:00] haku: peak g30v2 trend is a new phenomenon. i will be the founding father of this movement
[2024-11-29T04:44:01] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-11-29T04:48:00] Noname: Ok we gonna wrinkle your 🧠. 1st number is tire width weather it's metric or freedom. 2nd number is called aspect ratio. Not important. It's the percent of the width and that equils sidewall. So a 90 65 6.5 tire is 90 wide 90 x .65 = 58.5 Multiply that x 2 and add rim size. That's tire height
[2024-11-29T04:49:18] haku: lol
[2024-11-29T04:49:20] Noname: I even gave him a tire calculator link
[2024-11-29T04:49:26] Noname: No thinking involved
[2024-11-29T04:49:41] haku: how do i determin width like how fat the tire will be
[2024-11-29T04:49:48] Noname: Oh lol thought you meant rice boy not tire
[2024-11-29T04:50:12] haku: we turkey and dog today buddy
[2024-11-29T04:50:19] Noname: 1st NUMBER IS WIDTH
[2024-11-29T04:51:30] haku: this kinda width. or girth like how call it.
[2024-11-29T04:51:56] Noname: THE FIRST NUMBER IS TIRE WIDTH
[2024-11-29T04:52:24] haku: so 10 65 6.5 is 10 in girth
[2024-11-29T04:52:55] Noname: Typo
[2024-11-29T04:53:03] Noname: 100 65 6.5
[2024-11-29T04:53:09] haku: oh wtf

[2024-11-29T04:53:41] Noname: Gimme the number
[2024-11-29T04:53:57] haku: what about this how mm or inch is this in fatness/thickness. I just found this on AliExpress: $44.64 | 10 inch Tubeless Tire 10x3.0-6.5 Vacuum for 10 Inch Electric Scooter Replacement Parts https://a.aliexpress.com/_m0psAmb
[2024-11-29T04:54:15] Noname: Oh lol that's a 10"
[2024-11-29T04:54:26] Noname: Cause freedom units

[2024-11-29T04:54:40] Noname: 3
[2024-11-29T04:54:54] Noname: 10 tall 3 wide 6.5 rim in American
[2024-11-29T04:54:57] haku: ok. thats my question. it should fit my 73mm rim yea
[2024-11-29T04:55:17] haku: <photos/photo_19771@28-11-2024_19-07-22.jpg>

[2024-11-29T19:39:20] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If the guy on YouTube is Spanish, he has many videos of inventions. The bicycle that we saw on the video I thought about doing. When I saw it, it gave me ideas, but since the black one was a little bigger, I thought, well, we'll do this one, then the small one, which by the way I like to do more. The small one is more kuki
[2024-11-29T19:49:13] haku: yes ive seen that too. i thought i was the first one i guess its been done before

[2024-11-30T20:50:07] GABE: Id make a good assumption and say you could push 26kw through it. 13kw being a very high push on the 6fet.
[2024-11-30T20:50:34] GABE: The mosfets are the exact same iirc, double load capacity

[2024-11-30T22:45:34] haku: oh no. no hate from me dude. i think of it as jokes and fun
[2024-11-30T22:46:53] Yamal: I'm wondering the same

[2024-12-01T10:27:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Does both motors have to be sensored for the traction control to work good ?
[2024-12-01T10:32:42] yoann tsobanoglou: I think I found the problem. One of the mosfets doesn’t have correct contact with the board

[2024-12-01T14:00:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Wut
[2024-12-01T14:01:42] Patrick: More Watt is needed to achive the speeds so yes Watt also matters for speed
[2024-12-01T14:02:20] Patrick: Air resistance limits youre topspeed at these speeds the most
[2024-12-01T14:21:04] Paolo ⁭: You fixed can?
[2024-12-01T14:21:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: if i fix the cam

[2024-12-01T14:46:40] puneDir: Hi guys
[2024-12-01T14:49:57] GABE: The junk ends up dragging the wallet, as always.
[2024-12-01T14:50:06] GABE: 40 fucking euros for literal shit ill throw out later.
[2024-12-01T14:59:15] Mirono escooters: Didn't you have a good welder
[2024-12-01T15:25:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ?
[2024-12-01T15:32:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hey bro
[2024-12-01T15:33:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2024-12-01T15:42:38] Mirono escooters: You switch to sensor less over x kmh anyway soo.. no?
[2024-12-01T15:42:41] Mirono escooters: Educated guess
[2024-12-01T16:15:50] Morten Jensen: I can’t get field weakening to work, no matter how many amps I set it to. I have chaged it in Lisp also. My setup is: m365 20s flipsky 75200 v2.0 pro, using original m365 Pro Display. Alli 350w motor?
[2024-12-01T16:28:16] GABE: Power surge while i pressed the weld pedal
[2024-12-01T16:31:26] Mirono escooters: Explain?
[2024-12-01T16:36:07] 'lekrsu': Speed's very accurate at high bemf, more so than halls would've been.
[2024-12-01T16:37:26] 'lekrsu': Do you hit your duty activation % at max speed? You may need to lower it.
[2024-12-01T16:38:20] Mirono escooters: Halls get totally fucked at double digit speed numbers
[2024-12-01T16:38:42] Mirono escooters: I wonder if encoders are any better Eh, backemf wins anyway
[2024-12-01T16:38:53] Morten Jensen: Its set to 80%
[2024-12-01T16:40:24] 'lekrsu': But do you reach it?
[2024-12-01T16:40:42] 'lekrsu': You need to adjust the field weakening current in the lisp script solely if you're using that.
[2024-12-01T16:42:01] Morten Jensen: Maybe I don’t reach 80, I will try to lower it.. I have changed it in lisp script
[2024-12-01T16:42:07] NetworkDir: Yeah Basically vesc after 5km/h can calculate nicely with bemf Also try with VSS method instead as sensorless mostly works same as hall sensors without hall
[2024-12-01T16:44:51] Mirono escooters: Vss? I've not read much good about it
[2024-12-01T16:44:59] Mirono escooters: Well, it helps, but not hall replacement
[2024-12-01T17:02:14] haku: its called a peak g30
[2024-12-01T17:11:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Already payed Alex (a legend in the filed of motors ) to sensor my motors
[2024-12-01T17:11:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why ?
[2024-12-01T17:17:50] haku: because its a g30 motor and uses scooter components
[2024-12-01T17:21:24] haku: whats going on my seated brother. hows everything
[2024-12-01T17:28:59] haku: dude ask seller mosfet board. they sent me all kinds of boards for free

[2024-12-01T18:14:49] haku: it looks like my tire but skinnier.
[2024-12-01T18:14:49] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-12-01T18:15:38] Pandalgns: Probably the same size but my hands are big 😂😂😂

[2024-12-01T18:41:44] haku: this guy is current zero world champ. when is turkey getting title back
[2024-12-01T18:43:48] haku: a seated zero will automatically win the world title. no need for speed tests just put seat
[2024-12-01T18:44:28] NetworkDir: zero isn't good for fun rides i understand this on 3 years the type and segment like supermotos but it's isn't decent frame
[2024-12-01T18:44:57] haku: i see. stem very weak yea?
[2024-12-01T18:46:45] haku: seated and chopped stem zero sounds like a winner to me.
[2024-12-01T18:46:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: One thing at the time
[2024-12-01T18:46:58] NetworkDir: stem, neck, frame, stock suspensions snap easily, bad handlebar

[2024-12-01T18:48:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or just buy Ukrainain/upgraded parts
[2024-12-01T18:48:28] NetworkDir: but when you ride +60km/h and this happend you can't buy new part because you will die ?
[2024-12-01T18:48:40] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2024-12-01T18:48:44] NetworkDir: what's about this part?
[2024-12-01T18:49:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Doesn't happent once you can see cracks before it

[2024-12-01T18:50:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Certainly not now

[2024-12-01T23:07:22] Patrick: No the ramp time was set from 0.3 to 0.0. its a little bit better. But i found the problem from first project. The motor temp max setting was at 0degree, i dont know how it happened, but i set it again to 112-120celcius and now its much better. I saw in logfile it push out only 86A phase max. And its 160A 🙂👍🏼 thank you. Maybe tomorrow i look what the nami from a friend doing wrong. 🙂👍🏼

[2024-12-01T23:34:58] haku: hes mr. international

[2024-12-02T13:02:05] Lieven L.: It's measured in china lumen 😉
[2024-12-02T13:15:12] Давно пора: I opened bunch of these led bars they have 1-2 18650 inside
[2024-12-02T13:28:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 28,70€ | 8000mAh 5 LED 5 * P90 luz de bicicleta impermeable USB recargable LED luz de bicicleta 5200 lúmenes linterna y faro como banco de energía https://a.aliexpress.com/_Eu4cXvQ

[2024-12-02T13:31:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: why don't you make a battery for the flashlight with good batteries
[2024-12-02T13:32:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You open the flashlight, look at the batteries, see if they are 18650 or 21700, or if it has 18650, look at the possibility of putting in 21700
[2024-12-02T13:33:15] Yamal: Wherever//// my actually light magi shine it’s 1000lms ………….

[2024-12-02T13:35:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you buy the model that corresponds with the maximum capacity, you will spend the same as buying a new one, but if you make the battery, you will have a flashlight for life.
[2024-12-02T13:35:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: With 10 ah I would have a flashlight for a week

[2024-12-02T17:35:02] haku: people are buying more teslas now its crazy.
[2024-12-02T17:36:49] haku: too bad i cant afford self drive
[2024-12-02T17:38:48] haku: im an early believer in elon. since he bought twitter. hes good for the cause. for humanity
[2024-12-02T17:40:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Caffeine addicts, I've never tried coffee
[2024-12-02T17:44:19] Lieven L.: Well Tesla is producing efficient cars in terms of range, but I don't like their cost cutting. You get decent range but that's about it. They are way overhyped because they do good marketing and people who don't know much about cars will keep buying them.
[2024-12-02T17:47:04] haku: tesla is for the lazy
[2024-12-02T17:47:29] haku: the tech is good enough to trust it
[2024-12-02T17:49:01] Lieven L.: "good enough" 😂 Well I wouldn't trust any manufacurer right now.
[2024-12-02T17:50:06] Lieven L.: Works 98% of the time means I will still crash and die 2% of the time
[2024-12-02T17:51:47] haku: there will be casualties for the cause
[2024-12-02T17:53:17] haku: the 2% will be remembered for thier sacrifice
[2024-12-02T17:53:37] Lieven L.: Well I prefer not to be one of them, Neither behind the wheel nor in front of the car
[2024-12-02T17:55:23] haku: more tesla sales more funding for cure to the virus
[2024-12-02T17:55:28] Lieven L.: You wouldn't want to sacrifice your dog or son right?
[2024-12-02T17:57:08] Lieven L.: Well I think you can automate highways, but real world city driving is just insanely complex
[2024-12-02T18:00:30] haku: i tested self drive in busy city streets. its legit
[2024-12-02T18:01:00] Lieven L.: 100% of the time? 😉
[2024-12-02T18:01:05] haku: the sensors are so good bow

[2024-12-02T18:19:37] Pandalgns: With a xiaomi?? 😂😂
[2024-12-02T18:20:45] haku: yea. i was going 10-15mph and stayed next to me then went full out. my whole body was freezing. it was at night
[2024-12-02T18:21:37] haku: peak g30v2 would smoke him if done
[2024-12-02T18:22:53] Noname: Ram him with the car 😆
[2024-12-02T18:23:26] haku: lol. there is cameras. my car will self snitch on me

[2024-12-02T18:32:42] haku: i will talk to him and convert him on my seated movement.
[2024-12-02T18:33:20] haku: he looks like he will pass the 2 gender policy i have
[2024-12-02T18:35:25] haku: preach the quality of life
[2024-12-02T18:46:05] haku: these young men need guidance. not violence. need to show them proper quality of life and teach then 2 genders
[2024-12-02T18:58:04] haku: elon just need to remove this or change it to american colors. its attracting the wrong crowd.
[2024-12-02T18:58:04] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-02T19:09:18] Yamal: Elon ? Tesla?
[2024-12-02T19:10:04] haku: yes. this is one of the color options for self steering. unfortunately its the best one because you can see it right away
[2024-12-02T19:10:32] Yamal: Oh !no…
[2024-12-02T19:10:43] haku: red whit and blue with stars would be better. easy update
[2024-12-02T19:12:14] haku: the rainbow use to be an awsome color combination before it was used as a flag
[2024-12-02T19:12:30] haku: polaroid and macho man randy savage used em
[2024-12-02T19:13:14] haku: mariokart rainbow road too. so unfortunate what that colors mean now

[2024-12-02T19:22:54] haku: yes october. it died after the election. too much celebrations
[2024-12-02T19:22:59] Yamal: tie a blanket to your head and buy seven
[2024-12-02T19:23:30] haku: too expensive my dude. i would do fardriver first tbh

[2024-12-02T19:25:13] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-12-02T19:25:19] haku: need bigger motors for fardriver anyways
[2024-12-02T19:25:43] haku: legend has it he voted in america. he was the winning vote
[2024-12-02T19:26:09] Yamal: If never can repair, buy new one

[2024-12-02T19:26:22] Yamal: Less 200
[2024-12-02T19:26:30] haku: yea. but budget just limited for me.
[2024-12-02T19:26:59] haku: i want good enough performance for cheap
[2024-12-02T19:27:57] Yamal: Look, I have a handheld light bulb for the scooter.
[2024-12-02T19:29:53] haku: mini bmx peak g30v2 is also in the budget. i really want that done. idk how much welding brake adapters might cost
[2024-12-02T19:30:39] haku: since i saw that bmx frame i just knew i had to build on it
[2024-12-02T19:33:17] haku: im not begging boys but if anyone give me this for christmas i would be extremely grateful.
[2024-12-02T19:33:28] Yamal: My new project is going to cost a lot too, but what a solution to do it little by little,, In the same way I "think" that with the big ubox its safe limits are 200A battery and 300phase because of what people have been saying here...
[2024-12-02T19:34:12] haku: ive ran it at 250/300phase it did not explode but just got hot
[2024-12-02T19:34:53] haku: maybe if i fix cooling it will not get too hot. also a hot day when i tested it
[2024-12-02T19:35:51] haku: i broke it because of burnouts while motor is locked
[2024-12-02T19:35:59] Yamal: I can't open the controller door because of my motors, and I'm considering leaving poor Nami like this and reserving everything for the new project.
[2024-12-02T19:36:23] haku: nami already good it be better with a seat though
[2024-12-02T19:36:30] haku: just saying

[2024-12-02T19:40:36] haku: i will open a gofund me if your serious about that lifestyle
[2024-12-02T19:40:55] haku: if not just put an electric chair. same outcome
[2024-12-02T19:44:37] haku: jeez. https://youtube.com/shorts/42CnhFF1EEE?si=wDdLxyQutPs6LBGj
[2024-12-02T19:44:43] Yamal: but I would really like the nami to have modern ly engines
[2024-12-02T19:45:03] haku: whats the point of this. why not get brembo
[2024-12-02T19:45:16] Yamal: Nice
[2024-12-02T19:46:48] Lieven L.: Cheap bastard better get some moto gp carbon creramic breaks next time 😉
[2024-12-02T19:47:50] haku: lmao. imagine seeing that on these ebikes/surrons
[2024-12-02T19:48:28] haku: ive already seen brembo on a ebike. wich is crazy already
[2024-12-02T19:48:29] Lieven L.: Brakes worth 20 Surrons 😅
[2024-12-02T19:50:17] Lieven L.: https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthebrakereport.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2Fbrembo-will-keep-supplying-its-advanced-braking-systems-for-the-2023-motogp-championship-212192_1.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=ed220211c317d5f6d1c11f9ca74ce04a7eb4fa6e440976e20b565f66d78681b4&ipo=images
[2024-12-02T19:50:23] Z: Probably in the wrong channel
[2024-12-02T19:51:28] haku: post on general.
[2024-12-02T19:51:31] Lieven L.: The freaking damper integration within the caliper mount is just insane.
[2024-12-02T19:52:40] Z: Scared that these screw holes might split the frame. Where is a good place to put a reinforced plate ?
[2024-12-02T19:52:41] Z: <photos/photo_19850@02-12-2024_19-52-41.jpg>
[2024-12-02T19:52:59] haku: i can see that on emotos someday
[2024-12-02T19:53:18] haku: the tech not there yet to go as fast as gas
[2024-12-02T19:55:06] Lieven L.: Well energy density of liquids is just crazy. We need higher density, higher discharge and less heat.
[2024-12-02T20:44:03] haku: this is what im talking about mounting to the side with alu fins. instead of mounted right on battery(red) it will be mounted to the side(blue) but on aluminum fins. thats why im considering the form factor of the new spintend 12fet.
[2024-12-02T20:45:49] haku: i hope it wont blow up pushing limits
[2024-12-02T20:47:56] haku: look at this printer. holy cow! https://youtu.be/VEgwnhLHy3g?si=-iyDhrgmpiBCD9Jn
[2024-12-02T20:49:54] Yamal: But less power ..?
[2024-12-02T20:50:33] haku: yea. its for the front wheel anyways
[2024-12-02T20:50:45] Yamal: 85/240 right?
[2024-12-02T20:50:48] haku: yea
[2024-12-02T20:51:18] Yamal: I like the single phase wiress…
[2024-12-02T20:51:52] haku: its weaker than the old 12fet.
[2024-12-02T20:51:57] Yamal: Hard to solder the 85/250 on bullet 8mm for a noob
[2024-12-02T20:52:11] haku: i use 10mm
[2024-12-02T20:52:23] Yamal: Next time I try bullet Amass
[2024-12-02T20:52:51] Yamal: 85/240 look amazing also the price…
[2024-12-02T20:53:02] haku: yea. agreed
[2024-12-02T20:53:31] haku: but old 12 fet is just known for its durability. the new one hasnt been pushed yet
[2024-12-02T20:53:35] Yamal: <photos/photo_19852@02-12-2024_20-53-35.jpg>
[2024-12-02T20:54:28] haku: 18fet ive heard in the works
[2024-12-02T20:54:30] Yamal: Maybe same power..?
[2024-12-02T20:54:38] haku: no.
[2024-12-02T20:54:53] Yamal: If you use 200A battery and 300 phase ..
[2024-12-02T20:55:23] haku: yea maybe that. not 250/300 like i use tgough
[2024-12-02T20:55:38] haku: maybe 240/300
[2024-12-02T20:56:09] Yamal: but I really prefer the capacitors to be inside,,, unless you have the electronics sheltered,,
[2024-12-02T20:56:31] haku: agreed
[2024-12-02T20:57:08] Yamal: Ubox come with 250 from home … but it’s crazy more than 3Shull,,, but better use only 200
[2024-12-02T20:57:23] Yamal: And also it’s crazy 400A battery
[2024-12-02T20:57:41] Yamal: I think …
[2024-12-02T20:59:29] Yamal: 22s11p 40pl?/ 18/24seven and 85h 33/2could be another spacex
[2024-12-02T21:00:16] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-12-02T21:00:16] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-02T21:02:28] haku: i will bail you out
[2024-12-02T21:02:47] haku: why 22 when you can do 30s
[2024-12-02T21:03:08] haku: your not limited by racing rules
[2024-12-02T21:03:21] Yamal: If you want “universal” races 22s limit…
[2024-12-02T21:03:54] haku: yea. but im not doing that so do whatever the limit of the controller is
[2024-12-02T21:04:13] Yamal: If get 18/24
[2024-12-02T21:04:19] Yamal: 22 okeee
[2024-12-02T21:04:24] haku: where do you even fond a charger for 30s lol
[2024-12-02T21:05:07] haku: 126v
[2024-12-02T21:05:18] Yamal: No problem i think… unicycle have so much V
[2024-12-02T21:05:25] Yamal: So can get..
[2024-12-02T21:05:27] haku: oh thats right
[2024-12-02T21:05:56] Yamal: 30s for go buy the bread
[2024-12-02T21:06:32] haku: 30s 8 or 9p will fit my battery box
[2024-12-02T21:06:49] haku: but motor is the limiting factor
[2024-12-02T21:07:23] Yamal: I miss your e-miniscooterbike
[2024-12-02T21:07:38] Yamal: Also your route in desert…
[2024-12-02T21:07:50] haku: me too. i miss riding it but too distracted and broke to fix it
[2024-12-02T21:08:00] Yamal: 🐂
[2024-12-02T21:08:45] haku: the surron boys are out in mass since i broke wepoor
[2024-12-02T21:12:31] haku: i actually want a dirtbike/pitbike in the future. so many dirt trails here
[2024-12-02T21:17:14] haku: another day another big booty workout.
[2024-12-02T21:18:08] Yamal: Here now at 6:30 it is night, I have little desire to go out and even more so with a hand lamp.
[2024-12-02T21:21:46] Yamal: I don't know whether to get into engines or rfp frame next month
[2024-12-02T21:22:13] haku: engines then use it for your nami for now
[2024-12-02T21:22:23] haku: then get rfp frame
[2024-12-02T21:22:53] Yamal: disturb the Nami or let him rest easy
[2024-12-02T21:22:59] haku: atleast you get to use it. if you buy frame you will be waiting on motors
[2024-12-02T21:24:32] haku: you doing 75-80h? 33x2?
[2024-12-02T21:25:06] Yamal: The issue is that by the time next season starts the Thunder will of course not be ready, because it's not just the engines, it's the electronics/battery/brakes etc etc, and if Nami has the engines at least I'll be able to go have fun
[2024-12-02T21:25:15] Yamal: 75…
[2024-12-02T21:25:22] haku: 33x2?
[2024-12-02T21:25:30] Yamal: But okeee for Nami
[2024-12-02T21:25:32] Yamal: Yes
[2024-12-02T21:25:42] haku: there you go.
[2024-12-02T21:25:56] haku: what does the rfp frame look like. just curious
[2024-12-02T21:26:11] Yamal: I post many time
[2024-12-02T21:26:22] haku: not the link
[2024-12-02T21:26:40] haku: and i cannot understand le french
[2024-12-02T21:29:11] haku: keep snow white white. just saying
[2024-12-02T21:30:07] Yamal: <photos/photo_19854@02-12-2024_21-30-07.jpg>
[2024-12-02T21:30:38] Yamal: I want this type scooter 🔥

[2024-12-02T21:31:07] Yamal: RFP solution
[2024-12-02T21:31:15] haku: thats a longboy
[2024-12-02T21:31:27] Max Rainlogix: Grill thing
[2024-12-02T21:31:30] Yamal: Also i start in this world with thunder
[2024-12-02T21:31:41] haku: thats a dualtron? limosine?
[2024-12-02T21:31:43] Yamal: So “back” to this scooter it’s nice ..
[2024-12-02T21:32:21] Max Rainlogix: Dualtron base 100%
[2024-12-02T21:32:33] Max Rainlogix: Long body
[2024-12-02T21:32:58] haku: thats modified frame though yea? custom milled?
[2024-12-02T21:33:08] Max Rainlogix: I think so
[2024-12-02T21:33:40] haku: perfect for a long seat with that short stem. just saying
[2024-12-02T21:33:55] Yamal: Many time i post…😂
[2024-12-02T21:34:13] haku: sometimes im asleep when you post my boy
[2024-12-02T21:35:02] haku: im more curious with the bikes in the background
[2024-12-02T21:37:31] Yamal: <photos/photo_19855@02-12-2024_21-37-31.jpg>
[2024-12-02T21:38:08] haku: rage and rfp work together yea?
[2024-12-02T21:38:20] Yamal: <photos/photo_19856@02-12-2024_21-38-20.jpg>
[2024-12-02T21:39:12] Yamal: Curious
[2024-12-02T21:39:18] haku: is your stem on nami that short
[2024-12-02T21:39:37] Yamal: They just mount short stem
[2024-12-02T21:39:53] haku: but your nami is it that short?
[2024-12-02T21:40:30] Yamal: Yes because I cut
[2024-12-02T21:40:41] Yamal: I put new one soon
[2024-12-02T21:40:43] haku: how you ride comfy like that
[2024-12-02T21:40:46] Yamal: Just waiting arrive
[2024-12-02T21:40:50] Yamal: Aluminium
[2024-12-02T21:40:57] haku: you will be half squat or hunched
[2024-12-02T21:41:08] Yamal: 😂
[2024-12-02T21:41:42] haku: might aswell add a seat my guy. just trust me on this
[2024-12-02T21:41:43] Yamal: I drive every day as if someone is chasing me
[2024-12-02T21:42:01] haku: that short of a stem needs a seat
[2024-12-02T21:42:38] haku: i wonder if the racing guys allow seats in thier races
[2024-12-02T21:42:48] haku: they should consider it
[2024-12-02T21:43:09] Yamal: also because I want to start training soon
[2024-12-02T21:43:57] haku: gotcha. makes sense. but not good for a daily scooter. it will fuck your posture. remember chest up like a man not hunched
[2024-12-02T21:44:32] Yamal: For Daly, better get power g30 hehe
[2024-12-02T21:44:38] haku: you want those pecs hitting breaking the wind
[2024-12-02T21:45:46] Yamal: I’m really Okee with the stem
[2024-12-02T21:45:58] Yamal: Drive like 🦍
[2024-12-02T21:46:24] haku: but if your hunched the cleavage will show. they might mistake you for a female
[2024-12-02T21:46:50] Yamal: and you can't imagine how much fun it is to drive, everything is easier
[2024-12-02T21:47:17] haku: ill cut es3 stem if i can and see
[2024-12-02T21:47:26] ✨🇪🇸عمر: French scooter 😎😎
[2024-12-02T21:47:29] haku: i cant judge since i havent tried it
[2024-12-02T21:48:00] Yamal: Just think make for race , not for Daly life
[2024-12-02T21:48:43] Yamal: I would also like the idea of one for offroad
[2024-12-02T21:48:48] haku: toxic masculinity is back boys. embrace it
[2024-12-02T21:49:46] haku: it was never gone for me
[2024-12-02T21:51:08] Yamal: neither for any of us
[2024-12-02T21:51:21] haku: learn from hulk hogan not pdiddy
[2024-12-02T21:52:28] Yamal: That's something you're born with... how do you tell a lion to be a lioness?
[2024-12-02T21:52:55] haku: good answer.
[2024-12-02T21:53:39] Yamal: By the way, on Thursday we are going to a wok to stuff ourselves with Argentine-style beef, invite us to work xD
[2024-12-02T21:54:01] haku: picanha eh
[2024-12-02T21:54:55] Yamal: It's a wook that has everything, but they have a grill Argentina, usually empty and churrasco
[2024-12-02T21:55:04] haku: love that style of cooking
[2024-12-02T21:55:14] haku: churrasco
[2024-12-02T21:56:14] Yamal: For me, it is the best of the cow, I have loved it since I was a child, meat with bone and fat
[2024-12-02T21:56:56] haku: we have those restaurants here too churrasco style. but brazilian
[2024-12-02T21:57:13] Yamal: Samba weeh

[2024-12-02T21:57:59] haku: i like that too. but duck not so much
[2024-12-02T21:58:15] haku: fried rice on a wok
[2024-12-02T21:58:21] Yamal: fish, seafood, sushi and many types of fried foods""
[2024-12-02T21:58:23] haku: making me hungry my boy
[2024-12-02T21:58:49] haku: im only allowed a cup of rice a day with my budget
[2024-12-02T21:59:24] haku: hollidays coming my son thinks hes getting a ps5 hehe
[2024-12-02T21:59:38] haku: ill give him my old gamecube
[2024-12-02T21:59:44] Yamal: I now eat legume stews during the week, a hot dish guaranteed
[2024-12-02T21:59:54] Yamal: Easy
[2024-12-02T22:00:03] Yamal: 4-5 days lunch time ..
[2024-12-02T22:00:13] Yamal: Style my father XD
[2024-12-02T22:00:59] Yamal: <photos/photo_19857@02-12-2024_22-00-59.jpg>
[2024-12-02T22:00:59] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-02T22:01:30] haku: healthy boy
[2024-12-02T22:03:16] Yamal: chickpeas with cod one of his recipes
[2024-12-02T22:03:28] Yamal: Lazy to cook every day
[2024-12-02T22:04:01] Yamal: Just miss my family,, my three girls
[2024-12-02T22:05:21] haku: family -don torreto
[2024-12-02T22:05:28] haku: hes right
[2024-12-02T22:08:05] Yamal: The last time I was separated from them for a long time, the girls grow up quickly, on January 1st my little girl turns 2, we must also look for a boy xD, whenever the omega queen wants, because you already know What are women like for that?
[2024-12-02T22:09:00] Yamal: My big one on July 6
[2024-12-02T22:09:32] haku: i get seperated from my boy sometimes but thats when i do stuff. i do not weld or solder infront of him incase of explosion lol
[2024-12-02T22:09:55] Yamal: my two princesses of persia
[2024-12-02T22:10:39] haku: but when im with my kid we do alot of stuff together. work on bikes. ride them and stuff. sometimes play minecraft
[2024-12-02T22:10:53] Yamal: That’s good
[2024-12-02T22:11:03] haku: i teach him anti woke things to counter school
[2024-12-02T22:11:04] Yamal: They grow fast and this is cool
[2024-12-02T22:11:31] Yamal: Also have mini bike vesc hehe
[2024-12-02T22:11:54] haku: he is the fastest kid in the park
[2024-12-02T22:12:03] Yamal: Sure
[2024-12-02T22:12:10] haku: he needs full face helmet if i want to make ot faster
[2024-12-02T22:13:05] haku: hes a bit autistic he ran over a pole once
[2024-12-02T22:14:02] haku: he was diagnosed with it thats why hes so smart. hes top 1% in math in the whole US. in his age group
[2024-12-02T22:14:20] Yamal: There is no need to worry about that, in the end they end up living a normal life.
[2024-12-02T22:14:51] haku: oh yea. im not worried. its a gift actually when it comes to other things
[2024-12-02T22:15:41] haku: his physical reaction time is off a bit. but i practice mits with him sometimes
[2024-12-02T22:17:45] Yamal: He is lucky and privileged to use VESC at such a young age, he is an era ahead of the rest
[2024-12-02T22:18:21] haku: thats my vesc not his. he will get a mini ubox
[2024-12-02T22:19:41] Yamal: I mean the controller is left? come now!! you're already starting to make me angry
[2024-12-02T22:20:52] Yamal: The mini bike has to be a gift, because when I find out that you take away the ubox to put a mini lite or flisky on it, I'll take a flight
[2024-12-02T22:20:54] haku: the regular 6fet is overkill for his setup. that might be better for my future mini bmx
[2024-12-02T22:21:46] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-12-02T22:21:48] haku: anyways all his future rides will be vesced because i trust it
[2024-12-02T22:22:16] haku: and batteries made by me
[2024-12-02T22:22:16] Yamal: Buy trampa for the minibike
[2024-12-02T22:22:20] Yamal: Only one …
[2024-12-02T22:22:35] Yamal: B where are you
[2024-12-02T22:22:46] haku: i would just to support bv. but he understands my situation

[2024-12-03T18:39:19] Yamal: But c350 say 200A battery 400phase also
[2024-12-03T18:39:46] Yamal: what is the difference

[2024-12-03T20:56:48] Pandalgns: I know 19s max
[2024-12-03T20:57:01] haku: gotcha
[2024-12-03T20:57:19] Pandalgns: From ur laotie??
[2024-12-03T20:57:22] haku: yea
[2024-12-03T20:57:37] Pandalgns: 20s and kboom my friend 😂😂
[2024-12-03T20:57:44] Yamal: I need to cook,,, lazy
[2024-12-03T20:58:06] haku: someone needs a cheap 20s esc. im thinking of giving this to him
[2024-12-03T20:59:11] Pandalgns: Cheap 20s... damao... similar to j&p but is 72v controller
[2024-12-03T20:59:12] haku: this one is powerful though. squarewave just on and off no inbetween
[2024-12-03T20:59:22] Pandalgns: J&p 60v stock
[2024-12-03T21:00:00] haku: this is the controller that almost killed me.

[2024-12-04T01:22:56] haku: dc motor nvm
[2024-12-04T02:13:58] JPPL: Cheap
[2024-12-04T02:15:41] haku: not for me 😭
[2024-12-04T06:48:36] Yamal: Nice frame
[2024-12-04T06:58:17] haku: dc motor kills the deal. idk why these mini kids pitbikes still come with dc motors
[2024-12-04T06:59:27] haku: ill just buy a cheap one from marketplace witg a decent frame and a cheap brushless motor like a big flipsky
[2024-12-04T07:10:51] Yamal: @Foujiwara Hello, good morning, have you tried spintend 85/250, with 250A battery for a long time,? It is curious that it comes from the factory by default with so many A batteries :)
[2024-12-04T07:39:43] Face de Pin Sucé: No just changed shunts
[2024-12-04T07:39:53] Face de Pin Sucé: No, too far x)

[2024-12-04T13:26:28] Pandalgns: @punedir i have a question for u, 84100 and 84200 u know how much battery amps can handle?
[2024-12-04T13:32:54] Max Rainlogix: Buy only spintend 85150 or 85250
[2024-12-04T13:32:58] Max Rainlogix: Ubox
[2024-12-04T13:33:10] Max Rainlogix: Not flipsky or some other things
[2024-12-04T13:37:03] Pandalgns: The question is not what to buy, friend.
[2024-12-04T13:37:26] Max Rainlogix: I understand
[2024-12-04T13:38:01] Max Rainlogix: 100s is about 60 honest battery amps 200s about 150a
[2024-12-04T13:39:14] Pandalgns: That's what I wanted to hear hahaha thanks friend
[2024-12-04T13:39:42] puneDir: 84100 probably 80 84200 i dont know
[2024-12-04T13:39:54] Max Rainlogix: If you wanna set more amps, fets not gonna be alright
[2024-12-04T13:40:09] Max Rainlogix: Risky
[2024-12-04T13:40:49] Pandalgns: Thx pune i love u 💕
[2024-12-04T13:40:56] Pandalgns: 😁
[2024-12-04T14:22:17] Yamal: Why not spintend ..?
[2024-12-04T14:24:49] Pandalgns: At the moment the result that the 84,100 likes gave me and apart from that the spinted ones are a little more expensive... economic issues bro, a 7 year old girl eats a lot 🤣🤣
[2024-12-04T14:56:16] Rose: Hey there km, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-12-04T15:11:46] Rose: Hey there km, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-04T15:14:22] km: Hey guys
[2024-12-04T15:14:27] km: has anyone here done a high kw rwd build. I want to know if it's worth it
[2024-12-04T15:14:56] JPPL: Good tiger
[2024-12-04T15:26:46] GABE: Everyone has done it.
[2024-12-04T15:27:07] GABE: Sure 3K or more for a genuine one.
[2024-12-04T15:27:25] GABE: High kw or ultra high power?
[2024-12-04T15:28:26] Jan: Yes, high kW, low KV, not worth it
[2024-12-04T15:29:11] Jan: 12kW single motor, topspeed like 62kmh without fw, really dangerous to drive
[2024-12-04T15:29:47] Jan: <photos/photo_19876@04-12-2024_15-29-47.jpg>
[2024-12-04T15:30:09] Patrick: With sharkset yes
[2024-12-04T15:30:25] Patrick: When did you have woobles 50km/h?
[2024-12-04T15:31:08] Jan: Apart from that, if you full throttle from start it always lifts until you nearly flip the scooter, no matter how hard you hug the handlebar
[2024-12-04T15:31:31] Patrick: Power wheelie💪
[2024-12-04T15:32:52] km: Will it be possible to achieve 100km/h+ . I want to upgrade KuKirin G4 to 72V system with lunnyo but only rear motor
[2024-12-04T15:33:32] Patrick: You could but hard
[2024-12-04T15:34:02] Jan: Omg
[2024-12-04T15:34:33] Jan: Yes it works with 22x3 65H but that crap frame will be your death
[2024-12-04T15:34:41] km: 😂
[2024-12-04T15:34:42] Patrick: 20s 100km/h on singlemotor is hard in my opinion cause if you want a decent motor for Single its 16x4-17x4 but with these you would need fwk wich sucks and a lot of it
[2024-12-04T15:34:50] Patrick: 22x3 sucks too single
[2024-12-04T15:35:05] Jan: It works ok, Daniel did 110kmh single motor
[2024-12-04T15:35:26] Patrick: Maybe star/delta 16x4 or 17x4 but the relay size for this Power xD
[2024-12-04T15:35:45] Patrick: Never posted a log only 1 log with 70km/h max and 10V v drop
[2024-12-04T15:35:48] Jan: The question is more why single motor, when its a budget issue, dont even try it that why, rather 2x vsett10+ hubs
[2024-12-04T15:35:59] Jan: Ok
[2024-12-04T15:36:12] Patrick: Also hes light
[2024-12-04T15:36:29] Jan: Topspeed is not influenced by weight
[2024-12-04T15:36:31] Patrick: 22x3 with like 80kg+😭
[2024-12-04T15:36:32] Jan: Only accel
[2024-12-04T15:36:49] Patrick: Yea but
[2024-12-04T15:36:54] Patrick: .
[2024-12-04T15:37:14] Jan: I wouldnt do single anyway for performance
[2024-12-04T15:37:20] Patrick: I wouldnt want a Single motor scooter only for topspeed
[2024-12-04T15:37:44] Jan: @kmmostwanted why single motor?
[2024-12-04T15:37:49] Patrick: Thats why i will do star/delta 16x4 cause i want to drive topspeed sometimes but most of the time i still want the good efficiency
[2024-12-04T15:38:34] Patrick: Single is nightmare for this
[2024-12-04T15:38:41] Patrick: On 72V
[2024-12-04T15:38:50] Jan: How switch?
[2024-12-04T15:39:08] Patrick: Manuel😅 0 space for these big relays
[2024-12-04T15:39:24] km: I am converting g4 to dual with stock motors rn. So rwd high kw came to my mind for next project
[2024-12-04T15:39:24] Jan: You could do transistor switches
[2024-12-04T15:39:39] km: Also g4 front fork needs to be cut to fit a motor
[2024-12-04T15:40:07] Patrick: How? Ben thought about using fets but didnt find a solution
[2024-12-04T15:40:10] Jan: G30 frame probably better platform
[2024-12-04T15:40:25] Patrick: Fets would be perfect though could mount them below the battery
[2024-12-04T15:41:01] Lieven L.: https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg1.etsystatic.com%2F000%2F0%2F5801345%2Fil_570xN.275860075.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=c1e5389cf3c5819242812fd03349b327595f19e886c7052c42efef7dbc2506ea&ipo=images
[2024-12-04T15:41:01] km: Do you all use lunnyo motors guys?
[2024-12-04T15:41:27] Lieven L.: a couple of these will do 😂
[2024-12-04T15:41:33] Patrick: Yes like this but with busbars
[2024-12-04T15:41:51] Jan: Yes for now but i will not buy again, switching to my own if i have to
[2024-12-04T15:41:59] Jan: Yes this
[2024-12-04T15:42:34] Patrick: Please Design it i dont understand kicad
[2024-12-04T15:44:22] Patrick: Yea
[2024-12-04T15:44:47] Patrick: You could connect it too a vesc like this anyways later
[2024-12-04T15:46:05] Patrick: Sensorless but you would need to cut Power while switching the vesc can find the position later right?
[2024-12-04T15:47:05] Patrick: Could you save multiple motor Parameters and switch them over lisp?
[2024-12-04T15:47:10] Jan: Or auto switch by back emf voltage?
[2024-12-04T15:47:38] Patrick: Without making the vesc cry for RAM or CPU or whatever it takes
[2024-12-04T15:48:13] Patrick: Even after you cut Power while switching?
[2024-12-04T15:49:00] Patrick: Or i mean while switching you could use the halls until the vesc has the position in sensorless
[2024-12-04T15:49:22] Patrick: And if it doesnt get the position the motor just Cuts power
[2024-12-04T15:49:25] Jan: If i understand it correctly thats the reason why we do the delta star in the first place
[2024-12-04T15:50:14] Patrick: I mean 16x4 and 17x4 has halls anyways
[2024-12-04T15:51:36] Jan: Custom motor could have the switch board in the hub itself
[2024-12-04T15:52:56] Patrick: Could you use something Else then lisp on the Vesc?
[2024-12-04T15:53:04] Jan: At this point could be a community project to develop a motor together lol
[2024-12-04T15:53:12] Jan: 10inch and 11 inch
[2024-12-04T15:53:19] Patrick: Like just using a esp and connecting it over can or something and let everything run on it there
[2024-12-04T15:54:03] Jan: - Tubeless splitrim - Star/Delta switchboard in hub - Hall/Temp - Proper materials - CNC
[2024-12-04T15:54:08] Patrick: 100% thought about this too with fets a while you would just need to have good cooling
[2024-12-04T15:54:26] Patrick: Alu pcb then?
[2024-12-04T15:55:27] Jan: Hub motors cant be efficiently cooled and be waterproof
[2024-12-04T15:55:37] Patrick: Maybe cooling fins inside the stator? Wouldnt be a solution for longer runs but could help a little if the stator isnt able to get rid of the heat fast enough
[2024-12-04T15:55:53] Jan: Easiest is just to have watercool connectors
[2024-12-04T15:56:27] Jan: Either its top of the line motor or not worth to do
[2024-12-04T15:56:34] Patrick: Radiator on the steering pole
[2024-12-04T15:56:37] Jan: Shitty motors can be bought everywhere
[2024-12-04T15:56:50] Jan: Yeah or bottom plate radiator
[2024-12-04T15:56:56] GABE: People I talk to didnt even know their front wheel is a motor
[2024-12-04T15:57:04] GABE: can you not like imagine looking down while driving
[2024-12-04T15:57:28] Patrick: Yea would work on scooter like namis with enough ground clearance
[2024-12-04T15:57:28] GABE: I imagine these are the people who crash
[2024-12-04T15:58:24] Patrick: Or if you make it cnc anyways you could just make a propper heatsink on the motor
[2024-12-04T15:58:48] Patrick: Solidworks would help a lot too make a efficient one
[2024-12-04T15:58:49] Jan: You cant get the heat away from the motor, i dont see it where
[2024-12-04T15:59:01] Jan: Cover heatsink is not worth as its airgapped to the stator
[2024-12-04T15:59:08] Patrick: Ferrofluid
[2024-12-04T15:59:22] Jan: Yeah ~ but egh no
[2024-12-04T15:59:47] Jan: You bridge the gap for some time and then its dry and does nothing
[2024-12-04T15:59:58] Patrick: Yes
[2024-12-04T16:00:28] Jan: The dissipated heat per volume is too high not to have it watercooled
[2024-12-04T16:00:36] Patrick: I dont know but maybe you could Design the case so there is a very small air gap to the stator so the case can take the heat good
[2024-12-04T16:01:05] GABE: I imagine it just transfers heat to magnet's and they get violated instead
[2024-12-04T16:01:13] Jan: Still 0.1mm would be too much
[2024-12-04T16:01:19] Jan: Air is a hell of an insulator
[2024-12-04T16:01:29] GABE: fr
[2024-12-04T16:01:30] Patrick: Vacum in the motor😂
[2024-12-04T16:01:36] Jan: 😅
[2024-12-04T16:01:37] 'lekrsu': So 12kW on 16x4 flips you over. What's a reasonable power level to use?
[2024-12-04T16:01:45] Jan: 8kW
[2024-12-04T16:02:08] 'lekrsu': And what's the kV on this again?
[2024-12-04T16:02:36] 'lekrsu': Or just a speed @ V w/o load, I'll approximate
[2024-12-04T16:04:11] Jan: Dont know, low
[2024-12-04T16:05:09] Patrick: Or wait couldnt you use a Fluid for this?
[2024-12-04T16:05:40] 'lekrsu': Asked Lonnyo what a 17x4 would cost to ship to Sweden incl all, haven't gotten a response yet
[2024-12-04T16:05:43] Patrick: You could still make the case compatible with water cooling and still use some cooling Fluid to get rid of the gap if youre not running watercooling
[2024-12-04T16:05:58] Patrick: And then efficient heatsink on the case
[2024-12-04T16:06:21] Patrick: Around 330€ for 1 and for 3 around 290€ per motor with shipping
[2024-12-04T16:07:55] GABE: Bruh that would advance shit so much
[2024-12-04T16:08:04] GABE: No third system
[2024-12-04T16:08:09] GABE: switchable cells between bodies But would have to be a split stator motor
[2024-12-04T16:08:39] GABE: Just an engine and power source like cars have
[2024-12-04T16:09:33] Patrick: Not full esc🤣 just star/delta switching
[2024-12-04T16:09:42] GABE: I'm too high
[2024-12-04T16:09:48] Patrick: 85240 in 65H would be crazy
[2024-12-04T16:13:33] Patrick: What scooter?
[2024-12-04T16:14:50] Patrick: And what battery? 20s5p 40PL & 85240 fully internal?😂
[2024-12-04T16:15:30] Patrick: You planning on switching Phase wires maybe?
[2024-12-04T16:15:51] Patrick: Whatttt
[2024-12-04T16:15:53] Patrick: 11inch?
[2024-12-04T16:16:03] Patrick: Ah just thought 10 inch xD
[2024-12-04T16:16:15] Patrick: 10inch would fit the 6mm² glassfiber cables
[2024-12-04T16:16:23] Patrick: Shit is so expensive 30€ for 5m
[2024-12-04T16:25:16] Lieven L.: Hub motors in general aren't the best solution. Thats why we don't really have them in cars or bikes. Lots of disadvantages, like unsprung mass and outrunners are harder to cool. It's just to bad that scooters are so limited in space.
[2024-12-04T16:27:17] Lieven L.: Otherwise I would just go middrive
[2024-12-04T16:32:03] Jan: Transfer the middrive power to thr wheel is also a challenge
[2024-12-04T16:34:26] Lieven L.: yeah but a chain or belt works for motor cycles so it should be possible for scooters. But will take up space and is far from quite too.
[2024-12-04T16:37:23] haku: dam. one for every day of the week
[2024-12-04T18:23:21] haku: what about 33x2?
[2024-12-04T18:25:42] Lieven L.: should be even worse
[2024-12-04T18:27:45] haku: i will help. im good a drawings
[2024-12-04T18:29:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: trying some changes
[2024-12-04T18:31:15] haku: yes. unsprung weight. i keep hearing that. i looked it up its facts
[2024-12-04T18:32:17] haku: we just need a midrive with gears to compete with gas
[2024-12-04T18:36:10] Rose: Hey there Willie Schneider, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-04T19:12:26] haku: oh lawd the guy i sold the vsett got a flat and wants me to fix it. he will pay ofcourse. but ill tell him to just buy solids

[2024-12-04T19:12:53] haku: night riders
[2024-12-04T19:23:42] Lieven L.: Makes me wanna buy a surron 😅
[2024-12-04T19:23:55] haku: lol. this guy loweballed me and short $3. he also wanted to pay me in weed 😭
[2024-12-04T19:24:17] haku: not the kind of customers i wanted
[2024-12-04T19:25:42] Lieven L.: I'm somewhat used to it now. Scooter cliental is just different than Porsche cliental
[2024-12-04T19:26:04] haku: surron kids are where the money is
[2024-12-04T19:26:35] haku: those chi/powerful lithium batteries they buy are expensive af
[2024-12-04T19:28:23] Lieven L.: i almost bought one 😅
[2024-12-04T19:31:47] haku: i want somethimg similar bit prolly not surron brand
[2024-12-04T19:34:19] Yamal: <photos/photo_19879@04-12-2024_19-34-19.jpg>
[2024-12-04T19:42:09] GABE: Motor heat still the issue
[2024-12-04T19:42:17] GABE: 2 issues
[2024-12-04T19:42:53] GABE: Mid drive motors are easier to cool imo
[2024-12-04T19:43:41] haku: sketchy ride but theres a seat. i approve
[2024-12-04T19:51:48] Lieven L.: I don't care about the brand. i just want something mid size and surron seems to be the only brand which has decent market share to stay for a while. I don't want to end up with an "Alta Red Shift equivalent"
[2024-12-04T19:55:04] haku: seems like talaria and surron are the main brands here. but other brands similar to surron look are coming out with more power and cheaper.
[2024-12-04T19:55:19] haku: bigger battery conpartments
[2024-12-04T19:59:03] Lieven L.: Yeah but if there's no market share you won't find parts or help online
[2024-12-04T19:59:39] GABE: Stoned at the pub
[2024-12-04T19:59:52] haku: agreed surron brand has so many aftermarket parts
[2024-12-04T19:59:59] Lieven L.: Therefore i won't go with any tiny startup brand
[2024-12-04T20:00:41] haku: but if your going to spend all that money upgrading a surron just get a varg
[2024-12-04T20:01:15] Lieven L.: I'd like to but it's not street legal
[2024-12-04T20:02:00] haku: dam. ive only seen 1 varg here where im from. its so rare
[2024-12-04T20:07:43] Lieven L.: Yeah i mean its a big expensive bike. Not many people spend so much money on a toy.
[2024-12-04T20:12:19] Lieven L.: Especially in runners
[2024-12-04T20:17:19] haku: let me guess. no girls in sight
[2024-12-04T20:17:35] GABE: Only alcoholic old men smoking
[2024-12-04T20:18:02] haku: irish pubs are awsome dude. here atleast
[2024-12-04T20:18:30] haku: i always order the corned beef and cabbage
[2024-12-04T20:19:50] haku: oh shit i just looked it up. its an american irish made dish. they dont have it in ireland
[2024-12-04T21:28:13] GABE: yall think 1/4 of 0.1mm of copper can be welded with a switchboard?
[2024-12-04T22:07:21] 'lekrsu': Switchboard?
[2024-12-04T22:53:13] luffydnoob: Guys which vesc controllers fit inside dualtron victor with everything stock that can convert to 72v and make it reach topspeed of 100km/h per hour
[2024-12-04T22:53:52] luffydnoob: Has anybody has done this here before
[2024-12-04T22:59:53] 'lekrsu': The vesc's are likely smaller than your existing controllers.
[2024-12-04T23:15:38] luffydnoob: The stock controller is small too, it comes with two in one controller
[2024-12-04T23:15:57] 'lekrsu': That's two controllers in one
[2024-12-04T23:16:12] luffydnoob: <photos/photo_19880@04-12-2024_23-16-12.jpg>
[2024-12-04T23:17:51] 'lekrsu': You'll need to make another battery to run 72V if you haven't already.
[2024-12-04T23:18:39] luffydnoob: With stock controller I could achieve speed of 80km/h once but I'm getting lower top speeds I think because of battery degradation or smaller tyres that I have 10x2.50 before that I had 10x3 tyres
[2024-12-04T23:19:10] luffydnoob: Battery is not an issue for me I could make a new one
[2024-12-04T23:19:32] luffydnoob: Do bigger tyres affect top speeds??
[2024-12-04T23:38:32] 'lekrsu': Of course.

[2024-12-05T11:53:25] Yamal: But pretty solid and nice
[2024-12-05T12:06:41] Face de Pin Sucé: I think it is dead weight
[2024-12-05T12:06:53] Face de Pin Sucé: We put titanium pole, which are a lot less weight
[2024-12-05T12:09:23] Yamal: I know
[2024-12-05T12:10:49] Yamal: I can’t pay 300€ for stem my profesional friend :)
[2024-12-05T12:48:27] luffydnoob: So that means I can adapt eye 3 with vesc controllers??

[2024-12-05T13:11:23] Yamal: Titanium 🤩
[2024-12-05T13:11:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Including adaptors of course
[2024-12-05T13:11:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Pole itself is 600gr if I remember well
[2024-12-05T13:14:02] Yamal: This puts the power to the direct handlebar, no adapter needed.

[2024-12-05T13:43:49] Yamal: the reason why I changed the stem

[2024-12-05T13:50:03] Z: Wait @PaoloWu you are here too?
[2024-12-05T13:50:49] Yamal: The nami stem goes from less thickness to more thickness, the power was already very forced and in general my last cut was not clean xD
[2024-12-05T13:51:18] Paolo ⁭: I think I invited you here haha

[2024-12-05T14:21:11] Paolo ⁭: Does it fit decent 28s ?
[2024-12-05T14:22:46] Z: 14s 10p 21700 fits. Will stack another on top 14s10p on top and series connect
[2024-12-05T14:26:30] Z: Will use this metal and fit it perfectly in this battery bay part. Held by long screws from the bay lid

[2024-12-05T14:46:28] Paolo ⁭: Do instead 2 28s5p
[2024-12-05T14:47:01] Paolo ⁭: This reduce significantly BMS accident which could kill vesc
[2024-12-05T14:47:55] Z: And parallel?

[2024-12-05T14:48:55] 'lekrsu': Surely one 28S is smaller than two high current 14S
[2024-12-05T14:53:45] Z: That is so very true
[2024-12-05T15:05:52] GABE: Or just do 20s cos it's phase anyways

[2024-12-06T13:52:37] Pandalgns: Asturias, natural paradise😍
[2024-12-06T14:12:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When we stop the engines, it asks us before stopping if we want to reset the settings. What settings are you referring to? I always say NO.
[2024-12-06T14:13:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When I detect I mean
[2024-12-06T14:35:26] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I WAS BORN IN AVILÉS, Spain is a beautiful country
[2024-12-06T14:45:02] Patrick: This max speed?
[2024-12-06T14:50:47] 'lekrsu': It'd reset everything as if it was new.
[2024-12-06T14:59:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: So it wouldn't be enough to just do the detection and leave the values ​​that it gives us in FOC, I would have to change other things, right?
[2024-12-06T14:59:58] Pandalgns: U are asturiano for life 💪😁 where do u live now?
[2024-12-06T15:38:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: My question is why when I put the motors they never vibrated, they made a configuration since then the motors vibrate I thought about doing a reset to solve it because the person who made the configuration does not know why the motors vibrate
[2024-12-06T15:39:58] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2024-12-06T15:40:57] haku: 80mph its is for me
[2024-12-06T15:43:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I raise the frequency to 30 the motors vibrate more, if I lower it to more than 20 the motor does not work well.
[2024-12-06T15:44:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2024-12-06T15:45:24] JPPL: Full settings reset maybe solve
[2024-12-06T15:46:03] JPPL: Also check ADC input settings, maybe ground cable can be loose on break or acelerator
[2024-12-06T15:48:30] JPPL: 13" tyres will not be easy
[2024-12-06T15:49:24] JPPL: I never did it on 13", only on 12" zero 11x with g300
[2024-12-06T15:53:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes I want to do it to see if I can fix it but I don't know what values ​​apart from current voltage additional information foc advance would reset that's why I never did it I only updated several times but never hit reset
[2024-12-06T15:53:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The accelerator works well, I always do the accelerator detection, I do it correctly, it calibrates and detects
[2024-12-06T15:55:56] Paolo ⁭: Try to lower motor inductance by 30%
[2024-12-06T15:56:09] Paolo ⁭: I don't know if you already did
[2024-12-06T16:00:13] 'lekrsu': Press the backup button and play around afterwards.
[2024-12-06T16:00:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I didn't do it, I have it like this
[2024-12-06T16:02:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I don't have a PC, I only use an iPhone, I never knew where I kept the backup
[2024-12-06T16:02:22] 'lekrsu': In the app.
[2024-12-06T16:02:45] 'lekrsu': You press "restore from backup" or something in that manner.
[2024-12-06T16:03:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: in the app tab? in Vesc
[2024-12-06T16:03:40] JPPL: Try double it then
[2024-12-06T16:04:26] JPPL: It's low maybe, normally I don't touch this, never felt much diference, I leave as detection goes. But seems low anyway
[2024-12-06T16:05:42] JPPL: Normally after full reset some parameters should be tuned in some menus, I can name more or less all of them if you need some guidance
[2024-12-06T16:06:03] JPPL: Sensor mode vss
[2024-12-06T16:06:05] JPPL: No
[2024-12-06T16:06:05] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-06T16:06:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I don't touch the foc parameters either, but after a configuration we shouldn't have done that it always vibrates. I can do the detection again but it vibrates again.
[2024-12-06T16:07:17] Paolo ⁭: Put 17 instead 22.5
[2024-12-06T16:07:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I don't have hall
[2024-12-06T16:09:19] JPPL: So vss config must be wrong
[2024-12-06T16:09:35] JPPL: Never use it
[2024-12-06T16:14:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: wooooo much better I put both engines at 17 which would be the minimum I could put
[2024-12-06T16:15:18] Paolo ⁭: 15.8 minimum
[2024-12-06T16:15:26] Paolo ⁭: I don't recommend less
[2024-12-06T16:25:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I will keep it between 16,17

[2024-12-06T19:20:28] 'lekrsu': That means nothing sorry
[2024-12-06T19:30:21] haku: this is why you need no suspension when cornering. peak g30 cornering is of the chainz. https://youtube.com/shorts/EKXmzahSYSI?si=BfuKuSDBHGtSTJMa

[2024-12-06T19:45:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Now my motors run much smoother, I don't know if it's because of activating the VSS or lowering the inductance.
[2024-12-06T19:57:07] Paolo ⁭: Set inductance like before then you will know
[2024-12-06T19:58:40] Paolo ⁭: Not easy to explain

[2024-12-06T21:13:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: In electromagnetism and electronics, inductance is the measure of opposition to a current change of an inductor or coil that stores energy in the presence of a magnetic field, and is defined ... Wikipedia
[2024-12-06T21:14:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Inductance is the property of a device that tells us how effectively it induces an electromotive force in another device. In other words, it is a physical quantity that expresses the effectiveness of a given device.

[2024-12-07T21:03:33] haku: is it possible to do this on a scooter motor? mount brembo calipers.
[2024-12-07T21:40:58] Apo: arent they just way too big?

[2024-12-07T21:41:24] haku: be cool to see though
[2024-12-07T21:41:29] Apo: usually motorbike brakes are way too big
[2024-12-07T21:41:35] Apo: and want a very very thicc rotor
[2024-12-07T21:42:06] haku: well scooters and bikes go motorcycle speeds now. it should have big brakes not bike brakes imo
[2024-12-07T21:42:25] Apo: well, then you would need a scooter that is made for such brakes
[2024-12-07T21:42:47] Apo: most scooters simply dont have the room for this cuz they arent being made with the thought of braking safety
[2024-12-07T21:43:32] haku: scooter ebike hub manufacturers should make the rotor mounting holes like motos. and caliper mounting like motoes
[2024-12-07T21:43:37] Apo: i personally also value my safety so i buy brakes that i know work well, such as Magura etc. and i do NOT trust shitty ass Nutt, Zoom etc. brakes
[2024-12-07T21:44:24] Apo: they might have a good bite, but the moment u repeat hard braking they will fade very very early and u will lose ur brake and then just go into whats in front

[2024-12-08T05:50:11] Yamal: Nice tyre

[2024-12-08T06:01:37] Noname: Think if you wrap a ratchet strap around circumference a few times it'll keep it from growing and push outwards
[2024-12-08T06:01:58] haku: is this pretty good?
[2024-12-08T06:02:23] Noname: I'd try windex or something first
[2024-12-08T06:02:49] haku: that rainbow lube i need to buy.

[2024-12-08T06:09:06] Noname: It's close enough to slip a piece of paper in.
[2024-12-08T06:10:13] Noname: Wrap a strap around when flattened. Than air up.
[2024-12-08T06:11:03] haku: yea used ratchet strap to inflate it. ill try again but with dish soap or something
[2024-12-08T06:11:29] Noname: Yeah china tires 🙄

[2024-12-08T06:12:44] Noname: Mabey it's the china rim idk Italian tires don't fit either lol

[2024-12-08T19:53:30] Yamal: wood stove, very typical of northern Spain in the past, many people still use them, but I only use the oven and to heat the house, I also have a normal gas stove like normal people xD, but it is very cool and it is super efficient
[2024-12-08T19:54:08] haku: yea i would rather use that. house prolly smells good too
[2024-12-08T19:55:43] haku: you can prolly turn that into a slow cooker grill too
[2024-12-08T19:57:20] Yamal: and cook directly on the grill, cleaning with vinegar beforehand.
[2024-12-08T19:57:24] Yamal: Look
[2024-12-08T19:57:44] haku: do they commonly sell that in spain?

[2024-12-08T19:59:12] Pandalgns: Where I live, northern Spain, Asturias, in the towns they are practically in every house
[2024-12-08T19:59:29] haku: when the end of days come and the woke rebelion happens i need this
[2024-12-08T19:59:33] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-12-08T19:59:55] Pandalgns: It is the typical village kitchen that was used in the past both for cooking and heating the house.
[2024-12-08T20:00:21] haku: thats amazing. need one asap
[2024-12-08T20:00:43] Pandalgns: I can assure you that the food cooked there tastes much better.
[2024-12-08T20:01:15] haku: im sure of it too. anythimg cooked with wood or real coal tastes better
[2024-12-08T20:02:46] haku: im also a fan of cooking in cast iron pans
[2024-12-08T20:03:22] Pandalgns: Here in Asturias, the most typical dish of our gastronomy is "fabada", it is a dish that is made with white beans grown in our fields, cooking them over very low heat along with chorizo, blood sausage and bacon, nothing more, you can cook it in any type. kitchen but if you make it on a charcoal stove it is a dish from gods
[2024-12-08T20:04:03] haku: thats living life my dude.
[2024-12-08T20:04:13] haku: the good life

[2024-12-08T20:07:02] Pandalgns: One of the things that I am most passionate about about American food is the tradition that you have in different regions with barbecues.
[2024-12-08T20:07:31] haku: oh yea. texan is my favorite style.
[2024-12-08T20:08:10] haku: dry rub ribs.
[2024-12-08T20:08:51] haku: even that stuff is so expensive now. its like 50-100 per plate. used to cost less
[2024-12-08T20:10:15] Pandalgns: beef ribs barbecued at low temperature, the smokers, the different types of barbecues that you have there is impressive, I dream one day of being able to live in a house instead of an apartment and have my different types of barbecues
[2024-12-08T20:11:00] haku: dam you making me hungry lol
[2024-12-08T20:11:07] Pandalgns: Jajajajaja

[2024-12-08T20:15:23] Yamal: Best of all, the potatoes are grown by my father in the north, he brought them to me the last time he came to the south and I still have them, but few, and he returns next Tuesday with more shipment, he says he brings two chops, one for each a large dining room table
[2024-12-08T20:16:19] haku: ill move to spain if the woke rebels and we lose. but i doubt we will loose because we have more guns
[2024-12-08T20:16:59] haku: spain seems like a chill place.
[2024-12-08T20:17:41] Pandalgns: Where does your father live?
[2024-12-08T20:17:53] Yamal: Castilla y león
[2024-12-08T20:18:02] Yamal: Move for work
[2024-12-08T20:18:15] haku: yes. i will be a farmer.
[2024-12-08T20:18:16] Yamal: Now like 9 years I Think..
[2024-12-08T20:18:45] haku: i will have experience after being a lead farmer after the rebelion
[2024-12-08T20:19:03] Pandalgns: about 3 hours from where I live
[2024-12-08T20:19:33] Yamal: Also nice road
[2024-12-08T20:19:36] Yamal: 🤯
[2024-12-08T20:21:59] Pandalgns: In Spain there are many livestock farms, many plantations of different types of vegetables, we are a country of farmers and now there is a lot of battle with the national product, prices, "organic farming" laws and a thousand other shits that are killing livestock and agriculture in Spain and most large stores import from other countries without any type of regulation in cultivation methods and at impossible prices.
[2024-12-08T20:23:26] Yamal: 💃
[2024-12-08T20:23:49] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-12-08T20:23:49] Pandalgns: but we have a great product and it is especially seen in the livestock and farming towns. If I can, on the next market day in my town I will send you photos of the tomatoes, peppers, and all kinds of vegetables that are grown here, a delight
[2024-12-08T20:24:39] Pandalgns: 🤤🤤 patatas asadas!!
[2024-12-08T20:24:42] haku: i want a plantation too. thats been a dream of mine
[2024-12-08T20:26:45] haku: the dream is to just sit in my porch and look over my plantation
[2024-12-08T20:27:04] haku: smoking cigars. maybe vaping im not sure yet
[2024-12-08T20:27:48] Pandalgns: with a branch of wheat in your mouth 😂😂
[2024-12-08T20:28:12] haku: dog and shotgun by my side
[2024-12-08T20:31:28] Pandalgns: do you like hunting?
[2024-12-08T20:31:48] haku: no never did try it. nothing to hunt here
[2024-12-08T20:32:06] Noname: Prarie dogs?
[2024-12-08T20:32:31] haku: not even that we have.
[2024-12-08T20:32:52] haku: rattlesnakes wild horses and mules we have
[2024-12-08T20:33:22] haku: pigeons too. but they are city dirty pigeons
[2024-12-08T20:35:38] haku: i dont think we are allowed to shoot the wild horses here. im not sure.
[2024-12-08T20:36:59] Pandalgns: Today, distributing through the towns, I heard every so often the shots of the hunters in the mountains hunting wild boars.
[2024-12-08T20:37:44] haku: yea wild boars in some of the states here are bad. not in mine though but they are invasive animals
[2024-12-08T20:38:48] haku: they hunt em with automatic weapons in helicopters and atvs in texas. its really bad the boars and wild pigs there ive read
[2024-12-08T20:39:06] haku: they eat your crops
[2024-12-08T20:39:32] Pandalgns: Here they are also invasive, in the capital they are sometimes seen in the city, they come down from the mountains to look for garbage and walk around the city, but they are also a delicacy hahaha although there are many restrictions for hunters with the number of wild boars they are allowed to hunt per day
[2024-12-08T20:40:23] Noname: Just saw a vid of hunters getting swarmed by boars. They were unloading as they ran towards em. Scarry
[2024-12-08T20:40:54] haku: yea i would go to texas when end of days come. food available everywhere
[2024-12-08T20:42:48] Pandalgns: My ex father-in-law is a hunter and he sometimes told me his hunting stories, wild boars opening dogs in half with their fangs, hunters with their knees destroyed by wild boars being gored with their fangs, and very disturbing things.
[2024-12-08T20:43:02] haku: that or spain will be my choice when the woke rebellion happens and we lose but doubt it. i will be a happy farmer with my son and dog
[2024-12-08T20:45:18] Yamal: There is a type of wild boar hunting with hunting dogs and a knife
[2024-12-08T20:45:44] haku: dam thats cool. how about archery
[2024-12-08T20:46:10] Yamal: I search video
[2024-12-08T20:46:28] Pandalgns: that's crazy
[2024-12-08T20:46:30] haku: hand to hand combat with a boar is next level
[2024-12-08T20:46:37] Pandalgns: God mode
[2024-12-08T20:46:39] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-12-08T20:47:46] haku: if im being honest ive never used an axe.
[2024-12-08T20:48:00] Pandalgns: Keep in mind that wild boars, at least here in Asturias, sometimes can withstand even shotgun shots. When that happens, you have to shoot more, but some shots can withstand them and they stay alive since they have super thick skin.
[2024-12-08T20:48:04] haku: that be the best weapon i think. viking style
[2024-12-08T20:49:19] Pandalgns: What's more, look if the wild boars that my wife ran over a baby wild boar a few months ago are strong and resistant and nothing happened to the baby wild boar... our car was destroyed
[2024-12-08T20:49:47] haku: nice. those arw doggo argentino dog breeds i think
[2024-12-08T20:49:58] haku: the white ones.
[2024-12-08T20:50:25] Yamal: It is a type of hunting that is practiced here in the mountains of my city, the dogs hold them and the man finishes it off with a knife, personally I would not do it, neither because of the type of prey nor because of the type itself, in my opinion Personally, I like hunting with birds of prey, much more beautiful and spectacular.
[2024-12-08T20:50:42] Yamal: It’s strong video a little..
[2024-12-08T20:51:00] Pandalgns: I'm going to dinner guys, I love you guys ❤️
[2024-12-08T20:51:02] Yamal: Can search on YouTube
[2024-12-08T20:51:30] haku: i would hunt with a pack of dogs. not the current woke dog i have though but actual hunting dogs
[2024-12-08T20:51:56] Yamal: Enjoy your dinner👍⚡️
[2024-12-08T20:51:57] haku: my dog only kills birds but scared of bigger animals
[2024-12-08T20:53:27] haku: my dog the predator.
[2024-12-08T20:54:33] haku: not the woke sex kinda predator but an actual predatory insticts
[2024-12-08T21:01:09] haku: here he is chewing on his dildo again.
[2024-12-08T21:02:12] Yamal: Hehe nice dog
[2024-12-08T21:02:28] Yamal: Hair like Lion
[2024-12-08T21:03:42] haku: yes its snows inside the house because of him
[2024-12-08T21:05:03] Yamal: 🪩
[2024-12-08T21:06:43] haku: this is his favorite treat for some reason.
[2024-12-08T21:09:24] Noname: Time to swap bird shot for slugs 😆
[2024-12-08T21:11:33] haku: 9mm should be enough to put that thing down yea?
[2024-12-08T21:12:34] haku: or 45
[2024-12-08T21:14:21] Noname: Prob not. Animals don't go down easy
[2024-12-08T21:15:58] Noname: A 9mm poke hole vs a slug putting a hole the size of your fist is a different story.
[2024-12-08T21:16:48] haku: you cant eat the whole thing then.
[2024-12-08T21:17:01] haku: i mean a 9mm to the skull of the boar
[2024-12-08T21:17:25] haku: never hunted so i have no idea
[2024-12-08T21:23:04] haku: my nephew is a hunter. he likes to shoot those birds. qual or pigeons i think
[2024-12-08T21:27:33] Noname: Idk prob just knock em silly. Don't shoot armadillo though.

[2024-12-08T22:19:04] haku: agreed split rim is super convinient.
[2024-12-08T22:21:22] haku: oh no. tire too thin?

[2024-12-09T16:37:03] Yamal: Vesc scooter group, is the great scooter chat on telegram, real to death as Anuel AA says xD
[2024-12-09T16:37:39] Yamal: g30 chat is also very powerful
[2024-12-09T16:41:40] Yamal: I don't have many more telegrams 2 from Nami / 2 local ones and some from Dualtron that are dead today, well yes also another one from competition in Spain
[2024-12-09T16:42:54] Yamal: I know there are many interesting telegrams about movies/news, etc., I'm not interested in them, I don't watch TV, I only watch e-scooter videos.
[2024-12-09T16:43:29] haku: these are the 2 best chats imo. vesc and g30
[2024-12-09T16:43:38] haku: lots to learn about vesc

[2024-12-09T17:14:05] Yamal: Master Chef
[2024-12-09T17:14:52] Yamal: What a pity that it is now a little far from the 17/4 and 33/2 windings
[2024-12-09T17:15:52] haku: what you mean?
[2024-12-09T17:16:02] haku: no more 22x3?

[2024-12-09T17:18:20] Yamal: 11”?

[2024-12-09T17:18:40] Yamal: I mean motor 11”
[2024-12-09T17:18:50] haku: yea.
[2024-12-09T17:18:53] haku: 6.5
[2024-12-09T17:19:21] haku: i just need motors. already have rims
[2024-12-09T17:32:27] Yamal: I only have broken one from Nami
[2024-12-09T17:34:48] haku: fix it. whats wrong with it
[2024-12-09T17:35:06] haku: nami 16x4?
[2024-12-09T17:47:45] Yamal: 17/4
[2024-12-09T17:50:14] Yamal: <photos/photo_19972@09-12-2024_17-50-14.jpg>
[2024-12-09T17:51:01] Yamal: Your favourite haku, sweet thing
[2024-12-09T17:51:55] Pandalgns: Guys, how about these brake discs?
[2024-12-09T17:52:05] Pandalgns: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 36,19€ | Disco de freno BCA YOD4 6 orificios | 160 mm 180 mm / 1,95 mm Rotores de freno de bicicleta Frenos de disco MTB de carretera https://a.aliexpress.com/_EI2dAzm
[2024-12-09T17:52:33] 'lekrsu': What happened to it?
[2024-12-09T17:53:03] Yamal: No good
[2024-12-09T17:53:16] Pandalgns: Why??
[2024-12-09T17:53:37] Pandalgns: They look good
[2024-12-09T17:53:37] Yamal: I don't know about the rest of the people, but for me the floating discs on e-scooters are not good
[2024-12-09T17:54:05] Pandalgns: They are not completely floating from what I saw on several pages.
[2024-12-09T17:54:09] Yamal: If I had to buy an Aliespress disc today it would only be his 3mm wolf
[2024-12-09T17:55:49] Pandalgns: They put them as a two piece non-floating construction
[2024-12-09T17:55:56] Yamal: I have been buying cheap Aliespress discs for a while and I have tried several models, all worn down to the point of being like cigarette papers, well I have bought the cheapest Shimano discs and I still can't believe the robustness
[2024-12-09T17:56:44] Pandalgns: Let's see on Aliexpress they are worth 30 euros each disc but in stores they are around 80/100 euros each disc
[2024-12-09T17:57:18] Yamal: My new shimano disc 11€ ////22 Pair
[2024-12-09T18:04:53] Yamal: I don't know, the magnets get scratched, it's a long story, it hasn't been long since I gave away a Nami motor, I don't know if they will be using it, the ideal is to use it
[2024-12-09T18:05:58] Yamal: The problem “””is that the vast majority of you use a 10" motor.
[2024-12-09T18:06:22] Yamal: 11 Omega Queen
[2024-12-09T18:23:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Those discs you mention are for me the best on Ali express and much better than those sold in bicycle shops.
[2024-12-09T18:25:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The last disc I used with rivets, the rivets broke, thank goodness I was almost stopped, but they broke.
[2024-12-09T18:27:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you want to be safe, try the ones Yamal mentions. When I have to buy, I ask for 4 discs to have spares, they are super hard.
[2024-12-09T18:56:56] haku: heres one i saw Noname good brand too. peak g30v3
[2024-12-09T18:57:42] Noname: How many do you need?
[2024-12-09T18:57:56] Noname: Spend on frames no cash for parts
[2024-12-09T19:01:32] haku: morning cardio before deadlifts.
[2024-12-09T19:03:37] haku: i have alot of motors. shit ones though
[2024-12-09T19:37:34] haku: i call this a W-walk instead of C-walk. its a new gang

[2024-12-09T20:39:19] haku: im trying to get socialy accepted in todays internet society
[2024-12-09T20:40:44] Pandalgns: You still lack a queen's touch
[2024-12-09T20:40:48] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-12-09T20:41:24] haku: im working hard. i will learn it someday maybe i need heels instead of barfoot.
[2024-12-09T20:41:41] Pandalgns: A little more gay and you will be accepted
[2024-12-09T20:41:47] Pandalgns: 😜😜😜
[2024-12-09T22:43:04] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Work in progress for my other GT (Will be 20S9P EVE 40P 21700 Cells)
[2024-12-09T22:43:31] Mirono escooters: 😶😶😶
[2024-12-10T04:23:28] haku: is it possible to fit a mt5 caliper into a 120/125mm rotor?
[2024-12-10T11:36:53] GABE: Ya
[2024-12-10T11:39:55] Alin Ciobanu: fit 180 cells?
[2024-12-10T11:40:54] Patrick: Why not Bak 45D?
[2024-12-10T11:52:58] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yes
[2024-12-10T11:53:34] 'lekrsu': Any better or just the additional capacity?
[2024-12-10T11:55:17] Patrick: Both
[2024-12-10T11:55:36] Patrick: Beats p45b in discharge
[2024-12-10T12:05:37] GABE: maybe nice for a mini motor
[2024-12-10T12:07:09] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): As far as i could figure out EVE has better low temp performance and lower internal resistance.
[2024-12-10T12:13:31] Patrick: 40P have higher ir and Performance is worse
[2024-12-10T12:14:00] Patrick: Bak45d are amazing not that much more expensive also 40PL arent expensive too but they would be overkill
[2024-12-10T12:18:05] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Ok good to know thanks. Anyway EVE's have been ordered already

[2024-12-10T13:54:21] GABE: Shit does not stick lol I'll wait for the board and wait till my friends mom lets me use her car cell
[2024-12-10T13:56:45] Noname: Lightly sand cell.
[2024-12-10T13:56:54] Noname: But don't cause soldering is hack

[2024-12-10T19:42:22] Patrick: What spotwelder are you using kWeld?
[2024-12-10T19:43:18] Patrick: And i hope you use Caps then and not lipos xD they will cry after welding this much copper
[2024-12-10T19:45:28] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): I aint gonna weld it ... as i have bad experience with welding here. Had twice that i had to toss a pack out of the window. (Of course my fault) The Guy who welds it has a 24Kw spotwelder fully caps based. I am better in tinkering & blowing up stuff then sticking cells together 😂
[2024-12-10T20:01:07] Noname: My holiday gift to you. Good to know what your good at and what your not. Nice holder though

[2024-12-10T20:37:09] Pandalgns: The right-hand drive may come from Japan or England.
[2024-12-10T20:37:16] Pandalgns: But it's beautiful
[2024-12-10T20:38:00] haku: agreed. the guy took his kids to school on it. even has a carseat. what a boss

[2024-12-10T21:00:29] Noname: No way take an EMF field to shut me down. 1 button press and your car doesn't work.

[2024-12-10T22:18:03] GABE: the only confidence pill you need is a shower and brushed teeth and good clothes, hair, skin non greasy, chewing gum (if even)

[2024-12-12T14:38:03] GABE: If I use P42a then could I do 12v x 120a?
[2024-12-12T14:38:11] GABE: That's 1.5kw ISH no
[2024-12-12T14:38:24] GABE: Draw is for 20ms @lekrsu

[2024-12-12T15:07:44] GABE: Can't read that
[2024-12-12T15:13:49] Patrick: Its about amps not kW
[2024-12-12T15:14:35] Patrick: For propper welding you should have atleast 1kA in my opinion
[2024-12-12T15:16:35] GABE: For Cooper sandwich sure
[2024-12-12T15:16:42] GABE: I mean like Steel steip
[2024-12-12T15:16:44] GABE: strip
[2024-12-12T15:16:48] GABE: has to work right
[2024-12-12T15:16:55] GABE: I only need 30a if even
[2024-12-12T15:16:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-12T15:17:12] Patrick: Still about amps not kW
[2024-12-12T15:17:18] Patrick: 120A is nothing
[2024-12-12T15:17:25] Patrick: Long pulse
[2024-12-12T15:29:02] Paolo ⁭: Also depends by V
[2024-12-12T15:35:08] Patrick: Only little to melt it you need amps
[2024-12-12T15:56:18] Finn: with no voltage no current can flow
[2024-12-12T15:57:13] Patrick: Ofcourse but you dont need much voltage
[2024-12-12T15:57:29] Finn: Typically you use arround 12V for that
[2024-12-12T15:57:55] Patrick: Yes but you could probably use like 1V and would be fine on most material
[2024-12-12T15:59:07] Finn: Nope
[2024-12-12T15:59:30] Finn: Voltage makes a huge difference in the weld result such as generating the heat required to bond to metallic pieces together.
[2024-12-12T16:00:59] Finn: If you have 2000A and 5V and 1000A and 10V the 1000A 10V will generate a better result due to resistance of the cable and the materials youre using
[2024-12-12T16:01:30] GABE: And that welds copper sandwich?
[2024-12-12T16:01:46] GABE: Yep
[2024-12-12T16:01:54] Finn: What?
[2024-12-12T16:01:56] GABE: just needa weld steel deadass
[2024-12-12T16:01:58] GABE: 0.1mk
[2024-12-12T16:02:00] GABE: mm
[2024-12-12T16:02:13] GABE: That surely needs 10% of copper power
[2024-12-12T16:02:21] GABE: Cos copper = 1:4 nickel
[2024-12-12T16:02:21] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-12T16:02:41] Finn: all depends on equipment. and how long how muich current can flow and whats the wire resistance and voltage drop at load(depends on wire and internal resistance of cells)
[2024-12-12T16:10:43] Paolo ⁭: It's the first ohm law bro
[2024-12-12T16:10:49] Paolo ⁭: Physic basics
[2024-12-12T16:12:47] Patrick: Yes?
[2024-12-12T16:13:05] Patrick: And as long as the voltage is enough to pass the current where does it matter
[2024-12-12T16:13:17] Patrick: You dont need like 200V for welding
[2024-12-12T16:13:26] Patrick: kW of a welder says nothing
[2024-12-12T16:14:57] GABE: No
[2024-12-12T16:15:08] GABE: Not at all
[2024-12-12T16:15:23] GABE: Copper doesn't weld at lower voltages even at 2.5ka
[2024-12-12T16:16:15] GABE: Yes Welding = heat
[2024-12-12T16:16:20] GABE: More power = more heat
[2024-12-12T16:16:20] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-12T16:18:36] Patrick: Voltage isnt heat...
[2024-12-12T16:18:50] Patrick: So kW says shit when welding
[2024-12-12T16:18:57] Patrick: Amps make the heat
[2024-12-12T16:19:00] GABE: Joules are heat bro
[2024-12-12T16:19:09] Patrick: Yea see
[2024-12-12T16:19:19] GABE: J == Wattage
[2024-12-12T16:19:28] GABE: Physics.
[2024-12-12T16:21:55] GABE: litch a formula for it based on the metal welded.
[2024-12-12T16:22:37] Patrick: Time × Ampere = Joule
[2024-12-12T16:22:47] Patrick: Thats how even the kWeld works
[2024-12-12T16:22:52] Finn: without voltage no current can flow
[2024-12-12T16:23:21] Patrick: Yea and where does the kW matter tell me a 100kW welder could be more shit then a 5kW
[2024-12-12T16:23:22] Finn: Ohms law and vdrop of components...
[2024-12-12T16:23:42] Patrick: 4000V × 10A welder more shit then 12V × 2000A welder
[2024-12-12T16:24:18] Finn: the kV depends on voltage applied and current flowing.
[2024-12-12T16:24:38] Finn: and the 100kw is probably peak i would guess
[2024-12-12T16:24:55] Patrick: You See and kW can also be the same if i just have a high voltage
[2024-12-12T16:25:03] Patrick: And for welding you want high amps
[2024-12-12T16:25:07] Patrick: Not high voltage
[2024-12-12T16:25:09] Finn: yes it can thats why you look at amps
[2024-12-12T16:25:21] Finn: when you know both you can calculate voltage
[2024-12-12T16:25:29] Finn: ^^
[2024-12-12T16:25:49] Patrick: Now tell me where kW matters if a welder just says 100kW means nothing if you dont know amps
[2024-12-12T16:25:50] Finn: its the same as the motor ratings on all motors
[2024-12-12T16:25:57] Finn: exactly
[2024-12-12T16:26:07] Patrick: So why are we arguing?
[2024-12-12T16:26:12] Finn: if you buy cheap amazon stuff that says 1000kw
[2024-12-12T16:26:22] Finn: Im not arguing
[2024-12-12T16:26:50] GABE: Time x W
[2024-12-12T16:27:04] Finn: remember that?
[2024-12-12T16:27:12] GABE: Not A
[2024-12-12T16:27:19] GABE: Am I right?
[2024-12-12T16:27:23] GABE: Like or am I tripping
[2024-12-12T16:27:43] GABE: Finn
[2024-12-12T16:27:46] Patrick: You can if the current will Pass
[2024-12-12T16:28:01] Finn: ...
[2024-12-12T16:28:10] Finn: current cant flow without voltage
[2024-12-12T16:28:23] Finn: voltage makes the heat when you have same current
[2024-12-12T16:28:28] Patrick: I dont say 0V
[2024-12-12T16:28:35] Finn: on spotwelding current rises while voltage drops
[2024-12-12T16:28:42] Patrick: I just talk about low voltage
[2024-12-12T16:28:45] Finn: because of resistance of material losses etc..
[2024-12-12T16:28:53] Finn: Try it and see the result
[2024-12-12T16:28:56] Finn: why arguing anyway
[2024-12-12T16:29:12] Finn: doesnt lead to anything tbh
[2024-12-12T16:30:16] Finn: Thought you were doing an apprenticeship as an electronics technician. Ask your teacher when you're in vocational school. I'm sure he can explain that to you
[2024-12-12T16:30:16] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Finn has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-12T16:30:45] Paolo ⁭: Your welding point has resistance
[2024-12-12T16:31:00] Paolo ⁭: If you want weld steel you need enough voltage
[2024-12-12T16:31:25] Paolo ⁭: Otherwise even you put 10000 lipo in parallel the max current is still the same
[2024-12-12T16:33:15] Paolo ⁭: And 1v is really low
[2024-12-12T17:03:52] GABE: physical zeros

[2024-12-12T18:27:19] Noname: Is the base to thin to mount vesc? Think it would be rigid enough if mounted parallel to fins?
[2024-12-12T18:29:18] haku: what are the different strains? enlighten us mr. weedmanladytheythem
[2024-12-12T18:46:00] haku: i have that. you can mount it

[2024-12-12T19:57:25] haku: i need for wepoor. powerstage should come soon so i can get running
[2024-12-12T19:58:01] haku: i wonder if i mount the powerstage straight to these fins would it be better
[2024-12-12T19:58:45] haku: instead of transfering heat from case to fins
[2024-12-12T20:37:24] Noname: Small percent loss through thermal paste but large surface of heatsink will outweigh that easily
[2024-12-12T20:37:44] Noname: Where you gonna fit that huge thing
[2024-12-12T20:38:31] haku: 2 vescs mounted on bottom under 1 heatsink
[2024-12-12T20:39:08] haku: i havent tried it yet but might work
[2024-12-12T20:40:48] haku: <photos/photo_20018@12-12-2024_20-40-48.jpg>
[2024-12-12T20:46:52] haku: 2 vescs mounted under 1 heatsink means 2 genders under 1 flag. sounds good to me

[2024-12-12T21:40:25] haku: a lots of hidden messeges under that 2 vescs under 1 heatsink. like 2 balls under 1 dick.
[2024-12-12T21:41:15] haku: 2 tits under 1 chest. it just sounds more natural than multiple
[2024-12-12T21:50:42] Noname: 2 girls 1 cu..... nevermind
[2024-12-12T22:01:10] haku: classic

[2024-12-12T23:35:06] haku: boys open your eyes the the real war is against the woke mind virus. if you wokes dont release yamal they/them will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[2024-12-12T23:36:42] 'lekrsu': Sure you don't mean 16Ah?
[2024-12-12T23:37:22] 'lekrsu': Your brake is basically off in your config.
[2024-12-12T23:57:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What happened to yamal ?
[2024-12-12T23:58:48] haku: the woke got him. prolly dmd him with rainbow threats

[2024-12-13T02:56:48] Noname: Ugh this cul-de-sac looks so drab
[2024-12-13T03:02:21] haku: the third one looks nice actually theres a window

[2024-12-13T07:38:40] Rose: Hey there Yamal, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-13T07:39:01] Yamal: Hallo , todays it’s Friday @Mirono_escooters
[2024-12-13T07:39:04] Yamal: I’m back
[2024-12-13T07:39:22] Yamal: Finish the VESC scooter group holidays “””””
[2024-12-13T07:45:28] Yamal: The vacations have been short but intense! I will try not to share shit in this group. Another thing I would like to tell you Haku, acting as woke, I think it is bad that they censor you for talking about these things, since we are committed to families and the natural law of families, but really, this is something strange, unnatural and even disgusting. ,! It's really not worth mentioning this constantly because it becomes the On the contrary, it seems that you give it more importance than necessary. In life there are much more beautiful things to talk about than this? Do you understand, this is my sincere opinion, I mean we don't want or share this but we can't stop talking about it? Let's talk about scooter tunning with vesc, beautiful women or places where you would get lost with your family and your scooter,, It's like saying I don't like gays, and I spend all my time day saying fucking gays fucking gays fucking gays, this is not worth it because in a way they are occupying your head and your heart
[2024-12-13T07:45:28] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-13T08:16:19] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Rose go F#ck yourself :) (Yeah it's a bot) but cant the owner of the group not make the setting less aggresive?
[2024-12-13T08:47:23] crimeware: No
[2024-12-13T08:47:45] crimeware: Just make a second account & type inbetween each message to bypass the filter 👍
[2024-12-13T09:04:03] Yamal: Good morning @SibClimb, I'm doing the math for the new engines. Your racing scooters really have 8mm Amass 24bullets and a 6-pin Juliet connector, right?
[2024-12-13T09:06:13] Jason: heh
[2024-12-13T09:12:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2024-12-13T09:12:17] Yamal: ❤️‍🔥👍

[2024-12-13T10:50:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't feel miss out exactly the same as u don't feel missed out by not eating dogis
[2024-12-13T11:25:15] haku: your back! i cant believe they let you free! i was about to pour out liquor to a fallen brother. but anyways i dont like fucking gays
[2024-12-13T11:26:39] haku: have i told you a new chat thats theres no rose and speech is abundant?
[2024-12-13T11:29:55] haku: im glad 2nd worlds fastest nami in spain is back and my lawyer is back

[2024-12-13T14:37:05] puneDir: fuck gays
[2024-12-13T14:38:20] puneDir: being gay is against nature
[2024-12-13T14:41:25] Jan: I think not, else the genetics pool would have erradicated over the last thousands of years. As ive understood, scientifically it serves the purpose of co-parenting as not all animals are fit for parenting. We see this in many different higher developed animals like in penguins where this study was conducted
[2024-12-13T14:43:53] Jan: Let just people live their lives and dont force your opinion to others. I feel like the whole woke movement feels like the same extremist movement we had 80years ago but in the other direction. Extremism is bad on all sides
[2024-12-13T15:32:50] Yamal: …..,,.,,,..
[2024-12-13T15:34:04] Yamal: I don't think any more explanations are necessary... I like Kim Kardashian
[2024-12-13T15:34:12] Yamal: Heheheh
[2024-12-13T15:34:20] Yamal: Scooter group enjoy
[2024-12-13T15:50:59] Lieven L.: I don't understand why people care so much about what others do. Just let others do what ever the fuck they want. Its not impacting you at all.
[2024-12-13T16:12:01] haku: it is the chemicals in these medications and the shit ntrition from our processed foods that are turning the people gay
[2024-12-13T16:13:11] Marius: fr bro they gotta stop stealing our children and puttin em in mcdonalds
[2024-12-13T16:14:24] haku: i have nothing agaimst gays i have people i know and care about that are gay. its the wokemind is the problem. when you shove that down our kids throats
[2024-12-13T16:15:10] haku: and people are okay with it. no its not okay. someone has to call out the BS
[2024-12-13T16:18:34] haku: being gay is an adult choice not a minors choice. dont indoctrinate our kids. my son my only boy the heir to the thrown of gondor. the heir to isildur himself is being taught to be gay is not cool.
[2024-12-13T16:24:54] haku: and the worse part is that if you call that out your called a nazi. do these woke fucks know what that word even means. let me say my stance on this. i dont care wich higher power you worship. i do not US getting involved in wars. im not racist i like all races exept maybe indians and canadians they dont tip for some reason and most of all only 2 genders
[2024-12-13T16:25:52] Marius: fax bro those canadians are nasty business
[2024-12-13T16:32:05] Yamal: <photos/photo_20028@13-12-2024_16-32-05.jpg>

[2024-12-13T16:33:09] Paolo ⁭: Nothing against them , but when you reject they should stop
[2024-12-13T16:33:44] Paolo ⁭: Many gay spam in dm asking picture of jewel😳
[2024-12-13T16:34:56] haku: the cancel culture is real bro. if you do not agree with them they will get you fired.
[2024-12-13T16:36:12] Jan: Yeah and in second world war you were executed going against the regime's opinion
[2024-12-13T16:36:15] Jan: Its extremism
[2024-12-13T16:36:25] Jan: I dont agree with extremism
[2024-12-13T16:38:31] Paolo ⁭: Like here during pandemic, if you don't inject vaccine you get fired too

[2024-12-13T16:45:01] Yamal: change schools and change your profile picture or at least the colors... and if you don't agree, put williams wallace's face painted blue
[2024-12-13T16:45:38] Yamal: and if you want we will send it to Singapore there all this is prohibited by law xD
[2024-12-13T16:45:40] Yamal: ;)
[2024-12-13T16:47:09] haku: i changed my profile to free you brother and bend the knee to the woke. ill change it back dont worry

[2024-12-13T16:51:41] haku: this little wokemind reminders everyday i say is not an insult but a message to the young people in this group. they need someone real to tell them its not okay. someone with a face not a avatar
[2024-12-13T16:53:02] haku: i dont hide my face. im a real person with real kid. not a virtual world. these kids just need guidance is all.
[2024-12-13T16:54:37] haku: im not the smart but i do have a phd in 2 gender only science
[2024-12-13T16:54:37] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-12-15T05:18:47] haku: oh i see
[2024-12-15T05:19:27] haku: why not available. dam must be sold out or canceled. hmm

[2024-12-15T05:38:23] Noname: Before you sleep.what is your power supply for kweld
[2024-12-15T05:39:58] haku: legend has it he uses an exercise bike to produce the current
[2024-12-15T05:40:42] Noname: I believe that is the funniest thing you have ever said
[2024-12-15T05:41:50] Noname: I'd have guessed water powered generator from a Swiss waterfall powering an old wooden shack in a mountain
[2024-12-15T05:44:38] Noname: Read a lot of complaints about changing leads. I do have some like 0g wire lol
[2024-12-15T05:45:55] Noname: Mabey I leave alone no cash for another replacement
[2024-12-15T06:13:01] Yamal: I still don't understand when you say powerstage 22s, supposedly so that ubox can work with 22s you have to change the mosfet and some components
[2024-12-15T06:15:43] haku: this one has different mosfets from regular ubox
[2024-12-15T06:16:27] haku: ive been told it custom from a customer.
[2024-12-15T06:18:48] Yamal: But you buy new one ,,?
[2024-12-15T06:18:56] haku: this is original mosfet
[2024-12-15T06:19:04] haku: yea. i got 2 just to match
[2024-12-15T06:19:12] haku: just powerstage
[2024-12-15T06:19:45] Yamal: Nice man
[2024-12-15T06:20:02] Yamal: Just mount and ride !
[2024-12-15T06:20:03] haku: need wepoor for the inaguration parade
[2024-12-15T06:20:10] Yamal: It’s your time ..
[2024-12-15T06:20:38] Yamal: But you use on 20s right
[2024-12-15T06:21:15] haku: yes. but might add 2 more S next year depending on how this powerstage is at 20s
[2024-12-15T06:21:36] haku: lots of room in wepoor
[2024-12-15T06:21:51] Yamal: Spintend assures that they will go well in 22s?
[2024-12-15T06:22:28] Yamal: that I have heard only rfp has been successful in it
[2024-12-15T06:22:55] Yamal: many ubox deaths along the wayde 22s
[2024-12-15T06:23:28] haku: they claim.
[2024-12-15T06:23:35] haku: we will test
[2024-12-15T06:23:41] Yamal: He is distant now, I don't know what's wrong with him, I called him several times before and he never answered...
[2024-12-15T06:23:56] Yamal: 😞
[2024-12-15T06:23:59] haku: who? BV?
[2024-12-15T06:24:11] Yamal: Raphael fujiguara
[2024-12-15T06:24:17] haku: ah i see
[2024-12-15T06:24:55] haku: i have no idea what his ubox is. this is mine. maybe possible that these are the same powerstage. no clue
[2024-12-15T06:25:32] haku: i dont want to confirm nor deny. i plead the fifth. 😜
[2024-12-15T06:26:24] Yamal: ………..
[2024-12-15T06:27:04] Yamal: you forget many things, eat raisins
[2024-12-15T06:27:17] Yamal: XD
[2024-12-15T06:27:35] haku: raisins went up in price. its not in my grocery list anymore.
[2024-12-15T06:27:38] Yamal: Ubox 85/250—————R350 22s
[2024-12-15T06:28:28] Yamal: https://rfp-performance.com/product/esc-rfp-r350/

[2024-12-15T06:29:17] haku: mine is wepoor performance. i love china we trust
[2024-12-15T06:29:26] Yamal: and with that Kilian won the championship and came second,,,, people can say a thousand things,,,,, but this is the reality
[2024-12-15T06:29:50] haku: i dont even follow scooter races. i should
[2024-12-15T06:30:16] haku: do they have a 2 gender policy on the circuit?
[2024-12-15T06:30:37] haku: because if not. i will not watch
[2024-12-15T06:31:59] Yamal: What
[2024-12-15T06:32:35] Yamal: I think there are some woman races with the manes
[2024-12-15T06:33:11] Yamal: but there is no women's league, that would be fine xD
[2024-12-15T06:33:25] Yamal: You and your photo ,,,,
[2024-12-15T06:33:30] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-12-15T06:33:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-15T06:37:18] haku: im okay with that. but is blueman allowed to race?
[2024-12-15T06:39:15] Yamal: No
[2024-12-15T06:39:26] Yamal: When you mount the controlller ?
[2024-12-15T06:39:40] haku: great. ill stay tuned to races
[2024-12-15T06:39:43] Yamal: Only need mount bullet on esc right ?
[2024-12-15T06:40:07] haku: yes reuse old bullets and qs8 like a peasant
[2024-12-15T06:40:31] Yamal: Ah yes qs8 too
[2024-12-15T06:40:45] Yamal: Okey I hope everything okeee
[2024-12-15T06:40:51] haku: the bullets i have you cant buy in ali. its an american store that sells it i think
[2024-12-15T06:41:30] Yamal: Planing tu buy bullet Amass 8mm
[2024-12-15T06:42:08] Noname: I need somethimg to fit the 2 phase wires
[2024-12-15T06:42:12] Yamal: I follow everything Ragemechanic and RFP
[2024-12-15T06:42:22] Yamal: THEY are the best
[2024-12-15T06:42:30] haku: dont be a follower be a leader. do different
[2024-12-15T06:42:42] haku: like jaguar comercial
[2024-12-15T06:43:06] Yamal: I’m new “” in this world and they are the profesional winner
[2024-12-15T06:43:11] Noname: Less expensive when you lean from others mistakes
[2024-12-15T06:43:55] haku: true. but you want to pioneer something. peak g30 and wepoor for example
[2024-12-15T06:44:13] haku: buying 811h and finding out its good
[2024-12-15T06:44:33] Noname: Depends if you want glory or results. Early.bird gets the worm. 2nd mouse gets the cheese
[2024-12-15T06:45:13] Noname: How is any of that pioneering
[2024-12-15T06:45:33] Yamal: Each one is the leader of his tribe and his house, but this does not mean that you follow the greats of this world, while you soldered 10 bullet connectors they have soldered 1000
[2024-12-15T06:46:21] haku: no one crazy built on these frames.
[2024-12-15T06:46:45] Noname: That you know of
[2024-12-15T06:46:50] haku: never seen a vesced 70h wepoor frame before.
[2024-12-15T06:47:13] Noname: Ok ill give you that one
[2024-12-15T06:47:43] haku: peak g30 someone did im sure
[2024-12-15T06:54:40] Yamal: Why peak”””
[2024-12-15T06:55:03] haku: because thats what it is
[2024-12-15T06:55:17] Yamal: The G30 I understand it’s about your rear motor it’s from g30
[2024-12-15T06:55:18] haku: final evolution of g30.
[2024-12-15T06:55:44] haku: yep. hence the name
[2024-12-15T06:56:44] Yamal: It is currently Nami 21 XD
[2024-12-15T06:58:24] Yamal: he will try a power increase for a few months but later he will become Nami 21 again and will have to donate the engines to his brother Thunder Black Panther.
[2024-12-15T06:58:50] haku: i bet the extreme bull k6 frame is also a good platform. looks so stable. need to try it
[2024-12-15T07:00:11] Yamal: Nice many V
[2024-12-15T07:00:21] Yamal: 126 I think ,,?
[2024-12-15T07:00:29] haku: yea
[2024-12-15T07:02:07] Yamal: Today I finish early
[2024-12-15T07:02:38] Yamal: Only 13 tree, so morning finish maybe i can do some km later
[2024-12-15T07:02:46] haku: i wonder if these kick scooters are meant to be converted to electric and vesc and why is trampa of all companies making it.
[2024-12-15T07:03:48] haku: cancelled the str500 but kept this. i have no idea who they are catering too
[2024-12-15T07:06:13] haku: if i was an investor in thier company i would sell all shares.
[2024-12-15T07:08:51] haku: this is the one time they can prove the str500 is superior western made. compared to fardrivers with the same power
[2024-12-15T07:17:54] Yamal: I like the mast and the handlebars, many competitors or rather some use them, the first one I saw was in Aymard Vernay, which by the way I find it lost now...
[2024-12-15T07:19:00] Yamal: I would like the TRAMPA team to do more honor to BV and make a leap in terms of power and models
[2024-12-15T07:19:38] haku: agreed
[2024-12-15T07:20:11] Yamal: If I were from Sweden, everything would be very different
[2024-12-15T07:20:22] haku: if i can afford these seven or this i would get it.
[2024-12-15T07:20:53] haku: be the first one to run seven amd 40pl
[2024-12-15T07:21:10] Yamal: But not good life … sad…
[2024-12-15T07:21:18] haku: or any new tabless cells
[2024-12-15T07:21:54] haku: what 6.5" scooter motor can even handle that is the question
[2024-12-15T07:22:05] Yamal: Yes but …
[2024-12-15T07:22:46] Yamal: They will be able to maintain the 400phase more easily and for longer at heart-stopping temperatures
[2024-12-15T07:24:00] haku: it prolly feels great to have the worlds fastest scooter or minibike in the world
[2024-12-15T07:24:25] haku: so far its rage has proven top dog
[2024-12-15T07:25:06] haku: video, gps and telemetry on video
[2024-12-15T07:27:06] haku: BV and James should move to US. show what viking power really means
[2024-12-15T07:28:10] haku: and now RIP focforever. who else US vesc representative making videos
[2024-12-15T07:28:10] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-15T07:32:23] Yamal: Rose Rose
[2024-12-15T08:48:37] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-12-15T11:05:10] Jason: loo
[2024-12-15T11:05:10] Jason: <photos/photo_20068@15-12-2024_11-05-10.jpg>
[2024-12-15T13:26:19] GABE: why not make it all a zigzag?
[2024-12-15T13:59:46] Patrick: You know if the 65H Lonnyo 16x4, are star or delta winding from stock?
[2024-12-15T14:02:48] Patrick: Star ofcourse
[2024-12-15T14:06:56] Patrick: Damn 16A only
[2024-12-15T14:08:06] Patrick: The motor takes like 100-120A battery
[2024-12-15T14:09:34] Patrick: You should be fine setting the motor current/Phase to like 150A
[2024-12-15T14:10:00] Patrick: Better ask Roger what he could push Phase on his Vsett setup
[2024-12-15T14:10:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Patrick has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-15T14:10:51] Patrick: Its because the bms shut off and then all controller will burn. So the reason is the e-brake limit to your max voltage, then you can brake without problem.
[2024-12-15T14:12:34] Patrick: Apparently 180A if you scroll up in the segway group
[2024-12-15T14:14:23] Patrick: Yes i also did 180A with my vsett motor. Hit 90kph
[2024-12-15T14:14:42] Patrick: 16s Single?
[2024-12-15T14:14:54] Patrick: Or 20s Single then
[2024-12-15T14:15:15] Patrick: Sounds realistic for Vsett motor
[2024-12-15T14:15:47] Patrick: But i changed to lonnyo, because the vsett motor go hot very quickly. Also if i only drive 45-50kph for 20minutes. its go hot unbelivable, not can touch the motor
[2024-12-15T14:17:00] Patrick: Little high kV too for Single right?
[2024-12-15T14:19:38] Patrick: And only 105diameter stator und 50mm magnets. The lonnyo are also 16x4 but with 110mm stator and 65mm magnets. No temp problem, also when drive in mountain. Only what i not very happy is the topeed. I never hit over 84kmh all time. But most time 78-80kmh. Maybe its need test a 22x3. Should hit the 100kmh quickly 😁 The vsett reach 90kmh without big problem, only the temp, max speed was 94kmh under perfect conditions.
[2024-12-15T14:23:13] Patrick: I will order my 16x4 with phase wires on both sides this allows star/delta
[2024-12-15T14:23:55] Patrick: So if i want to go faster i just need to change the connections and i can run it as delta
[2024-12-15T14:23:56] 'lekrsu': Guess the current output of having more copper isn't needed
[2024-12-15T14:24:50] Patrick: Its mean its a star from stock? You maybe know i can may also change to delta? I never did. Maybe the vsett is a delta from stock?
[2024-12-15T14:25:06] Patrick: No both star
[2024-12-15T14:25:38] Patrick: My wires all at one side, but if there is a way w would try 😁
[2024-12-15T14:25:43] Patrick: And idk if its worth for you to change the motor to delta for me it is but i can also change it back in like 5min
[2024-12-15T14:26:47] Patrick: The big question is, is it possible with my lonnyo, inwould test it out 😇
[2024-12-15T14:27:38] Christophe C.: Ok all, thanks for your answers. I will begun with 130 A motor and 45 A max for battery. I don't search the maximum speed, i want to stay alive 😀 and i search secure settings for battery, motor and vesc . Vesc are extensive (160 euros in France) and i don't want change it all the years 😂 45 - 50 kmh are enough for me. I will be back to tell you the result when i try it ! Thanks again to all 👍
[2024-12-15T14:31:05] Patrick: Possible with every star motor
[2024-12-15T15:00:47] Yamal: <video_file>

[2024-12-15T15:46:39] 'lekrsu': It's on the app store.

[2024-12-15T16:16:14] Rose: Hey there Q, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-15T17:56:46] haku: feasting like kings over here
[2024-12-15T18:01:20] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati its been confirmed by mr.rage worlds fastest scooter in the world that my powerstage is mr. foujiwaras.
[2024-12-15T18:50:20] Yamal: How is posible ?
[2024-12-15T18:50:29] Yamal: When he do at home ,,
[2024-12-15T18:53:42] haku: no idea boi.
[2024-12-15T18:54:05] haku: maybe spintend copy.
[2024-12-15T18:55:05] haku: thats difficult to do at home. what the hell. hundreds of alu powerstages
[2024-12-15T19:01:14] Yamal: Gooogle translate tired really
[2024-12-15T19:03:25] Yamal: spintend can give you mosfett at 100 v """ or something like that but he has gone deeper into this electronics and also does more things to it like changing some components, etc., I don't lose it, some tried to do the same as him but to no avail. the same success and this is what I know to date.....
[2024-12-15T19:05:00] Yamal: and we talk about how their scooters go in their maximum configuration and to the "maximum", and the drivers ride successfully, that is, their scooters do not go out for a walk to see landscapes,, Their scooters go out to the circuit to die spinning around, I don't know if I can explain myself.
[2024-12-15T19:06:35] Yamal: But okeeeee mount the controller and let’s go bebe
[2024-12-15T19:07:00] Yamal: We want to see the desert 🤩
[2024-12-15T19:07:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-15T19:11:32] haku: i have no idea how this will perform tbh. but we will test
[2024-12-15T19:11:51] Yamal: Also you start first with 20s
[2024-12-15T19:11:57] Yamal: Everything ready !!
[2024-12-15T19:12:39] haku: 20s first easy to add 2s in the futute
[2024-12-15T19:12:48] haku: 30kw is the new 20kw

[2024-12-15T19:24:04] Yamal: Fancy bogar

[2024-12-15T19:25:48] Yamal: but 250A batt you need a big battery that can hold that on the highway
[2024-12-15T19:26:53] Yamal: 500A battery for how long
[2024-12-15T19:27:49] haku: thats peak

[2024-12-15T19:47:00] Yamal: to do really cool routes, discover new places, maybe you'll find old Tom in those landscapes you have there, they are very similar, I don't know, but you can really enjoy it

[2024-12-15T22:23:57] Yamal: 15 December
[2024-12-15T22:24:24] Yamal: Better mount the controller before finish the year !
[2024-12-15T22:28:24] Yamal: You have everything you need, tools, materials and a lot of free time! If you had a monkey it would be awesome
[2024-12-15T22:28:44] haku: not time. im busy busy man

[2024-12-15T23:23:29] Patrick: What cells for the 30s4p?
[2024-12-15T23:34:25] Jason: 40t
[2024-12-15T23:34:28] Jason: smasnug
[2024-12-15T23:39:11] Patrick: Why not eve 40P those are better
[2024-12-15T23:39:23] Jason: easier to get
[2024-12-15T23:39:44] Jason: have to go thru customs and worst case can't get those imported into here
[2024-12-15T23:40:01] Jason: kr law sucks and I wanna just fkn flee to Sweden or sorta
[2024-12-15T23:41:52] Patrick: So like 14-15kW should be possible with those
[2024-12-15T23:42:24] Patrick: If you do delta on the 17x4 thats like 120km/h+
[2024-12-15T23:42:58] Patrick: <photos/photo_20075@15-12-2024_23-42-58.jpg>
[2024-12-16T00:47:03] Jason: single?
[2024-12-16T01:02:35] Patrick: Enough Wattage and RPM is there too
[2024-12-16T01:54:44] Jason: hmm then I should seriously consider delta as an option
[2024-12-16T01:54:48] Jason: hope it ain't that hard
[2024-12-16T01:54:58] Jason: (only did delta once but motor fkn burnt)
[2024-12-16T03:51:19] haku: i have a few brakes and levers to choose from. looks like mt5e will rub. also i wonder what best way mount pistons.
[2024-12-16T03:51:19] haku: <photos/photo_20077@16-12-2024_03-51-19.jpg>
[2024-12-16T03:51:56] haku: peak g30v2 needs a little bit of thinking. not smooth brain it
[2024-12-16T03:53:05] haku: 160mm rotor might be better
[2024-12-16T03:55:52] haku: this build is more complicated than i was expecting
[2024-12-16T04:12:54] purp: anyone add vesc to a old mantis 10 with no halls? which dual vesc controller did y’all manage to fit in the deck? i got the 24.5 ah battery so space is limited
[2024-12-16T04:14:13] Noname: You don't need halls just have to push start. And by that I mean move it 1 inch
[2024-12-16T04:15:17] purp: yeah i don’t mind that. im just curious what controller fits in the mantis? i measured and the dual ubox lite 100v is just like maybe half a inch too wide
[2024-12-16T04:17:13] Noname: Can you get singles and stick them to the side of frame?
[2024-12-16T04:18:18] Noname: Or one on floor one on cover over each other?
[2024-12-16T04:22:27] purp: u mean stack em?
[2024-12-16T04:23:57] Noname: Well one on the lid? What's it made of?
[2024-12-16T04:42:57] purp: the controller box area bottom is metal but the top part is a plastic cover
[2024-12-16T04:43:21] purp: i wish i could fit one in the battery compartment but the battery is long and so there’s no way to lay it down flat
[2024-12-16T04:49:37] Noname: How deep is the battery tray
[2024-12-16T04:49:56] purp: lemme take a pic
[2024-12-16T04:50:30] purp: i MIGHT be able to squeeze some shitskys but i’d like to be able to go w spintend if possible lol
[2024-12-16T04:51:02] Noname: You could stand one on side and stick to side or front of neck
[2024-12-16T04:51:24] purp: yeah i thought ab that but kinda scared of temps without it sittin flat on meta
[2024-12-16T04:51:27] purp: metal*
[2024-12-16T04:51:43] Noname: Singles are 58mm

[2024-12-16T19:41:54] haku: same with a regular shutter camera. dam phone camera innovation has been good. only difference is now is the pixels and depth of field

[2024-12-17T03:16:27] haku: agreed
[2024-12-17T03:32:57] Matthew: Am I able to datalog a heavy fast run and share it here to see if you guys can tell why the scooter motor seems to almost lightly flutter. I'd compare the feeling almost to detonation/pinging on a gasoline engine. If I back off the throttle a bit it stop doing that and I can push the throttle to a certain position and about hover just below where the motor cogs or flutters. The acceleration is affected when the fluttering happens and when I back off and slowly get back onto the the throttle the scooter will accelerate strong again.
[2024-12-17T04:27:49] haku: show video
[2024-12-17T04:28:48] haku: easier to diagnose when video

[2024-12-17T14:56:44] Ofek 🐥: Hey guys, I have started a new project, Dualtron X LTD with dual tronic X12 vesc. Battery is 23S (84V nominal), I completed the setup successfully and when there's no load the motors spin great. With load when I'm riding, I can go up to ~100 phase amps and then I get disconnecting of the motor and Over-Voltage fault code is shown. It also happen when I try to accelerate quickly. I count wrap my head about what can cause it. Motor current - 200A Battery - 50A Battery and motor regen set to - 0A Any help would be appreciated 🙏
[2024-12-17T14:58:39] Ofek 🐥: <video_file>
[2024-12-17T15:10:49] Yamal: Stock battery ?
[2024-12-17T15:12:11] Yamal: Send photos of absolutely the entire project 🤩
[2024-12-17T16:03:36] Ofek 🐥: For now yes, I have total of 120A discharge
[2024-12-17T16:04:09] Yamal: You need POWER battery man ^^'
[2024-12-17T16:04:33] Yamal: Stock motor
[2024-12-17T16:05:31] Paolo ⁭: what vesc
[2024-12-17T16:06:01] Yamal: X12 master chef VESC
[2024-12-17T16:06:41] Ofek 🐥: Custom made heatsinks for mounting inside, on the outside there's fins for cooling
[2024-12-17T16:07:46] Ofek 🐥: Yes, rear with Hall and front semsorless
[2024-12-17T16:08:17] Ofek 🐥: I know, it's my friend's scooter. He will probably swap it soon
[2024-12-17T16:09:00] Ofek 🐥: X12 They are rated for 24S and I have 23S
[2024-12-17T16:12:43] Paolo ⁭: do you have hall?
[2024-12-17T16:22:47] Ofek 🐥: Rear motor have Hall, front doesn't
[2024-12-17T16:23:12] Yamal: very interesting, x12 on dualtron X, how many parallels fit in there,,,,there is not much information or experiences with this Vesc giant.
[2024-12-17T16:24:01] Ofek 🐥: I've tried setting motor current to 0 for front and 200 for rear, the issue remains When I set it opposite (front 200 and rear 0) it happen too
[2024-12-17T16:27:02] Ofek 🐥: It has 12 TOLT fets, the construction is simple 1 PCB. Must use thermal pad in installation to avoid shorting the phases. (Like with TO-220 based vesc) It looks great but they ship it without all the necessary connectors, only switch cable and adc. No hall, no can wires, nothing 🫠

[2024-12-17T16:29:49] Yamal: From my short experience you need a battery with discharge cells and motors that can channel and irrigate with the swamp water xD
[2024-12-17T16:29:53] 'lekrsu': Why the hotglue
[2024-12-17T16:30:22] Paolo ⁭: What is max voltage in your settings

[2024-12-17T16:30:35] 'lekrsu': Doesn't belong on heating hardware, xD
[2024-12-17T16:30:46] 'lekrsu': High temp epoxy or silicone, not this

[2024-12-17T16:55:05] Yamal: Rage mechanics winner ! Hehe also titanium right

[2024-12-17T18:28:50] Yamal: I'm just asking, if they are going to set up seven, we agree that the c350 are very powerful controllers and that it is more than proven that they work well, but they are the avant-garde, they have a budget and they need to make the leap to something new, powerful and new ...
[2024-12-17T18:28:59] Yamal: X12/seven
[2024-12-17T18:29:09] Noname: Ok hear me out. Surron motor and a battery on back lol 😆

[2024-12-17T18:44:59] Yamal: Continuos current its battery right ,,?always I confuse,,, i know max set point and abs it’s phase,,,, ?
[2024-12-17T18:48:36] Finn: No hardware overcurrent detection😐
[2024-12-17T18:53:46] Yamal: 400A battery in optimal conditions,,,?
[2024-12-17T18:56:19] Yamal: 300A for x12?
[2024-12-17T18:58:28] Yamal: It would be good to know what is the maximum "configurable" for both phase and battery (A) per controller..
[2024-12-17T19:19:57] Yamal: Imagine you have the battery necessary, just for know
[2024-12-17T19:20:36] Yamal: And imagine you don’t care the phase wires of your engine xD
[2024-12-17T19:21:30] Yamal: X12
[2024-12-17T19:21:33] Yamal: ?
[2024-12-17T19:25:12] Yamal: I heard that for the x12 they were 250A batteries, how is it possible so little phase?
[2024-12-17T19:26:26] haku: after christmas ill work on the wepoor. garage too crowded atm
[2024-12-17T19:29:53] haku: need a 22s bms

[2024-12-17T19:41:43] Face de Pin Sucé: nono
[2024-12-17T19:42:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes we have maxxed out the power, now we need to go a step higher

[2024-12-17T19:43:21] Face de Pin Sucé: G300 overheats compared to a C350, no point in this controller SEVEN18 is same idea, with VIAS on FR4 PCB, so not interesting
[2024-12-17T19:43:26] Yamal: Base spintend xD?
[2024-12-17T19:43:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope x)

[2024-12-17T19:52:16] Face de Pin Sucé: No, but Seven, won't be much better, cooling through vias is really bad compared to IMS
[2024-12-17T19:53:28] Yamal: …

[2024-12-17T19:57:08] Yamal: It's a big dilemma which one to buy
[2024-12-17T19:59:19] Yamal: I would like to try both vesc too, but I would definitely start with seven, I'm not ready for tronic yet xD
[2024-12-17T20:00:34] haku: only way to really try is test it. i will ask for seven sponsorship
[2024-12-17T20:00:34] Yamal: Viking vs picture painter, France trembles

[2024-12-17T20:01:27] haku: ill make a battery worthy of it if they send me to test 😜

[2024-12-17T22:13:54] Yamal: Stock motor it’s like this
[2024-12-17T22:14:04] Yamal: 60h 17/4
[2024-12-17T22:14:25] Yamal: My motor is type Rion and 22/3
[2024-12-17T22:14:35] Yamal: Any way tiny wires …
[2024-12-17T22:19:25] Yamal: Powerful Vescs need decent phase cables, if you want to take advantage of electronics, but of course one is not born knowing, and everything is a process, that's why I'm looking forward to starting the new project xD

[2024-12-17T22:28:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: @PaoloWu He knows how to do it. He solved a doubt that Yamal and I had about the motor winding.
[2024-12-17T22:31:34] Paolo ⁭: By measuring phase wire, or by opening it
[2024-12-17T22:32:00] Paolo ⁭: In major of case just with free wheel speed
[2024-12-17T22:32:25] Yamal: Is there a photo of a Nami motor that clearly said 17/4 on the stator?
[2024-12-17T22:33:49] Ofek 🐥: Ortega aswell We came to conclusion that the rear motor cause cutoffs

[2024-12-17T22:48:18] Yamal: It is the most common thing that everyone names or guides
[2024-12-17T22:49:02] Yamal: I also hear 22/3 as "torque" and 33/2 speed.
[2024-12-17T22:50:36] Yamal: 33/2, your great goal for the x12, I thought you already knew it, even that you already had the 80/85h engines?

[2024-12-17T22:58:30] Yamal: Do not hesitate to ask absolutely anything you are not clear about or want to know, that is where the point is. progress, in fact many people learn from your questions, someone will answer xD, that's what I do! I declared myself a novice enthusiast wanting to break the sound barrier. So something will happen in the future, by the way if you are going to compete in xelectric I hope we see each other, we can even mess with the gabachos or puncture their tires xD
[2024-12-17T22:59:32] ✨🇪🇸عمر: Or 90h 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

[2024-12-17T23:00:50] ✨🇪🇸عمر: It will be with pleasure!! I will come see my family and do some laps! 🤣🤣
[2024-12-17T23:01:20] ✨🇪🇸عمر: currently I have 180mm for the engines
[2024-12-17T23:02:09] Yamal: When will your scooter be ready and when will your training start?
[2024-12-17T23:02:14] Yamal: Why
[2024-12-17T23:04:10] ✨🇪🇸عمر: my little nami I only need the battery (22s10) that I will get back at the end of January, the big one with the gtr fork will perhaps be ready for 2026 I don't really know
[2024-12-17T23:04:46] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I make the fork tees to measure, I put the spacing I want
[2024-12-17T23:10:37] Yamal: Wich one have the x12
[2024-12-17T23:12:05] ✨🇪🇸عمر: the x12 would be for the big one
[2024-12-17T23:12:10] haku: if it overheats ill move it outside and put a heatsink. this setup just so clean.
[2024-12-17T23:12:40] ✨🇪🇸عمر: the little will stay in spintend
[2024-12-17T23:13:00] ✨🇪🇸عمر: 100v100a or 100v240a
[2024-12-17T23:13:03] Yamal: and you want to compete with spintend 100/100 and the fabric engines?
[2024-12-17T23:13:18] haku: 20s at 20-30a battery
[2024-12-17T23:13:23] ✨🇪🇸عمر: yess
[2024-12-17T23:13:56] ✨🇪🇸عمر: just have a first experience of the circuit!
[2024-12-17T23:14:33] Yamal: of spintend 100/100 it is better to forget if you want to compete in my opinion only ubox22 can within spintend ""
[2024-12-17T23:14:50] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I'm not going to invest a lot of money if I'm really bad or I don't like it 🤣
[2024-12-17T23:15:25] Yamal: There are no good results with 100/100 in terms of performance or taking your scooter to the limit.
[2024-12-17T23:15:52] ✨🇪🇸عمر: it will be replaced by 240a but not before the first race unfortunately
[2024-12-17T23:16:59] ✨🇪🇸عمر: even with big controllers I will be limited later by my kaabo motors
[2024-12-17T23:17:10] Yamal: Little by little is how we all do it, but 100/100 is clearly not a good option.
[2024-12-17T23:19:12] Yamal: Yes and you have a 22s battery I would look for something for 22s and spintend only rfp has the success, waiting for haku with their ubox results if they actually manage that voltage well
[2024-12-17T23:19:41] ✨🇪🇸عمر: after the battery and the equipment the controllers are on my shopping list
[2024-12-17T23:21:30] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I have a friend who changed the mosfet of the 250a and I am in a Russian group who uses the 240a in 22s without any real problems so far
[2024-12-17T23:21:47] Yamal: Wouh
[2024-12-17T23:21:55] Yamal: Nice to know
[2024-12-17T23:22:53] Max Rainlogix: Are you sure abt that? 😂
[2024-12-17T23:23:18] ✨🇪🇸عمر: Afterwards I was made to understand that it wasn't just that that had changed
[2024-12-17T23:23:44] haku: how you measure phase resistance without vesc tool?
[2024-12-17T23:26:02] haku: i shouldve got mini spintend. i just have some vesc that i dont use. perfect size for this jetson
[2024-12-17T23:26:48] Yamal: Yes, they change the mosfet and components but it is difficult to get stuck in breaking an esc and stay stuck for a long time waiting for the new one, for my new project the idea of ubox22s is very tempting, but so is the idea of seven xD
[2024-12-17T23:28:18] ✨🇪🇸عمر: you have to try 🤣🤣
[2024-12-17T23:30:14] Yamal: the wave is pure and in the form of hello, you wouldn't fall to the asphalt that way, you would surf it
[2024-12-17T23:30:29] Yamal: Two time (wave) no need xD
[2024-12-17T23:31:09] Yamal: Also 3shulc350V4 good option
[2024-12-17T23:31:17] Yamal: X12 x4
[2024-12-17T23:31:47] Yamal: Seven it’s the dream
[2024-12-17T23:31:47] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-17T23:31:57] Max Rainlogix: <sticker>
[2024-12-17T23:32:44] ✨🇪🇸عمر: trampa 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
[2024-12-17T23:34:39] Yamal: seven would be proud to honor FOC forever, he was the first person to hear about this new electronic with enthusiasm
[2024-12-17T23:35:19] Yamal: 100/250 less power than 3shull or ubox22?
[2024-12-17T23:35:32] Yamal: Str500 very big I think..
[2024-12-17T23:36:23] ✨🇪🇸عمر: 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
[2024-12-17T23:36:38] Yamal: G300
[2024-12-17T23:36:58] Yamal: need modifications to cool better
[2024-12-17T23:37:26] ✨🇪🇸عمر: In France there is a person who uses them and he is happy about it.
[2024-12-17T23:37:26] Yamal: They claim that ubox handles more current than g300
[2024-12-17T23:37:41] Yamal: Str500?
[2024-12-17T23:38:35] ✨🇪🇸عمر: Nope 100v250a
[2024-12-17T23:39:11] Yamal: you scared me xD
[2024-12-17T23:39:42] Yamal: I had to sit on the floor waiting for the answer.
[2024-12-17T23:39:48] Yamal: 😂
[2024-12-17T23:41:04] ✨🇪🇸عمر: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNeTW6nwc/

[2024-12-17T23:43:50] ✨🇪🇸عمر: after that I was told not to do this stupid thing, take vesc, and 680a is too much for the engines
[2024-12-17T23:43:50] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. ✨🇪🇸عمر has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-17T23:44:03] Yamal: Can’t see don’t have TikTok

[2024-12-17T23:48:20] Yamal: the name will be FOC FOREVER with the support of VESC project paradise and the blessing of BV that I hope to take it to so that he can test it, touch it or say a few words to the new scooter XD
[2024-12-17T23:48:52] Yamal: 🥲🫡🫵

[2024-12-18T02:47:37] Paolo ⁭: Over current now
[2024-12-18T02:47:55] Paolo ⁭: But one motor only, and has very high resistance
[2024-12-18T02:48:24] Paolo ⁭: It looks like some internal soldering fault, like Mirko motor
[2024-12-18T02:48:36] Paolo ⁭: Is normal with hm motors👎
[2024-12-18T03:50:17] haku: this is NRF BT module yea this can be used for vesc?

[2024-12-18T06:44:08] Yamal: pilot in 7/11
[2024-12-18T06:45:39] Yamal: He has knee protection and a good helmet. You say you're waiting for the new year to assemble the electronics?
[2024-12-18T06:56:55] Yamal: I'm glad to see you here brother, how's that Nami? Don't get away from the group! How are those routes going? How are your friends doing with the ubox 85/150 in the viper? You are fully immersed in good weather!!! On the contrary, we are having the shortest days and the longest nights of the year and it is cold!! xd
[2024-12-18T06:57:55] Yamal: long days, heat, vesc, girls with light clothes, finally summer!!!

[2024-12-18T08:12:03] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): If it's to control your VESC just get a ESPC3 with a small can board ... dump VESC Express on it and be happy. You can go further and make a full VESC Express so you have logging + GPS but not mandatory. Biggest advantage: BT & Wifi connection.
[2024-12-18T09:21:32] haku: we will see
[2024-12-18T09:29:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's not a bomb just kukirin being shit

[2024-12-18T09:36:22] haku: yea im wondering what those drones are. my guess is santa
[2024-12-18T09:39:10] haku: i dont watch world news. all i want to know is when will they release the diddy tapes
[2024-12-18T10:18:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Someone got assassinated by a bomb hidden in electric scooter
[2024-12-18T10:29:27] Finn: If you got a damaged g30 dashboard you can flash it and use it.
[2024-12-18T10:33:14] Yamal: Just listen now
[2024-12-18T10:33:24] Yamal: From Coparner work

[2024-12-18T11:20:42] Yamal: When you back to the e-scooter ,,?
[2024-12-18T11:35:05] Yamal: I'm thinking of a description for the Vesc project paradise channel, I need fun and constructive ideas like: Vesc recipe, enjoy and drive safely or looking for "waly"
[2024-12-18T11:35:11] Yamal: XD
[2024-12-18T11:36:55] Yamal: but I need something current and avant-garde
[2024-12-18T11:38:17] Yamal: I just hope that BV manages to see some of my shorts"" and I can even steal a smile from him, just one...

[2024-12-18T12:00:24] Yamal: More original ask in VESC scooter group ;)
[2024-12-18T12:15:23] Finn: Rescued two broken g30 dash and flashed them. Works like any other nrf chip
[2024-12-18T15:16:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Put it on a escooter and we will see, on Surron, it's only about peak very very short As you know we discussed in private, it's not the only 12fet performing that well :p
[2024-12-18T15:20:05] Patrick: This isnt even the lonnyo website

[2024-12-18T15:25:35] Paolo ⁭: Still better price through me considering shipping 😘
[2024-12-18T15:25:55] Paolo ⁭: But now I'm occasional seller, no more doing for job
[2024-12-18T15:26:17] Yamal: British English: 75h33/2.155mm Alibaba 645$ LY 779$ ;)
[2024-12-18T15:27:08] Paolo ⁭: For 2 unit?
[2024-12-18T15:27:08] Yamal: Out rim OfcourseE

[2024-12-18T15:27:48] Yamal: shipping included
[2024-12-18T15:27:55] Yamal: Tax NOt
[2024-12-18T15:28:24] Yamal: but Alibaba claims to make small invoice for customs carousel
[2024-12-18T15:28:58] Yamal: ❗️‼️‼️‼️‼️❗️‼️❗️
[2024-12-18T15:29:02] Yamal: XD

[2024-12-18T15:32:50] Paolo ⁭: Very bad idea, I shipped several times declaring lower value, and all the time got stopped by custom for check for 2/3 weeks. And finally they applied more tax anyway. I got daily calls and threats from customer in spain
[2024-12-18T15:34:17] Yamal: It worked for some of my friends but I take note cowboy ✍️
[2024-12-18T15:36:25] Paolo ⁭: Yes and I hope will always work. But I don't anymore, because people get angry with me. If Alibaba do this who cares lol
[2024-12-18T15:37:20] Yamal: 12 fet in 500 trampa? What 12 fet esc do you declare that they work well,,?
[2024-12-18T15:38:00] Yamal: Anyway you re far from engine now right ?

[2024-12-18T16:17:55] Yamal: Underneath those red and white chains you can't see the electronics you're wearing xD as the saying goes, "The devil knows more from the old man than from the devil".
[2024-12-18T16:21:31] Yamal: I also wish you better luck next season, because man does not live by beauty alone, because the dance of the walker and the forcefulness of the great foujiguara did not give you a place for a first place! XD always with love and with competition in between.
[2024-12-18T16:21:39] Yamal: Hehehe

[2024-12-18T16:47:16] Finn: Extract it and flash vesc nrf fw on it
[2024-12-18T16:48:45] Yamal: Actually the Nami is doing very well now, it is very explosive but it is far from the figures of the competition scooters so nothing adds up and goes on as the song says,,, stories of a worker xD

[2024-12-18T17:09:56] Simone: Anyone interested in a 22s10p battery? 40T cells, JK 200A bms and custom copper strips. Perfect condition (uses only in sun condition on my e-scooter).
[2024-12-18T17:10:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, many look to our improvements and tests to do the same, we have seen it a lot, so now, I'm sorry but I don't reveal everything

[2024-12-18T17:16:59] Yamal: Italy right ?
[2024-12-18T17:18:12] Yamal: Likewise, rfp is growing and ragechanic has an established name
[2024-12-18T17:22:36] Yamal: By the way, look for someone with big tits who picks up phones and responds to emails! You have to polish this brother ^^'
[2024-12-18T17:23:51] Simone: Yes, I have mounted on my e-scooter with this result...

[2024-12-18T17:27:32] NetworkDir: Sure
[2024-12-18T17:28:53] Yamal: On 11x or Vsset 11
[2024-12-18T17:31:08] Simone: 2× Briesc 100/200
[2024-12-18T17:31:26] Yamal: Bri?
[2024-12-18T17:32:18] Simone: Mix of part from vsett11 and zero11x but with custom made allu box
[2024-12-18T17:32:50] Simone: Esc made by an italian guy. Similar performance of 3shul c350
[2024-12-18T17:33:12] Yamal: I remember now !
[2024-12-18T17:33:28] Yamal: You post before like video opening the box right ?
[2024-12-18T17:33:48] Yamal: Nice !
[2024-12-18T17:34:11] Simone: yes! great memory!
[2024-12-18T17:34:58] Yamal: specifications? I heard that there is a man in Italy who has ridden many types of vesc, and who today wears flippky, could it be ?0
[2024-12-18T17:36:35] Yamal: Don’t know ,,, many people in Italy
[2024-12-18T17:36:56] Simone: I don't think so...Uses only its own esc and now is completing a "heavy" version that is a middle ground between c700 and c1000 but with smaller dimensions
[2024-12-18T17:37:31] Yamal: but it would be nice to know the specifications of that esc and the man who produces them, perhaps he also has an unconditional love for BV
[2024-12-18T17:37:56] Simone: <files/BRIESC_100 (2).pdf>
[2024-12-18T17:38:16] Simone: This is the datasheet

[2024-12-18T17:40:54] Simone: I pushed them up to 210A of battery and 420A of phase each
[2024-12-18T17:40:58] Yamal: 12 fet?
[2024-12-18T17:41:08] Yamal: Pretty nice

[2024-12-18T17:42:42] Paolo ⁭: Research and development , but not worth the time
[2024-12-18T17:44:16] Yamal: Why
[2024-12-18T17:45:16] Paolo ⁭: China company sell vesc for 3 times lower price, you can't compete
[2024-12-18T17:45:38] Yamal: I mean
[2024-12-18T17:46:23] Yamal: I mean if it has quality and is stable and very powerful, why isn't it worth it?
[2024-12-18T17:47:32] Yamal: but it's true, similar to the 3shul, maybe a little more powerful, what kind of fet does it have?
[2024-12-18T17:47:41] Paolo ⁭: Too complicated to assemble
[2024-12-18T17:48:28] Paolo ⁭: And people won't pay the price which it's worth
[2024-12-18T17:49:12] Paolo ⁭: 3 shul is with toll fell, you don't have to do nothing. It's already soldered from pcb factory
[2024-12-18T17:49:53] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_20139@18-12-2024_17-49-53.jpg>
[2024-12-18T17:50:07] Paolo ⁭: @SibClimb test this😘
[2024-12-18T17:58:11] Ofek 🐥: Hi guys, If any of you need "kick start" option on your vesc, I crated a script to disable output under X m/s In the default config its 1 m/s (3.6 kmh), you can change the number for your needs. Use is at your own risk, for me its working well ✌🏼
[2024-12-18T18:26:49] Yamal: Esc custom ?
[2024-12-18T18:27:02] Yamal: 30 fet? Xd
[2024-12-18T18:30:05] haku: what in the big dick vesc is that
[2024-12-18T18:31:05] haku: what is that paoulo?
[2024-12-18T18:41:43] Simone: This is Briesc 100/200 (100v/200a battery)
[2024-12-18T18:42:21] Simone: Is the prototype of the new ESC by Gabriele Russo
[2024-12-18T18:42:54] Simone: Performance in the middle of c700 and c1000
[2024-12-18T18:50:08] haku: you can flash thru vesc. the more you knowledge. thanks
[2024-12-18T18:53:25] Yamal: 🤌
[2024-12-18T18:53:31] Yamal: Dolce gusto
[2024-12-18T18:54:24] haku: there should be a showdown between these big dick vescs. c1000 seven and bresc
[2024-12-18T18:55:10] haku: run it on a qs268 and a 40pl/jp40 batteries
[2024-12-18T18:55:16] Simone: 24fet tool
[2024-12-18T18:56:56] Simone: I haven't tried my c700 yet but I doubt it can go beyond 800A phase... on the briesc prototype 900A have already been tested and it hasn't made a turn!
[2024-12-18T18:58:33] Yamal: The problem is in the engines that support that.
[2024-12-18T18:59:08] Yamal: but it doesn't matter if you set fire to them, we want to see it!
[2024-12-18T18:59:49] haku: qs268 will not burn. even 50h qs273
[2024-12-18T19:00:10] Yamal: I search
[2024-12-18T19:00:37] Yamal: Very big ,,

[2024-12-18T19:01:30] Yamal: 11” better and better xD
[2024-12-18T19:02:08] Simone: For the moment, it's testing it on oil-cooled QS273
[2024-12-18T19:02:29] Yamal: I like e-scooters not e-moto
[2024-12-18T19:02:34] Simone: Drive
[2024-12-18T19:02:37] Yamal: Better to walk 🚶‍♂️
[2024-12-18T19:03:44] Yamal: But some scooter maybe fit ? Like weped sonic?

[2024-12-18T19:11:02] haku: center of balance or whatever its called is just off standing and cornering
[2024-12-18T19:11:27] haku: and wind resistance

[2024-12-18T19:56:10] Finn: Good that i have sensorless there the tracking starts natually at 2-3kmh😂
[2024-12-18T20:07:01] Matthew: I have not opened it. This lonnyo motor i bought I've watched temp sensor religiously, the hottest temp I've hit is 85°c. My vsett 10+ motors did the same. Even on the newest vsett 10 motor i bought i had statorade in it before I ever ran it. I put the new vsett motor onto my scooter after abusing the 1st one I bought. I bought another because I honestly thought I'd damaged the vsett motor i first purchased because of weird play... turns out screws for the motor cover were coming lose. I tightened those screws and just bought another single ubox 85150 since the motor was fine. I ran dual motor for a bit with the vsett motors. One morning omw to work i wasn't even under full throttle and the older ubox shorted out but the slave new ubox was fine. The inline fuse didn't blow either. Thought maybe new motor burned or damaged something. Nope new vsett motor was fine. So disconnected the front motor and hooked up my rear motor to the still functional ubox. The new controller which is being used currently for lonnyo motor is fine. I removed my other vsett motor and just have mantis front rim and lonnyo rear 22x3 winding with statorade in it. Sorry about a long story but that's why I'm so confused
[2024-12-18T20:11:55] haku: agreed. you a baller if you daily a lambo. not very practical vehicle
[2024-12-18T20:14:17] Yamal: Dwalin?
[2024-12-18T20:15:21] Yamal: For me it is a very practical, portable, powerful and fun vehicle.

[2024-12-18T20:42:04] Yamal: Manual public ..
[2024-12-18T20:42:33] haku: they make us pay 50c to air tires here
[2024-12-18T20:49:11] haku: lets meet in the middle. seated with scooter and bike parts. most i can do
[2024-12-18T20:49:28] Yamal: Here you can normally inflate the tires at many gas stations, although there are more and more charges, but it is the first time in my life that I see a public manual like this on the street.
[2024-12-18T20:50:03] Yamal: Minibmx……. Your dream
[2024-12-18T20:50:09] haku: thats great. we need that in US. you can always go to a tire shop and they inflate for free here too

[2024-12-18T20:51:29] haku: or i can just mount it in the old spot just to get it running
[2024-12-18T20:51:51] Yamal: Yes,,, don’t know how will you mount that heatsink to the chassis,,
[2024-12-18T20:52:10] haku: theres a way but requires botching
[2024-12-18T20:52:29] Yamal: Ask happy giraffe he have the solution,,
[2024-12-18T20:53:09] haku: or i can just run it at lower battery amps. but i paid for 250a ill use 250 unless dangerous
[2024-12-18T20:54:11] haku: i made a 12p p42 ill use the whole 12p power
[2024-12-18T20:54:47] Yamal: You need like custom box I think ,,
[2024-12-18T20:54:55] haku: now i can do 22s too 😜
[2024-12-18T20:55:22] haku: it will be all internal. just heatsinks sticking out
[2024-12-18T20:55:31] Yamal: For mount on the frame and carry the heatsink
[2024-12-18T20:55:38] Yamal: Fire
[2024-12-18T20:56:15] haku: need to big brain think on this wepoor if i want to get all the power

[2024-12-18T20:58:11] Yamal: put the photo of Sirum just in case
[2024-12-18T20:59:39] haku: i washed my hands in wokemimd tears and it healed it.
[2024-12-18T20:59:55] haku: i just keep banging it up somehow
[2024-12-18T20:59:58] Yamal: You can also paint two black stripes on both sides of your face with black cloth tape and aviator glasses, like a Rambo remix

[2024-12-19T01:11:54] haku: dam i need to use wepoors nrf for now to get this running.
[2024-12-19T01:14:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He a bit better (at least have a better name)
[2024-12-19T01:18:48] Noname: Do it
[2024-12-19T01:19:11] Noname: Need a test report
[2024-12-19T01:22:57] haku: i will report back soon as its done.
[2024-12-19T01:23:14] Noname: Hurry
[2024-12-19T01:23:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Problem the wheel catching things can't reach the hole
[2024-12-19T01:23:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_20156@19-12-2024_01-23-29.jpg>

[2024-12-19T01:26:26] Paolo ⁭: Dualtron arm need different washer
[2024-12-19T01:26:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ok
[2024-12-19T01:26:49] Paolo ⁭: It's made for hm motor
[2024-12-19T01:27:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But one more problem the phase cable is on the wrong side
[2024-12-19T01:27:25] Paolo ⁭: And I guess these motors are from kaabo
[2024-12-19T01:27:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't have one is that problematic?
[2024-12-19T01:27:35] 'lekrsu': Flip the motor around then
[2024-12-19T01:27:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2024-12-19T01:28:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but the hole for the motor cable is on the other side and no holes for brake adapter on other side
[2024-12-19T01:28:39] Paolo ⁭: Make another hole
[2024-12-19T01:29:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe
[2024-12-19T01:29:09] 'lekrsu': I take it the motor stator isn't symmetrical
[2024-12-19T01:29:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What does that means ?
[2024-12-19T01:29:57] 'lekrsu': As in, same in every dimension
[2024-12-19T01:30:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't know that how do I check that ?
[2024-12-19T01:31:05] 'lekrsu': Well, you know, you look
[2024-12-19T01:31:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Open the motor?
[2024-12-19T01:32:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or can I see that from outside?
[2024-12-19T01:32:45] 'lekrsu': It probably isn't
[2024-12-19T01:33:15] 'lekrsu': Swapped a G30 motor axle around a while back. However never ended up using that setup, broke before completion.
[2024-12-19T01:34:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If it's not then?
[2024-12-19T01:35:30] 'lekrsu': Anyway @PaoloWu I've been meaning to ask, when we're talking windings such as 33x2, 22x3, 17x4. Is that four cables wound in parallel simultaneously, e.g. 17 turns, around each stator pole?
[2024-12-19T01:36:20] 'lekrsu': Well then you can't just flip a stator 180°
[2024-12-19T01:36:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Too much work anyway I'll just make a new hole
[2024-12-19T01:37:06] 'lekrsu': Probably a good idea.
[2024-12-19T01:37:12] haku: how much amps can you run on these bannana plugs? i think 50a should be okay for these yea?
[2024-12-19T01:39:55] 'lekrsu': ;)
[2024-12-19T01:42:33] Paolo ⁭: Contrary
[2024-12-19T01:42:53] Paolo ⁭: 17 parallel 4 turn
[2024-12-19T01:43:12] Paolo ⁭: More turn more torque less speed
[2024-12-19T01:43:22] 'lekrsu': Makes sense, couldn't figure out the resistance with my assumption
[2024-12-19T01:43:40] 'lekrsu': Thanks;)
[2024-12-19T01:43:50] Paolo ⁭: This one is 22x3
[2024-12-19T01:43:58] Paolo ⁭: This
[2024-12-19T01:44:15] 'lekrsu': I've never seen the inside of one 👀
[2024-12-19T01:44:27] Paolo ⁭: I already know
[2024-12-19T01:44:34] Paolo ⁭: Is from wolf warrior
[2024-12-19T01:45:55] 'lekrsu': Nice, the dual stem
[2024-12-19T01:54:52] haku: that has a bigger ballsack area
[2024-12-19T01:59:06] Finn: 50A phase?
[2024-12-19T02:06:27] haku: yea
[2024-12-19T02:06:41] Finn: Yeah
[2024-12-19T02:21:13] haku: just making sure throttle is 3.3v adc1 and ground yea
[2024-12-19T02:27:52] 'lekrsu': ye
[2024-12-19T02:53:36] Noname: Do a wheelie
[2024-12-19T03:05:38] haku: it will not do a wheelie. its low amps
[2024-12-19T03:06:02] Noname: Jump a gorge then
[2024-12-19T03:07:18] Noname: Getting my battery tray made tomorrow. Cut the old one out of moped.
[2024-12-19T03:07:38] haku: nice. you getting welded
[2024-12-19T03:08:08] Noname: I'll weld it at home. Might need a hammer adjustment to the frame
[2024-12-19T03:18:22] Smart Repair: What options are there for using vesc with an esp32-based touchscreen? Does anyone have a link for me?
[2024-12-19T03:23:43] haku: how do i fix this error again. i change voltage.
[2024-12-19T03:23:43] haku: <photos/photo_20161@19-12-2024_03-23-43.jpg>
[2024-12-19T03:34:07] Noname: Cutoff start something like 72v End 65 or so
[2024-12-19T03:34:24] Noname: You have 8 volts lol
[2024-12-19T03:34:29] haku: i put both at 85
[2024-12-19T03:34:44] Noname: No cutout end is 8
[2024-12-19T03:34:53] haku: i changed it to 85 too
[2024-12-19T03:35:02] Noname: That's low voltage shut off
[2024-12-19T03:35:51] haku: oh yea ill put it at 68
[2024-12-19T03:36:00] haku: 65 sorry
[2024-12-19T03:36:24] Noname: Start is when it throttles down End is shut down voltage
[2024-12-19T03:36:42] haku: its still error
[2024-12-19T03:36:48] haku: <photos/photo_20162@19-12-2024_03-36-48.jpg>
[2024-12-19T03:37:01] Noname: Cutoff start 72v
[2024-12-19T03:37:05] Noname: Change that
[2024-12-19T03:38:36] haku: i change to 72. wheres that setting again to put have 85v
[2024-12-19T03:38:51] haku: @jamessoderstrom whats that setting again?
[2024-12-19T03:39:31] Noname: Think it was battery type and then number of cells somewhere
[2024-12-19T03:39:42] Noname: None of my stuff is plugged in rt now
[2024-12-19T03:40:14] haku: thats when you run motor config
[2024-12-19T03:40:36] Noname: No its somewhere.
[2024-12-19T03:40:58] Noname: "Cell count" I think
[2024-12-19T03:41:06] haku: ok ill try that
[2024-12-19T03:41:22] Noname: Don't make me plug my stuff in lol
[2024-12-19T03:41:57] haku: <photos/photo_20163@19-12-2024_03-41-57.jpg>
[2024-12-19T03:42:04] haku: error still
[2024-12-19T03:42:22] Noname: Restart it ?
[2024-12-19T03:42:27] haku: i remember puting max votage at 85v i forgot wich setting it was
[2024-12-19T03:43:14] Noname: You did hit the "write" button to save?
[2024-12-19T03:43:41] haku: yes ofcourse.
[2024-12-19T03:43:56] haku: let me look up search. i asked this before
[2024-12-19T03:47:49] Noname: <photos/photo_20164@19-12-2024_03-47-49.jpg>
[2024-12-19T03:48:23] haku: gotcha thanks
[2024-12-19T03:49:47] haku: there we go.
[2024-12-19T03:49:59] haku: that should be on the voltage tab dammit
[2024-12-19T03:55:48] haku: lawd that resistance is terrible.
[2024-12-19T04:00:09] haku: jetson
[2024-12-19T04:00:44] haku: weak af.
[2024-12-19T04:01:41] haku: something strange on start. maybe phase.
[2024-12-19T04:02:23] Noname: You have it on sensorless
[2024-12-19T04:02:50] haku: wtf. i have sensors. it did not detect
[2024-12-19T04:03:05] Noname: Well change manually
[2024-12-19T04:03:24] haku: ill try
[2024-12-19T04:03:38] Noname: And fix your damn rotor
[2024-12-19T04:04:28] haku: what the shit where is the sensor settings.
[2024-12-19T04:05:14] haku: this
[2024-12-19T04:06:05] haku: it got worse.
[2024-12-19T04:09:51] Noname: Idk. Mabey lower phase amps?
[2024-12-19T04:10:14] haku: ill try
[2024-12-19T04:12:52] haku: nope. ill try another motor detection maybe halls fried
[2024-12-19T04:13:22] Noname: Seems like halls. My vsett kicks and bucks from a dead start
[2024-12-19T04:13:28] haku: ill do it later
[2024-12-19T04:13:45] haku: peak g30 has halls. no problems
[2024-12-19T04:13:48] Noname: Turn wheel very slow to start and see if it clears up.
[2024-12-19T04:13:50] haku: this motor sucks
[2024-12-19T04:14:34] haku: i did 45a
[2024-12-19T04:14:41] haku: 40a
[2024-12-19T04:15:01] Noname: Yeah just turn by hand and hit throttle
[2024-12-19T04:15:09] Noname: See if it stutters.
[2024-12-19T04:15:57] haku: no stutter. its halls
[2024-12-19T04:16:27] haku: i can live with no halls but i have halls so i want to fix it
[2024-12-19T04:16:50] Noname: Ah try and ride it. Just need a tiny push
[2024-12-19T04:17:16] haku: ill ride tommorow. no lights car might hit me
[2024-12-19T04:17:56] Noname: Ok then wheelies and burnouts
[2024-12-19T04:18:21] haku: it will not do those im sure of it. motor pretty lame
[2024-12-19T04:18:38] Noname: Ok drive up rocky mountain pass.
[2024-12-19T04:18:49] Noname: Race a corvette
[2024-12-19T04:18:54] haku: im okay with 30-35mph
[2024-12-19T04:19:05] haku: even no torque
[2024-12-19T04:19:19] Noname: Beat kids at park for pink slips and take their stuff
[2024-12-19T04:19:41] haku: mini bmx peakg30v2 is the dedicated burnout machine
[2024-12-19T04:19:58] Noname: 100a controller, push it to max
[2024-12-19T04:20:17] haku: 80 bat 120 phase is my guess. we will see
[2024-12-19T04:20:36] haku: that should be enough to burnouts a 16x4 motor
[2024-12-19T04:20:43] Noname: Either tire smoke or motor we need carnage
[2024-12-19T04:21:34] haku: wepoor will be next. ill install powerstage after all the jetson stuff is cleared
[2024-12-19T04:22:08] haku: peak g30v2 is the dream though. need to get that running asap too
[2024-12-19T04:22:32] Noname: Ok fine limp penis bike
[2024-12-19T04:22:54] haku: no peakg30v2 hard af
[2024-12-19T04:23:08] Noname: Meant the jetson
[2024-12-19T04:23:25] haku: yea that one is limp
[2024-12-19T04:23:33] haku: no range and power haha
[2024-12-19T04:26:28] haku: i just want to say to folks. yea its 72v boi
[2024-12-19T04:41:56] haku: with this jetson i will be able to join the worlds law abiding group ride. pedal bike takeover 😭 https://www.youtube.com/live/Yt14o2KxLRY?si=oKOJms0ulNZZzEWV
[2024-12-19T04:57:04] Noname: Pedal you have pegs
[2024-12-19T05:00:45] haku: there are some seated scooters welcome.
[2024-12-19T05:01:06] haku: seated laoties
[2024-12-19T05:03:37] haku: see seated laotie. its not just me. i knew there were more of us.
[2024-12-19T05:04:22] haku: the 2 gender seated policy is strong in las vegas boy
[2024-12-19T05:54:52] haku: no thats on the 50h 16x4 laotie motor for peak g30v2
[2024-12-19T05:55:29] haku: ill be usimg old dual 100v v2
[2024-12-19T05:55:46] haku: yea
[2024-12-19T05:56:00] haku: gotcha
[2024-12-19T05:56:08] haku: it will use p42s
[2024-12-19T05:56:52] haku: maybe 4 or 5p 20s. should be good yea
[2024-12-19T05:59:18] Noname: I was busting balls. He says to crank up my moped.
[2024-12-19T05:59:34] haku: do it.
[2024-12-19T05:59:44] haku: you have battery
[2024-12-19T05:59:56] Noname: Can't afford replacement vesc if it go boom
[2024-12-19T06:00:24] haku: powerstage is not bad priced
[2024-12-19T06:00:44] haku: doubt it will go boom. trust and believe
[2024-12-19T06:01:10] haku: only idiots that do front wheel burnouts that lock the rear tire go boom
[2024-12-19T06:01:10] Noname: I'm sure 10 to 12 will be plenty with 70h. I can hold it back now lol
[2024-12-19T06:10:09] haku: will do.
[2024-12-19T06:46:27] Yamal: I thought jetson was the minibmx
[2024-12-19T06:47:08] haku: nono. this is different build
[2024-12-19T06:48:13] haku: mini bmx peak g30v2 is the dream ride. concept all by my own
[2024-12-19T06:49:16] Yamal: Morning
[2024-12-19T06:49:37] haku: good night to me 😂
[2024-12-19T06:51:55] Yamal: Do you ever go around the casinos or look at the same fountain as in Ocean Eleven?
[2024-12-19T06:52:22] Yamal: I ever mean
[2024-12-19T06:52:26] haku: i used to work in those casinos.
[2024-12-19T06:52:44] haku: im tired of it.
[2024-12-19T06:53:36] haku: i met so many celebreties. even the woke prime minister of canada. trudeu
[2024-12-19T06:54:25] Yamal: what celebrities?
[2024-12-19T06:54:31] haku: i even got to work out with mat damon when he was filming one of his bourne movies
[2024-12-19T06:56:42] Yamal: The desert and the Colorado-type canyons call me from Las Vegas, not the casinos
[2024-12-19T06:57:26] haku: same. i like the nature stuff. alot of history here from old prospectors. mining and stuff.
[2024-12-19T06:57:47] haku: when you explore trails you sometimes see abandoned mines
[2024-12-19T06:58:36] haku: hot weather here is just to extreme
[2024-12-19T07:00:22] haku: colorado scenery way more better than vegas. they have actual trees there
[2024-12-19T07:03:54] Yamal: You can save and consider the extreme heat season and go to another country.
[2024-12-19T07:04:26] haku: good idea
[2024-12-19T07:04:59] Yamal: go to hawaii to surf
[2024-12-19T07:05:13] Yamal: I don’t know
[2024-12-19T07:05:27] Yamal: But maybe it’s fun
[2024-12-19T07:05:34] Yamal: Only need money
[2024-12-19T07:05:48] haku: hawaii is still america. maybe a 3rd world country cheaper
[2024-12-19T07:06:05] haku: hawaii is expensive trip
[2024-12-19T07:15:05] Yamal: I don’t know man
[2024-12-19T07:15:15] Yamal: Africa or Asia you like ?
[2024-12-19T07:15:38] Yamal: Or South America,,?
[2024-12-19T07:20:51] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-19T11:34:26] GABE: If I stop smoking weed I can buy everything I need but I don't know if I have the strength to do it
[2024-12-19T11:34:33] GABE: New welder and all
[2024-12-19T11:35:30] GABE: Really considering just saving the Half K to go into the G30 cos these motors are collecting dust hella...
[2024-12-19T11:35:39] GABE: Had enough idk.
[2024-12-19T11:35:57] GABE: For a month that is.
[2024-12-19T11:35:58] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-19T11:51:57] Yamal: Good luck
[2024-12-19T11:52:11] Yamal: VESC luck
[2024-12-19T12:02:46] Yamal: Well done! Ganja makes you lazy, takes away your desire to do things, and you lose instant memory or I don't know how to say it: Replace it with a season of exercise and training.
[2024-12-19T12:06:28] Yamal: I mean that physical exercise will help you let go of
[2024-12-19T12:11:19] JPPL: I do it for 16 years and i agree @jamaludin_algarnati, i dont recommend, meanwhile i dont do drugs or álcool. Its a long topic ;)
[2024-12-19T12:11:47] JPPL: I smoke everyday from the last 16 years, Im 36
[2024-12-19T12:12:25] JPPL: I dont know if the gains were better than the looses
[2024-12-19T12:20:27] Jason: do it
[2024-12-19T12:20:49] Jason: you defo can
[2024-12-19T12:21:30] Marius: lol then go for it
[2024-12-19T12:21:32] Jason: trust yourself
[2024-12-19T12:23:53] Yamal: 15 years old I think xD
[2024-12-19T12:24:27] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-12-19T12:24:45] Jason: <sticker>
[2024-12-19T12:25:05] Jason: bro you look fine damn
[2024-12-19T12:33:51] Yamal: 😂

[2024-12-19T12:34:56] Jason: mess xd
[2024-12-19T12:37:00] GABE: Yeah
[2024-12-19T13:25:30] Yamal: If you don't know it, no one knows it, but having a 6/7 scooter, mostly with a Vesc, is not just anything!
[2024-12-19T13:27:22] Yamal: If I had 7 scooters I would have to be sleeping under a tree, even though my wife is more than 10k kilometers away xD
[2024-12-19T13:28:42] Yamal: The next project is only public here, of course for the moment I will not upload anything to the vesc project paradise channel just in case they call me from the pentagon xD
[2024-12-19T13:30:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Vesc suggestions? @SibClimb
[2024-12-19T13:30:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <animation>
[2024-12-19T15:30:06] Face de Pin Sucé: ?
[2024-12-19T15:33:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What vesc to use on this thunder (72/36 60h wolf motors)
[2024-12-19T15:34:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_20101@17-12-2024_09-04-02.jpg>
[2024-12-19T15:36:30] 'lekrsu': You can run whatever model you want, mostly power requirements that'll limit you
[2024-12-19T15:46:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think maybe just go simple dual 75200pro?
[2024-12-19T15:46:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or g300 and 75200
[2024-12-19T15:47:16] 'lekrsu': Wouldn't get a Flipsky
[2024-12-19T15:47:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I know 2 75200 died on me
[2024-12-19T15:47:37] 'lekrsu': Get a Spintend
[2024-12-19T15:47:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Overpriced
[2024-12-19T15:48:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Here is 2x what website gives (and if I get what models?)
[2024-12-19T15:51:52] Jason: then diy
[2024-12-19T15:53:14] Yamal: G300-makerx -tech?
[2024-12-19T15:54:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2024-12-19T15:54:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sure bro ( I'm not on that level)

[2024-12-19T16:00:05] Jason: having conn for dash&adc so nice
[2024-12-19T16:12:25] Yamal: Powerful but needs a mod to improve its cooldown!
[2024-12-19T16:14:39] Yamal: Introduce yourself to weped and tell them that why they don't mount a vesc base, it would be taking a step into the future with maximum power and elegance
[2024-12-19T16:14:56] Yamal: It's not a joke, seriously.
[2024-12-19T16:15:18] Jason: hmmm i might try to
[2024-12-19T16:15:20] Jason: but idk

[2024-12-19T16:19:07] Yamal: you have to contact the heavy guy from the baggy style videos
[2024-12-19T16:21:27] Face de Pin Sucé: go for Spintend ones
[2024-12-19T16:21:56] 'lekrsu': But doesn't blow up
[2024-12-19T16:22:28] Paolo ⁭: Loool
[2024-12-19T16:22:41] Paolo ⁭: If spintend is overpriced
[2024-12-19T16:23:16] Paolo ⁭: I'm asking if you never bought quality product
[2024-12-19T16:23:29] Paolo ⁭: Because is very cheap compared to the quality
[2024-12-19T16:25:09] Paolo ⁭: There's only fsky and mks cheap, but very shit
[2024-12-19T16:34:32] Face de Pin Sucé: One thumb was forgotten
[2024-12-19T16:36:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Would you pay x2 for one ?
[2024-12-19T16:36:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll use the deck plate
[2024-12-19T16:38:02] Yamal: Also from what people say, the box they come with needs modification, that's what I've heard.
[2024-12-19T16:40:22] Yamal: You need to know well the space you have for electronics and based on that, choose and do it well, it is worth waiting a little and saving to buy quality Vesc.
[2024-12-19T16:45:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Go foc g300 is not better then spintend?
[2024-12-19T17:21:29] Yamal: No I think
[2024-12-19T17:23:04] Yamal: My father do… 🤌🤣
[2024-12-19T17:29:47] GABE: Isn't that the cheapest option.
[2024-12-19T17:45:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not for me I think
[2024-12-19T17:45:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Let's show and example
[2024-12-19T17:49:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Fack the price is 575$ vs 269$ on official website
[2024-12-19T17:49:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like from local distributor
[2024-12-19T17:49:41] haku: good morning ladies, gentlemen, lesbians, gays, bis and trans
[2024-12-19T17:51:11] haku: when g30 finish
[2024-12-19T17:51:23] 'lekrsu': That's the old one, don't get that.
[2024-12-19T17:51:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Here it's 6.50 the day is ending
[2024-12-19T17:51:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That's an example
[2024-12-19T17:51:57] Yamal: Avis 0 ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) RFP R350 (Spinted Improver) based on VESC® project by Benjamin Vedder compatible with VESC® software This product is an improved version of the Spinted, both in terms of hardware and software, developed thanks to the work and investment of RFP-Performance. This controller proved its effectiveness by winning the first E-Trott Racing championship, taking first and second place on Killian's (Miniwalker) and Raphaël's (RFP-Performance) scooters. It also equips Raphaël's monoroue, demonstrating the trust placed in its reliability and robustness. For more than a year, this controller operated on several machines at 400 A phase and up to 260 A battery in 22S (i.e. more than 20 kW per controller), including in demanding conditions on circuit, where temperatures were sometimes high. It has never failed, proving its quality, performance and reliability. Although this controller has a lower specification on paper than the G300 (R500), it benefits from an IMS PCB design, which provides much more efficient cooling. As a result, it achieves higher continuous power and maintains peak current for longer, while withstanding higher DC currents. So don't be fooled by the maximum current advertised in the specification, it doesn't tell the whole story: once the controller heats up, the current will be limited.
[2024-12-19T17:52:32] Yamal: RFP Performance talking about his ubox and also g300
[2024-12-19T17:53:01] 'lekrsu': @shlomda2 Get two of any of the Alu models.
[2024-12-19T17:54:04] Yamal: https://rfp-performance.com/product/esc-rfp-r350/
[2024-12-19T17:58:02] haku: if you happen to live in US and happen to shoot a big pharma CEO you wouldve been a sex symbol lookin like this
[2024-12-19T18:00:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Let me see price difference because the official website doesn't ship to Israel since they opend an official distributor
[2024-12-19T18:00:56] Yamal: CrediBus student
[2024-12-19T18:04:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 550$
[2024-12-19T18:04:50] GABE: Dunno if I quit weed then like immediately on next payment
[2024-12-19T18:06:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 275$
[2024-12-19T18:07:10] GABE: Maybe mp2 can be your saviour
[2024-12-19T18:07:14] GABE: 100 at most for one.
[2024-12-19T18:07:24] GABE: for a kit with everything
[2024-12-19T18:07:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't know that vesc at all
[2024-12-19T18:07:56] 'lekrsu': Where's this is insane cost increase come from?
[2024-12-19T18:08:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Greed
[2024-12-19T18:08:15] 'lekrsu': Are there import fees?
[2024-12-19T18:08:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: At this price I'll go for tronics
[2024-12-19T18:09:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but not that much maybe tax like 30-60$
[2024-12-19T18:09:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe even less
[2024-12-19T18:10:08] GABE: Nah lich
[2024-12-19T18:10:26] GABE: U just build it with the schematic
[2024-12-19T18:11:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How much is it maybe I'll try do that
[2024-12-19T18:11:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also whare selling
[2024-12-19T18:11:23] GABE: I have 2 here for the G30 that I gotta build sometime.
[2024-12-19T18:11:32] GABE: I got 2 for 160 ISH from sombre full kit
[2024-12-19T18:11:35] haku: stop the wokeness. weed is okay aslong as its controllable. just limit it. come to the light my prodigal son
[2024-12-19T18:11:38] GABE: just no busbars.
[2024-12-19T18:13:13] Yamal: Ganja for life say the song
[2024-12-19T18:13:20] Yamal: 😆
[2024-12-19T18:17:34] haku: dont get me wrong weed is okay. it helps sometimes aslong as you are not chasing the high. weed is very expensive here.
[2024-12-19T18:17:49] Yamal: Man
[2024-12-19T18:18:01] haku: i dont personally do it
[2024-12-19T18:18:07] Yamal: You don’t know what it’s smoke gamja o Hashhh
[2024-12-19T18:18:32] Rose: Hey there AdianV, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-19T18:18:51] haku: nono cant handle weed. i get too paranoid
[2024-12-19T18:18:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I just don't understand why spintend did that
[2024-12-19T18:19:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like no body from here is going to buy from u now
[2024-12-19T18:20:04] haku: did what
[2024-12-19T18:23:01] Yamal: When you are young it is not highly recommended to use weed, you are left with zero energy and a young person needs to be productivity in moving and learning things. Modern herbs with very high levels of Thc often give way to psychotic outbreaks, all with measure! But knowing what it is done, we agree that it is also a medicine but it should not be launched lightly.
[2024-12-19T18:23:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Make the Israeli distributor u can only buy from him now and that's are his prices
[2024-12-19T18:23:36] haku: agreed 1000%
[2024-12-19T18:24:07] haku: dam thats insane gouging
[2024-12-19T18:24:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ☝🏻
[2024-12-19T18:24:46] haku: you have to consider import costs shipping and stuff. but doubt it that much
[2024-12-19T18:25:30] haku: tarrifs too
[2024-12-19T18:26:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can import it myself cheaper
[2024-12-19T18:26:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: A lot cheaper
[2024-12-19T18:26:14] haku: yes do that
[2024-12-19T18:28:00] haku: buissness is complicated. most scooter/ebike owners dont do research and just buy on local shops. wich is good. but if you want to get the most get from a distributor
[2024-12-19T18:28:53] haku: its just gambling at that point. you are not sure about warranty and stuff from seller. or scam
[2024-12-19T18:29:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I meant to say before there was Israeli distributor I couldve now no
