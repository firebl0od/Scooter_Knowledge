[2021-12-21T02:06:39] Artem Bulashev: It is weakness is if you bend back and forth many times it it will break
[2021-12-21T02:07:25] Artem Bulashev: But I don’t need to bend it more than once from negative far side of the battery to BMS B-
[2021-12-21T06:52:57] Unknown: No you don't, but my wires are out in the open 😆
[2021-12-21T09:54:39] Dejan Avramovic: Hello everybody. Have a question. Got this minifoc (left on the screenshot) The voltage is a maximum of 60V 12S LIPO. I have a 13 S but no LIPO in my Xiaomi M365 pro and it is fully charged at 54.6V. Does the mini Foc hold up in terms of tension? Thanks for the answer
[2021-12-21T10:12:19] Happy Giraffe: Lipo is same voltage than li-io. I guess they meant 12s is highest safe voltage as the spikes will otherwise go above limit
[2021-12-21T10:47:32] Happy Giraffe: Doesn't your phase wire turn with motor?👀
[2021-12-21T10:52:08] sombre_enfant: No the rotor and wire is fixed by axle
[2021-12-21T10:52:43] Paolo ⁭: go for spintend single😎
[2021-12-21T10:52:51] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but when you steer left and right doesnt it move?
[2021-12-21T10:53:16] Happy Giraffe: Maybe small enough movement not to matter
[2021-12-21T10:53:19] Paolo ⁭: 100a with super compact siz
[2021-12-21T10:55:14] Happy Giraffe: He should, also compact to awd as you can put them on top of each other

[2021-12-21T11:13:46] Dejan Avramovic: 👍
[2021-12-21T11:15:31] Happy Giraffe: This would be fun to have in Xiaomi Pro and Blade awd😂

[2021-12-21T11:32:46] Happy Giraffe: Ferrari priviledge
[2021-12-21T11:44:53] Artem Bulashev: What?
[2021-12-21T11:45:17] Happy Giraffe: Motor turns with fork
[2021-12-21T11:45:27] Artem Bulashev: :)) I’m not using this wire as Phase 😄😄
[2021-12-21T11:45:38] Happy Giraffe: Aah, misunderstood😂
[2021-12-21T11:46:11] Artem Bulashev: I said it is perfect to lay out inside battery between BMS b- and battery negative when it is at the other end of the battery
[2021-12-21T11:49:53] Unknown: If i'm not mistaking lipo is less volt then liion?
[2021-12-21T11:50:58] Unknown: Oh no nvm
[2021-12-21T11:51:02] Unknown: Lifepo is less
[2021-12-21T12:13:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha, secret test event, can't send anything

[2021-12-21T16:26:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: fot those wondering 😉
[2021-12-21T16:43:38] Mirono escooters: Risky. Flipsky 4.2 is 12s max too but Ran 13s fine Ebrake is just the sketchy v spiker
[2021-12-21T16:43:49] Happy Giraffe: Austria based company, not bad value🤔 4000€ traditional e-scooter vs rion
[2021-12-21T16:43:51] Happy Giraffe: https://www.rideapart.com/news/555641/horwin-sk3-electric-scooter-launch/
[2021-12-21T17:39:12] Artem Bulashev: Some guys asked a good question, hall is not supposed to output such low voltage
[2021-12-21T17:41:10] Artem Bulashev: Should be 0.86v-4.21v at 5v supply And definitely not supposed to be same 200mv on both, or we misinterpreted the graph?
[2021-12-21T17:41:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and "VCC = 5V" in the title of your picture
[2021-12-21T17:42:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and "operating" doesn't mean optimal
[2021-12-21T17:42:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it was not millivolts but raw datas from ADC
[2021-12-21T17:53:45] Artem Bulashev: So what is 200? Because I though ADC raw data is voltage 🤷‍♂️
[2021-12-21T18:00:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: voltage in adc scale (8/10/12 bits). don't remember the scale, but we don't care. what matter is the difference between both measurements.
[2021-12-21T18:00:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but if you don't trust my measurements, test yourself 😁
[2021-12-21T18:07:48] Artem Bulashev: I trust
[2021-12-21T18:08:14] Artem Bulashev: Some guys dissected it and asked questions why this and that :)
[2021-12-21T18:08:47] Artem Bulashev: Russians are skeptical by nature 😄😄 I guess it’s better than being gullible lol
[2021-12-21T18:09:23] Artem Bulashev: Another guy had same problem and now we discover he had same ss49e hall
[2021-12-21T18:18:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think i made the test with a minimotors throttle (49e if i remember correctly)
[2021-12-21T18:50:15] Artem Bulashev: Some one of the guys concluded that adc readings are so because it repeats after your 3.3v source / converter , which is much worse than 5v stab. Any hall would do the same
[2021-12-21T18:50:32] Artem Bulashev: Just sharing his conclusion :)
[2021-12-22T12:42:38] Paolo ⁭: <files/75_100-300A.bin>

[2021-12-22T13:23:34] Mirono escooters: It handles?
[2021-12-22T13:24:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @SibClimb push 2x250A phase with active cooling if i remeber correctly
[2021-12-22T13:25:09] Mirono escooters: On spintend single?
[2021-12-22T13:25:10] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-12-22T13:27:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: dual
[2021-12-22T13:27:44] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2021-12-22T13:27:48] Mirono escooters: Wonder what single can
[2021-12-22T13:32:02] Paolo ⁭: this is only the hw limit, user can set in vesc tool. they removes only the limit
[2021-12-22T13:32:55] Paolo ⁭: Put the vesc in front and not cooling problem😂😂
[2021-12-22T14:39:55] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2021-12-22T14:43:10] Luis Magalhaes: Does that works on cooling? 😂
[2021-12-22T14:46:50] Happy Giraffe: That looks so sick😂
[2021-12-22T14:47:31] Mirono escooters: I want a radiator in front and waterpump

[2021-12-22T14:54:17] Luis Magalhaes: Ok, i was thinking of doing something like that but a closed box because of the water, but had to modify the cables to put longer ones
[2021-12-22T14:54:25] Paolo ⁭: Fuck 🖕
[2021-12-22T14:54:45] Paolo ⁭: I never use with water

[2021-12-22T14:56:38] Luis Magalhaes: I try not to use it too, but some times i can't predict it well so its better to have it protected 😂, in your case it has more air flow
[2021-12-22T14:57:07] Luis Magalhaes: Yes not for rain indeed 😜
[2021-12-22T14:58:22] Luis Magalhaes: Do you have any video pushing it some more ? The temperature was rising, it stop rising at what temperature?

[2021-12-22T15:21:49] Happy Giraffe: What motor is that?
[2021-12-22T15:22:16] Happy Giraffe: Drilled holes😅
[2021-12-22T15:23:10] Paolo ⁭: i ordered directly by factory, is a high torque motor no high speed

[2021-12-22T18:41:06] Paolo ⁭: Only front motor bro
[2021-12-22T18:41:30] Paolo ⁭: Cannot push too much front because bad friction
[2021-12-22T18:41:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Okay
[2021-12-22T18:41:45] Paolo ⁭: Still need know how enable can forward on this app
[2021-12-22T18:42:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Would be cool to see a log with both controllers

[2021-12-22T18:49:46] Happy Giraffe: 120A phase or nothing
[2021-12-22T18:49:58] Face de Pin Sucé: 250* or nothing
[2021-12-22T18:50:00] Happy Giraffe: Eat more candy for grip
[2021-12-22T18:50:15] Artem Bulashev: Man I’m scared of front wheel even with current 85a
[2021-12-22T18:50:24] Happy Giraffe: I want 150A👀
[2021-12-22T18:50:29] Artem Bulashev: It slips out if you not careful in turn
[2021-12-22T18:50:39] Mirono escooters: Rwd gang
[2021-12-22T18:50:48] Happy Giraffe: Will try 80A batt / 130A phase with single ubox bit later
[2021-12-22T18:50:56] Artem Bulashev: AWD is soooo much better :)
[2021-12-22T18:51:30] Mirono escooters: Got that too
[2021-12-22T18:51:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Come on, it's less than power in stock Dualtron Thunder x)
[2021-12-22T18:51:37] Artem Bulashev: On rear no problem but it will be slower acceleration than 2 motor 80/30a :-)
[2021-12-22T18:51:50] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2021-12-22T18:52:20] Artem Bulashev: My wheel is very low kv + 8.5 inch is smaller and easier to spin, tires are 3incg white but Touvt nylon … not very grippy
[2021-12-22T18:52:23] Happy Giraffe: Fuck I do 120A phase front with Xiaomi frame on frozen road😂
[2021-12-22T18:52:24] Paolo ⁭: Use my firmware
[2021-12-22T18:52:32] Happy Giraffe: Maybe Im just pussy
[2021-12-22T18:52:44] Happy Giraffe: Dont have dual
[2021-12-22T18:52:46] Luis Magalhaes: true just have to controll better the power 😂
[2021-12-22T18:53:03] Paolo ⁭: It is for single ubox
[2021-12-22T18:53:10] Happy Giraffe: 👀
[2021-12-22T18:53:30] Artem Bulashev: I have no need :) with dual motor acceleration is soooo good that you don’t need that much on front wheel ✅
[2021-12-22T18:53:40] Luis Magalhaes: and more progressive to the throtlle controll
[2021-12-22T18:54:06] Happy Giraffe: Rear motor wont fit on narrow Xiaomi frame😭
[2021-12-22T18:54:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Use semi offroad tyre version, they are soooooo less slippery than road version, especially while cornering
[2021-12-22T18:54:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-12-22T18:54:22] Luis Magalhaes: mine is not, even with some wheel spin is faster, but i dont have low kv motor
[2021-12-22T18:54:40] Luis Magalhaes: crazy spiin 🤣
[2021-12-22T18:54:48] Happy Giraffe: Thanks
[2021-12-22T18:56:09] Artem Bulashev: I can but my wife drive kid to kindergarten on it. I can’t have it be too snappy. Also remember I’m at 650w nominal motors soo… they can take more, but again don’t need as dual set up is soooo good Dual 85a phase 30a battery is better than single 170a phase 60a 😊😊
[2021-12-22T18:56:29] Luis Magalhaes: i was soo disappointed on vesc aceleration when using same specs as minimotors 🤣 now im happy
[2021-12-22T18:56:43] Artem Bulashev: It spins if you give it full even at 20kmh in dry underground garage 🤣🤷‍♂️
[2021-12-22T18:57:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Not a real excuse :p use a profile for your wife with 50% power :p
[2021-12-22T18:57:07] Artem Bulashev: Yeah, same, dual motor solved it haha
[2021-12-22T18:57:18] Happy Giraffe: Throttle ramp up time is set to super slow as stock
[2021-12-22T18:57:34] Luis Magalhaes: yes mine do the same hehe, only on a good road i can get less wheel spin at start
[2021-12-22T18:57:41] Artem Bulashev: I have, but defult profile when remote controller turns on is High
[2021-12-22T18:57:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Need to put 0.05s for Ramping Time to have decent throttle response
[2021-12-22T18:57:53] Artem Bulashev: So she need to manually switch to Low
[2021-12-22T18:58:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Then do the inverse x)
[2021-12-22T18:58:11] Happy Giraffe: Dont make me get extra wide rear fork welded to my xiaomi with your awd bs. 5500w awd xiaomi would kill me😂
[2021-12-22T18:58:13] Artem Bulashev: So true! And filter reduce from 15%!
[2021-12-22T18:58:24] Luis Magalhaes: yes it was, and i dont use halls too i think its worse in that case for aceleration
[2021-12-22T18:58:39] Artem Bulashev: They are not controllable / configurable in remote controller
[2021-12-22T18:58:53] Happy Giraffe: Thanks, I will do all these for it
[2021-12-22T18:59:04] Happy Giraffe: Easier to ride with cars then🤪

[2021-12-24T09:48:29] Face de Pin Sucé: But have another friend with this : https://youtu.be/VCvH_Gem0R8
[2021-12-24T09:48:43] Face de Pin Sucé: 6.98s (speed version we made, not torque version)
[2021-12-24T09:48:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am not talking about your friends mate

[2021-12-24T09:52:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Non should buy
[2021-12-24T09:53:27] Face de Pin Sucé: I never paied a Weped it's full price
[2021-12-24T09:53:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Always direct to importer with friendly price
[2021-12-24T09:54:03] Face de Pin Sucé: But I agree with you, tons of factory errors on those ones
[2021-12-24T09:54:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you smart and have to luck of an insider
[2021-12-24T09:54:23] Mirono escooters: I rather build myself instead of prebuild
[2021-12-24T09:54:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Imagine muggle ppl buying it
[2021-12-24T09:54:46] Face de Pin Sucé: That's why we prepare, amazing frame when problems solved
[2021-12-24T09:55:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: To be honest
[2021-12-24T09:55:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I basically would say that all bodies are made shit
[2021-12-24T09:55:30] Face de Pin Sucé: When I used to sell ones, I completely fix problems before selling, so I could warranty for 2 years without issues
[2021-12-24T09:55:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, not okay, Weped frame is great, problems are assembly, but very strong
[2021-12-24T09:56:04] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1732@24-12-2021_09-56-04.jpg>
[2021-12-24T09:56:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Can compare 0-50 if you prefer 😁😜
[2021-12-24T09:56:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But in this way ,its not weped ,the only good thing is basically in it you fixing it
[2021-12-24T09:56:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, because of Numo (this weped serie were made by Numo)
[2021-12-24T09:57:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ok🤔
[2021-12-24T09:57:12] Mirono escooters: Yea ok no way i will be even close
[2021-12-24T09:57:23] Face de Pin Sucé: But looking at Fold like FF/FS, no frame problem or wire at all, can sell directly without fixing anything
[2021-12-24T09:57:30] Face de Pin Sucé: 😁
[2021-12-24T09:57:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So you make there scooters work good and better
[2021-12-24T09:58:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What battery is in that?
[2021-12-24T09:58:58] Face de Pin Sucé: It's a shame Numo did bad assembly, because SS is good frame and GTS is fucking amazing frame, shorter, incredibly stable (already took off hands from handlebar at 120Kmh) and cornering is dementia
[2021-12-24T09:58:58] Artem Bulashev: Dammm
[2021-12-24T09:59:02] Artem Bulashev: Faster than my car

[2021-12-24T09:59:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Molicel version does 5.3s 0-100 with shinko tyres but can't find the screenshot :(
[2021-12-24T09:59:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Only good thing i like in these big frames ,thats it fits bigger packs
[2021-12-24T10:00:10] Face de Pin Sucé: Can up to 21S11P
[2021-12-24T10:00:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But as i said would never buy ,just because of the look
[2021-12-24T10:00:49] Face de Pin Sucé: I made 21S11P Molicel for one, receiving his scooter soon to install nucular 24F and my big motors
[2021-12-24T10:00:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have bigger also ,not a small naci
[2021-12-24T10:01:26] Face de Pin Sucé: I was saying exactly the same, but in the end, don't really care of look 😁
[2021-12-24T10:02:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But basically i dont like any frames all look dumb and mainly they dont really know what they want at the end of the day
[2021-12-24T10:02:54] Artem Bulashev: Vsett10+ firs 20s9p inside deck if controllers moved to the neck. (21700)

[2021-12-24T10:04:03] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1733@24-12-2021_10-04-03.jpg>
[2021-12-24T10:04:07] Face de Pin Sucé: What about those ones ?
[2021-12-24T10:05:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Still not style ,these more like asphalt I am all terrain fella
[2021-12-24T10:05:43] Face de Pin Sucé: What about vsett11+ (regardless the colours)
[2021-12-24T10:05:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I ride lot in Forests in dark
[2021-12-24T10:06:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's other type of adrenalin ,if you did dh before
[2021-12-24T10:06:27] Artem Bulashev: Bigger deck, motors without hall though and original are basic squarewave and not sine wave modulated
[2021-12-24T10:07:05] Artem Bulashev: Not sure how much would fit inside 11+ didn’t build a battery for it yet
[2021-12-24T10:07:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Body style bit better ,but i dont like neck solution
[2021-12-24T10:07:13] Face de Pin Sucé: Only speak about the frame
[2021-12-24T10:07:34] Artem Bulashev: For 9 and 10 I did so can tell Frame of 10+ is best on the market, no one mamamged to break the neck or stem, not single case There were 2 cases where people broke rear shock mount but vsett issued release of public statement - they have redesigned that part already 6 month ago and new design doesn’t have that potential problem any more
[2021-12-24T10:07:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brb ,have to do some Christmas magic
[2021-12-24T10:08:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: See

[2021-12-24T10:08:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He says best on the market
[2021-12-24T10:08:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Hate the handlebar x)
[2021-12-24T10:08:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz market is shit
[2021-12-24T10:09:19] Artem Bulashev: Easy 30€ fix 👌
[2021-12-24T10:09:38] Face de Pin Sucé: And column is too damn tall
[2021-12-24T10:09:38] Artem Bulashev: They get loose yeah
[2021-12-24T10:09:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Can't understand why they keep making taller and taller column
[2021-12-24T10:10:16] Artem Bulashev: I would disagree there, stem hight seems right to me I’m 180cm
[2021-12-24T10:10:32] Face de Pin Sucé: It's not meant to ride, it's for people who drive at 30Kmh
[2021-12-24T10:10:51] Face de Pin Sucé: If you want to corner hard and control better your scooter, need a small column
[2021-12-24T10:11:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Need to push on the column down to control better and apply force on front wheel or it will sleep if you take too much angle
[2021-12-24T10:12:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like if any would take time to design smart out better would be a win like , there are already things done like Forget stupid ball Bearings not good for us if there is any hits jumps etc Skf best dies out same time than a middle category coz non made for that move Front suspension ,should Be like on bikes Brake's pocket bike

[2021-12-24T13:02:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cool👌🙌 Erase kaboo sing ,coz its better than that now
[2021-12-24T13:23:52] Luis Magalhaes: If you dont use it you dont break it 😂😂
[2021-12-24T13:32:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know something that would solve it
[2021-12-24T13:33:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Replace user and press any key to continue
[2021-12-24T13:37:35] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂 true, i had a m365 done 1500km with it and only broke the lock on the stering colum, replaced with a better fatter one and no more problems

[2021-12-24T14:25:04] Luis Magalhaes: Yap, normaly its run until it break 😂 then change broken parts and heal the body 😂😂😂
[2021-12-24T14:36:24] Happy Giraffe: 4500km here and no issues, only brakes are shit
[2021-12-24T14:36:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dunno why ppl do this, for me its normal to look after your stuff that u use, but this also comes from dh ,coz if you actively do it, u change frame / year Frame gets full off micro cracks , does jumps and dirt,forest stone roads not for free
[2021-12-24T14:37:20] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2021-12-24T14:37:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Another score for xiaomi🤣😄👌
[2021-12-24T14:38:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its an entering drug😁
[2021-12-24T14:39:41] Luis Magalhaes: I have done 1500km xiaomi, 2300km ubgo 1005 and now im near 10000km at kaabo wolf, did not had any big problem in any scooter, and did not break frames or any thing like that, but i try not to do bad use of it 😂
[2021-12-24T14:40:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If your were doing skateboard its easy
[2021-12-24T14:40:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its kinda like old matrix spoon thingy
[2021-12-24T14:40:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is no spoon
[2021-12-24T14:41:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So there is no handlebar
[2021-12-24T14:42:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In that moment u start to use handlebar to turn only and put zero forces on ,turns longlife
[2021-12-24T14:43:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: However there are shitbuilds , unlucky to get one , I use to joke on this ,like non better than errors right out from the box
[2021-12-24T16:08:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Had V1 version, first in France, broke front suspension screw, have been lucky, then upgraded this screw to m8 (original m5) Upgraded the whole scooter to 24S, worked well until I burnt half of the battery 😂
[2021-12-24T17:03:13] Luis Magalhaes: Hot story 😂😂😂
[2021-12-24T17:23:06] Face de Pin Sucé: X)

[2021-12-24T22:52:53] Mirono escooters: I have a excuse. It was discount+10% extra from seller themseof
[2021-12-24T22:52:56] Mirono escooters: 😁
[2021-12-24T23:03:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 32e for a ble module ????? WTF !!!!
[2021-12-24T23:03:14] Mirono escooters: (i know)
[2021-12-24T23:03:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it costs 3/4e !
[2021-12-24T23:03:21] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2021-12-24T23:03:32] Mirono escooters: Guess they make money on that
[2021-12-24T23:03:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sure !
[2021-12-24T23:04:04] Mirono escooters: O Well still cheap
[2021-12-24T23:12:35] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-12-24T23:13:17] Mirono escooters: I want/need bluetooth. No way Im using pc everytime
[2021-12-24T23:15:34] Luis Magalhaes: I agree 👌
[2021-12-24T23:15:59] Mirono escooters: In few weeks you all Will know how much it sucks or is good
[2021-12-24T23:16:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: really curious about this one. we'll see !
[2021-12-24T23:19:50] Mirono escooters: Lol me too
[2021-12-24T23:20:14] Mirono escooters: Hope it's Well. Will bolt it to frame for Optimal cooling Problably 20s Maybe 15s/16s

[2021-12-24T23:38:18] Paolo ⁭: 😂😂😂
[2021-12-24T23:50:15] Mirono escooters: How to hook up tho
[2021-12-24T23:55:31] Paolo ⁭: Using swdio prog in vesc tool

[2021-12-25T03:44:33] Daniel Cadete: Hi, what do you guys use as kill switch for flipsky 75100?
[2021-12-25T10:06:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: either you use a key loop made with xt90s, either you buy an anti-spark switch (but cost 30-100€, lol)
[2021-12-25T12:26:04] Daniel Cadete: The anti spark are most of them for 13s, what do you want to say with key loop?
[2021-12-25T14:08:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://forum.esk8.news/t/how-to-make-a-xt90-loop-key/17664
[2021-12-25T14:08:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/rc-ev-accessories/electronics/alien-antispark-power-switch-3-16s-300amp-max/
[2021-12-25T14:09:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://forum.esk8.news/t/current-anti-spark-switch-options/32204
[2021-12-25T14:10:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but yes. it's a pain. personally, i wouldn't pick any vesc without integrated power switch now. or you need a bms with power button
[2021-12-25T14:12:46] Mirono escooters: That price 😲
[2021-12-25T14:13:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah. it costs a lot.
[2021-12-25T14:13:17] Mirono escooters: Thé only thing i hate flipsky for.. no on off button Just a money making scheme to buy antispark
[2021-12-25T14:13:28] Mirono escooters: Mine died after 3 months now constantly on
[2021-12-25T14:13:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this should be a main critera when choosing a vesc
[2021-12-25T14:13:37] Mirono escooters: I know ._.
[2021-12-25T14:13:54] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth bms for thé win
[2021-12-25T14:13:57] Mirono escooters: Or a breaker. Xd
[2021-12-25T14:14:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but even that, i consider it a pain. need power on smartphone, unlock, launch app, click button... 🤢🤮
[2021-12-25T14:21:27] Mirono escooters: I know ./
[2021-12-25T14:21:39] Mirono escooters: And a on off button is so simple. But it's about money
[2021-12-25T14:22:03] Mirono escooters: So a simple breaker Will work and look cool .lol
[2021-12-25T14:22:34] Mirono escooters: :)
[2021-12-25T14:23:17] Mirono escooters: I Will find something, in worst case i have to do a trace cut 😁
[2021-12-25T14:32:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: complicated for a clean install, but yes.
[2021-12-25T14:34:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. all internal vesc power stage have a 'enable' pin (tps, lm, sy...). it would have been so easy to put a switch/plug on that pin (without high current). a simple latching switch does the job.
[2021-12-25T14:34:39] Mirono escooters: I take thé challenge
[2021-12-25T14:34:50] Mirono escooters: I think i Will just do a trace cut :)
[2021-12-25T14:34:58] Mirono escooters: Cant be hard. Done on Xiaomi too
[2021-12-25T14:40:51] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_1750@25-12-2021_14-40-51.jpg>
[2021-12-25T14:40:57] Mirono escooters: 2 for thé price of 1. Wow
[2021-12-25T14:52:47] Daniel Cadete: Thanks a lot
[2021-12-25T15:12:06] Mirono escooters: Ill just make this. Looks so Nice and easy lol
[2021-12-25T15:12:12] Mirono escooters: And it's kinda a key
[2021-12-25T15:21:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. just use XTxxS to avoid sparks (and destroying the connector each time you insert it)
[2021-12-25T15:21:30] Mirono escooters: Flipsky doesnt have so much caps
[2021-12-25T15:21:47] Mirono escooters: We Will see, antispark for 20s price is deadly 🤣
[2021-12-25T15:23:36] Paolo ⁭: Why destroy?🙁 still work after 1 year with same connector
[2021-12-25T15:25:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it loads the capacitors each time you plug it. it draws a lot of current... and make a spark when both connectors are almost touching.
[2021-12-25T15:25:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it ends like this
[2021-12-25T15:25:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1751@25-12-2021_15-25-32.jpg>
[2021-12-25T15:25:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: dead...
[2021-12-25T15:26:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: or this
[2021-12-25T15:26:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1752@25-12-2021_15-26-02.jpg>
[2021-12-25T15:26:07] Paolo ⁭: With xt90s?
[2021-12-25T15:26:15] Paolo ⁭: So stranger …
[2021-12-25T15:27:03] Paolo ⁭: This not is xt90s
[2021-12-25T15:32:58] Mirono escooters: Ill go xt90s
[2021-12-25T15:42:54] Happy Giraffe: Is it genuine Amass?👀
[2021-12-25T16:01:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: s is for anti-spark. there is a resistor integrated to avoid sparks
[2021-12-25T16:08:25] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: XT90S is not solution for Short Circuit problem or also for connect 20S without Arc, the Resistor is too low for 20S with relativly high Cap capacity
[2021-12-25T16:09:08] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: for it it need too have précharge Adapter, to préload the Cap before plug direcly
[2021-12-25T16:18:35] Paolo ⁭: Now you edited message is ok😂 before you tell antispark connector will destroy
[2021-12-25T16:18:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahaha. lol . ok 😅
[2021-12-25T16:19:09] Paolo ⁭: I’ve QS8 connector
[2021-12-25T16:19:17] Paolo ⁭: Is perfect with 5.1 ohm resistance
[2021-12-25T17:34:38] Mirono escooters: Field weakening on vesc het?
[2021-12-25T17:34:39] Mirono escooters: Yet*
[2021-12-25T17:43:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. firmware version 5.3 (and even 5.2 if i understand correctly)
[2021-12-25T17:46:12] Mirono escooters: Where? Cant fidn
[2021-12-25T17:56:19] Paolo ⁭: I prefer higher voltage than this risk😂
[2021-12-25T17:56:28] Mirono escooters: Fair
[2021-12-25T17:56:31] Mirono escooters: Im at 20s lol
[2021-12-25T17:56:47] Unknown: Can't you just place trampa power button?
[2021-12-25T17:56:54] Unknown: It's designed good
[2021-12-25T17:57:01] Paolo ⁭: With 20s dual and good motor you can run 120km/h
[2021-12-25T17:57:11] Paolo ⁭: Still not sufficient?
[2021-12-25T18:00:07] Mirono escooters: No theres no on off button port on flipsky Just so they can sell antispark.
[2021-12-25T18:00:18] Mirono escooters: Im not even gonna do that
[2021-12-25T18:00:23] Mirono escooters: Low kv rear motor
[2021-12-25T18:00:35] Mirono escooters: Just when i wanna fuck around or don't need good range and long Road 😛😛
[2021-12-25T18:20:35] Gigolo Joe: Hello everyone, has anyone been running the new vesc 75100? I have been playing with it for lil over a week now. Is there any option to turn field weakening on it?
[2021-12-25T18:20:47] Mirono escooters: Me soon
[2021-12-25T18:27:46] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-12-25T18:29:24] Luis Magalhaes: Of vesc tools?
[2021-12-25T18:45:45] Luis Magalhaes: Oh its for the vesc itself, if i understand it has 2 firmware's on the vesc is it this?
[2021-12-25T18:46:32] Luis Magalhaes: I have flashed the 75300 firmware this 5.03 is not for the same thing right 😂
[2021-12-25T18:46:59] Luis Magalhaes: Sorry for the stupid questions trying to learn 😂
[2021-12-25T18:48:28] Gigolo Joe: So far I'm stuck with top speed of 57kmh because it doesn't have field weakening
[2021-12-25T18:48:44] Gigolo Joe: 16s11p battery
[2021-12-25T18:49:33] Mirono escooters: Go 20s 🤤
[2021-12-25T18:49:49] Gigolo Joe: 2rich4me
[2021-12-25T18:49:56] Mirono escooters: Fair
[2021-12-25T18:51:03] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1753@25-12-2021_18-51-03.jpg>
[2021-12-25T18:51:35] Luis Magalhaes: Hw is what i flashed 😂
[2021-12-25T18:52:05] Mirono escooters: Flipsky locked theirs im afraid
[2021-12-25T18:52:53] Gigolo Joe: I know it can be restored if you connect to the board via stlink
[2021-12-25T18:53:23] Gigolo Joe: <photos/photo_1754@25-12-2021_18-53-23.jpg>
[2021-12-25T18:54:05] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2021-12-25T18:55:53] Luis Magalhaes: @koxx3 can you explain me about the Fw ? 😂 Is it from vesc tools or has to be flashed on vesc?
[2021-12-25T19:06:42] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1755@25-12-2021_19-06-42.jpg>
[2021-12-25T19:07:11] Luis Magalhaes: Forget that😜
[2021-12-25T19:08:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if i read correctly flisky 75100 firmware cannot be updated.
[2021-12-25T19:08:25] Mirono escooters: :(
[2021-12-25T19:08:59] Luis Magalhaes: Ubox here, but yes was reading about that, flipsky wont even show the fw version 😅
[2021-12-25T19:13:11] Gigolo Joe: That's what i read too. I wonder how they blocked that option 🤔
[2021-12-25T19:16:18] Luis Magalhaes: Maybe with stlink it ahould work or not?
[2021-12-25T19:16:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not sure they blocked anything, but the standard vesc firmware may be been deeply modified, and if you flash any stock firmware, it won't work. and since flipsky never published any customization they made to official firmware (against vesc gpl rules), it's dead.
[2021-12-25T19:16:53] Luis Magalhaes: 😅 oh shit
[2021-12-25T19:17:18] Luis Magalhaes: Flipsky on it best
[2021-12-25T19:17:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah... welcome to flipsky world 😰
[2021-12-25T19:17:26] Gigolo Joe: 😢😒
[2021-12-25T19:18:03] Gigolo Joe: So no field weakening for now for the 75100 eh?
[2021-12-25T19:18:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: depends which firmware is based on
[2021-12-25T19:18:42] Mirono escooters: We could ask em, they are usually helpful
[2021-12-25T19:19:19] Luis Magalhaes: So its is risky to change the fw there it could not work and then you don't have the "stock flipsky fw" to flash it again
[2021-12-25T19:19:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with stlink, you can dump it normally
[2021-12-25T19:20:09] Gigolo Joe: <photos/photo_1756@25-12-2021_19-20-09.jpg>
[2021-12-25T19:20:21] Gigolo Joe: Flipsky states it's 5.2
[2021-12-25T19:21:03] Luis Magalhaes: And firmware upload not available 😂
[2021-12-25T19:21:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: field weakening normally require 5.3
[2021-12-25T19:21:25] Luis Magalhaes: 5.03 right?
[2021-12-25T19:21:37] Gigolo Joe: Car manufacturers say that too but people still find ways
[2021-12-25T19:21:48] Luis Magalhaes: Strange way to name it after the oficial 5.2 😂
[2021-12-25T19:22:20] Luis Magalhaes: True its a risk i think 😁
[2021-12-25T19:22:40] Luis Magalhaes: But if it works it would be fun
[2021-12-25T19:24:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2021-12-25T19:25:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: of course, it always possible. even iphone can be hacked. but it depends how much users have it and want to spend time to hack.
[2021-12-25T19:25:43] Luis Magalhaes: I have to install the test version of the vesc tools and then i would be able to update the fw is it this way?
[2021-12-25T19:26:23] Gigolo Joe: With field weakening it can be a game changer
[2021-12-25T19:26:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 5.3 is beta, you need to download bin from vesc forum or build it yourself
[2021-12-25T19:26:37] Gigolo Joe: Small, powerful and cheap
[2021-12-25T19:28:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if it really works, respect the specs and keep working after 1 month, yes. 😁
[2021-12-25T19:28:21] Mirono escooters: Will see
[2021-12-25T19:30:18] Luis Magalhaes: http://home.vedder.se/tmp2/vesc_tool_test_2021-12-14_v2.zip this one?

[2021-12-25T19:41:32] Gigolo Joe: Yeah that's fucked up, it was my reaction also when i opened mine
[2021-12-25T19:41:55] Gigolo Joe: As if they used wrong size housing for it
[2021-12-25T19:42:32] Mirono escooters: Bad argument. it's isolated
[2021-12-25T19:42:48] Mirono escooters: I think i Will open mine to secure caaps
[2021-12-25T19:42:50] Gigolo Joe: Soldering job is not THAT BAD Seen much worse
[2021-12-25T19:42:56] Gigolo Joe: <photos/photo_1766@25-12-2021_19-42-56.jpg>
[2021-12-25T19:43:25] sombre_enfant: Change the current shunt
[2021-12-25T19:43:39] Gigolo Joe: Couple dabs of all purpose sealant and you're good to go
[2021-12-25T19:43:54] Mirono escooters: Haha yep. Spintend had so bad soldering balls we have to clean up ourselves
[2021-12-25T19:43:58] Mirono escooters: Y
[2021-12-25T19:44:04] Mirono escooters: Yep easy thing to do
[2021-12-25T19:44:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also true !
[2021-12-25T19:44:20] Mirono escooters: Wich i find fucked for such expensive piece of tech
[2021-12-25T19:44:44] Mirono escooters: My vesc works out of box (4.2, cheap but good. Got loads of hate but it's going in another scoot still working)

[2021-12-25T19:55:09] Mirono escooters: 2 comm ports! Hoerai
[2021-12-25T19:55:13] Mirono escooters: Can use my display
[2021-12-25T20:03:59] Gigolo Joe: So far it pretty much does what they promised
[2021-12-25T20:05:31] Gigolo Joe: It has it's downsides, which most of them can be fixed with some tinkering. Biggest downside for me (for now) it's the fact it doesn't have field weakening
[2021-12-25T20:07:06] Happy Giraffe: Heatsink useless when heat source blocked by kapton tape😂
[2021-12-25T20:09:00] Happy Giraffe: These are solder balls?
[2021-12-25T20:10:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: surely
[2021-12-25T20:10:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: swd pins
[2021-12-25T20:10:31] Gigolo Joe: The right one is remainings of thermal paste
[2021-12-25T20:10:41] Paolo ⁭: Only single shunt for 100Amps?
[2021-12-25T20:11:05] Happy Giraffe: Chinese soldering = Solder ball bukkake
[2021-12-25T20:11:19] Gigolo Joe: 😂😂😂😂😂
[2021-12-25T20:11:24] Happy Giraffe: I counted 3-4 last time I had to remove with Spintend

[2021-12-25T20:28:43] Paolo ⁭: You need two
[2021-12-25T20:30:02] zekoslav mrkva: I know, but people said that is not good for Vsett 10, why
[2021-12-25T20:30:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: finally some interesting tests
[2021-12-25T20:30:52] zekoslav mrkva: They said that stock controller much better than Flipsky vesc
[2021-12-25T20:33:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: who says that ?
[2021-12-25T20:33:30] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2021-12-25T20:33:34] Mirono escooters: Ignorant people
[2021-12-25T20:33:59] Mirono escooters: Aha so 20s works
[2021-12-25T20:34:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: quality, may be. power, certainly not. look at the video, 6kw (20s, 120A phase, 80A bat) ... we'll see how long it last 😁
[2021-12-25T20:34:51] Mirono escooters: Cant wait for mi'e
[2021-12-25T20:35:08] Mirono escooters: Ive done 150a phase in flipsky 4.2 lol. Im convinced of Quality
[2021-12-25T20:35:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vsett 10 stock contro are what ? 27 ? 30A battery ? 😁😁
[2021-12-25T20:35:14] Gigolo Joe: And even with 20s he can't reach 70kmh
[2021-12-25T20:35:25] Mirono escooters: ...
[2021-12-25T20:35:29] Mirono escooters: Speed depends on many factors
[2021-12-25T20:35:33] Mirono escooters: And kv is one of them
[2021-12-25T20:35:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2021-12-25T20:35:47] Mirono escooters: U can hit 70kmh with 14s if needed
[2021-12-25T20:35:49] Mirono escooters: Just high kv
[2021-12-25T20:36:23] Mirono escooters: Don't compare Apples and lemons
[2021-12-25T20:36:55] Artem Bulashev: I too out 58kmh at 16s full charge 🤣🤣
[2021-12-25T20:37:28] Artem Bulashev: Thrust is insane 😄😄 I’m spinning out at 20kmh front wheel loaded at 85a only 😁😁😁
[2021-12-25T20:37:42] Mirono escooters: I cant wait for 20s low kv
[2021-12-25T20:37:44] Paolo ⁭: I think single shunt for 100 amps is too less or not? @koxx3
[2021-12-25T20:37:55] Mirono escooters: Probably depends on resistance
[2021-12-25T20:38:09] Paolo ⁭: At least 1 copper shunt
[2021-12-25T20:38:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: single per phase (on 3 phase), and low side if i understood correctly. not sure how it will hold
[2021-12-25T20:39:23] Paolo ⁭: Generally other like spintend use 3 for phase
[2021-12-25T20:39:46] Paolo ⁭: Or generally use copper shunt
[2021-12-25T20:39:56] Unknown: Some very crappy solder places on them though, would redo some of them
[2021-12-25T20:54:14] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2021-12-25T20:54:53] Luis Magalhaes: I have some guys thinking that way too 😂 no time to explain to them 😅
[2021-12-25T20:56:51] Luis Magalhaes: Video or its all lies 🤣 kidding but film it please 😜
[2021-12-25T20:58:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: most stock escooters have 25/30/40/45A battery. going above 45A is really excellent.
[2021-12-25T20:59:09] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi at 15 👍
[2021-12-25T20:59:17] Mirono escooters: Not even that
[2021-12-25T20:59:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahaha. yes. didn't count 😁
[2021-12-25T20:59:32] Mirono escooters: Sowwy
[2021-12-25T20:59:44] Mirono escooters: After im done Messing 65 😂
[2021-12-25T21:05:27] zekoslav mrkva: in the vsett group on Telegram

[2021-12-25T21:07:50] zekoslav mrkva: You think that Flipsky 75 ok for that, but I need a two controllers
[2021-12-25T21:08:00] zekoslav mrkva: 7500000
[2021-12-25T21:08:08] Happy Giraffe: People use what they want, having decent enough stock esc is already a miracle
[2021-12-25T21:09:35] zekoslav mrkva: Or I need to use this https://spintend.com/collections/diy-electric-scooter-parts/products/75v-200a-dual-motor-controller-ubox-based-on-vesc
[2021-12-25T21:11:19] sombre_enfant: This better ngl
[2021-12-25T21:12:34] Luis Magalhaes: True
[2021-12-25T21:12:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: condering the integration required for 2 flipsky 75100 (mecanical, wiring, antispark...), i would clearly advise the sptintend dual.
[2021-12-25T21:13:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: unless you need more than 16s...
[2021-12-25T21:15:18] Mirono escooters: Thé price is better too?
[2021-12-25T21:15:36] Luis Magalhaes: I only can tell you that my wolf was runing minimotors 40A shunted to 50A and now i uso ubox have tested at 70A, at 50A minimotors had done 92 straight with ubox had done 101 at a small uphill. So.. what you think is better? 😂
[2021-12-25T21:15:48] zekoslav mrkva: Is it complicated to connect
[2021-12-25T21:17:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for dual 75100, need to avoid ground loops, and i would seriously consider anti-spark circuit.
[2021-12-25T21:17:29] Paolo ⁭: This is due to foc vs bldc
[2021-12-25T21:18:01] Paolo ⁭: With same current, bldc you will have more torque and more power consumption, foc higher speed and less consumption
[2021-12-25T21:18:04] zekoslav mrkva: You think that is not good idea
[2021-12-25T21:19:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i would not go that direction. but doable.
[2021-12-25T21:19:23] Mirono escooters: Huh? Bldc had more speed? Higher peaks
[2021-12-25T21:19:39] Paolo ⁭: Bldc more toruqe
[2021-12-25T21:21:18] zekoslav mrkva: Is that Flipky foc or?
[2021-12-25T21:21:41] Paolo ⁭: All vesc can support foc
[2021-12-25T21:24:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: from what i've read foc only. doesn't support bldc (what the fuck have they done to the vesc firmware !!!)

[2021-12-25T21:25:25] Mirono escooters: Weirdos
[2021-12-25T21:25:40] Mirono escooters: @Ghost_911 said his bldc didnt work so that's true
[2021-12-25T21:26:14] Gigolo Joe: Yep, didn't work at all
[2021-12-25T21:26:16] zekoslav mrkva: OK, thank you for teaching. I need to first do something with vesc in my country
[2021-12-25T21:26:16] Happy Giraffe: I thought they were other way around, FOC for efficiency and torque and BLDC for speed👀
[2021-12-25T21:26:36] Mirono escooters: Me too..
[2021-12-25T21:27:43] zekoslav mrkva: much beter ubox thanks
[2021-12-25T21:27:46] Happy Giraffe: Gotta Google it one more
[2021-12-25T21:27:48] Gigolo Joe: As if there was some code that blocks it Gave an error when i tries bldc and crashed the vsec tool
[2021-12-25T21:27:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i personnaly think it's "bullshit" 😉 but FOC is much more complicated to configure. i really think with good PID/config, you have the same startup torque.
[2021-12-25T21:29:11] Happy Giraffe: "Logically since FOC is modulating the phases, it maximizes the torque output at any point due to that the ABC phase are always charged and each of them are using only as much as what do they require for each rotor position within the motor" "Logically since sinusoidal control are creating smooth wave form instead of spikes like BLDC and Trapezoidal, the peak point of each amplitude is less than BLDC mode and or trapezoidal mode. Therefore it has slightly less top speed."
[2021-12-25T21:31:47] Gigolo Joe: 1 month is not a good indicator in my opinion, as 1 can do 500km and another 1000km in a month. 3000km with no issues at all is a good starting point
[2021-12-25T22:04:04] Luis Magalhaes: Yes and in the consumption side the minimotor made less km the the ubox in range test too
[2021-12-25T22:04:49] Happy Giraffe: I experience the same, more range even when using more power and speed with ubox
[2021-12-25T22:04:54] Gigolo Joe: If I understood correctly, the 75100 is based on the 75300. Can anyone confirm it? If so, what are the risks in trying to re-flash it using stlink and the 75300 default firmware? 🧐
[2021-12-25T22:05:26] Happy Giraffe: I would be surprised if it survives longer as it is
[2021-12-25T22:05:39] Gigolo Joe: Expect bricking it
[2021-12-25T22:05:49] Gigolo Joe: 😆😆😆

[2021-12-25T22:09:35] Paolo ⁭: You need to know pinout of mcu and so much data like shunt amplifier, shunt numbers , shunt value etc
[2021-12-25T22:09:44] Paolo ⁭: Ask they to send you config file
[2021-12-25T22:10:02] Artem Bulashev: 12v 30 - tiny, cheap, murata quality
[2021-12-25T22:13:01] Gigolo Joe: Ask who? Flipsky? They don't really want to cooperate neither sharing build info about this controller
[2021-12-25T22:25:06] Paolo ⁭: Vesc is open source software, everyone want edit this code need share it.
[2021-12-25T22:26:00] Mirono escooters: But they can make closed forks right
[2021-12-25T22:26:02] Mirono escooters: Like rion
[2021-12-25T22:26:41] Paolo ⁭: Rion not legit😂 they not interesting hahaha
[2021-12-25T22:28:02] Gigolo Joe: You are right, but, flipsky decided to say fuck it and make the 75100 un upgradeable as they claim
[2021-12-25T22:29:02] Gigolo Joe: That's why i ask if anyone had any success or even tried re flashing it via stlink, as the pinouts are on the board
[2021-12-25T22:29:04] Paolo ⁭: No😂
[2021-12-25T22:29:13] Paolo ⁭: I can open it and self reverse
[2021-12-25T22:29:39] Paolo ⁭: Not complicated , you need only to know configuration
[2021-12-25T22:29:49] Paolo ⁭: The software not any differences

[2021-12-25T22:31:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, 'easy' but i don't have any 75100 😉
[2021-12-25T22:33:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we don't know. it think it's more deeply modified that usual vesc variant (usually, nb/value shunts, opamp gain... recompile vesc firm, and that's it)
[2021-12-25T22:41:39] Paolo ⁭: Yes, I’m mean firmware is always vesc, that changes are only config file (75_300.h)
[2021-12-25T22:45:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what wonder me is why bldc isn't available. i think there is something else.
[2021-12-25T22:46:33] Mirono escooters: Yea that's weird
[2021-12-25T22:56:01] Paolo ⁭: Really? Just tried?
[2021-12-25T22:56:41] Paolo ⁭: I never tried this, because I don’t like hardware.
[2021-12-25T22:57:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: some people tried. really not working
[2021-12-25T22:59:06] Paolo ⁭: What mean as not working?
[2021-12-25T22:59:24] Paolo ⁭: Configuration error or other issue?

[2021-12-26T15:07:08] Luis Magalhaes: @artBula where did you buy the motor? A friend of mine is interested 😁
[2021-12-26T15:28:22] Paolo ⁭: How much watt?
[2021-12-26T17:07:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Could be interesting to compare to Dualtron Raptor motors, I think it's more than 100mm stator diameter
[2021-12-26T17:08:50] Artem Bulashev: Supplier in eu gave it to me for 100€
[2021-12-26T17:09:55] Artem Bulashev: Vsett9 650w nominal and they are made to get to 45-48kmh at 14s (52v)

[2021-12-26T17:16:21] Artem Bulashev: This one has smaller diameter stator than typical 8.5inch wheel - 92mm startor allows for better airfow (space between rim section - air cools magnets better) It also there for takes smaller inner diameter tire - 134mm diameter tires (not like Xiaomi 8.5tire that has inner diameter 6.2inch) this means that you get tire profile almost as high as 6.5inch rim with 10inch tire 😊👍👍 so comfortable ride, not typical 8.5v inch tire comfort level but rather 10inch tire level
[2021-12-26T17:17:17] Artem Bulashev: I think I got special discount
[2021-12-26T17:17:33] Artem Bulashev: May be abit more like 120€
[2021-12-26T17:17:52] Artem Bulashev: I will check with him and let you know sale price
[2021-12-26T17:19:38] Face de Pin Sucé: I see
[2021-12-26T17:20:53] Luis Magalhaes: Ok 👍 thanks
[2021-12-26T17:21:32] Artem Bulashev: This is vsett9+ dual motor 48v based. Preaty quick 0-40kmh for 48v scooter stock
[2021-12-26T17:22:37] Artem Bulashev: And here is mine now - one motor 52v version - one motor 48v version - 60v battery - ubox 27a/85a 20kmh in 2 sec 30kmh in 3 sec 32kmh in 3.05sec (20mph) 40.3kmh in 4.05 sec (25mph) 46kmh in 5sec 48.28kmh in 5.3 sec (30mph) 50kmh in 5.5 sec (31mph) It keeps accelerating at this rate up to 56kmh than can not spin wheels faster and slower climbs to 59kmh
[2021-12-26T17:32:15] Face de Pin Sucé: 13.9s :o
[2021-12-27T07:21:10] Artem Bulashev: It gets slow acceleration 44-50kmh
[2021-12-27T07:21:39] Artem Bulashev: Low kv motor for 48v (13s)
[2021-12-27T07:25:15] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I get like 58kmh at 16s but 53-58kmh is suddenly alot slower acceleration (Perfect for what I wanted 🙃💪 - a lot of torque, 52kmh top speed I wanted give or take)
[2021-12-27T09:37:23] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 you saw it?
[2021-12-27T10:16:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: inyeresting ! need to find a dissipator. but for leds, very nice
[2021-12-27T10:20:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1784@27-12-2021_10-20-01.jpg>
[2021-12-27T10:20:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: they have 75v-> 5v 30A
[2021-12-27T10:21:39] Artem Bulashev: I think with 10amps it would not heat up as it is 30a rated
[2021-12-27T10:23:59] Artem Bulashev: Just thought it is powerful and cheap ;-)
[2021-12-27T10:24:07] Artem Bulashev: That’s why shared 👍
[2021-12-27T10:25:59] Artem Bulashev: I was hoping they may have half size half power version ;-) like 15amps
[2021-12-27T10:39:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if fact, it seems to be old evaluation boards from murata. many components manufacturer produced evaluation board. but since this design is obsolete, they must have send it to the grey market. eval board costs much more normally (30-100€)
[2021-12-27T22:27:11] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb do you use any display on kelly ?
[2021-12-27T23:25:20] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 one of the smallest 12v-5v € 4,48 14％ Off | DC-DC Buck Power Supply Module 6V 12V To 5V 8A Switch Power Supply Module 40W mini module High-Efficiency Intelligent Home https://a.aliexpress.com/_ADDD2s

[2021-12-27T23:33:11] Artem Bulashev: Some read on it http://www.zolshar.ru/article/1179 https://ee-paper.com/hybrid-converter-simplifies-48-v-54-v-buck-conversion-of-data-center-and-telecommunication-system/
[2021-12-27T23:45:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: whooo another nice finding ! 👍
[2021-12-27T23:46:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but 72v isn't enought for what i want. 90v min.
[2021-12-27T23:47:03] Artem Bulashev: Got you body
[2021-12-27T23:47:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i want 20s proof even with regen burst
[2021-12-27T23:47:12] Artem Bulashev: Will keep it on lookout

[2021-12-28T00:17:14] Luis Magalhaes: ok, a friend wanted to use one on kelly but he has not see no one using it 😂
[2021-12-28T00:18:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Can use tft750 but needs custom kelly
[2021-12-28T00:18:54] Face de Pin Sucé: And custom tft
[2021-12-28T00:34:14] Luis Magalhaes: i think thats what he was using but i did not resist to first ride, stop working he thinks it burn something 😅
[2021-12-28T00:41:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a friend burnt 2 tft750 with his kellys.
[2021-12-28T00:42:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: doesn't seems to be correctly tested
[2021-12-28T00:42:20] Luis Magalhaes: so it should not buy a new one 😂
[2021-12-28T00:42:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: he didn't
[2021-12-28T00:43:26] Luis Magalhaes: ok will tell my friend that 🤣
[2021-12-28T13:15:19] Unknown: Do i need to grind rim of m365 alot to fit 10x2.5?
[2021-12-28T13:15:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Why should grind ?
[2021-12-28T13:17:37] Unknown: Idk to get it to fit? 😆 foes it not have to be?
[2021-12-28T13:18:04] Unknown: Also, does it just fit in the rear end or is it too wide to do so? 🤔
[2021-12-28T14:15:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Rime size is 6"
[2021-12-28T14:15:40] Face de Pin Sucé: So is 10x2.5
[2021-12-28T14:15:51] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-12-28T14:15:55] Mirono escooters: You have to
[2021-12-28T14:15:59] Mirono escooters: Otherwise it doesnt seat
[2021-12-28T15:02:21] Happy Giraffe: Alternatively, you can buy rim that has it ready, but thats for Xiaomi chit chat

[2021-12-28T21:46:33] Mirono escooters: I do
[2021-12-28T21:46:40] Mirono escooters: Tuovt ok too
[2021-12-28T21:46:47] Mirono escooters: But harder to lever on
[2021-12-28T21:47:16] sombre_enfant: They seems good
[2021-12-28T21:47:37] Paolo ⁭: How much magnet width?
[2021-12-28T21:47:46] Mirono escooters: 69
[2021-12-28T21:47:55] Paolo ⁭: Impossible
[2021-12-28T21:48:15] Mirono escooters: (it's a Joke)
[2021-12-28T21:48:17] sombre_enfant: 50-45 ig
[2021-12-28T21:48:24] Paolo ⁭: 45 I think
[2021-12-28T21:48:33] sombre_enfant: So kinda good
[2021-12-28T21:48:42] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2021-12-28T21:48:52] Paolo ⁭: It’s based on HM motor
[2021-12-28T21:48:54] sombre_enfant: U dont need 60mm on such frame 😂
[2021-12-28T21:49:03] sombre_enfant: 1200w one ?
[2021-12-28T21:49:19] Paolo ⁭: “ 1600W “
[2021-12-28T21:49:23] sombre_enfant: Hm are not really efficient
[2021-12-28T21:49:28] Paolo ⁭: But not real
[2021-12-28T21:50:06] sombre_enfant: They made 1200w and 1400w as they marked are they different or based on 1600w ?
[2021-12-28T21:50:36] Paolo ⁭: I’ve 60mm one of LY, same fork opening as 45mm motor HM, hm motor a lot useless occupied space
[2021-12-28T21:51:46] Paolo ⁭: Where you’ve seen 1200w hm?
[2021-12-28T21:53:21] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_1787@28-12-2021_21-53-21.jpg>
[2021-12-28T21:53:35] sombre_enfant: 60v 1200w
[2021-12-28T21:54:06] Paolo ⁭: I think is same of 1600w
[2021-12-28T21:54:20] Paolo ⁭: Best is LY, also blade motor is LY
[2021-12-28T21:54:28] sombre_enfant: What about 1400w?
[2021-12-28T21:54:58] sombre_enfant: They seems to have more efficient parameter
[2021-12-28T21:55:56] Paolo ⁭: Don’t know, I hate hm motors hahaha
[2021-12-28T21:56:25] sombre_enfant: Why ?
[2021-12-28T21:57:15] Paolo ⁭: I’ve 45mm motor and 60mm motor, all so much more heat than blade motor
[2021-12-28T21:57:34] Paolo ⁭: 3000W motor heat more than 1200?😐
[2021-12-28T22:00:32] sombre_enfant: I had review of HM 2800W and 1600w on g30 controller they say its slow acceleration, and high off ground speed but need 50A to get acceptable torque
[2021-12-28T22:01:08] sombre_enfant: I'll get those lyong a day
[2021-12-28T22:11:09] Paolo ⁭: This is normal, it’s due to high KV. Also LY is so slow in acceleration, at least need 50A controller
[2021-12-28T22:15:24] Mirono escooters: That's y prefer low kv
[2021-12-28T22:16:42] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-12-28T22:21:37] Paolo ⁭: Now I prefer high kv😂 my current is sufficient for push motor, but I can’t go more than 16s
[2021-12-28T22:22:04] Happy Giraffe: Tbh blade does ok even with 15% of my throttle
[2021-12-28T22:22:37] Happy Giraffe: I would say it's perfect middle
[2021-12-28T22:43:50] sombre_enfant: Why not more ?

[2021-12-28T22:53:36] sombre_enfant: @PaoloWu full black LY on blade are the same as the other grey and black ?
[2021-12-28T22:54:24] Paolo ⁭: Wich full black are you mean?

[2021-12-28T23:06:58] sombre_enfant: @PaoloWu same one or these got more torque ?
[2021-12-28T23:09:16] Paolo ⁭: This motor is more slow and less torque
[2021-12-28T23:09:22] Paolo ⁭: Not any advantage😂😂
[2021-12-28T23:10:35] sombre_enfant: Oh alright

[2021-12-29T11:32:57] Mirono escooters: Morning
[2021-12-29T11:33:54] Paolo ⁭: They says 100A but I’m see minu guys with 150A
[2021-12-29T11:37:49] sombre_enfant: Henlo
[2021-12-29T11:39:14] sombre_enfant: Askip
[2021-12-29T11:50:22] Mirono escooters: Aha sick
[2021-12-29T11:50:40] Mirono escooters: They themself specify 120A peak
[2021-12-29T11:50:59] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-12-29T11:51:58] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if Spintend single creates electronic noise at 120A+
[2021-12-29T11:53:18] Mirono escooters: Problably
[2021-12-29T11:53:32] Mirono escooters: U know im gonna test it Traces are thic thi
[2021-12-29T11:54:35] Happy Giraffe: If you put cfw its warranty over and when it blows up you gotta fix it yourself😂
[2021-12-29T11:54:44] Mirono escooters: Sure thing
[2021-12-29T11:54:52] Mirono escooters: Let's Order spare fets already
[2021-12-29T11:55:15] Happy Giraffe: Maybe better ones aswell
[2021-12-29T11:57:48] sombre_enfant: They really good actually
[2021-12-29T11:59:38] Mirono escooters: Idk wich would be better
[2021-12-29T11:59:42] Mirono escooters: Thé stock ones are Nice
[2021-12-29T11:59:47] Happy Giraffe: I thought someone said they are shit😂
[2021-12-29T12:00:53] Mirono escooters: Sure no Ubox budget fets but.. they seemed good
[2021-12-29T12:04:30] Happy Giraffe: Even Ubox kinda average but no need for more
[2021-12-29T12:05:02] Happy Giraffe: I wonder how would Francois hyperfets work here
[2021-12-29T12:05:02] Mirono escooters: Cant wait for my scoot to ride
[2021-12-29T12:05:44] Happy Giraffe: Same, cant wait to fly home and ride later today
[2021-12-29T12:06:06] Mirono escooters: 20s vesc 🤤
[2021-12-29T12:06:06] sombre_enfant: My guy wanted to upgrade it with this https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/power/mosfet/n-channel/ipp026n10nf2s/
[2021-12-29T12:07:44] Happy Giraffe: I will start monitoring my fet temps bit later, but the cooling on spintend is designed with brain so I suspect they easily handle it
[2021-12-29T12:25:00] Paolo ⁭: 75100?
[2021-12-29T12:25:05] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2021-12-29T12:26:09] Paolo ⁭: How much maximum phase amps?
[2021-12-29T12:26:31] Mirono escooters: I Will do 120. To start 😁
[2021-12-29T13:01:19] Mirono escooters: Is spacing Brake disk with this.. a good idea?
[2021-12-29T13:01:41] Mirono escooters: My disk spacer 1 is too little 2 too much so gotta find a way to space more . And washers idk seems shitty
[2021-12-29T14:28:06] Gigolo Joe: Currently pulling up to 120 Over that and the controller overheats too fast
[2021-12-29T14:29:03] Paolo ⁭: Motor current or battery current?
[2021-12-29T14:30:52] Gigolo Joe: 120amp phase current
[2021-12-29T14:31:30] Gigolo Joe: Only problem is the lack of field weakening
[2021-12-29T14:33:26] Happy Giraffe: Maybe replacing the kapton tape with something else will help
[2021-12-29T14:33:30] sombre_enfant: No
[2021-12-29T14:33:52] Happy Giraffe: Kapton is good insulation but too good thermal insulator aswell
[2021-12-29T14:34:24] sombre_enfant: If u need a bit less pass it to the mill
[2021-12-29T14:35:05] Happy Giraffe: I just used stainless washers that sit tight😅
[2021-12-29T14:35:52] sombre_enfant: U need to get it straight
[2021-12-29T14:36:22] sombre_enfant: I used this sort of washer ago and it get bad after some vibration
[2021-12-29T14:36:25] Gigolo Joe: Ain't got time to work on it right now... Gotta make a bracket and screw the controller with the mosfet side touching the frame, plus add thermal paste between mosfets and kapton tape
[2021-12-29T14:37:06] Happy Giraffe: You can add 24 karat gold but kapton still blocks everything already
[2021-12-29T14:39:22] Gigolo Joe: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2021-12-29T14:39:47] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-12-29T14:55:49] Mirono escooters: I don't have it
[2021-12-29T14:56:22] Mirono escooters: Thé casing overheats as it's so small. Kapton has little to do with it
[2021-12-29T14:59:28] sombre_enfant: U can remove it and put mica
[2021-12-29T14:59:49] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2021-12-29T14:59:54] Mirono escooters: I prob wont im laay
[2021-12-29T14:59:55] Mirono escooters: Lazy
[2021-12-29T15:00:26] Gigolo Joe: What's mica?
[2021-12-29T15:01:15] Happy Giraffe: You can also bolt that to frame

[2021-12-29T18:00:05] Unknown: They expensive as fuck, never buying trampa again 😆 and why 3 phase exits, who on earth will drive on 3 wheels 🤔😆
[2021-12-29T18:03:19] Mirono escooters: Seems good build tho
[2021-12-29T18:05:29] Luis Magalhaes: 😅🔥
[2021-12-29T18:05:41] Luis Magalhaes: Is it new or used?
[2021-12-29T18:06:08] Luis Magalhaes: 3 wheels? 😅
[2021-12-29T18:10:07] Paolo ⁭: Used hah
[2021-12-29T18:10:16] Mirono escooters: Yeet that thing
[2021-12-29T18:10:38] Luis Magalhaes: If it was new it would be a shame 😂
[2021-12-29T18:23:05] sombre_enfant: If u do an stl for case im interested for the file😉 i got one too moded with a 13s5p and dual hydro brake
[2021-12-29T18:27:12] Luis Magalhaes: Pics 😂

[2021-12-29T18:32:41] sombre_enfant: Got me giggling
[2021-12-29T18:35:09] Paolo ⁭: Half of single cell can power xiaomi😂😂
[2021-12-29T18:37:49] sombre_enfant: Its worth to do copper sheet and solder ? Not difficult to solder like that ? What's the thickness ?
[2021-12-29T18:41:40] Paolo ⁭: 0.2mm
[2021-12-29T18:43:33] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2021-12-29T18:45:02] Luis Magalhaes: You need a powerfull solder machine to this dont you?
[2021-12-29T19:01:32] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2021-12-29T19:03:28] Happy Giraffe: I wonder how the stock motors of "250w" ebikes handle current on FOC
[2021-12-29T19:04:00] Happy Giraffe: Only if there was a way to ferrofuild them and get pedal assist work with vesc, could be ultimate sleeper
[2021-12-29T20:26:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Spotted you haha @PaoloWu
[2021-12-29T20:26:39] Face de Pin Sucé: To be completely honest, I hate this RX2000 Frame x)
[2021-12-29T20:26:52] Face de Pin Sucé: But I hope you send us some powerful videos 😁
[2021-12-29T20:30:52] Paolo ⁭: That’s my preferred frame, because fit 2 good suspension, and the more resistant.
[2021-12-29T20:31:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Soooo unstable at high speed
[2021-12-29T20:32:10] Face de Pin Sucé: And column I hate also
[2021-12-29T20:32:23] Face de Pin Sucé: But can fit good suspensions yes, big motor and big battery
[2021-12-29T20:32:43] Paolo ⁭: 100kmh without steering damper
[2021-12-29T20:33:25] Face de Pin Sucé: With original tyres ?
[2021-12-29T20:33:33] Paolo ⁭: Better than carbon fiber😂😂
[2021-12-29T20:33:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Hate carbon fiber column too
[2021-12-29T20:33:57] sombre_enfant: Tu en as dans ton cimetière ??
[2021-12-29T20:34:01] Paolo ⁭: Pmt
[2021-12-29T20:34:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope mdr
[2021-12-29T20:34:22] Paolo ⁭: I hate WEPED column 😂😂 is so big
[2021-12-29T20:34:33] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2021-12-29T20:34:52] Face de Pin Sucé: But best for hard ride in all my tests x)
[2021-12-29T20:35:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Best angle with GTS
[2021-12-29T20:35:16] Paolo ⁭: You cannot curve with WEPED tire
[2021-12-29T20:35:17] Paolo ⁭: 😂😂😂
[2021-12-29T20:35:29] Paolo ⁭: Is plate lol
[2021-12-29T20:35:41] Face de Pin Sucé: That's not true, trust me x)
[2021-12-29T20:35:57] Paolo ⁭: With original kart tire?
[2021-12-29T20:36:16] Unknown: 3 phase exits
[2021-12-29T20:43:49] Face de Pin Sucé: Of course
[2021-12-29T20:43:57] Face de Pin Sucé: I hate PMT 130 on Weped
[2021-12-29T20:44:50] Luis Magalhaes: Thats all for one motor😂 its for the high current 😁
[2021-12-29T20:45:01] Mirono escooters: 3 cables per phase???
[2021-12-29T20:45:24] Paolo ⁭: Plate 😵😵
[2021-12-29T20:46:17] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1807@29-12-2021_20-46-17.jpg>
[2021-12-29T20:46:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Not any problems to take angles
[2021-12-29T20:46:34] Face de Pin Sucé: I already touch my rear brake disc on road x)
[2021-12-29T20:46:51] Luis Magalhaes: Yup 😂
[2021-12-29T20:50:25] Face de Pin Sucé: The only thing is you don't have to be affraid when curving x)
[2021-12-29T20:51:55] Paolo ⁭: The only thing I don’t like of WEPED is battery setup
[2021-12-29T20:52:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Ah yes it's shit
[2021-12-29T20:52:21] Face de Pin Sucé: I only speak about frame x)
[2021-12-29T20:52:38] Paolo ⁭: 9P of 50E for 200Amps😵
[2021-12-29T20:52:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Other main problem is front wheel, no suspension, only between column and deck
[2021-12-29T20:52:54] Face de Pin Sucé: So you take everything in your handlebar
[2021-12-29T20:53:19] Paolo ⁭: If you try my blade frame you will love it😂
[2021-12-29T20:53:32] Paolo ⁭: The suspension are like DH bike hahaha
[2021-12-29T20:53:41] Luis Magalhaes: I dont like the price 😂😂😂
[2021-12-29T20:53:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't think so x) hate this frame to drive
[2021-12-29T20:56:00] Paolo ⁭: It’s better than Z10X
[2021-12-29T20:56:11] Paolo ⁭: And better than mantis and other similar
[2021-12-29T20:56:56] Face de Pin Sucé: 10X is more stable I find
[2021-12-29T20:57:27] Paolo ⁭: No😂 i ve also Z10X
[2021-12-29T20:57:27] Face de Pin Sucé: We made 72V45Ah 10X, reached 115Kmh with it
[2021-12-29T20:57:33] Face de Pin Sucé: But modified everything
[2021-12-29T20:57:44] Face de Pin Sucé: 800mm handlebar
[2021-12-29T20:57:48] Paolo ⁭: Maybe you’ve tried blade 10 with different pole
[2021-12-29T20:57:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Titanium column
[2021-12-29T20:58:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Show your pole ?
[2021-12-29T20:58:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Steel folding not foldable anymore x)
[2021-12-29T20:58:29] Face de Pin Sucé: 1500LBS suspensions x)
[2021-12-29T20:58:40] Face de Pin Sucé: And 110 slick tyres ofc
[2021-12-29T20:59:56] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_1808@29-12-2021_20-59-56.jpg>
[2021-12-29T21:00:17] Paolo ⁭: Speedtrott one is telescopic , mine is fix
[2021-12-29T21:01:10] Paolo ⁭: These part is perfect in the mine, some people have this problem for the pole.
[2021-12-29T21:01:26] Paolo ⁭: And I’m using the oldest model xd
[2021-12-29T21:02:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh
[2021-12-29T21:02:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe better than speedtrotr shitty pole
[2021-12-29T21:02:36] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_1809@29-12-2021_21-02-36.jpg>
[2021-12-29T21:02:39] Paolo ⁭: You maybe tried this
[2021-12-29T21:05:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2021-12-29T21:05:29] Face de Pin Sucé: But speedtrott version
[2021-12-29T21:07:49] sombre_enfant: I wonder who make them
[2021-12-29T21:08:07] sombre_enfant: They really cheap actually when u a professional
[2021-12-29T21:08:32] sombre_enfant: 1600€ for the speedtrott brz2. 4
[2021-12-29T21:09:03] sombre_enfant: The one with dnm nutt and lg battery
[2021-12-29T21:09:14] Paolo ⁭: What
[2021-12-29T21:09:17] Paolo ⁭: Where?
[2021-12-29T21:09:38] sombre_enfant: 😆😆
[2021-12-29T21:12:08] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_1810@29-12-2021_21-12-08.jpg>
[2021-12-29T21:12:25] sombre_enfant: U should get them even cheaper since u get them by china via eon
[2021-12-29T21:12:58] sombre_enfant: When u got a shop not random customer price
[2021-12-29T21:13:02] Paolo ⁭: Oh yes directly by factory maybe cheaper
[2021-12-29T21:13:26] Paolo ⁭: But the commercial price is 2.2k€ arround
[2021-12-29T21:14:22] sombre_enfant: Not for us
[2021-12-29T21:14:56] sombre_enfant: And we dont take it to speedtrott itself so theres already a margin
[2021-12-29T21:16:12] Paolo ⁭: Yes the bigger problem is to import them
[2021-12-29T21:16:16] sombre_enfant: How much a dual blade10 with the shocks and hydro cost from eonmotor with shipping to eu normal customer price ?
[2021-12-29T21:16:28] Paolo ⁭: Cost so much, due to this I’m not so like this business
[2021-12-29T21:16:58] sombre_enfant: More expensive than the price we get them rebranded ?
[2021-12-29T21:17:15] Paolo ⁭: I think arround 1800€ with ship fee now
[2021-12-29T21:17:35] sombre_enfant: Yeah its resonable
[2021-12-29T21:17:48] sombre_enfant: But compared to a laotie es19...
[2021-12-29T21:18:26] Paolo ⁭: Not tried these scooter and never will try
[2021-12-29T21:18:30] sombre_enfant: Idk if a scoot like laotie is worth... With vesc and some upgrade but not major one like battery and motor
[2021-12-29T21:18:36] sombre_enfant: Why ?
[2021-12-29T21:18:57] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2021-12-29T21:22:11] Face de Pin Sucé: This is huge shit x)
[2021-12-29T21:25:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2021-12-29T21:31:42] sombre_enfant: He's in regular not goofy and all the way back it dont help😅
[2021-12-29T21:37:20] Happy Giraffe: Cant be real for the love of god
[2021-12-29T21:42:23] Mirono escooters: Very short peak can be ok
[2021-12-29T21:44:02] Happy Giraffe: 50E barely does 10A I heard
[2021-12-29T21:44:28] Happy Giraffe: Im waiting for a news story of someone suing them for exploded battery
[2021-12-29T21:44:45] Mirono escooters: I Remember in manufacturer spec sheet for 20 seconds higher Amps was allowed at 20c. Idk how much anymore
[2021-12-29T21:44:56] Mirono escooters: Laotie is sick
[2021-12-29T22:23:36] Luis Magalhaes: Yes it is 😂 and now he uses 2 steering dumpers 😂😂😂, 1 minute...
[2021-12-29T22:24:41] Luis Magalhaes: https://youtu.be/Fq7y3rIu1RQ
[2021-12-29T22:25:43] Luis Magalhaes: These ones are from my friend's and they dont feel that 😂 one of them tryed to tell what it has to be seen before riding and that guy deleted his coment 😂
[2021-12-29T22:25:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: looks like a tne. and i wouln't call it 'stylish' 🤣🤣
[2021-12-29T22:36:00] Happy Giraffe: That front light looks ugly af with the fork
[2021-12-29T22:37:12] Happy Giraffe: And this is coming from someone who silicone bukkaked a xiaomi
[2021-12-29T22:40:53] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2021-12-29T22:42:36] Mirono escooters: It looks ok imo
[2021-12-29T22:44:12] Luis Magalhaes: But the es19 is not that dangerous thing 😅 it has to have steering dumper thats true but only one.. you have to tight all including the steering so it wont wooble like that lol, then they use exa suspension etc to get it better
[2021-12-29T22:44:35] Luis Magalhaes: Have seen one at 90kmh with no woobles lol
[2021-12-30T00:51:39] Unknown: See you the fuck feel what i'm sayin 😆😂
[2021-12-30T00:54:39] Unknown: I'd love to see specs on that
[2021-12-30T00:56:32] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1811@30-12-2021_00-56-32.jpg>
[2021-12-30T00:56:38] Luis Magalhaes: There you have it
[2021-12-30T00:58:52] Luis Magalhaes: https://trampaboards.com/1x-vesc-100v-250a--p-28115.html
[2021-12-30T01:12:43] Mirono escooters: Only 400A peak?
[2021-12-30T01:12:50] Mirono escooters: If ubox does 300
[2021-12-30T01:14:29] Unknown: Holy 💩
[2021-12-30T01:15:02] Unknown: Still, 400A damn 9v would defo kill ya 😆
[2021-12-30T01:25:41] Mirono escooters: 9v?
[2021-12-30T01:31:27] Paolo ⁭: Ubox is dual
[2021-12-30T01:39:30] Luis Magalhaes: Dual ubox lol
[2021-12-30T10:54:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Want to die?
[2021-12-30T10:54:32] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2021-12-30T10:55:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That shit falls to part from its self
[2021-12-30T10:56:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its more scary to do 25 on that than anything else i rode last few years😅
[2021-12-30T10:58:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Frame piece of shit ,u should know
[2021-12-30T11:02:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why the wobbling?
[2021-12-30T11:06:21] Gigolo Joe: Flipsky claims the controller have nothing to do with the speed of the scooter🤦‍♂... waiting for their response as i asked them for more detailed info about why is it blocked from uploading new software. Will update y'all when i have more info.
[2021-12-30T11:11:03] Mirono escooters: Partially correct..
[2021-12-30T11:42:06] Artem Bulashev: Damm that is some crazy shit
[2021-12-30T12:05:37] Happy Giraffe: Flipsky doesn't want people to use field weakening with bldc
[2021-12-30T12:06:46] Mirono escooters: Problably to minimize warranty returns. Lol
[2021-12-30T12:07:11] Gigolo Joe: Partially. They claim it has NOTHING to do with it
[2021-12-30T12:07:37] Gigolo Joe: Any idea why?
[2021-12-30T12:07:54] Gigolo Joe: This controller works only in FOC mode
[2021-12-30T12:07:58] Mirono escooters: For basic controllers it's correct.' not many use field weakening
[2021-12-30T12:09:06] Gigolo Joe: You are right, but, my response was on a video about the 75100 particularly.
[2021-12-30T12:10:03] sombre_enfant: Nearly none use fielf weakening some month ago there was like only grin technology
[2021-12-30T12:11:18] Gigolo Joe: Nucular, asi, grintech I even had cheap aliexpress controller that used field weakening (tested it with oscilloscope to verify)
[2021-12-30T12:11:54] Gigolo Joe: As @Mirono_escooters told me, even xiaomi controller has field weakening
[2021-12-30T12:12:02] Mirono escooters: Recently a beta firmware has it yes
[2021-12-30T12:12:04] Gigolo Joe: You just need to know how to use it
[2021-12-30T12:19:23] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, they probably minimize warranty requests as Miro said. If their soldering QC is as bad as Spintend they get lot of repairs. I'm just lucky my unit got solder ball short after 25km and not 3-6 months
[2021-12-30T13:00:47] Mirono escooters: Well i haven't seen a dead flipsky yet :)
[2021-12-30T13:00:53] Mirono escooters: And defo not bcs of solder balls
[2021-12-30T13:03:28] Paolo ⁭: All series of flipsky are without bldc or only 75100?
[2021-12-30T13:06:16] Mirono escooters: Only 75100
[2021-12-30T13:06:34] Paolo ⁭: Ok I hope I don’t worry for my 75200😂😂
[2021-12-30T13:06:34] Mirono escooters: 4.2 works fine
[2021-12-30T13:06:47] Mirono escooters: I prefer foc anyways
[2021-12-30T13:07:22] Paolo ⁭: More power with bldc 😈
[2021-12-30T13:10:17] Happy Giraffe: Higher topspeed, powerwise Im not sure🤔
[2021-12-30T13:10:33] Paolo ⁭: Less top speed
[2021-12-30T13:10:34] Happy Giraffe: FOC gives better torque
[2021-12-30T13:10:47] Happy Giraffe: Check again, you have mixed them
[2021-12-30T13:10:50] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2021-12-30T13:11:15] Happy Giraffe: BLDC on/off switching allows for higher spikes on power so more speed
[2021-12-30T13:11:18] Paolo ⁭: This is based in my use stats
[2021-12-30T13:11:50] Happy Giraffe: All settings were similar but BLDC gave you less speed?😳
[2021-12-30T13:12:29] Paolo ⁭: Foc has reduced magnetic field than bldc, because bldc are on/off
[2021-12-30T13:12:55] Paolo ⁭: Yes, same motor settings
[2021-12-30T13:12:57] Happy Giraffe: But its perfectly assigned in correct position
[2021-12-30T13:13:06] Paolo ⁭: 75 with bldc 83 with foc
[2021-12-30T13:13:23] Paolo ⁭: This is based on gps stats
[2021-12-30T13:13:31] Happy Giraffe: Maybe GPS inaccurate
[2021-12-30T13:14:20] Happy Giraffe: I will do some testing a bit later when I get my bluetooth module installed. My GPS once showed also 71kmh and next day 45kmh topspeed
[2021-12-30T13:14:25] Paolo ⁭: No bro, because also by motor rpm is with this stats , but I’ve tried also with gps for confirm them
[2021-12-30T13:14:45] Paolo ⁭: I’ve tried both measurements
[2021-12-30T13:15:01] Paolo ⁭: You’ve tried yet both modes?
[2021-12-30T13:15:05] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, it is weird to hear BLDC gets less topspeed
[2021-12-30T13:15:11] Happy Giraffe: Not on Vesc yet
[2021-12-30T13:16:50] Paolo ⁭: You need try it
[2021-12-30T13:20:01] Mirono escooters: Bldc more top speed Foc more torque That's how i know it
[2021-12-30T13:20:07] Mirono escooters: Bldc aggressive
[2021-12-30T13:20:28] Happy Giraffe: And sounds like F1
[2021-12-30T13:20:33] Mirono escooters: Yea i love it
[2021-12-30T13:20:36] Mirono escooters: 😂
[2021-12-30T13:21:26] Mirono escooters: Bldc has modified Sine wave with aggresive higher peaks so can hit more speed And foc always does max torque as sinewave and always max of phase
[2021-12-30T13:21:35] Mirono escooters: My explanation sucks but in my head it's correct
[2021-12-30T13:22:46] Paolo ⁭: Wtf
[2021-12-30T13:23:05] Paolo ⁭: Square wave more acceleration ☹️☹️ so much more
[2021-12-30T13:23:24] Mirono escooters: U sure?..
[2021-12-30T13:24:07] Mirono escooters: On Paper and from my experience foc >bldc for torque
[2021-12-30T13:24:15] Paolo ⁭: With 155A batt amps these are stats
[2021-12-30T13:25:22] Paolo ⁭: Maybe flj motor 45mm is stranger😂😂 I will try when my personal escooter will done
[2021-12-30T13:26:35] Mirono escooters: Would be weird
[2021-12-30T13:26:46] Mirono escooters: Maybe it feels more accel.' as bldc aggressive
[2021-12-30T13:29:23] Happy Giraffe: FOC start acceleration is bit less but 20kmh onwards it should be no comparison against BLDC
[2021-12-30T13:29:36] Mirono escooters: Even better
[2021-12-30T13:29:46] Mirono escooters: Foc aggressive at low start speed as peaks
[2021-12-30T13:29:51] Mirono escooters: Felt that too
[2021-12-30T13:29:59] Mirono escooters: But above 8kmh or so.. nop
[2021-12-30T13:30:01] Mirono escooters: Even worse
[2021-12-30T13:30:31] Happy Giraffe: For me the slow throttle ramp-up is perfect for winter ice, snow and water
[2021-12-30T13:31:15] Happy Giraffe: So I havent even experienced what FOC can really do on acceleration
[2021-12-30T13:31:29] sombre_enfant: @PaoloWu what you think about shdc motor ?
[2021-12-30T13:58:44] Mirono escooters: I know it's small compared to you guys batteries but still happy with my 12s5p with 35e 😊
[2021-12-30T13:58:48] Mirono escooters: 35e is really Nice. Love the capacity
[2021-12-30T13:59:00] Mirono escooters: Coming from Eve 26v (2550mah) this is a good upgrade

[2021-12-30T14:08:55] Mirono escooters: For personal builds i don't Care. especially seeing the prices at nkon lol
[2021-12-30T14:09:00] Artem Bulashev: Don’t know much of them, I think they are higher load, lower capacity
[2021-12-30T14:09:07] Mirono escooters: Yes correct
[2021-12-30T14:38:17] Happy Giraffe: Is there anyone who built a vesc powered boat or surfboard with motor(s)?

[2022-01-06T08:27:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: ça me semble un peu exagéré sur 6 mosfets, c'est quoi comme Mosfets ?
[2022-01-06T08:30:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Je sais plus
[2022-01-06T08:30:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Mais c'est du peak
[2022-01-06T09:49:49] sombre_enfant: Ta pas tuer tes shunt du coup sa lis n'importe quoi ?
[2022-01-06T09:50:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Non mdr
[2022-01-06T09:50:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Comparé à la lecture BMS
[2022-01-06T20:30:12] Mirono escooters: if you use vescc fw and set battery to 50 and phase to 100 you will get 100A for some time on the battery anyway
[2022-01-06T20:30:12] Mirono escooters: also don't think that if you put 50A battery and 100A motor the 100A for the motors comes from the thin air, it comes from the battery anyway
[2022-01-06T20:30:12] Mirono escooters: battery current it's just a sum of the motors current, it's more of a "costant" version of the motor current
[2022-01-06T20:30:19] Mirono escooters: TF? This sounds so wrong to me in a wah
[2022-01-06T20:30:20] Mirono escooters: Way
[2022-01-06T20:34:59] Paolo ⁭: It’s correct
[2022-01-06T20:35:16] Paolo ⁭: Motore current are only a peak current , but aren’t continuos
[2022-01-06T20:35:59] Paolo ⁭: Battery current is an average of motor current
[2022-01-06T20:36:04] Mirono escooters: Ok. Thanks :)
[2022-01-06T20:36:08] Mirono escooters: Trying to leaen
[2022-01-06T20:36:12] Mirono escooters: First sentence made head go boom
[2022-01-06T20:36:25] Paolo ⁭: And these peak are from battery helped by capacitors
[2022-01-06T20:36:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Wtfffffff what do I read
[2022-01-06T20:36:45] Mirono escooters: Idk
[2022-01-06T20:36:56] Paolo ⁭: 😢
[2022-01-06T20:37:00] Mirono escooters: Guy has some degrees 😂
[2022-01-06T20:37:07] sombre_enfant: Source tkt
[2022-01-06T20:37:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Controllers is basically a stepdown x)
[2022-01-06T20:37:17] Mirono escooters: Yes i thought so tio
[2022-01-06T20:37:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Ça m'a fumé
[2022-01-06T20:37:26] Mirono escooters: And at lower speed and v way more phase amps
[2022-01-06T20:37:58] Face de Pin Sucé: At low duty cycle, low voltage and high phase amps
[2022-01-06T20:38:06] Face de Pin Sucé: It's not coming from "thin air"
[2022-01-06T20:38:16] Mirono escooters: Yes thought so tooo . ..
[2022-01-06T20:38:23] Mirono escooters: No energy to discuss with him
[2022-01-06T20:38:39] Mirono escooters: Especially when he has degrees and im.. me
[2022-01-06T20:39:03] Face de Pin Sucé: You pull 300W from battery, it gives you 300W ( including the losses of course) but you can pull 30V10A battery and start at 10V30A phase
[2022-01-06T20:39:07] Face de Pin Sucé: BASICALLY
[2022-01-06T21:22:22] Happy Giraffe: +1
[2022-01-06T21:24:43] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise over the limit batt current would blow up all the fuses and activate bms protection all the time
[2022-01-07T16:38:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Everybody dead here ?
[2022-01-07T16:51:30] Happy Giraffe: Plannin to install second battery in parallel, nothing to report yet🌚

[2022-01-07T17:37:36] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-01-07T17:38:09] Face de Pin Sucé: ARE YOU USING EXACT SAME INTERNAL RESISTANCE ????
[2022-01-07T17:38:27] Happy Giraffe: Im using same cells 35E 13s6p + 13s6p
[2022-01-07T17:39:17] Happy Giraffe: Same bms etc. other battery has 50-60 cycles or so more but doesnt matter
[2022-01-07T17:40:37] Happy Giraffe: And only 6.7Amps from single cell so they arent even stressed at all
[2022-01-07T17:40:44] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-01-07T17:41:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Shit x)

[2022-01-07T17:41:39] Happy Giraffe: Will be fun for single motor xiaomi😁
[2022-01-07T17:42:09] Paolo ⁭: Guy I’ve tell only what is better, I’m not at playing a game :/
[2022-01-07T17:43:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't take it bad, I like to say shit things 🤗🥰
[2022-01-07T17:43:07] Luis Magalhaes: True 😁, it would be the better way or using only one battery no parallel ones
[2022-01-07T17:43:17] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-01-07T17:43:53] Paolo ⁭: Will I finally finish this battery?🥺

[2022-01-07T17:48:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Never saw one
[2022-01-07T17:48:13] Paolo ⁭: It’s better than molicel
[2022-01-07T17:48:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Pink I wanted to write :o 😂
[2022-01-07T17:48:22] Paolo ⁭: I before was using molicel
[2022-01-07T17:48:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Why write green xD
[2022-01-07T17:48:30] Happy Giraffe: That's geh
[2022-01-07T17:48:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Really ?
[2022-01-07T17:49:14] Happy Giraffe: VTC 9A charge current damn, could fill the pack so quick
[2022-01-07T17:49:47] Paolo ⁭: Yes. Voltage drop is less, heat less, and normally less internal resistance
[2022-01-07T17:50:34] Face de Pin Sucé: That's nice
[2022-01-07T17:50:42] Face de Pin Sucé: But sooooo expansive compared to P42A

[2022-01-07T17:53:27] Paolo ⁭: Because molicel declare 45A and Sony 40, guys think molicel is performer than Sony. 😂😂
[2022-01-07T17:53:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Tbh, never heard of this Sony before
[2022-01-07T17:54:01] Face de Pin Sucé: But I looked at price

[2022-01-07T18:24:45] Luis Magalhaes: Working 😂👌
[2022-01-07T18:25:05] Luis Magalhaes: But it has to be done one by one
[2022-01-07T18:25:14] Luis Magalhaes: Well better then google..
[2022-01-07T18:25:20] Happy Giraffe: Oh these reactions are this stupid...
[2022-01-07T18:25:42] Happy Giraffe: Gotta take it off right away
[2022-01-07T18:27:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Please add reactions
[2022-01-07T18:27:09] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-07T18:27:38] Happy Giraffe: You asked for it😂
[2022-01-07T19:02:23] Unknown: Sup guys? new here, got a flipsky 75100 vesc that came in a box with chinese intructions and many questions 😂 Everything works great after much googling and learning but im left with this weird short single 'tah' the motor does whenever the controller switches from sensors to sensorless. Its set to 2000 erpm and if I change to a higher number it just does it later at a higher speed. My question is how can I smooth the transition to sensorless?
[2022-01-07T20:06:55] Gigolo Joe: Bruh tell them about your experiment withh 100v on it
[2022-01-07T20:06:58] Gigolo Joe: <sticker>
[2022-01-07T20:19:07] Unknown: Ah yes, it works well with my 24S 😎
[2022-01-07T20:19:37] Unknown: But that motor stutter happens also with a 60v so its not the over voltage thang
[2022-01-07T20:28:37] Mirono escooters: Jezus 24s. No ebrake i hope
[2022-01-07T20:29:23] Unknown: Nah going fast has nothing to do with braking 😎
[2022-01-07T20:30:25] Mirono escooters: Just for back emf to not kill it
[2022-01-07T20:32:49] Luis Magalhaes: At stock 75100? Nice
[2022-01-07T20:33:18] Gigolo Joe: Yolo
[2022-01-07T20:37:25] Unknown: As long as no field weakening or ebraking i dont see an issue
[2022-01-07T20:38:08] Unknown: Left it on at 100.8v for hours and then bashed it from full charge a few times and aside from boiling like a mofo its all good 😂
[2022-01-07T20:39:03] Unknown: Gonna liquid cool it with gaming computer gear, did that before works great and even looks like the delorean
[2022-01-07T20:39:14] Unknown: Anyway, any idea about my issue?
[2022-01-07T20:40:08] Mirono escooters: Lol pictures
[2022-01-07T20:48:12] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂🔥
[2022-01-07T20:48:47] Luis Magalhaes: Run it like mine... Allways sensorless 😂
[2022-01-07T20:49:17] Luis Magalhaes: Just kidding, would love to help but dont know how

[2022-01-07T21:54:11] Face de Pin Sucé: But I buy at same price 🤫
[2022-01-07T22:20:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't forget that if you hit something on road like a small rock, at full batt and high speed it can create a voltage spike in controller
[2022-01-07T22:20:59] Face de Pin Sucé: But EUC use 100V mos for 24S and it's working so, why not x)
[2022-01-07T22:23:43] Mirono escooters: Nice

[2022-01-08T16:30:18] Face de Pin Sucé: You didn't change phase wires on motors ?
[2022-01-08T16:30:26] Face de Pin Sucé: And you hit 100Kmh with this setup ?
[2022-01-08T16:32:42] Luis Magalhaes: Yes on the place of the original minimotors
[2022-01-08T16:32:49] Luis Magalhaes: No stock ones
[2022-01-08T16:33:00] Luis Magalhaes: Full battery yes 😂
[2022-01-08T16:33:16] Face de Pin Sucé: And Ubox doesn't overheat with this setup ?
[2022-01-08T16:33:27] Luis Magalhaes: Yes it got hot
[2022-01-08T16:33:54] Luis Magalhaes: I open the front of the deck for air flow when its hot outside 😂
[2022-01-08T16:34:11] Luis Magalhaes: It helps a lot to cool down the ubox
[2022-01-08T16:34:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha
[2022-01-08T16:34:37] Face de Pin Sucé: That's great
[2022-01-08T16:34:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Might do the same on friend's wolf
[2022-01-08T16:35:26] Luis Magalhaes: 😂show us after then 👍
[2022-01-08T16:35:43] Luis Magalhaes: Im waiting for my 8P 30t
[2022-01-08T16:35:59] Luis Magalhaes: Yo see if it hold better the voltage sag 😂
[2022-01-08T16:36:30] Luis Magalhaes: *to
[2022-01-08T16:36:41] Happy Giraffe: Why not just big battery of maximum capacity?
[2022-01-08T16:37:25] Happy Giraffe: One with proper high load cells, nickel and battery wire gauges😳
[2022-01-08T16:41:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Of course it will
[2022-01-08T16:41:54] Face de Pin Sucé: You won't sag with a 8P 30T
[2022-01-08T16:42:13] Face de Pin Sucé: In parallel of your inside battery x)
[2022-01-08T16:44:22] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/uy7TieOniGQ
[2022-01-08T16:44:30] Happy Giraffe: Something for you😁
[2022-01-08T16:44:53] Face de Pin Sucé: Hate this x)
[2022-01-08T16:45:04] sombre_enfant: Tire too big for acceleration
[2022-01-08T16:45:25] Happy Giraffe: Not for awd with power
[2022-01-08T16:45:48] Happy Giraffe: But 16" scooter would be perfect for winter use (with stud tire)
[2022-01-08T16:47:05] Happy Giraffe: That tire is obviously poor choice for asphalt roads, bad grip
[2022-01-08T17:05:04] Luis Magalhaes: 💸

[2022-01-08T17:34:40] Mirono escooters: Wich welder and pins?
[2022-01-10T01:13:56] Unknown: Any idea how can I make my flipsky 75100 in my scoot open like a dumb chinese controller? I'm in FOC mode, acceleration is great, speed, everything but I miss the kick my 40A aliexpress controller had. Messed with tons of settings and couldn't find anything that does this. It doesnt make sense that a much more powerfull vesc wouldn't be able to do what a junk 40A (actually 36A) controller does (both sensored)
[2022-01-10T01:15:33] Unknown: 110A phase, 80A battery, throttle lag or whatever its called set to 0 (was by default 0.10) and nada.
[2022-01-10T01:15:35] Paolo ⁭: No option, you need more phase current bigger.
[2022-01-10T01:15:53] Paolo ⁭: The only things you can do it’s mod shunt resistor
[2022-01-10T01:16:38] Unknown: Sounds right until you ride a 36A junk china controller which accelerates by throwing you into an unwanted willy
[2022-01-10T01:17:08] Unknown: Im running 24S btw, so thats why 36A actually willies
[2022-01-10T01:18:10] Unknown: You say that these aliexpress controllers rated at "800W" have more than 110A phase of the flipsky?
[2022-01-10T01:18:52] Unknown: They accelerate like shit but the kick from 0 to about 15-20kmh is sick
[2022-01-10T01:22:51] Happy Giraffe: FOC start is not that strong
[2022-01-10T01:23:38] Happy Giraffe: But after that it pulls really great
[2022-01-10T01:26:46] Paolo ⁭: This is not problem if foc or not
[2022-01-10T01:27:07] Paolo ⁭: This is because they ve limited phase current to 120 max
[2022-01-10T01:27:29] Paolo ⁭: Chinese controller limit only battery current
[2022-01-10T01:31:50] Happy Giraffe: FOC startup is slower than BLDC people say
[2022-01-10T01:31:54] Unknown: So you say that the phase current on my 36A china controller is larger than 110A?
[2022-01-10T01:32:17] Happy Giraffe: Foc starts ramping up at 10kmh (this is why I kick it to start like in Xiaomi)
[2022-01-10T01:32:23] Paolo ⁭: Yes, the controller limit only battery current in chinese one
[2022-01-10T01:32:40] Luis Magalhaes: Been there, my minimotors setup was stronger then ubox setup 🤣
[2022-01-10T01:33:01] Luis Magalhaes: Solution more Fase amps
[2022-01-10T01:33:04] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-10T01:33:36] Unknown: I know that ASI open soft but Nucular does have the option to disable some filters and open like crazy (FOC)
[2022-01-10T01:33:37] Paolo ⁭: I was working 80 battery amps with dtx controller lol
[2022-01-10T01:34:45] Paolo ⁭: With dual motor I have identical couple in starting, and I’m see foc is faster than bldc
[2022-01-10T01:35:23] Luis Magalhaes: I was at 50A shunted 40A controller 😅
[2022-01-10T01:36:07] Luis Magalhaes: Now with the 300A firmware i go lot faster and lot quicker then the minimotors
[2022-01-10T01:36:25] Luis Magalhaes: It even sping faster if i want 😂
[2022-01-10T01:36:35] Unknown: Any idea why I set 120A phase but it goes to max 110A?
[2022-01-10T01:36:37] Luis Magalhaes: Im happy now 😂
[2022-01-10T01:37:03] Luis Magalhaes: Max battery limit maybe
[2022-01-10T01:37:31] Paolo ⁭: Need higher absolute maximum current
[2022-01-10T01:37:32] Unknown: Set to 80A
[2022-01-10T01:37:55] Paolo ⁭: And that depends by your motor
[2022-01-10T01:38:26] Unknown: It gets to like 30-40kmh while battery current climbs to 40A and goes up from there with speed
[2022-01-10T01:38:37] Luis Magalhaes: Thats not only if it gives you an error for hitting that?
[2022-01-10T01:39:38] Unknown: Full throttle from a dead stop pulls max phase but takes some speed to get to max battery amps so why would I be limited by max battery current?
[2022-01-10T01:41:57] Luis Magalhaes: You have the power at battery side and the power at wheel side, if you battery side is equal to motor side (because volts are rising) it cuts amps to motor to maintain the consumption limits of battery side
[2022-01-10T01:42:12] Luis Magalhaes: Cant really tell if this is your case so..
[2022-01-10T01:43:20] Unknown: Not the case
[2022-01-10T01:43:40] Unknown: Full throttle pulls 110A phase immediately
[2022-01-10T01:44:35] Unknown: Battery amps at that time are barely 30A, goes to 40A at about 30-40kmh and climbs with speed
[2022-01-10T01:44:51] Luis Magalhaes: Ok
[2022-01-10T01:45:00] Luis Magalhaes: Whats your battery limit ?
[2022-01-10T01:45:06] Unknown: 80A
[2022-01-10T01:45:14] Luis Magalhaes: Ok
[2022-01-10T01:45:45] Luis Magalhaes: It looks like you have some type of ramp aceleration is that .
[2022-01-10T01:45:46] Luis Magalhaes: ?
[2022-01-10T01:46:02] Unknown: Nope, set to 0
[2022-01-10T01:46:14] Unknown: 110A immediately and locks there
[2022-01-10T01:46:27] Unknown: Max phase amps set to 120A
[2022-01-10T01:46:43] Unknown: Also set to 140A but does the same, only 110A
[2022-01-10T01:48:01] Luis Magalhaes: But you can write to controller those values?
[2022-01-10T01:48:21] Luis Magalhaes: A friend of mine told me he can put 120A max fase
[2022-01-10T01:48:41] Luis Magalhaes: Its bloked to more
[2022-01-10T01:48:53] Luis Magalhaes: Let me see what value he said to me ..
[2022-01-10T01:48:55] Unknown: I can write there whatever I want
[2022-01-10T01:49:00] Paolo ⁭: Can’t set more than 120
[2022-01-10T01:49:18] Unknown: I wrote 250A and saved and it goes to 110A max
[2022-01-10T01:49:31] Paolo ⁭: Try to 119😂😂
[2022-01-10T01:49:36] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1842@10-01-2022_01-49-36.jpg>
[2022-01-10T01:49:36] Unknown: Its advertised as 120A peak
[2022-01-10T01:50:02] Unknown: I use the bluetooth and android app
[2022-01-10T01:50:14] Unknown: Didnt see a message like that
[2022-01-10T01:50:19] Luis Magalhaes: Strange
[2022-01-10T01:50:36] Luis Magalhaes: My ubox was blocked to 135A
[2022-01-10T01:50:52] Luis Magalhaes: At 100A firmware and cant write more then that
[2022-01-10T01:51:13] Luis Magalhaes: Like @PaoloWu said try 119 😅
[2022-01-10T01:51:25] Unknown: Well mine gives a nice illusion of unlimited power 😂
[2022-01-10T01:51:51] Unknown: Will try that!
[2022-01-10T01:52:40] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-10T01:52:47] Unknown: One last thing that makes me bash my brain for a week ...
[2022-01-10T01:54:06] Unknown: When the switch from sensored to sensoreless happens (set at 2000erpm) i have a single motor stutter, like a single 'tah' on the moment of transution
[2022-01-10T01:54:13] Unknown: Transition*
[2022-01-10T01:54:28] Unknown: How the hell do I smooth this?
[2022-01-10T01:56:25] Luis Magalhaes: That i have no idea 😂
[2022-01-10T01:57:07] Unknown: Lost here...nobody replies at the vesc forum either...
[2022-01-10T01:57:33] Unknown: Any idea of a vesc expert who might know what to do?
[2022-01-10T01:57:50] Luis Magalhaes: Vedder ? 😂
[2022-01-10T01:58:39] Luis Magalhaes: Dont know mate maybe some one here could help, i would love to help but don't have knowledge to
[2022-01-10T01:58:50] Paolo ⁭: Change controller bro
[2022-01-10T01:58:54] Paolo ⁭: Or mod the shunt
[2022-01-10T01:59:32] Unknown: Thanks alot for the help so far 😊
[2022-01-10T02:00:07] Unknown: We are talking about a different issue niw
[2022-01-10T02:00:23] Unknown: ...
[2022-01-10T02:00:52] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu do you have done some scooter with hall sensors?
[2022-01-10T02:01:00] Luis Magalhaes: Mine is sensorless 😅
[2022-01-10T02:01:23] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-01-10T02:01:28] Paolo ⁭: With ubox
[2022-01-10T02:02:04] Unknown: I tried running sensoreless foc and that thing was shaking and twisting trying to kill itself 😂
[2022-01-10T02:02:23] Luis Magalhaes: Do you have experience any strange transition from the time it goes sensorless ?
[2022-01-10T02:02:42] Luis Magalhaes: Did you push start?
[2022-01-10T02:03:03] Unknown: Nope, hard start from a standstill
[2022-01-10T02:03:18] Luis Magalhaes: Thats normal sensorless 😂
[2022-01-10T02:03:28] Luis Magalhaes: Push a litlle to start rotation
[2022-01-10T02:04:03] Unknown: I tried changing the erpm where it changes to sensoreless and it did the same only at a higher speed
[2022-01-10T02:04:51] Paolo ⁭: I never tried sensorless FOC 😂😂
[2022-01-10T02:04:52] Unknown: Doesnt seem normal, ive ridden minimotors, sensoreless and no push start and all went perfect
[2022-01-10T02:05:02] Paolo ⁭: When I run sensorless I use bldc mode
[2022-01-10T02:05:14] Unknown: Ahh ok
[2022-01-10T02:05:25] Unknown: Why dont you use foc?
[2022-01-10T02:05:35] Paolo ⁭: But you need kick to 5km/h least and after push it
[2022-01-10T02:05:43] Paolo ⁭: Without hall sensor it’s normal does this
[2022-01-10T02:06:03] Luis Magalhaes: Mine always done that even with minimotors had a strange start sometimes 😂
[2022-01-10T02:06:10] Unknown: But again, how come minimotors with no sensors dont need a push start?
[2022-01-10T02:06:23] Unknown: Hmm interesting
[2022-01-10T02:06:35] Luis Magalhaes: Im runing foc sensorless 😂
[2022-01-10T02:06:51] Paolo ⁭: Minimotors use different hardware
[2022-01-10T02:07:13] Unknown: Any idea about my weird transition motor burp from sensored to sensoreless?
[2022-01-10T02:08:50] Paolo ⁭: Sorry but I don’t know this problem , you need take me a video
[2022-01-10T02:09:46] Unknown: You wouldnt hear or see that, its just felt through the chassis
[2022-01-10T02:10:46] Unknown: Any idea what can control smoothness of transition between sensored and sensoreless? Many things I have no idea yet what they do, some filter settings, openloop, pid....
[2022-01-10T09:23:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: they limited it in the firmware. you can't bypass it, especially since this pseudo-vesc isn't fully opensource and cat be recompiled.
[2022-01-10T09:27:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: to diagnose 'slow' start in foc, you need to log all datas and check what's wrong. i also suspect that PID ki/kp aren't set correctly. current is not rising at it's max fast enought.
[2022-01-10T09:27:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you need to read more on vesc forum. 😉 getting a vesc to work is easy. optimizing perfs isn't.
[2022-01-10T10:05:07] Unknown: Well thanks guys, will keep on researching
[2022-01-10T12:04:09] Mirono escooters: U cant do bldc, u are missing that. Bldc is little more aggresive Tbh u won't miss it l
[2022-01-10T12:05:09] Happy Giraffe: Bldc with field weakening is a must try
[2022-01-10T12:06:06] Mirono escooters: I prefer foc
[2022-01-10T12:12:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol. impossible 😉 for field weakening, you must know where is the field, and this is precisly the concept of FOC (field oriented control). field weakening without foc is just impossible.
[2022-01-10T12:13:23] Happy Giraffe: Aah, thanks for teaching me
[2022-01-10T12:13:34] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-10T12:13:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no pb 😉
[2022-01-10T12:15:12] Mirono escooters: That's sick info
[2022-01-10T12:15:18] Mirono escooters: You smort
[2022-01-10T12:15:24] Happy Giraffe: Makes total sense
[2022-01-10T12:15:45] Happy Giraffe: What does field weakening actually do then?
[2022-01-10T12:29:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not easy to explain, kind of 'advance' in time the current in phases. let's say a instant T, your motor is rotating and pass at 0°, at a specific speed, foc algorithm will decide to send current in phases to align magnets at 1° position for best perf ratio. with field weakening, you put phase current further, like 1.2/1.5°. the magnet will have have more difficulties to reach it (need more current), but will reach it faster at the same time. that's my understanding 😅
[2022-01-10T12:30:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's also why it reach amazing speeds without load (magnets can easily follow)... you can ask 3/5° 🤣🤣 but with load, it's not the same story.
[2022-01-10T12:36:35] Happy Giraffe: So it's kinda leading the normal angle a little👍
[2022-01-10T12:36:54] Happy Giraffe: Thanks again for the info!
[2022-01-10T12:38:02] Happy Giraffe: Carrot in front of a horse, with less torque😂
[2022-01-10T15:23:30] Unknown: What he said, kind of like advancing ignition. The phases are energized earlier before the magnets align creating sime kind of a slingshot effect making it spin faster but since it doesnt energize right where the magnet is it creates less torque BUT since it happens at a high speed you don't need that much torque. So less torque more speed. Its less efficient than having a battery with higher voltage to get to that same speed without field weakening though. Also can create weird problems with back emf and certain circuits. Ive had a customer blow up an asi controller because he used regen braking at field weakening speed and the bms of the battery cut power because it thought its a too powerful charger and some crazy back emf shit happened and kaboom 😂
[2022-01-10T15:24:30] Unknown: So you kids out there make sure your pack doesnt cut while regening at field weakening speeds (above natural rpm)
[2022-01-10T16:30:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahha. yes, bemf must be crazy at such high speed. it's not just a simple software feature. every components must support it 😁
[2022-01-10T16:31:43] Paolo ⁭: Buy a highest Kv motor and solve problem☺️
[2022-01-10T16:32:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on my boosted, i don't want more kv, but less motor heat 😅 l'll try statorade when i can.
[2022-01-10T16:32:48] Mirono escooters: Rip torque
[2022-01-10T16:33:22] Paolo ⁭: Push 200A and not worry for torque
[2022-01-10T16:33:38] Paolo ⁭: Also rion use high Kv motor and not a high torque
[2022-01-10T16:35:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Rion not good 😂
[2022-01-10T16:41:23] Mirono escooters: Still prefer low kv
[2022-01-10T16:51:17] Paolo ⁭: 15mR is good

[2022-01-10T17:06:04] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2022-01-10T17:09:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Rion motor not bad
[2022-01-10T17:09:19] Face de Pin Sucé: But Rion is not a good example for me x)
[2022-01-10T17:09:46] Face de Pin Sucé: When I hear "Rion does this" I instantly have a bad thought 😂😂😂
[2022-01-10T17:19:10] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-10T17:19:20] Luis Magalhaes: But its good looking 😂
[2022-01-10T17:19:42] Luis Magalhaes: In what controller? 👌
[2022-01-10T17:20:15] Paolo ⁭: Ive burn all 😂😂
[2022-01-10T17:20:52] Paolo ⁭: Xd
[2022-01-10T17:21:04] Luis Magalhaes: Oh shit 😂
[2022-01-10T17:21:09] Luis Magalhaes: That was now?
[2022-01-10T17:21:58] Face de Pin Sucé: That's the only good thing
[2022-01-10T17:22:15] Face de Pin Sucé: And good looking not from close trust me
[2022-01-10T17:22:23] Luis Magalhaes: The battery looks good too 😂
[2022-01-10T17:22:33] Paolo ⁭: Ive kill it in configuration😂😂
[2022-01-10T17:22:36] Luis Magalhaes: Never seen one 😂

[2022-01-10T17:23:04] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-01-10T17:23:38] Luis Magalhaes: Video i did, but are they all like that still? Or was that one of the first ones?

[2022-01-11T18:59:40] Unknown: Splattered solder on the mcu legs. Seems the junk thickening of the mains melted. Some manufacturers use a ton of solder instead of a thick copper bar and that shit melts easy even when the mosfets are not overheating. Had the same thing happened to me on a liquid cooled sildered shunt controller i had. Fets were room temp when bashed at 250% the max current of the controller but the traces were thickened with solder on a thin copper wire so it melted, hit the circuit and boom, fireworks 😂
[2022-01-11T19:15:39] Unknown: So you guys, got the flipsky 75100... If I want to upgrade the fets to the strongest and best out there, which ones do you recommend? Also, how can I make the software enable more current?
[2022-01-11T19:16:39] Paolo ⁭: You need anyone can reverse that
[2022-01-11T19:20:04] Unknown: Que?
[2022-01-11T19:44:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Damn bro
[2022-01-11T19:45:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Remeber me saying open it🙈
[2022-01-11T19:48:47] Paolo ⁭: Only one😂
[2022-01-11T19:48:56] Paolo ⁭: But I have two :/
[2022-01-11T19:49:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I had 7 solderballs inside
[2022-01-11T19:50:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Removed all shit , even there was one under the foam
[2022-01-11T19:51:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😞 solder balls are not dramatic IF they are under varnish / coating and not touching any components.
[2022-01-11T19:51:44] Luis Magalhaes: You have some type of vodoo at the controllers 😂 all burning
[2022-01-11T19:52:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: These were all kinda loose
[2022-01-11T19:52:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like one pothole surly would get them moving, but this works

[2022-01-11T20:06:54] Mirono escooters: Just how
[2022-01-11T20:07:04] Paolo ⁭: The power board look as not solder ball, in the fact mosfet are still alive
[2022-01-11T20:07:44] Luis Magalhaes: so with a new controll board it should work
[2022-01-11T20:09:52] Paolo ⁭: I think not, only mosfet are alive
[2022-01-11T20:10:18] Paolo ⁭: I will use minimotors for these day

[2022-01-11T20:15:38] Paolo ⁭: And I open paypal dispute
[2022-01-11T20:16:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: WTF ... it's not possible ! some solder must have melt from somewhere
[2022-01-11T20:16:33] Luis Magalhaes: at my case they told me they send me a new one, without arguing
[2022-01-11T20:16:54] Happy Giraffe: Be sure they use FedEx
[2022-01-11T20:16:54] Luis Magalhaes: but had to wait for it to arrive at home 15 days i think
[2022-01-11T20:17:03] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise you wait 6weeks lol

[2022-01-11T21:21:00] Gigolo Joe: 👁👄👁 Already got the files too Will update how it turns out
[2022-01-11T21:21:39] Gigolo Joe: Flipsky only blocked it via firmware Flash a bootloader and you're good to go basically
[2022-01-11T21:22:06] Luis Magalhaes: Ok 👌

[2022-01-12T16:32:56] Artem Bulashev: Guys as I said 100 times
[2022-01-12T16:33:31] Artem Bulashev: Spintend works better than any other, but you must open and check your self for the balls ⚽️!
[2022-01-12T16:34:16] Artem Bulashev: Chinese soldering QC is not good enough - partially because they are small company and don’t use ultrasonic welding
[2022-01-12T17:07:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah and also lazy to hire a monkey for this
[2022-01-12T18:43:01] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-14T19:06:15] Paolo ⁭: I think this motor have some problem
[2022-01-14T19:25:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sounds not to good ,but sound is not so telling
[2022-01-14T20:07:07] Paolo ⁭: In the fact motor with low rpm not good, when exceed 35km/h run very very fast up to 100 with 60v battery
[2022-01-14T20:09:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did , something happened in extra or this was on it when vesc's go boom?
[2022-01-14T20:10:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Open it /switch contoller if possible just for a try
[2022-01-14T20:10:39] Paolo ⁭: I think is motor too high Kv
[2022-01-14T20:12:03] Paolo ⁭: First esc is flipsky , boom. Second spintend work good but burned due to solder ball but for the same not many torque , now minimotors and no torque with low rpm
[2022-01-14T20:12:32] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-01-14T20:12:45] Mirono escooters: Work good, and burned 2 weird words in 1 sentence
[2022-01-14T20:14:03] Paolo ⁭: I think need more phase current
[2022-01-14T20:14:12] Paolo ⁭: Rion drive one motor with 400Amps phase
[2022-01-14T20:14:20] Mirono escooters: Damn
[2022-01-14T20:14:27] Paolo ⁭: I’ve only 135
[2022-01-14T20:14:28] Mirono escooters: Shunt minimotors?
[2022-01-14T20:14:30] Paolo ⁭: Maybe is for this

[2022-01-14T23:17:34] Paolo ⁭: Spintend?
[2022-01-14T23:17:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope, custom design
[2022-01-14T23:18:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Hope can show you more ASAP when testings are done ✅
[2022-01-14T23:18:08] Paolo ⁭: Wich mosfet ?

[2022-01-14T23:20:50] Mirono escooters: Guys
[2022-01-14T23:23:58] Unknown: Can someone please explain to me what openloop is? Didnt find anything in google
[2022-01-14T23:24:11] Unknown: Relating to vesc anyway
[2022-01-14T23:37:21] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 here is another one 🙃

[2022-01-14T23:42:02] Paolo ⁭: I’ve seen only project in online forum
[2022-01-14T23:42:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Vesc terminal command
[2022-01-14T23:42:21] Paolo ⁭: Tell me how many mosfet😂
[2022-01-14T23:43:25] Face de Pin Sucé: BESC is crazy, I remember talking with Gal about this one, but too fucking expansive, BOM was like 250€ before components shortage x) And too big for my use
[2022-01-14T23:44:47] Mirono escooters: 99%? Hmmmm
[2022-01-14T23:45:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤪🤪 BOM must be 300/400€ now
[2022-01-14T23:45:48] Face de Pin Sucé: At least x)
[2022-01-14T23:46:00] Mirono escooters: That's my budget for whole scoot 😂
[2022-01-14T23:46:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and don't forget it's for a single motor 😁
[2022-01-14T23:46:50] Mirono escooters: Jezus
[2022-01-14T23:46:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Of course hahaha
[2022-01-14T23:47:04] Face de Pin Sucé: But it's 30000W capable
[2022-01-14T23:47:07] Face de Pin Sucé: If I remember right
[2022-01-14T23:47:13] Face de Pin Sucé: Or G2 is, I don't remember
[2022-01-14T23:47:14] Mirono escooters: It's whaaat
[2022-01-14T23:47:16] Mirono escooters: Damn
[2022-01-14T23:47:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but 400€ for a whole scooter with vesc, it's really low 😓 not sure it's even interesting
[2022-01-14T23:47:53] Face de Pin Sucé: G2 is 20S max with 400A right ?
[2022-01-14T23:48:19] Face de Pin Sucé: I remember seeing testings on his ebike in mountains on YouTube
[2022-01-14T23:48:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Insane x)
[2022-01-14T23:48:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on paper, may be. but i'd really like to see it in action with real data logs.
[2022-01-14T23:48:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't remember. so high voltage ?
[2022-01-14T23:50:45] Mirono escooters: Maybe bit more But let me elaborate Frame 50€ Motor if i use original its free with frame Dual suspension 80€ Springs 100€ 200€ battery 100€ vesc And im kinda done😂
[2022-01-14T23:50:54] Face de Pin Sucé: https://youtu.be/MQYNLKpVmGU
[2022-01-14T23:50:59] Mirono escooters: Ok budget is problably close to 700 but you get Point
[2022-01-14T23:51:09] Mirono escooters: See why i love flipsky? Thé price is just good for me 😂😂
[2022-01-14T23:51:55] Face de Pin Sucé: 15000W
[2022-01-14T23:52:00] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm a little sad :(
[2022-01-14T23:52:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: already 530€, and not all new. ok
[2022-01-14T23:52:08] Face de Pin Sucé: But it works from hell x)
[2022-01-14T23:52:44] Mirono escooters: Yes, bad math
[2022-01-14T23:53:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, i've seen it. but it only says '30kw motor'. means nothing. we need datas 😁
[2022-01-14T23:53:29] Mirono escooters: Still giving so muvh to just 1 piece (esc) For me to much in Xiaomi anyways
[2022-01-14T23:54:55] Face de Pin Sucé: And it says 15000W in description
[2022-01-14T23:58:53] Paolo ⁭: 20s21p?
[2022-01-15T00:00:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly. xiaomi frame isn't bad, but i don't really see the point of spending so much money to give it a boost. if you are looking for better perfs, sell it, there are many other escooters with much better perfs at 800€. dualtron mini, vsett 8, speedway leger, and many other brands. stock 48/52v bat.
[2022-01-15T00:01:53] Mirono escooters: True

[2022-01-15T00:02:36] Face de Pin Sucé: That's what he claims yes
[2022-01-15T00:02:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: like any vehicules, unless you really want to make YOUR custom or nothing with such power exists, custom will always be much more expensive than higher stock product.
[2022-01-15T00:02:59] Mirono escooters: I like my custom work tho
[2022-01-15T00:03:06] Mirono escooters: It's mine. I don't like prebuild
[2022-01-15T00:03:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: don't get me wrong, it's fun to make custom 😁
[2022-01-15T00:03:30] Mirono escooters: Yes 🥰
[2022-01-15T00:03:39] Mirono escooters: I cant wait to test 75100
[2022-01-15T00:04:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seems stable at 30A bat really continous without cooling. not so bad. i'd like to test it too.
[2022-01-15T00:04:59] Mirono escooters: Will bolt to frame anyways

[2022-01-15T00:05:22] Mirono escooters: It's not like it's expensive
[2022-01-15T00:05:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: need 2 to make real tests 😅
[2022-01-15T00:05:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Order 3 the d

[2022-01-15T00:09:29] Paolo ⁭: Not mean this, we want run bldc😈
[2022-01-15T00:09:40] Mirono escooters: 12s for 300? Xd
[2022-01-15T00:10:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Beurk x)
[2022-01-15T00:10:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seems to be working with "original" firmware on it. some guys already hacked it to put 5.3 firmware with higher max currents
[2022-01-15T00:11:15] Unknown: Yup trampa mk6 bt module and power button ~> belgium +-300
[2022-01-15T00:12:06] Paolo ⁭: Pinout is different by original design no?
[2022-01-15T00:12:49] Paolo ⁭: I’ve already kill 3 vesc, then I will not test😂😂
[2022-01-15T00:14:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: they've rebuilt the firmware ;)

[2022-01-15T00:18:59] Paolo ⁭: Thank you very much, I have 10 unit . I will test it soon😅
[2022-01-15T00:19:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 10 ? 🤣🤣😜
[2022-01-15T00:19:50] Paolo ⁭: Yes for resell
[2022-01-15T08:03:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That could point to high kv yes but sound is still strange
[2022-01-15T08:07:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nice
[2022-01-15T08:12:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Problem starts if you need a small compact also ,near this lot big bodies build is pretty bad, not to mention waterproofing or there necks
[2022-01-15T08:14:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I was expecting something like this😎
[2022-01-15T14:17:01] Gigolo Joe: With enough cooling it works surprisingly good 🤔
[2022-01-15T14:17:28] Mirono escooters: Hell yeah
[2022-01-15T14:18:39] Gigolo Joe: 120 phase amp 60 battery amp limits, works great, overheat protection kicks after couple 0 to full speed runs, cools super fast tho Done over 200 km on it already Also flashed another 'un limited' software on it So far so good
[2022-01-15T14:18:54] Gigolo Joe: On 16s battery
[2022-01-15T14:21:07] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2022-01-15T14:21:11] Mirono escooters: Me going 20s
[2022-01-15T14:21:18] Gigolo Joe: Sadly the 5.3 didn't work on mine, it flashed successfully but had problems configuring the motor... gave an error al the time, maybe gotta change the phase order or something
[2022-01-15T14:21:48] Gigolo Joe: 20s is good Just make sure to cool it, maybe with small fans or something
[2022-01-15T14:23:31] Face de Pin Sucé: If you hit overheat then it means don't work great
[2022-01-15T14:24:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Imagine, only from 0 to max speed, so what ? 5-20s of acceleration and you have reached 80°C
[2022-01-15T14:24:14] Face de Pin Sucé: It's not the meaning of working great
[2022-01-15T14:28:51] Mirono escooters: Just bolt to frame well
[2022-01-15T14:32:27] Unknown: Any idea which fets the 75100 has and whats the best out there that can work with it? Im gonna liquid cool it and want to crank the phase current to like 200A
[2022-01-15T14:34:16] Paolo ⁭: This can’t be done
[2022-01-15T14:34:24] Paolo ⁭: Original shunt is a single 0.5mR
[2022-01-15T14:34:31] Paolo ⁭: Can’t read more current
[2022-01-15T14:34:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you use the vesctool beta ?
[2022-01-15T14:34:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍👍
[2022-01-15T14:35:22] Unknown: Baahh are you sure? Can the shunt be replaced?
[2022-01-15T14:35:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: change shunts & recompile 😊😊
[2022-01-15T14:36:40] Paolo ⁭: Do you have source code?
[2022-01-15T14:37:02] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-01-15T14:37:07] Unknown: Can you guys help me maybe post a link in digikey for such shunt and best possible fet?
[2022-01-15T14:37:40] Unknown: Koxx says changing a shunt is possible
[2022-01-15T14:38:15] Unknown: Theres a link here somewhere with the source, the .h and .c files
[2022-01-15T14:38:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I didn"t check ;)
[2022-01-15T14:38:30] Unknown: Huh
[2022-01-15T14:38:33] Gigolo Joe: Yes
[2022-01-15T14:38:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I don't own a 75100

[2022-01-15T14:38:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😊😊
[2022-01-15T14:44:04] Mirono escooters: It's been posted

[2022-01-15T20:09:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Not the same at all
[2022-01-15T20:09:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Rion motor is same as Weped FF
[2022-01-15T20:09:44] sombre_enfant: Wolf warrior dont have hall ?
[2022-01-15T20:09:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Depends of versions but most haven't
[2022-01-15T20:10:06] Luis Magalhaes: no, just the space to add them 🤣
[2022-01-15T20:10:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Have been able to see Rion motor and it's same as Weped FF exactly x)
[2022-01-15T20:10:50] Luis Magalhaes: i think fast ride said something about that in a video too , rion motors equal at FF and some kaabo 😅
[2022-01-15T20:10:55] sombre_enfant: Add some then
[2022-01-15T20:11:51] Luis Magalhaes: its running good, just has to push start a litlle to have no problem starting
[2022-01-15T20:11:59] Luis Magalhaes: exercise 🤣
[2022-01-15T20:15:30] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1877@15-01-2022_20-15-30.jpg>
[2022-01-15T20:15:50] Luis Magalhaes: here they said it
[2022-01-15T20:16:23] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2022-01-15T20:16:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes but small mistake I think
[2022-01-15T20:16:31] Luis Magalhaes: he said the kaabo wolf the text dont show it all 😂
[2022-01-15T20:16:43] @arnaudgst: Julien so famous ! 😜
[2022-01-15T20:16:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Kaabo motors come from same factory as Rion
[2022-01-15T20:16:59] Luis Magalhaes: ok, they look similar but did not ever seen a motor of the rion opne
[2022-01-15T20:17:00] Luis Magalhaes: open
[2022-01-15T20:17:26] Luis Magalhaes: ok, could have same external with diferent internals then?
[2022-01-15T20:17:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Starting with magnets size, diameter and windings yes x)
[2022-01-15T20:18:15] Luis Magalhaes: do you know that specs ?
[2022-01-15T20:18:19] Luis Magalhaes: im curious
[2022-01-15T20:18:22] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-01-15T20:18:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't remember
[2022-01-15T20:18:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Could look one day when I have time
[2022-01-15T20:18:55] Luis Magalhaes: i would apreciate that 😁👌
[2022-01-15T20:19:39] Luis Magalhaes: the new wolfs have diferent motors then mine too
[2022-01-15T20:20:32] Luis Magalhaes: the Gt has 2000W motors, you can see the diameter inside is bigger and i think it has larger magnets too
[2022-01-15T20:21:13] Luis Magalhaes: even the exterior is larger to mount it on my chassis you have to put a type of spacer
[2022-01-15T20:23:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes GT has bigger motors
[2022-01-15T20:25:26] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1878@15-01-2022_20-25-26.jpg>
[2022-01-15T20:25:27] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1879@15-01-2022_20-25-27.jpg>
[2022-01-15T20:25:48] Paolo ⁭: Yes 65mm magnet
[2022-01-15T20:25:49] Luis Magalhaes: larger diameter 😁
[2022-01-15T20:26:07] Luis Magalhaes: yes mine has 60mm
[2022-01-15T20:26:31] Luis Magalhaes: but it looks the kv is higher in mine
[2022-01-15T20:26:33] Paolo ⁭: Yep your is 1500W version right?
[2022-01-15T20:26:42] Luis Magalhaes: 1200w
[2022-01-15T20:26:55] Luis Magalhaes: 1500W is the king
[2022-01-15T20:27:02] Luis Magalhaes: and 2000w the GT
[2022-01-15T20:29:00] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1880@15-01-2022_20-29-00.jpg>

[2022-01-15T20:29:13] Luis Magalhaes: this it mine when i change tyres
[2022-01-15T20:29:38] sombre_enfant: Nice hand bro
[2022-01-15T20:30:45] Luis Magalhaes: thats my dads 🤣 his a electromechanic for profession 😂😂
[2022-01-15T20:31:15] Luis Magalhaes: i cant do anything with him at my side he wants to do it all 😅😂😂
[2022-01-15T20:33:48] Paolo ⁭: This is only that they write on the motor, but real motor power is 1500w
[2022-01-15T20:34:57] Luis Magalhaes: that i dont know, but the motor of king is diferent of mine outside, and it looks to have more torque
[2022-01-15T20:35:07] Luis Magalhaes: it has 20S battery too 😅
[2022-01-15T20:37:30] sombre_enfant: U hit 100kph with 16s and 18650 its a good motor
[2022-01-15T20:40:00] Luis Magalhaes: And did not burn anything yet 😂
[2022-01-15T21:02:26] Luis Magalhaes: Este deve ser o mesmo
[2022-01-15T21:02:26] Luis Magalhaes: Este deve ser o mesmo
[2022-01-15T21:02:32] Luis Magalhaes: Rion
[2022-01-15T21:02:51] sombre_enfant: Look goofy
[2022-01-15T21:02:54] Luis Magalhaes: Looks like the gt are larger 😅
[2022-01-15T21:17:39] zekoslav mrkva: No display yet
[2022-01-15T21:38:46] Face de Pin Sucé: And ? X)
[2022-01-15T21:44:27] Luis Magalhaes: smartphone app
[2022-01-15T21:44:30] Luis Magalhaes: 😁
[2022-01-15T21:44:57] Luis Magalhaes: but i think that one does not have onboard bluethooth right ?
[2022-01-15T21:45:10] Luis Magalhaes: the antena it has is for the controller
[2022-01-15T21:49:46] Happy Giraffe: If it doesnt have integrated BT module then the BT module wires are connected to RX, TX , GND and +5v
[2022-01-15T21:53:58] Luis Magalhaes: i think this one doesnt have integrated but not sure
[2022-01-15T22:20:36] Paolo ⁭: This is 60mm
[2022-01-15T22:20:43] Paolo ⁭: I sell it too :)
[2022-01-15T22:21:04] zekoslav mrkva: For me, better with display, display like on nuclear vesc. I think you can now understand me
[2022-01-15T22:21:26] Luis Magalhaes: the rion ones ?
[2022-01-15T22:21:36] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-01-15T22:21:53] Luis Magalhaes: a display would be good too
[2022-01-15T22:22:45] Luis Magalhaes: so the magnets are same size of mine
[2022-01-15T22:22:55] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_1885@15-01-2022_22-22-55.jpg>
[2022-01-15T22:23:04] zekoslav mrkva: Yes of course

[2022-01-15T22:23:28] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_1887@15-01-2022_22-23-28.jpg>
[2022-01-15T22:23:28] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_1888@15-01-2022_22-23-28.jpg>
[2022-01-15T22:24:06] Paolo ⁭: It’s same external metal as your , only stator and copper are different
[2022-01-15T22:24:07] Luis Magalhaes: nice, do you know the motors of wolf warrior 60v ?
[2022-01-15T22:24:16] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-01-15T22:24:30] Luis Magalhaes: it what i was asking next haha
[2022-01-15T22:24:51] Paolo ⁭: Is produced by same factory of your motor :)
[2022-01-15T22:24:57] Luis Magalhaes: so its only the cooper 😅
[2022-01-15T22:25:23] Luis Magalhaes: turns and that
[2022-01-15T22:25:27] Paolo ⁭: Yeah , conduct more and some holes for better heat dissipation
[2022-01-15T22:25:36] Paolo ⁭: And copper wire size
[2022-01-15T22:25:54] Luis Magalhaes: should have more cooper for the higher voltage and amps
[2022-01-15T22:26:18] Paolo ⁭: Voltage are not a problem, only for more amps
[2022-01-15T22:26:20] Luis Magalhaes: thanks for the info 😁
[2022-01-15T22:26:36] Luis Magalhaes: true thats what heats 🤣
[2022-01-15T22:26:45] Paolo ⁭: They use 2 version: 2000rpm at 60v 2600rpm at 60v
[2022-01-15T22:27:16] Paolo ⁭: Then means 33Kv and 43Kv
[2022-01-15T22:27:53] Paolo ⁭: No problem I’m affiliated of this factory 😂😂
[2022-01-15T22:28:01] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣

[2022-01-15T22:29:00] Paolo ⁭: ?
[2022-01-15T22:29:10] Luis Magalhaes: not for here 😅
[2022-01-15T22:29:25] Luis Magalhaes: its for my friend that was saying it was the same lolol
[2022-01-15T22:29:31] Paolo ⁭: Ive the 43Kv one, but if you haven’t powerful vesc you will not move it 😅
[2022-01-15T22:29:44] Paolo ⁭: Pedro? It’s also my friend
[2022-01-15T22:30:02] Luis Magalhaes: yes pedro 🤣🤣
[2022-01-15T22:30:16] Paolo ⁭: I know him😂 have my same scooter
[2022-01-15T22:30:35] Luis Magalhaes: yes he has 🤣
[2022-01-15T22:30:49] Luis Magalhaes: minimotors 50A 18S with wolf motors haha
[2022-01-15T22:32:05] Luis Magalhaes: yes, thats one thing i notice in the wolf motors, they where too slow and no torque with original 40A minimotors, with shunt to 50A they get a lot better, and now with the ubox even better
[2022-01-15T22:32:27] Luis Magalhaes: dont know whats my kv then 🤣
[2022-01-15T22:32:55] Luis Magalhaes: but notice it can do more speed then normal hm motor that came in chinese 60v scooters
[2022-01-15T22:37:03] Paolo ⁭: Minimotors controller can’t move real rion motor😂😅
[2022-01-15T22:37:18] Paolo ⁭: I’ve also her same controller, and very bad torque
[2022-01-15T22:37:30] Paolo ⁭: Rion uses 400A phase current xd
[2022-01-15T22:37:53] Luis Magalhaes: too high kv so 🤣
[2022-01-15T22:38:23] Paolo ⁭: Have two version
[2022-01-15T22:41:56] Luis Magalhaes: ok
[2022-01-15T22:42:11] Luis Magalhaes: dont know the kv of my motor or a hm to compare to
[2022-01-15T22:42:14] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2022-01-15T22:44:51] Luis Magalhaes: one more thing what ir the duty cycle ?
[2022-01-15T22:45:00] Luis Magalhaes: cant find it any where
[2022-01-15T22:45:14] Luis Magalhaes: is it related to the voltage to motor ?
[2022-01-15T22:46:33] Paolo ⁭: Duty cycle “is your throttle”😅
[2022-01-15T22:47:17] Paolo ⁭: 0.01 to 1 (0.95 limited , can be unlocked but better don’t do it)
[2022-01-15T22:49:55] Luis Magalhaes: just the throttle ? i think i have less then 95 some times at full speed
[2022-01-15T22:49:59] Luis Magalhaes: i think not sure
[2022-01-15T22:53:03] Paolo ⁭: Duty cycle is percentage mosfet are switching, I’m not able to explain them. It’s controlled by your throttle, but depends by situation 😂
[2022-01-15T22:57:30] Luis Magalhaes: oh ok not direct to throtlle
[2022-01-15T22:58:16] Luis Magalhaes: so if it goes to 95% it should be the max the ubox can do ?
[2022-01-15T23:00:56] Martin Kaktits: surprisingly linear. I would think that speed would drop faster as it gets slower. energy and velocity squared, you know 🧐
[2022-01-15T23:02:19] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-01-15T23:04:28] Luis Magalhaes: so it should be the number os times the mosfets are pushing power
[2022-01-15T23:06:59] Face de Pin Sucé: I would think the same
[2022-01-15T23:07:04] Face de Pin Sucé: He did 3 attempts
[2022-01-15T23:07:29] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1892@15-01-2022_23-07-29.jpg>
[2022-01-15T23:07:29] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1893@15-01-2022_23-07-29.jpg>
[2022-01-15T23:07:36] Face de Pin Sucé: These are the 2 others
[2022-01-15T23:12:42] Martin Kaktits: Well motor brake, afaik, is stronger the faster the wheel spins, so maybe that compensates and straightens the curve out? But he said motor brake is like 5%
[2022-01-16T00:16:10] Happy Giraffe: 45meter braking distance damn
[2022-01-16T00:21:09] Artem Bulashev: I moved from 52v to 60v and damm that’s a difference
[2022-01-16T00:34:15] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-01-16T00:34:42] Luis Magalhaes: @artBula do you wanted more speed ?
[2022-01-16T00:43:24] Paolo ⁭: I can get motors with customized rpm
[2022-01-16T00:57:27] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1894@16-01-2022_00-57-27.jpg>
[2022-01-16T00:57:32] Face de Pin Sucé: It's a little bit cold x)
[2022-01-16T00:57:52] Paolo ⁭: Photo of scooter please 😍
[2022-01-16T00:59:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh sorry, I'm already arrived

[2022-01-16T12:57:27] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2022-01-16T12:58:02] Mirono escooters: And smort. Can u short 1 motor phase wires and do a lot of w ?
[2022-01-16T14:07:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Now I know I need one
[2022-01-16T14:08:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes ;)
[2022-01-16T23:21:51] Luis Magalhaes: hi, it is out a official vesc tools upgrade? 3.01?
[2022-01-16T23:26:42] Face de Pin Sucé: ?
[2022-01-16T23:27:22] Luis Magalhaes: i had vesc tools 3.0 and now it pop up a new update of 3.01 version
[2022-01-16T23:27:32] Luis Magalhaes: im not using the beta one 🤣
[2022-01-16T23:27:55] Luis Magalhaes: oh and in my android too
[2022-01-16T23:28:03] Face de Pin Sucé: I know Vedder told will release soon 5.3 VESC but don't know if he already did
[2022-01-16T23:28:34] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_1897@16-01-2022_23-28-34.jpg>

[2022-01-16T23:30:14] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌
[2022-01-16T23:30:25] Luis Magalhaes: and a noob question
[2022-01-16T23:30:41] Luis Magalhaes: dont need to reflash anything on the ubox ?
[2022-01-16T23:33:04] Face de Pin Sucé: No need
[2022-01-16T23:34:59] Luis Magalhaes: ok, dum dum understand 🤣🤣
[2022-01-16T23:37:25] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb news from the 10x limited, controllers are all locked and my friend think its a piece of ****🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2022-01-16T23:38:14] Luis Magalhaes: he comes from square wave, to that sinewave with 40A battery and 60A rated current phase and 135Amax phase
[2022-01-16T23:38:40] Luis Magalhaes: its linear speed like a ramp and then starts getting speed 🤣
[2022-01-16T23:39:40] Luis Magalhaes: only value he can change was the battery amps from 40 to 50A the same as the boost value and then it starts getting speed and give an error of over current 🤣
[2022-01-16T23:39:40] Mirono escooters: Ieiw
[2022-01-16T23:40:40] Luis Magalhaes: his septic to sine wave power and get that shit 🤣 i think he is going to change for some minimotors he have at house 😂😂
[2022-01-16T23:51:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Told you 😂
[2022-01-16T23:52:17] Luis Magalhaes: yes you did 🙈🤣🤣
[2022-01-16T23:52:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Looks amazing 😂
[2022-01-16T23:52:35] Luis Magalhaes: will never buy a rion too 🤣🤣
[2022-01-16T23:53:00] Face de Pin Sucé: If only he tried VESC FOC with acceleration ramp time 0.05S
[2022-01-16T23:53:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Would never say it's not power x)
[2022-01-16T23:53:56] Luis Magalhaes: and with big phase amp value 🤣
[2022-01-16T23:54:39] Luis Magalhaes: 2 friends are using the kelly 7212 and they are loving it
[2022-01-16T23:55:07] Luis Magalhaes: one of them is buying the 7218 🤣
[2022-01-16T23:55:39] Luis Magalhaes: they love the controll and the power at full throtlle
[2022-01-16T23:55:52] Luis Magalhaes: pmt tyres are screaming 🤣
[2022-01-16T23:56:28] Luis Magalhaes: i was thinking that with 120A phase it would not be that strong
[2022-01-16T23:56:52] Luis Magalhaes: had not seen them live just in videos
[2022-01-16T23:57:01] Face de Pin Sucé: kellys are insane
[2022-01-16T23:57:31] Luis Magalhaes: the 7212 only do 120A or do they spike more then that ?
[2022-01-16T23:59:23] Paolo ⁭: 7212s very shit
[2022-01-17T00:03:06] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-01-17T00:03:25] Luis Magalhaes: not powerfull ?
[2022-01-17T00:04:08] Paolo ⁭: Yeah you need as least 80A continuos version
[2022-01-17T00:05:08] Luis Magalhaes: can ubox handlle more power ?
[2022-01-17T00:05:15] Luis Magalhaes: then 7212
[2022-01-17T00:05:24] Paolo ⁭: Yes ubox is better than 7212
[2022-01-17T00:06:33] Luis Magalhaes: ok, from the specs it has done i think it was more powerful but the are using pmt and had screaming starts 🤣 the kv of those motors as lower then mine too
[2022-01-17T00:06:38] Luis Magalhaes: maybe that
[2022-01-17T00:07:16] Paolo ⁭: 120 only as peak
[2022-01-17T00:07:24] Paolo ⁭: Continuos is 50
[2022-01-17T00:07:27] Luis Magalhaes: i will see the diference when my 30T battery is done 😁
[2022-01-17T00:07:59] Luis Magalhaes: isnt it 50A battery and 120A motor ?
[2022-01-17T00:08:52] Luis Magalhaes: my wolf dont spin motors at 120A 🤣 has to have 200+ 😅
[2022-01-17T00:09:06] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_1899@17-01-2022_00-09-06.jpg>
[2022-01-17T00:09:40] Luis Magalhaes: oh ok ok
[2022-01-17T00:10:02] Paolo ⁭: My motor not work with dtx 50A controller more shunt 😂
[2022-01-17T00:10:13] Luis Magalhaes: have to try one of those scooter 🤣
[2022-01-17T00:10:44] Luis Magalhaes: but your is higher kv then mine 🤣🤣
[2022-01-17T00:10:47] Paolo ⁭: So smooth dtx controller
[2022-01-17T00:12:36] Luis Magalhaes: not even spins motors on fast start ? 🤣
[2022-01-17T00:12:50] Luis Magalhaes: need a powerfull controller there 💪
[2022-01-17T00:13:08] Paolo ⁭: With hall sensor too
[2022-01-17T00:13:17] Paolo ⁭: Minimotors work without them 😂
[2022-01-17T00:13:31] Paolo ⁭: Front wheel dont slip
[2022-01-17T00:13:33] Luis Magalhaes: my motors come without 😅
[2022-01-17T00:13:54] Luis Magalhaes: how much is it shunted to?
[2022-01-17T00:14:29] Paolo ⁭: I ve added a 2mR shunt in parallel
[2022-01-17T00:14:37] Paolo ⁭: I don’t know original shunt value
[2022-01-17T00:15:27] Luis Magalhaes: did you measure the amps on it ?
[2022-01-17T00:16:31] Luis Magalhaes: my original wolf minimotores where shunted to 50A 🤣
[2022-01-17T00:17:15] Luis Magalhaes: tin and fine copper wire
[2022-01-17T00:17:18] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-01-17T00:17:23] Face de Pin Sucé: They spikes
[2022-01-17T00:17:38] Face de Pin Sucé: I have pulled 220A from battery with 2 7212S
[2022-01-17T00:17:54] Face de Pin Sucé: 16kW in 20S
[2022-01-17T00:18:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Not at all 😂
[2022-01-17T00:18:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Never reached more than 12kW with Ubox
[2022-01-17T00:18:48] Luis Magalhaes: 110A from battery 🙊 and constant power is the 50A ?
[2022-01-17T00:19:18] Face de Pin Sucé: It's only about cooling
[2022-01-17T00:19:31] Face de Pin Sucé: If you it well, you have 120A continuous
[2022-01-17T00:19:40] Luis Magalhaes: 16S and 20S on kelly, but kelly handles better the temperature right ?
[2022-01-17T00:20:06] Luis Magalhaes: nice 😱
[2022-01-17T00:20:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Much better
[2022-01-17T00:20:24] Face de Pin Sucé: But bigger, it's normal
[2022-01-17T00:20:43] Paolo ⁭: Let’s change mosfet
[2022-01-17T00:20:52] Paolo ⁭: Original mosfet I’ve seen is 4.2mR😱😱😱
[2022-01-17T00:21:01] Luis Magalhaes: true
[2022-01-17T00:21:17] Luis Magalhaes: on kelly
[2022-01-17T00:21:29] Luis Magalhaes: thats high compared to ubox
[2022-01-17T00:21:32] Paolo ⁭: In 7212 one
[2022-01-17T00:21:37] Paolo ⁭: Pedro sent me photos
[2022-01-17T00:21:41] Luis Magalhaes: is it 6 fets or more ?
[2022-01-17T00:21:49] Face de Pin Sucé: 12 mos in kelly, only 6 in ubox
[2022-01-17T00:22:24] Luis Magalhaes: so then its better even with higher resistance mosfets
[2022-01-17T00:22:50] Face de Pin Sucé: And well better cooled on Kelly
[2022-01-17T00:22:51] Paolo ⁭: 1 mosfet of ubox is better than two in kelly
[2022-01-17T00:23:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes but not well cooled
[2022-01-17T00:23:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Facts are I never reached power of 7212 with Ubox
[2022-01-17T00:23:24] Paolo ⁭: If you have controller outside like me not overheat issue😂
[2022-01-17T00:23:38] Face de Pin Sucé: (don't speak about 7218 x) )
[2022-01-17T00:23:42] Luis Magalhaes: i thouth of that 🤣
[2022-01-17T00:24:04] Face de Pin Sucé: But you don't do high speed bro, heat comes when pulling current for long time --> meaning high speed
[2022-01-17T00:24:14] Paolo ⁭: Isn’t limited at 120 amps motor current?
[2022-01-17T00:24:21] Paolo ⁭: @SibClimb
[2022-01-17T00:24:33] Luis Magalhaes: if 7212 can do 120A the 18 do what?! 🤣
[2022-01-17T00:24:53] Luis Magalhaes: true
[2022-01-17T00:25:05] Paolo ⁭: You will have more current consumption also with big uphill😉
[2022-01-17T00:25:21] Luis Magalhaes: not doing high speed it gets hot and then cold fast
[2022-01-17T00:25:59] Face de Pin Sucé: I think it only control battery current, as on most controllers
[2022-01-17T00:26:21] Face de Pin Sucé: We don't have the same Ride Style ^^
[2022-01-17T00:26:34] Face de Pin Sucé: I push a controller to it's limit
[2022-01-17T00:26:38] Face de Pin Sucé: I burn phases x)
[2022-01-17T00:27:29] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-01-17T00:27:46] Luis Magalhaes: you guys are burners 😂😂
[2022-01-17T00:27:57] Paolo ⁭: Fuck suspension

[2022-01-17T00:32:08] Luis Magalhaes: 😁
[2022-01-17T00:33:54] Paolo ⁭: Pmt don’t does smaller slick tire xd
[2022-01-17T00:34:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Only 10x3 efire now
[2022-01-17T00:34:27] Face de Pin Sucé: But needs 6" rim
[2022-01-17T00:34:46] Face de Pin Sucé: But, good tyres, gum is soft
[2022-01-17T00:35:02] Paolo ⁭: No
[2022-01-17T00:35:06] Paolo ⁭: I’ve 6.5 rim
[2022-01-17T00:35:30] Paolo ⁭: But pmt stradale is smallest in height
[2022-01-17T00:44:46] Happy Giraffe: Fuck, you are making me to open the deck tomorrow just to adjust this...
[2022-01-17T00:45:16] Face de Pin Sucé: You'll thank me instead of fucking me 😏
[2022-01-17T00:45:19] Happy Giraffe: @SibClimb Also I have this issue once per ride that I suddenly lose motor power for 2-3 seconds and red light flashing
[2022-01-17T00:45:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Abs over current maybe ?
[2022-01-17T00:45:40] Happy Giraffe: I love you so much #nohomo
[2022-01-17T00:45:55] Face de Pin Sucé: When it happens, you should not turn off, go to terminal and type
[2022-01-17T00:45:58] Happy Giraffe: Possibly, is there a solution like turning it off completely
[2022-01-17T00:45:58] Face de Pin Sucé: faults
[2022-01-17T00:46:18] Face de Pin Sucé: You'll see what fault happened and lots of details
[2022-01-17T00:46:22] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂

[2022-01-17T00:47:05] Luis Magalhaes: Abs current higher 😂
[2022-01-17T00:47:16] Happy Giraffe: I will check tomorrow, thanks again. I will also try to install the damn bt module too...
[2022-01-17T00:47:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Observer became crazy because of bad detection
[2022-01-17T00:47:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Could be cool x)
[2022-01-17T00:47:50] Paolo ⁭: Anyone know if vesc tool is compatible with mac?😂
[2022-01-17T00:48:01] Happy Giraffe: Problem is I gotta ride to university 2x back and forth in morning and evening so gotta plan it right😂
[2022-01-17T00:48:02] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2022-01-17T00:48:14] Happy Giraffe: I use bootcamp and win version
[2022-01-17T00:48:31] Paolo ⁭: Abs stay for absolute maximum current or anti block system brake?
[2022-01-17T00:48:34] Happy Giraffe: 20GB Windows partition for these kinda apps
[2022-01-17T00:48:48] Paolo ⁭: Work with m1?
[2022-01-17T00:49:19] Happy Giraffe: I dont think so...hmm, virtual machine maybe but its complicated
[2022-01-17T00:52:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Absolute max current
[2022-01-17T00:52:25] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_1902@17-01-2022_00-52-25.jpg>
[2022-01-17T00:52:28] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_1903@17-01-2022_00-52-28.jpg>
[2022-01-17T00:52:44] Happy Giraffe: I set it really high like 160A, then 120A phase and 50A batt
[2022-01-17T00:52:58] Paolo ⁭: Wtf 2 of 7212 mosfet is 2.25 mR , one of ubox mosfet is 1.1
[2022-01-17T00:53:23] Paolo ⁭: 1 ubox mosfet = 4 kelly mosfet🙄
[2022-01-17T00:53:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Put it higher, it's not enough between phase and absolute
[2022-01-17T00:53:53] Happy Giraffe: What does it actually do then?
[2022-01-17T00:54:04] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm sure when you'll look at faults you'll see 160A filtered current
[2022-01-17T00:54:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Sometimes there are small high phase peaks for some ms
[2022-01-17T00:54:30] Happy Giraffe: Sometimes it triggers even with half throttle lol
[2022-01-17T00:54:55] Happy Giraffe: Thanks, thats good to know. I will put maybe 200?
[2022-01-17T00:55:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Good idea

[2022-01-17T11:28:17] Happy Giraffe: *heavy breathing*
[2022-01-17T11:29:07] Happy Giraffe: Is there some special reason caliper is on that side?
[2022-01-17T11:29:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't think so
[2022-01-17T11:31:21] Happy Giraffe: I just think it's bit weaker on the current side, maybe more important on high speeds
[2022-01-17T11:35:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe, I don't know tbh
[2022-01-17T11:36:14] Happy Giraffe: @Her0DasH knows this stuff
[2022-01-17T11:36:40] Face de Pin Sucé: My domain is how to accelerate, braking, don't know 😁😁😁
[2022-01-17T11:36:55] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-17T11:50:26] Unknown: 😂 go fast, idc about getting it to stop hahaha
[2022-01-17T11:53:10] Face de Pin Sucé: The faster you the lesser you need to brake
[2022-01-17T11:53:14] Face de Pin Sucé: It's science
[2022-01-17T11:53:25] Unknown: Lol haha
[2022-01-17T11:53:43] Face de Pin Sucé: <animation>
[2022-01-17T12:07:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What
[2022-01-17T12:12:01] Happy Giraffe: Brake caliper mounted in front side of tire
[2022-01-17T12:12:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh yes there is probably ,there can be several answers ,but would need a closer pics to tell From this pics i dont see what holds the brake and how stock is that ,but kinda looks that brake is originaly other sided
[2022-01-17T12:13:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Some scoots had that by factory
[2022-01-17T12:14:24] Happy Giraffe: But at 100kmh one pushing against the arm has more rigidity than the one pulling away from it I think. Also the bolts are under stress
[2022-01-17T12:14:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And some even mounts disc in wrong direction , thing is Factories are in child shoes in a way and non of them usually has anything to do with motor bikes or bikes
[2022-01-17T12:14:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz they make lot stupid things
[2022-01-17T12:15:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like using ball Bearings
[2022-01-17T12:15:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: While you could have proper ones ,what you cant damage in any jumps
[2022-01-17T12:16:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I didn't say i like it or its good
[2022-01-17T12:17:27] sombre_enfant: +
[2022-01-17T12:18:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But most ppl dont even think over Like using scoot with speeds like that and does discs are not for it and they dont throw away after an year stress
[2022-01-17T12:18:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Even magura is not made for this in this size , however it will survive much more
[2022-01-17T12:20:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And what happens with scoot when disc broke On a smaller janobike i saw this Brake sits front or top position there🤔
[2022-01-17T12:20:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Disc broke next round ripped whole engine out
[2022-01-17T12:21:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So if you fast and do lot hidro and has chinese disc , change it yearly pls , atleast
[2022-01-17T12:24:47] Happy Giraffe: Magura MT5s made for 45kmh
[2022-01-17T12:31:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Problem is everything so small
[2022-01-17T12:31:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Stupid sizes
[2022-01-17T12:32:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If we could have moped or pocketbike disc and brake's 😊
[2022-01-17T12:32:30] Happy Giraffe: Yeah the rotors should be 5mm and pad surface also 5mm
[2022-01-17T12:32:51] Happy Giraffe: Then wouldnt have to change them under every 1000km....
[2022-01-17T12:32:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cheap and a lot type and would work
[2022-01-17T12:33:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Bro if you are a poweruser
[2022-01-17T12:33:35] Happy Giraffe: On motorbikes they last like 10,000km+
[2022-01-17T12:33:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Imagine that you use that much harded than originaly designed for
[2022-01-17T12:33:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So its normal
[2022-01-17T12:33:58] Happy Giraffe: Nope, they designed for 45kmh and I ride that mostly
[2022-01-17T12:33:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Back in time when i was doing dh
[2022-01-17T12:34:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Magura brake ,disc amd pads on my bike
[2022-01-17T12:34:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I pack of pads
[2022-01-17T12:34:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: One run down
[2022-01-17T12:34:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than change pads
[2022-01-17T12:35:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also how ever full metal pads grip bigger ,but to buy pads and change is easier and cheaper than disc buy and change
[2022-01-17T12:36:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Non Will last forever
[2022-01-17T12:36:39] Happy Giraffe: Yep, but 2-2.5mm disc is like😅
[2022-01-17T12:37:33] sombre_enfant: Bicycle disk are 1.8mm😐 would need atleast 3mm
[2022-01-17T12:37:50] sombre_enfant: Mine are at 1.6mm
[2022-01-17T12:38:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need another brake than also ,3 not sure would fit in anything on this size
[2022-01-17T12:39:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like Shimano hidro had issues to get on wider china disc than its original
[2022-01-17T12:43:18] sombre_enfant: Chinese 140mm are thicker
[2022-01-17T12:43:33] sombre_enfant: But shimano not for dh dont fit them
[2022-01-17T12:47:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This even hurts
[2022-01-17T12:47:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you read all lines?
[2022-01-17T12:48:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Two story is not one
[2022-01-17T12:49:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes thats what i was saying also ,normal bike disc less thick but branded ones are made to take heat
[2022-01-17T12:54:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also imagine i am not youth was doing dh and trick biking first more than 23 years ago😅
[2022-01-17T12:55:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Now i feel old🤷‍♂
[2022-01-17T14:15:58] Happy Giraffe: This, my 135mm one started bending when exposed to heat. Magura 160mm still as brand new

[2022-01-17T22:58:34] Paolo ⁭: I think the same, and I still have doubt to why. My personal opinion is mdp is better but 😅😅
[2022-01-17T23:05:22] Face de Pin Sucé: It's dragy, a module external with GPS and Accelerometer and those things
[2022-01-17T23:20:42] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_1909@17-01-2022_23-20-42.jpg>

[2022-01-18T00:58:51] Happy Giraffe: I really hope 180A fixes the cutoff issue
[2022-01-18T00:59:37] Happy Giraffe: Now throttle ramp up increased from 0.3sec to 0.1s🌚

[2022-01-18T01:02:06] Paolo ⁭: Just set to 200A abs

[2022-01-18T01:33:08] Happy Giraffe: Would be nuts to try field weakening right after having throttle lag
[2022-01-18T01:34:14] Paolo ⁭: They published only source code for 5.2 firmware, but no difficult for convert it to 5.3
[2022-01-18T01:44:26] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂

[2022-01-18T12:32:54] Happy Giraffe: Paolo should sell Spintend. Then he could make them work (cleaning solder mess etc.) and sell taxfree in EU. Many would rather support him than the little shady company🤔
[2022-01-18T12:35:02] Paolo ⁭: I pay tax 🙄
[2022-01-18T12:36:32] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but customer doesnt have to haha, also some customs clearance can be problematic and take one week more with hefty fees. So everyone would win🤔
[2022-01-18T12:39:14] Paolo ⁭: I import it with FedEx😂
[2022-01-18T12:39:20] Paolo ⁭: Pay 22% vat

[2022-01-18T18:44:58] Paolo ⁭: Don’t exceed 155A motor, I think this is good safe maximum current for these mosfet
[2022-01-18T18:59:57] Unknown: I was told they are "silicone limited" to 120A or whatever that means. Im going to water cool mine so as long as they don't heat, is there something more to worry about cranking them up? Also was told here by someone that you cant pass 120A as the shunt is 0.5ohm
[2022-01-18T19:01:05] Paolo ⁭: One shunt of these is good for 50A , and they’ve already exceed this value 😂😂

[2022-01-18T19:04:01] Face de Pin Sucé: 21S11P molicel P42A
[2022-01-18T19:04:17] Paolo ⁭: Ive 1s1p molicel

[2022-01-18T22:47:51] Mirono escooters: Yes i used it
[2022-01-18T22:47:55] Mirono escooters: Works top
[2022-01-18T22:48:04] Artem Bulashev: € 3,01 and cheap https://a.aliexpress.com/_AE45W0
[2022-01-18T22:48:06] Artem Bulashev: 👍👍
[2022-01-18T23:06:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nice
[2022-01-18T23:22:52] Face de Pin Sucé: I use those a lot
[2022-01-18T23:25:22] Happy Giraffe: Are there differences between vesc tool Android versions? Like the one you buy from Play Store vs the free?
[2022-01-18T23:25:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Nopz
[2022-01-18T23:25:45] Mirono escooters: Still buy
[2022-01-18T23:25:48] Mirono escooters: Guy deserved it
[2022-01-18T23:34:53] Happy Giraffe: Lucky I use the free but tbh updating app from play store is such convenience I will buy it to support him🌚
[2022-01-18T23:48:28] Happy Giraffe: Oh shit theres full version for android
[2022-01-18T23:48:37] Mirono escooters: Whaaa
[2022-01-18T23:48:43] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-18T23:49:52] Luis Magalhaes: i did that i love the app
[2022-01-18T23:51:15] Happy Giraffe: <files/vesc_tool_full.apk>
[2022-01-18T23:54:31] Happy Giraffe: Really usable with pc mouse
[2022-01-18T23:54:42] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-18T23:54:58] Happy Giraffe: I go try it now
[2022-01-19T00:38:11] Happy Giraffe: But this sucks as it doesnt have profiles, and I tried to use "AppTwin" Mobile and full at the same time but Android doesnt allow that sadly, gotta use mobile...
[2022-01-19T07:26:25] Gigolo Joe: Great converter, i even made a 3d box for it 🤣🤣
[2022-01-19T07:53:27] rosheee: I bought like 4 flipsky and my friend as well...hallsensor setup never worked like it should..never..had to measure by hand and calculate..even flipsky doesnt k ow why
[2022-01-19T07:53:49] rosheee: My racebox is 2 big
[2022-01-19T07:54:33] rosheee: Yup uploaded both
[2022-01-19T07:55:12] rosheee: Anybody has 3d box for the additional throttle/brake filter for spintend?
[2022-01-19T08:00:36] rosheee: I love this disc cuz heat and performance with mt7/mt8 and sinter pads from kool stop
[2022-01-19T10:00:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Had this with Shimano Saints on my Mantis 24S, very great discs
[2022-01-19T10:02:50] rosheee: Magura discs had to hot so i took these Alao because fancy
[2022-01-19T10:04:43] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_1925@19-01-2022_10-04-43.jpg>
[2022-01-19T10:08:08] sombre_enfant: Wich motor ?
[2022-01-19T10:08:59] rosheee: This verynice!! Magura has it inside ffs
[2022-01-19T10:10:04] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂😂😂
[2022-01-19T10:10:20] Face de Pin Sucé: It's same as Magura, had to do the modification side
[2022-01-19T10:10:32] rosheee: I need that mod xD
[2022-01-19T10:11:33] Face de Pin Sucé: It's wild 😂

[2022-01-19T10:12:01] zekoslav mrkva: Not satisfied with this disc!
[2022-01-19T10:12:53] Face de Pin Sucé: You have to make a "trench" on a right size screw for the new place banjo with dremel and it works perfectly
[2022-01-19T10:13:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Why ?
[2022-01-19T10:15:57] rosheee: <photos/photo_1929@19-01-2022_10-15-57.jpg>
[2022-01-19T10:16:19] rosheee: What pads?
[2022-01-19T10:16:49] rosheee: Doesnt look hard used
[2022-01-19T10:16:56] sombre_enfant: Hxt4mm ?
[2022-01-19T10:17:10] rosheee: <photos/photo_1930@19-01-2022_10-17-10.jpg>
[2022-01-19T10:17:14] rosheee: 6mm
[2022-01-19T10:17:39] rosheee: From 6-> 12
[2022-01-19T10:19:22] sombre_enfant: Xt150 ? I dont find hxt 6mm
[2022-01-19T10:20:09] sombre_enfant: 😐
[2022-01-19T10:26:55] Artem Bulashev: That should be very counter productive
[2022-01-19T10:29:21] rosheee: I need 12 1 motor has 6
[2022-01-19T10:30:29] Artem Bulashev: You want to drive two motors from one ESC??
[2022-01-19T10:31:04] rosheee: 1 motor = 6 phase So 2 =12 2 motor 1 v Dualvesc
[2022-01-19T10:31:32] rosheee: We have here
[2022-01-19T10:31:55] Artem Bulashev: Damm motor with dual phase wires?
[2022-01-19T10:32:18] rosheee: Yep It works nice last test months ago Now rebuild it
[2022-01-19T10:32:18] Artem Bulashev: That’s usually 3kw nominal 6kw max motors that use such
[2022-01-19T10:32:25] rosheee: It is
[2022-01-19T10:33:04] Artem Bulashev: I’m not sure Ubox is enough for such motor
[2022-01-19T10:33:18] Artem Bulashev: Hope it works out well
[2022-01-19T10:33:29] rosheee: It is Battery run hot Had 2x40A tested for 35km full throttle all time
[2022-01-19T10:33:54] rosheee: With new battery should be no prob
[2022-01-19T10:34:11] rosheee: With the dual 1400W i get max 9600W
[2022-01-19T10:35:02] rosheee: When it burns it burns So far not for +3000km
[2022-01-19T10:36:27] rosheee: But to many cables..happy when get spacer
[2022-01-19T10:37:08] rosheee: And it goes +80kmh with 16S
[2022-01-19T10:49:17] Face de Pin Sucé: It's better to rewire with bigger cables than keeping the dualphase ^^
[2022-01-19T11:00:14] rosheee: Will do But i still have to split the shit
[2022-01-19T11:04:20] rosheee: But step by step
[2022-01-19T11:04:41] rosheee: 6awg maybe to fat for vesc
[2022-01-19T11:08:24] Face de Pin Sucé: 8AWG is enough for this
[2022-01-19T11:08:36] Face de Pin Sucé: You won't be able to pull enough current from Ubox to justify bigger x)
[2022-01-19T11:34:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳 wtf is that cabling ?
[2022-01-19T11:35:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2022-01-19T11:36:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1000
[2022-01-19T11:37:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't see the point of dual motor cabling for a vesc like spintend. juste use 10/8 awg and recable the motor. not so hard, and much cleaner.
[2022-01-19T11:38:08] Artem Bulashev: Agree
[2022-01-19T11:38:42] Artem Bulashev: I would just solder both wires to each other and right inside one single xt150
[2022-01-19T11:39:40] Artem Bulashev: That would result in single point (instead of 4 connectors and 5 solder points) - solder is a terrible conductor - each connector is a loss as well
[2022-01-19T11:43:24] rosheee: I was to lazy
[2022-01-19T11:43:26] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_1931@19-01-2022_11-43-26.jpg>
[2022-01-19T11:43:59] Artem Bulashev: On inter connector. that would be a lot better
[2022-01-19T11:44:01] rosheee: The problem is more that the cables come from two sides And if i have to disconnect and take motor out for cable change..wjat then xD?
[2022-01-19T11:44:17] rosheee: 6 phase left side 6 right side
[2022-01-19T11:44:34] rosheee: Otherwise i would solder them together
[2022-01-19T11:44:40] Artem Bulashev: That Is terrible motor wiring
[2022-01-19T11:44:43] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2022-01-19T11:44:52] Artem Bulashev: Well
[2022-01-19T11:44:55] rosheee: The motors are like thid xD
[2022-01-19T11:44:58] Face de Pin Sucé: You put connector near the motor
[2022-01-19T11:45:01] Face de Pin Sucé: That's what I do
[2022-01-19T11:45:12] rosheee: XD then battery wont fit
[2022-01-19T11:45:24] Artem Bulashev: He has 3 phases on left of the motor and 3 on right of the motor
[2022-01-19T11:45:51] rosheee: I just make 1 fat cable from vesc then split it into 2 with 6mm hxt
[2022-01-19T11:46:29] Artem Bulashev: What is AWG of single phase wire?
[2022-01-19T11:46:37] rosheee: Or i take the spliter cables and solder them
[2022-01-19T11:46:43] rosheee: Phuu have to check
[2022-01-19T11:47:02] rosheee: Gimme 10min
[2022-01-19T11:47:07] Artem Bulashev: May be single would be enough of Ubox
[2022-01-19T11:47:19] Artem Bulashev: Though this is better than single
[2022-01-19T11:47:24] Artem Bulashev: For sure
[2022-01-19T11:47:32] Artem Bulashev: Even if not ideal
[2022-01-19T11:47:42] Face de Pin Sucé: I put one phase on one side and 2 phases on the other side
[2022-01-19T11:47:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Why ?
[2022-01-19T11:49:06] rosheee: Also fat
[2022-01-19T11:49:35] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't understand
[2022-01-19T11:49:53] rosheee: Put connector where? But it isnt needed
[2022-01-19T11:50:40] Face de Pin Sucé: I think I misunderstood what you said at first x)
[2022-01-19T11:52:36] rosheee: Hmmm
[2022-01-19T11:52:56] rosheee: My ruler stuff isnt hete Looks like 3mm copper per phase
[2022-01-19T12:27:47] rosheee: Well fuck xD
[2022-01-19T12:28:05] rosheee: Cable was warm xD omg
[2022-01-19T12:28:44] rosheee: 12AWG
[2022-01-19T12:30:28] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-19T12:30:48] rosheee: Yah xD
[2022-01-19T12:58:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: did anybody see a recompiled 5.03 firmware for spintend ubox dual somewhere ?
[2022-01-19T13:00:23] Paolo ⁭: I have but for “red” version
[2022-01-19T13:01:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: red & usb type-c ? firmware settings limited ? where did you find this ?
[2022-01-19T13:01:49] Paolo ⁭: It’s open source I’ve self recompiled
[2022-01-19T13:01:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2022-01-19T13:02:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with the 3.4v patch ? 😅
[2022-01-19T13:03:24] Paolo ⁭: What are you mean?
[2022-01-19T13:04:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: some spintend are powered the stm32 with 3.4v instead of 3.3v. it gives wrong values for voltage reading from what i understood
[2022-01-19T13:04:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this is why they advise not to flash genuine vesc firmwares
[2022-01-19T13:05:24] rosheee: True story
[2022-01-19T13:07:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1933@19-01-2022_13-07-40.jpg>
[2022-01-19T13:08:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: in fact, it's the opposite 😅
[2022-01-19T13:08:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 3.44v = genuine / 3.3v = custom spintend
[2022-01-19T13:08:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: v2 are the purple ones, right ?
[2022-01-19T13:09:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and there 2 v1 red types : usb type c / usb type micro-b
[2022-01-19T13:11:49] Paolo ⁭: <files/ubox_single_503.bin>
[2022-01-19T13:11:58] Paolo ⁭: for single vesc
[2022-01-19T13:12:30] Happy Giraffe: Unlocked?
[2022-01-19T13:12:49] Paolo ⁭: yes 5.3 with field weakening

[2022-01-19T13:17:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thanks. and for dual v1&v2 ?
[2022-01-19T13:19:06] Paolo ⁭: <files/image_2022-01-19_13-19-06.png>
[2022-01-19T13:19:12] Paolo ⁭: you need 3.3 or 3.44?
[2022-01-19T13:19:17] sombre_enfant: 140A fwd good luck
[2022-01-19T13:19:38] Paolo ⁭: @koxx3

[2022-01-19T13:25:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: by the way, i also fried a spintend by connecting usb port (ground loop i guess), so now, i tend to do everything wireless(bleutooth for mobile and wifi for computer)
[2022-01-19T13:25:59] rosheee: Where u changed? Console i guess
[2022-01-19T13:26:21] rosheee: With mobile app i dont get it only with full

[2022-01-19T13:31:56] Happy Giraffe: Spintend is not really compatible with Vesc 6 fw lets say
[2022-01-19T13:31:59] Happy Giraffe: Special fw

[2022-01-19T13:48:57] rosheee: U can do it
[2022-01-19T13:49:06] rosheee: Better not get this
[2022-01-19T13:49:25] rosheee: Get this btw and mount it
[2022-01-19T13:49:31] Happy Giraffe: Where does "ESC temp" get its readings in Single Ubox?

[2022-01-19T13:50:37] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, this might be better than using the deck
[2022-01-19T13:50:46] rosheee: Alot But take logfile
[2022-01-19T13:50:54] rosheee: And then u can send it here
[2022-01-19T13:51:02] Happy Giraffe: Start log and end log, it creates CSV file

[2022-01-19T14:29:00] Martin Kaktits: Hello. I have heard a lot of good things about VESC's and I will potentially somewhat soon get one for myself (flipsky 7550). I dont have much experience as you guys, I come from modifying xiaomi m365 and I wonder - I would like to see some actual numbers, comparisons of people who have upgraded to a vesc from something cheaper, like a xiaomi m365 controller (mine is modded ofc for better max power and voltage, but still). Like, they say its more torque, less motor heat/ more range, less noise, more speed with the same hardware otherwise .. is it true? How much? Because it will be some work to make it work with throttle, e-brake and even lights 😅 and I wonder if/ how better would it be
[2022-01-19T14:29:35] rosheee: Pls help him because i have no idea for e brake and light. Would enjoy
[2022-01-19T14:32:46] Unknown: No heated argument,and i discussed with @francois to ban him, he was on coke ranting and cursing against my mom my dad and family he said very bad things. But I'm ok he can come in, if he behaves..
[2022-01-19T14:33:11] rosheee: Inwas on coke ok xD
[2022-01-19T14:33:22] rosheee: More on whisky
[2022-01-19T14:33:23] Unknown: On something
[2022-01-19T14:33:23] Happy Giraffe: Thats expected
[2022-01-19T14:33:27] rosheee: I relax on coke vanilla
[2022-01-19T14:33:36] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2022-01-19T14:33:51] Unknown: Reuse??
[2022-01-19T14:34:05] Unknown: Ahhh ok
[2022-01-19T14:34:39] rosheee: I wanna shit in ur postbox this summer So no stuff for me

[2022-01-19T14:36:58] francois schempers: lets get back to the topic of Vesc guys x)
[2022-01-19T14:37:32] Mirono escooters: 400 mised text messages
[2022-01-19T14:37:33] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-01-19T14:38:32] rosheee: Dudes
[2022-01-19T14:38:47] rosheee: What cable u used for throttle+ powerbutton?
[2022-01-19T14:39:07] rosheee: I think i used to fat one 6x20awg
[2022-01-19T14:39:57] Unknown: Treibst du es zuweit Banne ich dich persönlich nächstes Mal, sei Mal erwachsen.
[2022-01-19T14:43:25] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I tried 140A phase and had small knocking. 130A is better
[2022-01-19T14:44:00] Happy Giraffe: ESC temp after ride 45-50°c
[2022-01-19T14:44:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: throttle & ebrake : not an issue. use the voltage adapter board from spintend or a simple voltage divider to input 3.3v on the vesc analog inputs. lights : not handled by the vesc. you need additionnal hardware. yes... it's dumb.
[2022-01-19T14:45:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: adc input ? 5v throttle ? shielded cable ?
[2022-01-19T14:45:30] Happy Giraffe: 1.5Ah drawn and 0.1 regen not bad
[2022-01-19T14:45:41] rosheee: Send csv
[2022-01-19T14:45:47] Happy Giraffe: ADC, 5V xiaomi throttle, non shielded
[2022-01-19T14:47:43] Happy Giraffe: I didnt properly understand the shielded cable but I just use an ethernet cable for throttle haha
[2022-01-19T14:55:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: high phase current going through cables emit a lot of electric noise. shielded cables with ground around all wires make small signals, like the throttle signal, immune to such noise 😉
[2022-01-19T14:57:29] Paolo ⁭: Francois do you know which are differeces between ubox usb micro and usb type c?
[2022-01-19T14:57:48] rosheee: <photos/photo_1944@19-01-2022_14-57-48.jpg>

[2022-01-19T15:00:57] rosheee: Crap mobile setup
[2022-01-19T15:01:05] Mirono escooters: I suspect fault somewhere else
[2022-01-19T15:02:43] rosheee: Got it
[2022-01-19T15:02:55] rosheee: Ulala

[2022-01-19T15:03:22] rosheee: So here with 16S freespin
[2022-01-19T15:03:27] rosheee: And default
[2022-01-19T15:04:04] Happy Giraffe: How does the field weakening setup work?
[2022-01-19T15:04:33] Happy Giraffe: Ooh, I think I will redo all Throttle, Brake and button wires tbh
[2022-01-19T15:04:33] Mirono escooters: I want my flipsky field weakening
[2022-01-19T15:04:38] rosheee: Idk
[2022-01-19T15:04:44] rosheee: Omg new problems..fck me
[2022-01-19T15:05:56] Paolo ⁭: Which flipsky you have?
[2022-01-19T15:06:16] Mirono escooters: 75100 lol
[2022-01-19T15:06:18] Mirono escooters: :)
[2022-01-19T15:06:31] rosheee: Omfg i get my laptop wtf
[2022-01-19T15:06:55] Mirono escooters: 😂
[2022-01-19T15:07:29] Paolo ⁭: This is with flipsky 75100
[2022-01-19T15:08:06] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_1946@19-01-2022_15-08-06.jpg>
[2022-01-19T15:11:24] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2022-01-19T15:11:56] Paolo ⁭: You need only install firmware and you can got field weakening
[2022-01-19T15:12:22] Happy Giraffe: How much can it be adjusted?
[2022-01-19T15:12:35] Paolo ⁭: What are you mean
[2022-01-19T15:13:23] Mirono escooters: It works good?
[2022-01-19T15:13:38] Paolo ⁭: Yes but not with my motor😂
[2022-01-19T15:13:49] Mirono escooters: Why?
[2022-01-19T15:13:59] Paolo ⁭: I’ve put 155A and still really smooth
[2022-01-19T15:14:08] Paolo ⁭: Too high Kv , need least 250 phase
[2022-01-19T15:14:24] Mirono escooters: Jezus
[2022-01-19T15:16:12] rosheee: Omg updated to 503 cant use old vesc tool
[2022-01-19T15:16:37] Happy Giraffe: How much control you have over it?
[2022-01-19T15:19:14] Martin Kaktits: smth like this? Just like that?
[2022-01-19T15:20:55] SirGeoff: Yes, but only if you have 3,3V throttle and brake sensors.
[2022-01-19T15:22:27] Martin Kaktits: xiaomi throttle and brake
[2022-01-19T15:22:30] rosheee: Btw u use current or duty for throttle?
[2022-01-19T15:23:40] Artem Bulashev: Current is better usually
[2022-01-19T15:23:43] SirGeoff: They are 5V sensors. I use an adc converter from 5V to 3.3V
[2022-01-19T15:23:55] Paolo ⁭: +2
[2022-01-19T15:24:09] Artem Bulashev: Most factory scooters use duty that allows for easy cruise control
[2022-01-19T15:25:30] Artem Bulashev: With current control cruise controll locks also to amp amount
[2022-01-19T15:25:57] rosheee: I use duty atm cuz tire spin
[2022-01-19T15:26:11] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-01-19T15:26:28] Mirono escooters: Am i stupid or expectin a lot Or should a expensive vesc be able to handle 5v throttle without a shit adaptor?
[2022-01-19T15:27:04] rosheee: Yah i havent setup current correct With duty i use -18% / -8%
[2022-01-19T15:27:33] Artem Bulashev: All vesc need step down
[2022-01-19T15:27:38] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-01-19T15:27:50] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-01-19T15:27:51] Artem Bulashev: Because logic is designed the same - VESC design - 3.3v
[2022-01-19T15:27:54] Mirono escooters: So stupid
[2022-01-19T15:28:01] Artem Bulashev: Normal
[2022-01-19T15:28:03] Mirono escooters: Why would they design it that way
[2022-01-19T15:28:11] rosheee: Thx to spintend converter switch
[2022-01-19T15:28:17] Artem Bulashev: It’s called logic level
[2022-01-19T15:28:34] Artem Bulashev: If you want to use 5v logic throttle than need an adapter
[2022-01-19T15:28:49] Mirono escooters: More money It's like the on off antispark Selling scheme of flipsky
[2022-01-19T15:29:02] rosheee: <photos/photo_1948@19-01-2022_15-29-02.jpg>
[2022-01-19T15:29:10] Artem Bulashev: Beside Spintend no one even sells that adapter
[2022-01-19T15:29:20] Artem Bulashev: Im not sure why

[2022-01-19T15:30:42] Mirono escooters: They say so
[2022-01-19T15:30:43] Martin Kaktits: I mean, I do see a 5v pin in there - doesnt that work?
[2022-01-19T15:30:50] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 75100 doesnt have on off
[2022-01-19T15:30:54] rosheee: Spintend not

[2022-01-19T15:35:27] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-19T15:35:40] SirGeoff: Yes, you need the 5V pin. The problem is, the vesc can accept 3,3V analogue input in ADC1 and ADC2.
[2022-01-19T15:35:45] rosheee: I even dont pay VAT on nkon
[2022-01-19T15:37:39] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2022-01-19T15:37:48] Mirono escooters: Well with vat spintend gets expensive
[2022-01-19T15:38:07] Mirono escooters: And seeing there single vesc with those solder balls and thé missing screws and what not

[2022-01-19T15:39:08] rosheee: I posted on instagram the burned vesc
[2022-01-19T15:39:13] rosheee: THEN THEY TRIED TO HELP

[2022-01-19T16:30:03] Paolo ⁭: <files/image_2022-01-19_16-29-54.png>
[2022-01-19T16:32:46] Mirono escooters: 150a i see
[2022-01-19T16:39:28] Paolo ⁭: Its maximum absolute for spikes
[2022-01-19T16:39:54] Mirono escooters: It survives 3 months
[2022-01-19T16:39:56] Paolo ⁭: There is continuos current
[2022-01-19T16:39:58] Mirono escooters: Now going 20s
[2022-01-19T16:40:10] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-01-19T16:54:04] rosheee: Wtf
[2022-01-19T16:54:21] rosheee: Now i get a brake at max throttle with current
[2022-01-19T16:57:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no. i don't understand why they made 2 firmwares. and i am a bit curious about it. i don't think usb port type have any impact.
[2022-01-19T16:58:24] Paolo ⁭: will you try it if i send you binary file? anyway can be reseted by stlink
[2022-01-19T17:00:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it should... but non does.
[2022-01-19T17:01:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it only need 2 resistors per adc. cost ? 0.0001$. really not the issue.
[2022-01-19T17:02:04] rosheee: Pfffnowscooter runs like shit
[2022-01-19T17:05:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for many vescs, you don't have 'power latch'. many esk8 use a simple on/off switch... but a little bit crazy considering voltage/current going in such switch now. flipsky doesn't have any 'logic' switch... so you need to ise, either a stupid swtich (supporting you battery current), or an remote logic switch (often called anti-spark, but it's not really it's main purpose).
[2022-01-19T17:06:28] Mirono escooters: Yea im using a breaker now
[2022-01-19T17:06:33] Mirono escooters: Also idea is a xt90 lol
[2022-01-19T17:06:55] Mirono escooters: Ive seen before here, those that make cirvuit complete
[2022-01-19T17:07:16] Mirono escooters: Or i trace cut vesc lol
[2022-01-19T17:08:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i want to check the content first 😁 need your git 😁😁
[2022-01-19T17:15:59] rosheee: Current throttle sucks hard
[2022-01-19T17:16:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ??
[2022-01-19T17:22:12] Happy Giraffe: What start up mode you use? Theres the default starts and aggressive one
[2022-01-19T17:23:15] Happy Giraffe: I put throttle latency to 0.05sec now and want bit more acceleration
[2022-01-19T17:23:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is no 'mode' inside vesc. you only put settings, and eventually assign settings to a profile.
[2022-01-19T17:23:41] Happy Giraffe: I mean the ones in Android app
[2022-01-19T17:23:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what's the exact setting name you are changing ?
[2022-01-19T17:25:08] Happy Giraffe: No wonder why it was slow, somehow it reverted to 0.3sec...
[2022-01-19T17:25:29] Happy Giraffe: I will screenshot bit later when I go ride again, cant see setting without vesc
[2022-01-19T17:26:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2022-01-19T17:37:37] rosheee: less boost, less power, less acceleration..jess
[2022-01-19T17:41:12] rosheee: Duty
[2022-01-19T17:41:33] Mirono escooters: 80a for that Accel?
[2022-01-19T17:41:53] rosheee: have to wait until 40kmh otherwise spinning tires + V cut
[2022-01-19T17:42:02] rosheee: even at 40kmh spin
[2022-01-19T17:42:05] Mirono escooters: A
[2022-01-19T17:42:16] Mirono escooters: How
[2022-01-19T17:42:28] rosheee: u see how it jumps at 50kmh? tire spin
[2022-01-19T17:43:12] Mirono escooters: Cool
[2022-01-19T17:43:36] rosheee: suxx need fatter tires
[2022-01-19T17:44:02] rosheee: even on car i can't spin tire from 0kmh when kick throttle at 4200rpm without esp
[2022-01-19T17:45:49] rosheee: but i test tomorrow how long i need from 100-0 with the car brakes warm but 1 degree ground temp + semi slicks
[2022-01-19T17:45:53] rosheee: current lol
[2022-01-19T17:46:13] rosheee: 4KW lol

[2022-01-19T17:50:19] rosheee: awd
[2022-01-19T17:50:47] rosheee: 2x1400W @max 9600W
[2022-01-19T17:51:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: kinda 'esp' on cars. avoid loosing grip is one wheel starts spinning faster than the other.
[2022-01-19T17:51:45] rosheee: fack esp on cars xD
[2022-01-19T17:52:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's really one of the MAJOR feature of the vesc
[2022-01-19T17:52:23] rosheee: true
[2022-01-19T17:52:40] Mirono escooters: I never went AWD with vesc *Cries*

[2022-01-19T20:36:10] Luis Magalhaes: Im having a problem
[2022-01-19T20:36:26] Luis Magalhaes: My scooter is not runing right
[2022-01-19T20:37:41] Luis Magalhaes: I start riding and it starts normal and then acts like i lose throtlle and pressed again, i can see in the display the power going up and down
[2022-01-19T20:38:00] Luis Magalhaes: Some times if a go faster it acts normal
[2022-01-19T20:38:08] Mirono escooters: Overcurrent? Bms trippi'g?
[2022-01-19T20:38:21] Luis Magalhaes: Looks like its not detecting position
[2022-01-19T20:38:29] Luis Magalhaes: No, and no error
[2022-01-19T20:38:33] Mirono escooters: Rip halls?
[2022-01-19T20:38:51] Luis Magalhaes: Sensorless
[2022-01-19T20:38:54] Artem Bulashev: Make sure CHARGE is not disabled in BMS
[2022-01-19T20:38:57] Artem Bulashev: I had it same
[2022-01-19T20:39:02] Luis Magalhaes: No error at vesc tools
[2022-01-19T20:39:14] Artem Bulashev: You won’t see any
[2022-01-19T20:39:19] Artem Bulashev: Beside low voltage
[2022-01-19T20:39:25] Luis Magalhaes: No its not disable and i dont even use ebrake
[2022-01-19T20:39:27] Artem Bulashev: May be monitor BMS live
[2022-01-19T20:39:34] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-01-19T20:39:50] Artem Bulashev: Even just Rolling creats charge
[2022-01-19T20:39:51] Luis Magalhaes: Not looking as a bms or battery fault
[2022-01-19T20:39:58] Luis Magalhaes: Ok
[2022-01-19T20:39:58] Artem Bulashev: So it could happen even without ebrake
[2022-01-19T20:40:10] Artem Bulashev: Than not sure
[2022-01-19T20:40:17] Artem Bulashev: May be throttle input problem ?
[2022-01-19T20:40:22] Luis Magalhaes: I try to log it but did not see it yet
[2022-01-19T20:40:27] Mirono escooters: Water damage? Bad cable?
[2022-01-19T20:40:43] Luis Magalhaes: <files/2022-01-19_18-13-07.csv>
[2022-01-19T20:40:45] Artem Bulashev: Sounds like HW issue for sure, likely cable
[2022-01-19T20:40:58] Luis Magalhaes: It could be
[2022-01-19T20:41:14] Luis Magalhaes: Some motor cable could do that ?

[2022-01-20T14:03:29] Paolo ⁭: Its 43Kv , really high , but the toruqe when you have high rpm is really crazy
[2022-01-20T14:03:34] Paolo ⁭: Low rpm = fuck
[2022-01-20T14:03:57] Paolo ⁭: Its same one that use rion, now I know why they use a gigant controller

[2022-01-20T14:17:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: mtpa should not have any effect. it's for ipmsm motors (not the classic kind we have) 😉
[2022-01-20T15:12:45] Artem Bulashev: That is 3 times the size of ubox single
[2022-01-20T15:13:11] Artem Bulashev: And 1/3 more expensive :)

[2022-01-20T15:17:42] Paolo ⁭: Not is vesc problem, it’s by my wrong use. To much power for them. Haven’t s powerful vesc in the market for good price.

[2022-01-20T20:36:25] Happy Giraffe: Benjamin answered my worry about updating Vesc FW with Android app
[2022-01-20T20:36:27] Happy Giraffe: The latest required android api version for the play store makes it really difficult for apps to access the local filesystem, so currently that is not possible. Same problem for logging. I'm working on finding a solution for that. One workaround if you need to update the firmware via bluetooth is to connect the phone to the same network as a computer and activate the "Wireless Bridge to Computer (TCP)" in vesc tool on the phone. It will then show you an ip address that you can connect to it from tcp in desktop vesc tool. Then you can update the firmware from desktop vesc tool. Edit: It does actually work if you use the path Android/data/vedder.vesctool/files Same for log files. You can access that location from a computer connected over USB (at least that works for me)
[2022-01-20T21:02:27] Happy Giraffe: I decided to pin this as I see it very important, especially the edited part
[2022-01-20T21:10:56] Luis Magalhaes: Hi, Luis please continue to use 5.2firmware for sometime, we need some time to change the custom 5.3firmware. already checked on that the 5.3 firmware changed too many comparing with past versions, we also need time to test. and please attention on our website , if we 're ready, will upload it there. thanks Best Regards! Amy
[2022-01-20T21:11:13] Luis Magalhaes: Spintend response 👀
[2022-01-20T21:14:51] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, I cant even put my .bin file into the Android/data/vedder folder
[2022-01-20T21:17:09] Happy Giraffe: It shouldnt take that long from them😳
[2022-01-20T21:19:17] Unknown: What to do when you got a flat tyre and need liquor
[2022-01-20T21:33:21] Luis Magalhaes: They are searching for the solder balls 😂
[2022-01-20T21:34:31] Luis Magalhaes: Ride it till it can't roll 😂😂
[2022-01-20T21:35:09] Mirono escooters: I ride on tubeless empty alot

[2022-01-20T21:39:35] Unknown: And ruin the rim? No thx 😆😂
[2022-01-20T21:40:03] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-20T22:02:17] Happy Giraffe: Tutustu tähän: File Manager - XFolder https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=files.fileexplorer.filemanager
[2022-01-20T22:02:53] Happy Giraffe: For Android 11 phones that block the Android/data/vedder/files path, this app allows you to take the bin file there
[2022-01-20T22:04:54] Happy Giraffe: So, any suggested values here? @SibClimb
[2022-01-20T22:06:16] Happy Giraffe: And how should I calculate the duty cycle? I think at 45kmh I would want the field weakening to kick off
[2022-01-20T22:22:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Need to know your duty cycle at that speed
[2022-01-20T22:22:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Try to put 20A first to test
[2022-01-20T22:23:13] Happy Giraffe: If I spin wheel at 45kmh and watch duty% clock?
[2022-01-20T22:23:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Honestly I don't know 😂
[2022-01-20T22:23:56] Face de Pin Sucé: I think yes
[2022-01-20T22:23:59] Face de Pin Sucé: But not sure
[2022-01-20T22:24:19] Happy Giraffe: I wasn't supposed to be the chosem one to test this!😂😂😂
[2022-01-20T22:24:33] Face de Pin Sucé: But you are :p
[2022-01-20T22:24:55] Happy Giraffe: If I die, I love you guys #nohomo
[2022-01-20T22:26:06] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-01-20T22:28:39] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3 might have some more ideas how to config FiWe
[2022-01-20T22:29:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: fiwe ? what is that ?
[2022-01-20T22:30:23] Happy Giraffe: FieldWeakening sry, Im too laxy to type😅
[2022-01-20T22:30:30] Happy Giraffe: Here
[2022-01-20T22:31:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. no idea. i tried it only for fun.
[2022-01-20T22:32:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: from my point of view, field weakening is pretty useless. too much energy lost.
[2022-01-20T22:33:20] Happy Giraffe: 45kmh for me approx 63% duty
[2022-01-20T22:33:35] Happy Giraffe: I try that and maybe 30A
[2022-01-20T22:34:14] Happy Giraffe: Is that current setting replacing battery current?
[2022-01-20T22:34:29] Happy Giraffe: And not added current on top of already existing one?
[2022-01-20T22:34:48] Face de Pin Sucé: We don't really know x)
[2022-01-20T22:34:53] Face de Pin Sucé: I think it's added
[2022-01-20T22:35:10] Face de Pin Sucé: But we both know it's not my point of view 🥰
[2022-01-20T22:37:16] Happy Giraffe: In air Field weakening doesnt work with 0 current
[2022-01-20T22:37:30] Happy Giraffe: I tried 20A and it gave some strong vibrations
[2022-01-20T22:38:48] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2022-01-20T22:43:24] Face de Pin Sucé: What controller are you using ?
[2022-01-20T22:44:11] rosheee: I use 5.3 and it sux
[2022-01-20T22:44:54] rosheee: Normal sound for me
[2022-01-20T22:45:05] rosheee: I get weird high sound with 5.3
[2022-01-20T22:46:44] Happy Giraffe: Single Ubox
[2022-01-20T22:47:02] Happy Giraffe: I will try it now with 10A
[2022-01-20T22:47:24] Happy Giraffe: I lowered my overall batt current to 40A so if it adds on top I wont blow up the BMS😂
[2022-01-20T23:32:00] Happy Giraffe: Field Weakening: 53.5kmh on same road 45A (40-42A continuous) battery current peak 47.2v Vdrop around max speed 51v resting voltage (stopping at traffic lights) Without field weakening (same road): 52.8kmh 50A (50A continuous )peak battery current 44.6v vdrop 50v rest voltage (stopping to traffic lights)
[2022-01-20T23:33:13] Happy Giraffe: So field weakening had battery with ~1v more charge, used 5Amp less battery current at peak and thus produced also less vdrop at lowest point
[2022-01-20T23:35:02] Paolo ⁭: Field weakening use more current
[2022-01-20T23:35:25] Paolo ⁭: This can’t be possibile if the conditions and settings are the same
[2022-01-20T23:35:42] Happy Giraffe: Field weakening was used with 40A battery + 10A weakening, regular used 50A battery
[2022-01-20T23:36:07] Happy Giraffe: I explained before I reduced normal current the same amount I added weakening
[2022-01-20T23:38:21] Paolo ⁭: If you want more speed add voltage😂
[2022-01-20T23:38:30] Paolo ⁭: Trust me, really useless fw
[2022-01-20T23:38:43] Happy Giraffe: But in this case adding 10A field weakening added 3Amp battery current and then 5A peak
[2022-01-20T23:39:00] Happy Giraffe: I could try 20A next time
[2022-01-20T23:39:08] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but fun testing
[2022-01-20T23:39:43] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I will add another 13s6p in parallel so I get less vdrop and a bit more current (and ton more range🌚)
[2022-01-21T09:31:45] Gigolo Joe: For what controller is that?
[2022-01-21T09:43:07] Happy Giraffe: This was just regarding issue when updating vesc fw with mobile app
[2022-01-21T09:46:39] Gigolo Joe: 🤔 Never had an issue with it
[2022-01-21T09:47:23] Gigolo Joe: Connected via usb once to flash bootloader and since then using vesc apl with Bluetooth only
[2022-01-21T09:47:33] Gigolo Joe: App**
[2022-01-21T09:48:16] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, the folder must be the Vedder one
[2022-01-21T09:48:47] Happy Giraffe: And the android system folder is handily locked by Android 11+ systems
[2022-01-21T09:48:53] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-21T12:11:55] Gigolo Joe: Locked? Never heard of her 😳 👻 Root is da way mah brother

[2022-01-21T12:25:07] Happy Giraffe: Haha, I know. Some bank apps require not to be rooted🌚
[2022-01-21T14:32:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1967@21-01-2022_14-32-08.jpg>
[2022-01-21T14:32:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @PaoloWu , you didn't tell us 😁
[2022-01-21T14:33:27] Mirono escooters: I wier cant we make vesc bigger/cheaper and way more powerful. Why so small
[2022-01-21T14:33:34] Mirono escooters: Smaller means more € no?
[2022-01-21T14:34:38] Paolo ⁭: We’ve posted in another group, Gabriele . He is the engineer 😎
[2022-01-21T14:35:31] Mirono escooters: Gabriele is smort
[2022-01-21T14:36:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2022-01-21T14:40:58] Paolo ⁭: He is engineer, I’m seller & burner😂😂
[2022-01-21T16:23:23] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-21T19:29:15] Mirono escooters: Still love this frame
[2022-01-21T19:29:21] Mirono escooters: Will be thé 20s flipsky frame 😂
[2022-01-21T19:38:36] Happy Giraffe: Another test done with 20A field weakening current (40A battery current), the log data never shows more than 45A battery peak.
[2022-01-21T19:38:58] Paolo ⁭: Then works fine 5.03 firmware in ubox🧐
[2022-01-21T19:39:21] Happy Giraffe: So far its about 3kmh more topspeed than without field weakening, while consuming 5amp less batt current.
[2022-01-21T19:39:34] Happy Giraffe: Next test will be with 30A field weakening
[2022-01-21T19:41:01] Happy Giraffe: I think at 50Amp it will be actually boosting the speed properly
[2022-01-21T20:13:24] Martin Kaktits: what, more efficient?
[2022-01-21T20:13:39] Happy Giraffe: 🌚
[2022-01-21T20:13:44] Mirono escooters: I wonder why
[2022-01-21T20:13:56] Happy Giraffe: More testing to be done, now 30A field current
[2022-01-21T20:14:10] Happy Giraffe: These are low currents afterall
[2022-01-21T20:54:37] Face de Pin Sucé: But you told earlier you reduced battery current before adding field Weakening ?
[2022-01-21T21:00:42] Happy Giraffe: Yes, now I tell you newest test result...1 sec
[2022-01-21T21:01:21] Happy Giraffe: Normal FOC 50A FOC Field 40A + 10/20/30A
[2022-01-21T21:01:58] Face de Pin Sucé: Keep same current, or your tests can't be relevant
[2022-01-21T21:03:17] Happy Giraffe: I absolutely dont do that until I find out how field behaves, I dont wanna exceed 50A batt current now
[2022-01-21T21:05:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Then make normal foc tries with 40A
[2022-01-21T21:05:50] Face de Pin Sucé: So you can compare
[2022-01-21T21:05:55] Happy Giraffe: Yes, will do
[2022-01-21T21:07:51] Happy Giraffe: Seems like its not added current on top of existing battery current, rather its that transformed into field weakening current
[2022-01-21T21:08:10] Happy Giraffe: Still peaks 45A batt at 40A batt + 30A field
[2022-01-21T21:08:32] Happy Giraffe: So next will be 40A field weakening
[2022-01-21T21:08:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe FW doesn't hit because you didn't reached yet the max torque possible at your voltage
[2022-01-21T21:09:13] Happy Giraffe: What do you mean?
[2022-01-21T21:09:52] Happy Giraffe: Not activating field weakening or?
[2022-01-21T21:10:07] Face de Pin Sucé: If you don't reach your max no load speed on load, it means you're far from getting the max torque at your voltage, you can go quicker just by adding more current
[2022-01-21T21:10:49] Face de Pin Sucé: That's how I reach 120Kmh in 60V while I have 125Kmh with no load (120 is my absolute max because of battery sag)
[2022-01-21T21:10:59] Happy Giraffe: Wheel on air is 72kmh, on road its 55kmh topspeed with full bat and no wind
[2022-01-21T21:11:03] Face de Pin Sucé: I push enough current to motors to reach his max speed
[2022-01-21T21:11:23] Face de Pin Sucé: If you push more current you'll go faster
[2022-01-21T21:11:27] Happy Giraffe: I will also do this later when I can double battery current to 100A 5500w😂
[2022-01-21T21:11:49] Face de Pin Sucé: Field weakening can maybe work only when motor already reached max speed ?
[2022-01-21T21:11:55] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't know this part tbh
[2022-01-21T21:12:34] Happy Giraffe: I feel it already doing so, but to be 100% sure I will lower the duty from current 65% to 55%
[2022-01-21T21:12:57] Happy Giraffe: Now field activates at roughly 45kmh, then it will be like 37ish maybe
[2022-01-21T21:21:13] Happy Giraffe: I checked, 87% duty cycle achieved so it surely works as I can also feel it
[2022-01-21T21:21:48] Happy Giraffe: 65% duty cycle is 38kmh according to vesc tool logs
[2022-01-21T21:28:28] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow 40A with fully charged battery, then 50A next
[2022-01-22T09:35:29] Gigolo Joe: What's up y'all, got a question Vesc 75100 on 5.3 acts weird. Wheel spins 90 kmh in air, Won't go past 70 on flat. Check logs, at top speed (67 kmh): phase current is 57 Battery Current is 49 Field weakening is was tested with couple configurations- 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 Amp. No matter what i do, it won't pull more than 50 amps at full speed. Battery is capable of 60 amp. Any suggestions on what setting to check?
[2022-01-22T09:36:55] Gigolo Joe: Field weakening starts at 90% duty cycle and works up to 99%
[2022-01-22T09:39:12] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, I get a little more battery current what I put haha
[2022-01-22T09:39:40] Gigolo Joe: <photos/photo_1969@22-01-2022_09-39-40.jpg>
[2022-01-22T09:39:50] Gigolo Joe: Peak point from the log
[2022-01-22T09:41:13] Gigolo Joe: *Tests done with battery fully charged, and 70% battery. Results stay the same...
[2022-01-22T09:42:22] sombre_enfant: Put more phase and battery if u want to reach more but your battery need to dont sag otherwise you will loose
[2022-01-22T09:49:37] Gigolo Joe: Phase set to 90amp, it doesn't even reach that
[2022-01-22T09:51:50] Gigolo Joe: I mean where's another 30 amps 🤔🤔🤔
[2022-01-22T09:57:34] Paolo ⁭: 90kmh with field weakening or without?
[2022-01-22T10:10:11] Gigolo Joe: With
[2022-01-22T10:10:32] Gigolo Joe: Wheel in air
[2022-01-22T10:11:28] Paolo ⁭: How much without it?
[2022-01-22T10:11:56] Gigolo Joe: Can't remember to be honest, i think it was 57
[2022-01-22T10:12:20] Gigolo Joe: Yes it was 57, and i was hitting 57 kmh flat
[2022-01-22T10:12:54] Paolo ⁭: Normal, field weakening is not efficient option. Differences aren’t big, but you use 4 time more energy 😂
[2022-01-22T10:13:11] sombre_enfant: Then it works u already gain 10kph you cant gain 30😂
[2022-01-22T10:13:17] Gigolo Joe: *Sad noises*
[2022-01-22T10:14:04] Paolo ⁭: Put more voltage if you want higher speed😂
[2022-01-22T10:15:18] Gigolo Joe: Yeah i guess it's the only option, or rewind the motor for more kv
[2022-01-22T10:18:26] Paolo ⁭: Yes, but you will have less torque in low rpm
[2022-01-22T10:29:44] Gigolo Joe: Can live with that
[2022-01-22T10:42:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's good for hair dryers 😁😁
[2022-01-22T10:44:49] Face de Pin Sucé: Remember, you multiply by 4 the power needed when using the field weakening, it's not by adding 10A battery that you'll be able to gain 30Kmh 😂
[2022-01-22T13:08:11] Gigolo Joe: So what you say exactly? I need a battery that can output 150A?
[2022-01-22T13:11:55] Paolo ⁭: Yeah but with which advantage? Really no sense
[2022-01-22T13:13:43] Happy Giraffe: Now Im anxious to try it more😂
[2022-01-22T13:14:10] Gigolo Joe: Imma fucking send it with 100A field weakening and 120 PA
[2022-01-22T13:14:28] Gigolo Joe: <sticker>
[2022-01-22T13:14:29] Mirono escooters: Oof

[2022-01-22T13:18:19] Gigolo Joe: Nah scoot will be fine
[2022-01-22T13:18:40] Gigolo Joe: This motor can handle 6kW without a problem
[2022-01-22T13:18:47] Mirono escooters: And batteey
[2022-01-22T13:19:09] Gigolo Joe: 👁👄👁 This i will find out in the next episode
[2022-01-22T13:19:18] Mirono escooters: 😂😂😂
[2022-01-22T13:19:39] Gigolo Joe: Worst case the bms cuts power
[2022-01-22T13:20:38] Face de Pin Sucé: What motor ?
[2022-01-22T13:21:01] Mirono escooters: Yea fair enough
[2022-01-22T13:21:41] Gigolo Joe: Inokim ox original motor with 12awg phase wires instead of 14
[2022-01-22T13:26:44] Paolo ⁭: Inokim motor is 1000w🤔
[2022-01-22T13:36:44] Gigolo Joe: Yeah yeah And Xiaomi is 250 and it handles 3 kw
[2022-01-22T13:37:15] Martin Kaktits: 🤣
[2022-01-22T13:37:24] Mirono escooters: Hehe 2600w me
[2022-01-22T13:37:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Peak*
[2022-01-22T13:37:48] Face de Pin Sucé: I've seen a friend running 2000W in his Xiaomi Pro motor
[2022-01-22T13:38:02] Face de Pin Sucé: We were riding on a good afternoon, he tried to follow us
[2022-01-22T13:38:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Motor completely burnt
[2022-01-22T13:38:18] Paolo ⁭: Peak only
[2022-01-22T13:38:18] Gigolo Joe: The pro can handle even more Add some statorade and cooling fins and you're golden
[2022-01-22T13:38:44] Face de Pin Sucé: If you feed inokim OxO motor with 6KW for more than 10minutes, we'll all be laughing
[2022-01-22T13:38:51] Paolo ⁭: Inrush can also handle 100A😂
[2022-01-22T13:39:21] Paolo ⁭: 75mm magnet motor are sell as 3500w
[2022-01-22T13:39:25] Gigolo Joe: Give me a battery and a controller that's capable of doing that and I will mah dude
[2022-01-22T13:39:46] Face de Pin Sucé: 70mm ones*
[2022-01-22T13:39:53] Face de Pin Sucé: No you won't
[2022-01-22T13:40:01] Face de Pin Sucé: I've burned enough motors in my life to know you won't
[2022-01-22T13:40:02] Gigolo Joe: Battery prices here are close to scooter price
[2022-01-22T13:40:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Inokim OX motor is not magical
[2022-01-22T13:40:33] sombre_enfant: Anyone got expérience with shdc motors ?
[2022-01-22T13:40:40] Gigolo Joe: Worst case rewind the fucker
[2022-01-22T13:40:53] Paolo ⁭: What brand is your motor?
[2022-01-22T13:41:20] Paolo ⁭: Not each factory declare same rated power
[2022-01-22T13:41:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Come with me with 6KW continuous, I take you there and we measure the distance before it burns
[2022-01-22T13:41:46] Face de Pin Sucé: https://youtu.be/MgAHm_Mr_Lk
[2022-01-22T13:42:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Friend burned his xiaomi motor 2000W there

[2022-01-22T15:11:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Have been arrested twice because of high speed
[2022-01-22T15:11:19] Face de Pin Sucé: But were very lucky
[2022-01-22T15:11:29] Face de Pin Sucé: With a talk, they let me go
[2022-01-22T15:11:47] Happy Giraffe: The only bad thing is they might take our scooters
[2022-01-22T15:11:49] Face de Pin Sucé: They were on motorcycles so no chances to leave them x)
[2022-01-22T15:12:05] Happy Giraffe: I dont give a fuck about 100€ fine but scooter is different😂

[2022-01-22T15:33:28] Unknown: Lol they gave me a ticket for speeding😂😂, 5 times controlled, 2 times they tried to chase me. So 6 to 1 ....
[2022-01-22T15:40:58] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-01-22T15:42:26] Luis Magalhaes: Here its ok for now
[2022-01-22T15:42:49] Luis Magalhaes: But its not good doing high speed in front of them 😂
[2022-01-22T15:45:09] Unknown: The problem is 20 kmh allowed, everything above 30 is visible and I'm the only idiot with a motorcycle helmet on a scooter....that's why I always drive with mirror....to the see the mfka coming....
[2022-01-22T16:09:26] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂, yes but thats stupidity too even at 20kmh in a small scooter if you crash your face can hit the floor 😅
[2022-01-22T16:11:46] Luis Magalhaes: I have seen one in a stock xiaomi the put the front wheel in a hole and hit the floor with his face, his teeth broke and his face was all scratch up, his bill in dentist could buy 2 or 3 good helmets 😅
[2022-01-22T16:18:22] Unknown: I felt 4 times, elbow down, my friend broke his skull bone at 30 kmh another rips broken... So I learnt the hard way, look stupid but protected...
[2022-01-22T16:25:42] Luis Magalhaes: Yup, i did ride xiaomi first without helmet but soon realise that if i crash it could be face on floor 😂

[2022-01-22T16:43:06] Paolo ⁭: 9.5awg for accuracy😆
[2022-01-22T16:43:13] Paolo ⁭: 6mmq right?
[2022-01-22T16:43:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2022-01-22T16:44:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, sold for 9AWG, maybe a little more than 6mm²
[2022-01-22T16:44:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't know
[2022-01-22T16:44:32] Paolo ⁭: You can see it on the cable hahaha
[2022-01-22T16:44:45] Paolo ⁭: Generally 3 x 6mmq , 5 x 0.2mmq
[2022-01-22T16:44:59] Face de Pin Sucé: I buy cables alone

[2022-01-22T16:45:13] Paolo ⁭: Is this 70mm ?
[2022-01-22T16:45:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope, only 65mm this one
[2022-01-22T16:45:38] Paolo ⁭: “Only”

[2022-01-22T16:45:52] Paolo ⁭: Mine is 60mm 😭😂
[2022-01-22T16:47:00] Paolo ⁭: Ive mod it only in external part
[2022-01-22T16:47:18] Mirono escooters: If only i could do more cable through my axle
[2022-01-22T16:47:28] Mirono escooters: I don't think my cables like 150a
[2022-01-22T16:49:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Not very efficient :/
[2022-01-22T16:49:32] Paolo ⁭: Yeah, but better than nothing
[2022-01-22T16:49:32] Face de Pin Sucé: I've seen Weped SST wired like that because people thought it would handle better heat
[2022-01-22T16:49:40] Face de Pin Sucé: It melted right after 🤣
[2022-01-22T16:49:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Inside your motors you can easily put 10AWG wires ;)
[2022-01-22T16:50:31] Face de Pin Sucé: 9AWG on left, 10AWG on right
[2022-01-22T16:50:41] Paolo ⁭: Also is difficult fit original cable bro hahaha
[2022-01-22T16:50:57] Paolo ⁭: I hate open motors, not easy
[2022-01-22T16:51:10] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi magnets luckily not strong lol
[2022-01-22T16:51:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Difficult is the word

[2022-01-22T16:58:50] Mirono escooters: Can you overheat windings? Or you solder so quickly?
[2022-01-22T16:59:56] Face de Pin Sucé: It's okay you have time
[2022-01-22T17:00:22] Face de Pin Sucé: It's pain in the ass to remove the "vernis" on the windings
[2022-01-22T17:01:18] Mirono escooters: Okidoki
[2022-01-22T17:01:24] Mirono escooters: Haha i know. I use sandpaper
[2022-01-22T17:01:32] Mirono escooters: Or a taser 😂😂😂

[2022-01-22T17:06:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Why do you use that ?
[2022-01-22T17:08:37] Unknown: So nothing drops into windings at ending i air compress all possible dirt out... Put statorAde put hylomar and close....
[2022-01-22T17:10:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh okay
[2022-01-22T17:10:57] Face de Pin Sucé: You're right to act like that
[2022-01-22T17:29:59] Paolo ⁭: I can do this in 3 second with 300w iron😂
[2022-01-22T17:31:16] Face de Pin Sucé: First you need to open a motor 😁
[2022-01-22T17:32:49] Paolo ⁭: Already did , but not for change cable hahah, only for add statorade

[2022-01-22T18:26:43] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-22T18:31:00] Paolo ⁭: Have eyes problem
[2022-01-22T18:31:01] Paolo ⁭: 😂
[2022-01-22T18:32:05] Luis Magalhaes: He uses 25S but just charge cells to 3.3v 👀
[2022-01-22T18:32:12] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-01-22T18:32:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Maximum cycles life for his battery b🤣
[2022-01-22T18:32:35] Paolo ⁭: Safe voltage😏
[2022-01-22T18:32:58] Face de Pin Sucé: But 25S with those motors, if wires don't burn because of lot of amps, he will reach easily 140Kmh
[2022-01-22T18:33:29] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂
[2022-01-22T18:33:56] Luis Magalhaes: Crazy speed 😁
[2022-01-22T18:34:22] Luis Magalhaes: Lets see if he has balls to it too 😂
[2022-01-22T18:35:02] Paolo ⁭: Those motor aren’t easy to move
[2022-01-22T18:35:27] Paolo ⁭: You can’t spin them also with 80A square controller
[2022-01-22T18:35:35] Mirono escooters: Wow
[2022-01-22T18:35:42] Mirono escooters: I don't understand how 😂
[2022-01-22T18:35:51] Paolo ⁭: But speed really crazy, more than 100kmh with 18s😅
[2022-01-22T18:36:30] Paolo ⁭: High Kv motor = more torque with high rpm Low Kv motore = more torque in start
[2022-01-22T18:36:43] Mirono escooters: How can it be hard to move
[2022-01-22T18:38:27] Paolo ⁭: Its norm for high Kv motor, the. You need more phase current in start .
[2022-01-22T18:39:01] Paolo ⁭: Its good 100 battery amps and 300A phase amps , but yes phase wire is tiny only 4mm… I’ve asked for do it 6mm
[2022-01-22T18:47:26] Face de Pin Sucé: I know those motors, already installed on Thunder 21S110 Molicel with 7212S kelly
[2022-01-22T18:47:54] Face de Pin Sucé: They won't
[2022-01-22T18:48:11] Face de Pin Sucé: But that's why I mean "if phases wires don't burn"
[2022-01-22T18:48:31] Paolo ⁭: I know what you mean
[2022-01-22T18:48:39] Paolo ⁭: But those motor isn’t designed for this use
[2022-01-22T18:49:13] Paolo ⁭: I’ve tried with 7212 and not work fine. As not work fine I mean front wheel not slip during acceleration
[2022-01-22T18:49:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Bad settings
[2022-01-22T18:49:44] Paolo ⁭: No
[2022-01-22T18:49:51] Paolo ⁭: You have the identical motor?
[2022-01-22T18:49:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2022-01-22T18:49:58] Paolo ⁭: Can show me photo pls?
[2022-01-22T18:50:10] Face de Pin Sucé: Let me find one
[2022-01-22T18:50:15] Paolo ⁭: Than you
[2022-01-22T18:50:38] Paolo ⁭: Because have some similar but not same
[2022-01-22T18:51:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Have exactly the same
[2022-01-22T18:51:50] Face de Pin Sucé: We compared with the Rion directly

[2022-01-22T18:53:28] Paolo ⁭: Did you tested erpm freewheel?
[2022-01-22T18:54:19] Paolo ⁭: But Trust me, just tried with any controller of the world, but start slipping need 250A phase
[2022-01-22T18:54:48] Paolo ⁭: Oh good, I’ve the same idea of controller position
[2022-01-22T18:54:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Honestly, I don't remember
[2022-01-22T18:55:27] Paolo ⁭: Because Rion have customized Kv , and it’s very high for better torque with higher rpm
[2022-01-22T18:55:54] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu whats your freewheel erpm?
[2022-01-22T18:56:43] Paolo ⁭: I don’t remind more, but anyway 2600rpm with 60v (not fully charged)
[2022-01-22T18:56:54] Luis Magalhaes: I tested mine the other day but just checked the speed 😂
[2022-01-22T18:57:05] Face de Pin Sucé: I think it's around this yes, have tested too many motors
[2022-01-22T18:57:08] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2022-01-22T18:57:30] Luis Magalhaes: Mine did 114kmh

[2022-01-22T23:49:11] Happy Giraffe: Check that 5v position is fully put on in ADC module
[2022-01-22T23:49:35] Happy Giraffe: Or does that happen even without it?
[2022-01-22T23:49:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-22T23:50:47] Luis Magalhaes: it was fully put in
[2022-01-22T23:51:00] Luis Magalhaes: now the B side dont do nothingº
[2022-01-22T23:51:07] Luis Magalhaes: looks briked 🤣
[2022-01-22T23:51:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: stm32 fried...
[2022-01-22T23:52:05] Luis Magalhaes: dam
[2022-01-22T23:52:07] Happy Giraffe: Oh shiet
[2022-01-22T23:52:09] Luis Magalhaes: really ?
[2022-01-22T23:52:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: how did you plug the throttle ? what else did you plug on it ? usb with computer ? something else ?
[2022-01-22T23:52:44] Luis Magalhaes: no need to try flashing via can bus ?
[2022-01-22T23:52:59] Luis Magalhaes: no nothing
[2022-01-22T23:53:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: led off is really a bad sign... i don't beleive it's a software failure
[2022-01-22T23:53:27] Luis Magalhaes: the throtlle was 5v gnd and adc1, with the resistor mod
[2022-01-22T23:53:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what resistor mod ?
[2022-01-22T23:54:04] Luis Magalhaes: to reduce adc1 input voltage
[2022-01-22T23:54:18] Luis Magalhaes: it was 2.8V max
[2022-01-22T23:54:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: simply 2k/1k or the spintend module ?
[2022-01-22T23:54:41] Luis Magalhaes: first one
[2022-01-22T23:55:15] Luis Magalhaes: i didnt change anything, it start failing at slow speeds
[2022-01-22T23:55:30] Luis Magalhaes: and it was geting worst
[2022-01-22T23:55:40] Luis Magalhaes: could be the smt there ?
[2022-01-22T23:55:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok. any discontinuity possible on that wiring ? any adc surge, and you are almost sure to fry the stm32
[2022-01-22T23:56:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: smt ?
[2022-01-22T23:56:31] Luis Magalhaes: stm sorry
[2022-01-22T23:57:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: to know for sure, you need to try to reflash it with a stlink.
[2022-01-22T23:57:13] Luis Magalhaes: 🙈
[2022-01-22T23:57:25] Luis Magalhaes: ok
[2022-01-22T23:57:31] Luis Magalhaes: https://spintend.com/blogs/news/6-steps-to-flash-bricked-vesc-without-programmer-in-easy-way
[2022-01-22T23:57:35] Luis Magalhaes: can follow this ?
[2022-01-22T23:57:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but in 95% cases, it the stm32 which is dead.
[2022-01-22T23:58:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: first, i would check if the stm32 is not in short circuit
[2022-01-22T23:59:14] Luis Magalhaes: how can i do that ?
[2022-01-22T23:59:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: check resistance on the dead side between 5v and gnd, then 3.3v.and gnd
[2022-01-23T00:00:05] Luis Magalhaes: ok 1 minute
[2022-01-23T00:00:41] Mirono escooters: Oof expensive joke if it's Ded
[2022-01-23T00:03:17] Luis Magalhaes: 21.5kR 5v to gnd
[2022-01-23T00:03:30] Luis Magalhaes: the 3.3v is the vcc pin right?
[2022-01-23T00:04:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's the main reason why i want to use only can bus to interface anything on vesc : 1/ it a differential bus much less subject to interferences/voltage spikes 2/ there is a component between the bus and the stm32... even if manage to you fry it (and it will be difficult), it's much easier/cheaper to replace it.
[2022-01-23T00:04:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think so..
[2022-01-23T00:04:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: good
[2022-01-23T00:04:31] Luis Magalhaes: fuck
[2022-01-23T00:04:51] Luis Magalhaes: 0.5
[2022-01-23T00:04:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: bad
[2022-01-23T00:05:00] Luis Magalhaes: vcc to grd
[2022-01-23T00:05:22] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-01-23T00:05:56] Luis Magalhaes: vcc is on shortcircuit right?
[2022-01-23T00:06:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think so
[2022-01-23T00:06:19] Luis Magalhaes: i wasnt even using vcc 😅
[2022-01-23T00:06:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and usually, it's the stm32 😓
[2022-01-23T00:07:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i also managed to fry the can tranceiver, but accentally inject 50v on it 🤣🤣
[2022-01-23T00:08:08] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-01-23T00:08:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1 min... i'll measure vcc/gnd resistance on mine
[2022-01-23T00:08:47] Luis Magalhaes: this should be a pain in the ass to change right ?
[2022-01-23T00:09:09] Mirono escooters: Stm is ok doable
[2022-01-23T00:09:15] Mirono escooters: It's big
[2022-01-23T00:09:15] Luis Magalhaes: 4.3kR at the other side
[2022-01-23T00:10:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 4.3k on mine
[2022-01-23T00:10:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i guess your adc module was plugged on this side ?
[2022-01-23T00:10:59] Luis Magalhaes: yes
[2022-01-23T00:11:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: first, you need to find it 😅😅😅
[2022-01-23T00:11:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i had one spare, but it already went to repair a spintend
[2022-01-23T00:11:47] Luis Magalhaes: but not even using the 3.3v should not be the 5v ? 🤣
[2022-01-23T00:12:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope.
[2022-01-23T00:13:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the whole stm32 is only powered in 3.3v. if something goes wrong and fry the stm32, the component itself can become a 'short circuit'
[2022-01-23T00:13:18] Luis Magalhaes: Have these 2 😂😂
[2022-01-23T00:13:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: give me 😁😁
[2022-01-23T00:14:16] Face de Pin Sucé: MCU dead
[2022-01-23T00:14:35] Luis Magalhaes: They look burn 😂
[2022-01-23T00:14:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: looool. @SibClimb is used to it 🤣
[2022-01-23T00:15:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not mandatory burnt
[2022-01-23T00:15:19] Face de Pin Sucé: A lot x)
[2022-01-23T00:16:05] Mirono escooters: How
[2022-01-23T00:16:07] Paolo ⁭: Common problem of ubox
[2022-01-23T00:16:33] Mirono escooters: Rip 300€?
[2022-01-23T00:16:50] Paolo ⁭: I can send you my dead ubox single😂
[2022-01-23T00:17:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i would say all vescs 😓 almost every vesc have no protection for adc, uart, halls & co. any mistake, and it's toasted.
[2022-01-23T00:17:50] Paolo ⁭: We’re have protection diode
[2022-01-23T00:18:05] Paolo ⁭: After burnt one prototype by hall short
[2022-01-23T00:18:13] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-01-23T00:18:18] Mirono escooters: I find that stupid especially for thé price
[2022-01-23T00:18:22] Paolo ⁭: Added also some tvs
[2022-01-23T00:18:52] Paolo ⁭: For 1cm more, just add protection 😂
[2022-01-23T00:19:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but it's a design issue, not the vesc software. everybody is copying the minimalistic design of vedder without thinking "what could go wrong when the user will plug it"
[2022-01-23T00:20:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: as i always says, when it correctly plugged, you have 99% chance it will last (if you don't play too much with currents).
[2022-01-23T00:20:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and rearmable fuses ?
[2022-01-23T00:21:29] Luis Magalhaes: 1.18kR 5.5v to grd 4.09kR vcc to grd 1.18KR 25.5KR
[2022-01-23T00:21:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seems pretty good.
[2022-01-23T00:22:00] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, a custom vesc from our communitiws would be nice. I hope the people who are working on it have a successfull attempt👍
[2022-01-23T00:22:34] Luis Magalhaes: so i could try swap the 2 ?
[2022-01-23T00:22:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's a lot of work of you want to achieve 'high current' vesc. many tried....and failed
[2022-01-23T00:22:54] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-01-23T00:23:04] Happy Giraffe: I have hope😂
[2022-01-23T00:23:25] Mirono escooters: If i would have knowledge i would try
[2022-01-23T00:23:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: swap stm32 ? if you have the equipment and know what you are doing, sure !
[2022-01-23T00:24:18] Luis Magalhaes: 🙈
[2022-01-23T00:24:30] Luis Magalhaes: should use hot gun right?
[2022-01-23T00:25:02] Luis Magalhaes: never did something like this only small things but with solderiron
[2022-01-23T00:25:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: minimal equipement : kapton, flux, hot air gun, solder paste, good soldering iron and good eyes (or binocular) 🤣
[2022-01-23T00:26:43] Luis Magalhaes: 😂, im going to youtube formation...
[2022-01-23T00:26:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: @Foujiwara does it. 😁
[2022-01-23T00:27:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for a first time, i wouldn't recommend suck operation. it can quickly be a mess.
[2022-01-23T00:28:29] Happy Giraffe: Louis Rossman says : not possible to use too much solder paste, then he does full bukkake of it and Im about to throw up😂
[2022-01-23T00:29:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: before replacing my fiest stm32, i already soldered a lot of simpler smt components.... and even then, i failed. hot air gun too powerfull, some components moved (even with kapton), and i wasn't able to to find which one goes where.
[2022-01-23T00:29:36] Paolo ⁭: Luis take kelly or sabvoton and don’t think bore!😂
[2022-01-23T00:29:57] Happy Giraffe: Only if they fit on my xiaomi😭
[2022-01-23T00:29:58] Paolo ⁭: Its easy bro
[2022-01-23T00:30:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol. i've just read a guy on fb who burnt his kelly 😁
[2022-01-23T00:30:17] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-23T00:30:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: looooooool
[2022-01-23T00:31:22] Paolo ⁭: Im not mean other controller can’t burn, but is easiest to burn actually market’s vesc than other motorcycle controller
[2022-01-23T00:32:08] Happy Giraffe: For summer I get metallic xiaomi bottom plate and bolt Single Ubox tightly to that
[2022-01-23T00:32:15] Luis Magalhaes: ok😂, thanks again for the help mate 👌
[2022-01-23T00:32:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1990@23-01-2022_00-32-25.jpg>
[2022-01-23T00:32:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also such issues 🤣
[2022-01-23T00:32:50] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-01-23T00:33:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_1991@23-01-2022_00-33-06.jpg>
[2022-01-23T00:33:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and thoses
[2022-01-23T00:33:33] Happy Giraffe: Im getting ptsd from solder ball burned Ubox, cya gotta go😂😂
[2022-01-23T00:34:32] Paolo ⁭: Ive made a v1 smart elec
[2022-01-23T00:34:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i agree ... 😓
[2022-01-23T00:34:50] Paolo ⁭: You can’t understand how is difficult to solder 0402 components😂
[2022-01-23T00:35:02] Paolo ⁭: I’ve did it without air gun hahaha
[2022-01-23T00:35:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh ! good !
[2022-01-23T00:35:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol
[2022-01-23T00:36:32] Paolo ⁭: With a simple ts100
[2022-01-23T00:37:31] Mirono escooters: That's thé plan of @PurpleAmI
[2022-01-23T00:38:50] Paolo ⁭: For summer I will not use more or I will melt phase cable @SibClimb 😂
[2022-01-23T00:48:16] Martin Kaktits: haha ye thats excly what i wnted to do :) I have normal xiaomi controller in it atm, but i wanna fit max battery, so controller will be pushed out of its resting place and I figure flipping it upside down allows for most efficient space filling and cooling
[2022-01-23T01:44:37] rosheee: Reset no prob
[2022-01-23T01:44:45] rosheee: Do not need
[2022-01-23T01:45:01] rosheee: U have to connect 1 to 2 with canbus cable and then use vesc tool on pc
[2022-01-23T01:46:41] Luis Magalhaes: Yes but looks like the stm32 is broken
[2022-01-23T01:46:51] rosheee: Oh
[2022-01-23T01:47:08] Luis Magalhaes: Its sortcircuit the vcc and grd
[2022-01-23T01:47:11] rosheee: What u tried?
[2022-01-23T01:47:14] rosheee: Omg no
[2022-01-23T01:47:15] rosheee: 😢😢
[2022-01-23T01:47:21] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-23T01:47:38] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-01-23T01:48:19] rosheee: My first one showed after forgot to shutdown -110% throttle and 82V instead of 63 xD
[2022-01-23T01:48:27] rosheee: But warranty
[2022-01-23T01:48:30] rosheee: Ask amy
[2022-01-23T01:48:44] rosheee: U got v1?
[2022-01-23T01:48:58] rosheee: Maybe u can send yours back and i take it over my warranty ^^
[2022-01-23T01:49:04] rosheee: Then u receive v2
[2022-01-23T01:50:28] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-23T01:52:13] Luis Magalhaes: Yes its v1 type C
[2022-01-23T01:52:47] Luis Magalhaes: No warranty now 😂
[2022-01-23T01:53:36] Luis Magalhaes: I was really liking the vesc software and the ubox was runing very good with 75300
[2022-01-23T01:53:56] Luis Magalhaes: Lets see if i can bring him alive again
[2022-01-23T01:54:33] Luis Magalhaes: If i cant i think im trying kelly 👀
[2022-01-23T01:54:39] Paolo ⁭: Buy rion vesc
[2022-01-23T01:54:47] Paolo ⁭: But 400$ each more custom😂
[2022-01-23T01:54:52] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb with kelly can i burn a motor? 😂
[2022-01-23T01:54:57] Paolo ⁭: But hardware seem good
[2022-01-23T01:55:02] Luis Magalhaes: Too mutch 😂
[2022-01-23T01:55:14] Paolo ⁭: Sabvoton ;)
[2022-01-23T01:55:22] Luis Magalhaes: Too big 😂
[2022-01-23T01:55:33] Luis Magalhaes: But seems good
[2022-01-23T01:55:36] Paolo ⁭: 👎
[2022-01-23T01:55:54] Luis Magalhaes: Sabvoton runs sensorless?
[2022-01-23T01:55:54] Paolo ⁭: For wolf is ok😂
[2022-01-23T01:56:14] Paolo ⁭: Sensorless 🤮🤮
[2022-01-23T01:56:18] Luis Magalhaes: I was thinking of ykz before ubox 😂
[2022-01-23T01:56:24] Paolo ⁭: But yes be sure
[2022-01-23T01:56:27] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-01-23T01:56:42] Luis Magalhaes: Have to put sensors in motors and better cable
[2022-01-23T01:56:57] Paolo ⁭: I still don’t know why they ask factory to don’t put hall sensor
[2022-01-23T01:57:25] Luis Magalhaes: Money?
[2022-01-23T01:57:27] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-23T01:57:44] Luis Magalhaes: The gt i think it has halls
[2022-01-23T01:57:48] Luis Magalhaes: On the sinewave
[2022-01-23T01:58:04] Luis Magalhaes: The minimotors i dont know if they put them
[2022-01-23T01:58:17] Paolo ⁭: Cost the same xd
[2022-01-23T01:58:35] Luis Magalhaes: So.. stupids 😂
[2022-01-23T01:59:22] Paolo ⁭: If sabvoton is too big for wolf…
[2022-01-23T01:59:40] Paolo ⁭: You need know guys put 2 x yuyang king into xiaomi frame
[2022-01-23T02:01:01] rosheee: Omfg that new vesc version
[2022-01-23T02:01:18] rosheee: Something is strange when setup xD with mobile
[2022-01-23T02:09:53] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-01-23T02:18:29] rosheee: 5.3 on spintend is worst
[2022-01-23T02:28:55] rosheee: Cant downgrade...omfg
[2022-01-23T02:30:28] Paolo ⁭: This is impossibile
[2022-01-23T02:30:41] Paolo ⁭: What errors return?
[2022-01-23T02:32:56] rosheee: Now stlink style
[2022-01-23T02:32:59] rosheee: No error
[2022-01-23T02:33:02] rosheee: XD stay on 5.3

[2022-01-23T02:40:38] Happy Giraffe: Is there a webpage or something about this?
[2022-01-23T02:41:00] Paolo ⁭: Tronicsystems.com
[2022-01-23T02:41:41] Happy Giraffe: Thanks👍
[2022-01-23T02:42:14] rosheee: Back 2 normal...ahhh
[2022-01-23T02:48:34] rosheee: Small inrunner, right?
[2022-01-23T02:52:08] Paolo ⁭: ebike hub

[2022-01-23T03:15:04] rosheee: Shit broken
[2022-01-23T03:17:10] rosheee: Or maybe because switch went from 3.3v to 5v
[2022-01-23T03:17:13] rosheee: Throttle busted
[2022-01-23T03:17:14] rosheee: <sticker>

[2022-01-24T16:04:34] rosheee: And thats wood?
[2022-01-24T16:04:44] Unknown: Nope yet
[2022-01-24T16:04:46] rosheee: Something which cools would be nice
[2022-01-24T16:04:49] rosheee: Ah
[2022-01-24T16:05:10] Unknown: Fire retardant filament with oven spray coated
[2022-01-24T16:05:33] rosheee: Prototyping
[2022-01-24T16:05:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😂
[2022-01-24T16:05:57] Unknown: I have 12v converter and three turbines installed
[2022-01-24T17:20:13] rosheee: Then i reconfigured the vesc again..flashed...danced..wend with the laptop out if the room or even away while flashing and detecting... maxed the 100A version to the max And lol
[2022-01-24T17:22:40] rosheee: It seems to work (2746636x today xD)
[2022-01-24T19:44:15] Happy Giraffe: Single ubox mosfets hit 67°c and thermal throttle...does battery current heat them more than motor current or? (Im also thinking about upgrading the thermal pads)
[2022-01-24T20:07:05] Paolo ⁭: G30 36v 😂👌
[2022-01-24T20:14:52] Federico77: 👍
[2022-01-24T20:15:44] Paolo ⁭: Dovrei provarlo in 13s, correrà abbastanza secondo me😁
[2022-01-24T20:48:37] Federico77: Ti volevo chiedere cosa erano quei cavi😂
[2022-01-24T20:49:09] Paolo ⁭: Quali
[2022-01-24T20:49:18] Federico77: L'accelerazione com'è??
[2022-01-24T20:49:50] Federico77: <photos/photo_2037@24-01-2022_20-49-50.jpg>
[2022-01-24T20:49:58] Paolo ⁭: Ma c’è il cruscotto, capisci da la
[2022-01-24T20:50:14] Federico77: Questi connettori che vedo
[2022-01-24T20:50:25] Happy Giraffe: Almost passed the runner😂
[2022-01-24T20:50:25] Paolo ⁭: Per la seconda 10s4p che è staccat per caricarsi più veloce
[2022-01-24T20:51:33] Federico77: Sembra dalla Dash che spinga forte dai 20 ai 35
[2022-01-24T21:16:06] zekoslav mrkva: uspesso feracio matura palambero tika
[2022-01-24T21:21:29] Federico77: Ma un conto è accelerare partendo da 10km/h un altro partendo da fermo, almeno correggimi se sbaglio
[2022-01-24T21:22:23] Paolo ⁭: Hai ragione, rifaccio video domani
[2022-01-24T21:23:37] Federico77: Comunque spinge bene a quanto si vede
[2022-01-24T21:24:12] Federico77: Tu è da molto che non provi un g30 a 36v originale?? Per fare un piccolo confronto
[2022-01-24T21:24:26] Federico77: A sensazioni
[2022-01-24T21:24:33] Paolo ⁭: Sinceramente su non riesco differenziare
[2022-01-24T21:24:43] Paolo ⁭: Ormai il mio fa 100 o oltre e non ci capisco più hahaha
[2022-01-24T21:25:53] Federico77: Infatti per questo chiedevo se era molto che non provavi,ma quando sei abituato a certi mezzi tu sembra no tutti fermi gli altri😂
[2022-01-24T21:43:03] Unknown: If stm32 breaks, how do you know it did? 😆
[2022-01-24T21:46:19] Luis Magalhaes: Mine did
[2022-01-24T21:46:34] Luis Magalhaes: First it wont work 😂
[2022-01-24T21:46:45] Artem Bulashev: It will be cracked in 2 halfs
[2022-01-24T21:47:13] Luis Magalhaes: Then @koxx3 told me to mesure the resistance between 5v and grd and then 3.3v and grd
[2022-01-24T21:47:23] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-24T21:47:37] Luis Magalhaes: @artBula mine looks new 😂
[2022-01-24T21:48:19] Unknown: Well thing is, my adc broke "i guessed" so i bought a new one, and it keeps on reading the same voltage 🤔
[2022-01-24T21:48:38] Unknown: Even though it's all connected and setup correctly
[2022-01-24T21:49:30] Unknown: <photos/photo_1025@10-09-2021_12-10-45.jpg>
[2022-01-24T21:50:28] Luis Magalhaes: Mine is really dead, no light for the b side and dont detect the vesc Bluetooth, and on usb it says unknown version
[2022-01-24T21:52:01] Unknown: I just mean the adc part :o my vesc works totally fine, with ppm controller, but i'd much rather use adc again..
[2022-01-24T21:52:49] Unknown: It's like going from .95v to .98v on full throttle and brake doesn't do any movements at all
[2022-01-24T21:53:05] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2022-01-24T21:53:08] Mirono escooters: Not good
[2022-01-24T21:54:41] Luis Magalhaes: Your better then me so 🤣
[2022-01-24T21:56:55] Unknown: Ye well not helped 😆
[2022-01-24T21:57:20] Unknown: Is it throttle, is it brake? Is it adc? Or is it within vesc itself 🤷🏼‍♂️
[2022-01-24T21:57:31] Unknown: How the fuck do i know 😂😂
[2022-01-24T21:57:38] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-01-24T21:57:55] Luis Magalhaes: Would love to help you man but dont have knowledge 😅
[2022-01-24T21:58:03] Unknown: I feel you haha
[2022-01-24T21:58:54] Unknown: Anyone else? I figured since i tried replacing adc converter, i'd replace the brake as this does nothong at all?
[2022-01-24T21:59:21] Unknown: Then again adc board woth only throttle connected does not work, same with brake on adc board
[2022-01-24T21:59:34] Unknown: Brand new board connected properly
[2022-01-24T22:15:42] rosheee: Yes
[2022-01-24T22:16:58] rosheee: What settings?
[2022-01-24T22:38:04] Happy Giraffe: 50A batt 120A phasw
[2022-01-24T22:39:34] Paolo ⁭: Motor
[2022-01-24T22:40:11] Paolo ⁭: If you use more with fixed speed at high rpm battery
[2022-01-24T22:40:42] Paolo ⁭: If you do many start stop then motor
[2022-01-24T22:48:27] rosheee: and so hot o.O?
[2022-01-24T22:51:58] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, city center riding
[2022-01-24T22:52:53] rosheee: u use with field weakening?
[2022-01-24T22:53:06] rosheee: how hard have u settet up the throttle? rampup? ewverything that generates heat?
[2022-01-24T22:53:11] rosheee: how warm was it?
[2022-01-24T22:53:57] rosheee: ^^' u have alu/steel bottom plate?
[2022-01-24T22:54:21] rosheee: yah ok vesc is smaller ^^'
[2022-01-24T22:55:55] rosheee: mostly uphill ^^'
[2022-01-24T22:57:42] Paolo ⁭: Spintend have not good heat dissipation
[2022-01-24T22:58:22] rosheee: even @ summer i reached not thermalthrottle of it battery itself went 40+C but never had that
[2022-01-24T22:58:30] rosheee: dual maybe besser than single
[2022-01-24T22:59:27] Paolo ⁭: Better solution for high heat dissipation
[2022-01-24T23:00:34] Artem Bulashev: What is the IR of this one ? Better than UBOX original once ?
[2022-01-24T23:00:56] Paolo ⁭: No, higher resistance , but much much better heat dissipation
[2022-01-24T23:02:09] Paolo ⁭: Ubox mosfet has bigger die, but anyway bad dissipation, The heat point is the drain of smd.
[2022-01-24T23:02:25] rosheee: u have log of your temps?
[2022-01-24T23:02:56] rosheee: i never managed to get over 40 degrees ^^'
[2022-01-24T23:06:16] Artem Bulashev: Hi interesting. So they dissipate better but they also produce more heat. Seems like less than optimal :) my not to take fets that are lower resistance ?
[2022-01-24T23:08:02] Paolo ⁭: If you have the same package yes!
[2022-01-24T23:08:39] Paolo ⁭: With to247 format you can fix the mosfet with big aluminum surface with screw
[2022-01-24T23:09:02] Mirono escooters: Bolt to frame. It's 1 big heatsink
[2022-01-24T23:09:04] Paolo ⁭: The only dissipation area of smd package mos is the pcb
[2022-01-24T23:09:55] Paolo ⁭: If you try with ubox 250A motor current it will get fire with 1.1mohm, with this mosfet 2mohm will work great
[2022-01-24T23:10:36] rosheee: yep i cnc metal bottomplate and took the paint away from vesc + heatpads if needed
[2022-01-24T23:16:59] Artem Bulashev: People did and many times actually as it is for short time. With air cooling actually works sustainable
[2022-01-24T23:17:17] Artem Bulashev: Nevertheless less interesting point
[2022-01-24T23:25:14] Paolo ⁭: I’ve put also nitrogen but not effect 😂
[2022-01-24T23:32:42] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-01-25T00:28:43] Artem Bulashev: 🙃👍👍
[2022-01-25T00:29:06] rosheee: but managed to get 3 caps exploding
[2022-01-25T00:29:09] rosheee: @# flipsky
[2022-01-25T00:29:11] rosheee: over 320A XD
[2022-01-25T00:29:26] rosheee: shine bright like a diamond
[2022-01-25T00:29:33] rosheee: SOOOO
[2022-01-25T00:29:38] Artem Bulashev: What else would you expect from Flipsky lol
[2022-01-25T00:29:43] rosheee: crapsky
[2022-01-25T00:29:52] rosheee: i posted @ instagram they were NOT amused eheh
[2022-01-25T00:29:57] rosheee: i open my 100V + 2x 75V v2 ubox soon
[2022-01-25T00:30:00] Artem Bulashev: Ubox can barely take such an will need some active cooling
[2022-01-25T00:30:54] rosheee: Or this
[2022-01-25T00:31:00] rosheee: 24 degrees life
[2022-01-25T00:31:09] rosheee: <photos/photo_2042@25-01-2022_00-31-09.jpg>
[2022-01-25T00:31:37] Artem Bulashev: Looks like thiiin wires 3) what is it ?
[2022-01-25T00:32:04] rosheee: these are ubox v2 75V
[2022-01-25T00:32:23] Artem Bulashev: Make sure you clean pcbs on all sides! 😀
[2022-01-25T00:32:28] rosheee: but gonna change cables as well
[2022-01-25T00:32:30] Artem Bulashev: Solder balls ⚽️ warning
[2022-01-25T00:32:33] Artem Bulashev: 🤝
[2022-01-25T00:32:34] rosheee: i've never cleaned
[2022-01-25T00:32:38] rosheee: what should i use?
[2022-01-25T00:32:44] Artem Bulashev: With those you have to
[2022-01-25T00:32:47] Artem Bulashev: See photos above
[2022-01-25T00:33:20] rosheee: For shine?
[2022-01-25T00:33:49] rosheee: Omg
[2022-01-25T00:33:55] rosheee: I dont wanna open
[2022-01-25T00:33:56] Artem Bulashev: Saw it ?
[2022-01-25T00:34:03] rosheee: Yaa
[2022-01-25T00:34:06] Artem Bulashev: Take magnifying glass
[2022-01-25T00:34:26] rosheee: Btw anyone designed or has 3d printbox for thst throttle filter from spintend?
[2022-01-25T00:34:28] Artem Bulashev: Once cleaned it will be bulletproof
[2022-01-25T00:35:04] rosheee: Magnifying glas..ahaa xD lol
[2022-01-25T00:35:04] Artem Bulashev: Neh just shrink wrap and superglue the switches I correct position!
[2022-01-25T00:35:24] Paolo ⁭: Ubox have bad contact by case to mosfet die, is useless also if you will put nitrogen
[2022-01-25T00:35:26] rosheee: Habe no space under and on vesc It is in my frame
[2022-01-25T00:35:42] rosheee: Omg thx god my v1 box still working
[2022-01-25T00:35:54] Paolo ⁭: 🍼
[2022-01-25T00:35:57] Artem Bulashev: Because that board will die if it switches from one position to other while powered on
[2022-01-25T00:36:16] Artem Bulashev: Yeah so is mine. But I cleaned it when I got it a year ago
[2022-01-25T00:36:30] rosheee: i used the power of isotape :D
[2022-01-25T00:36:31] Artem Bulashev: Also it was not that bad back than with solder balls
[2022-01-25T00:36:59] Artem Bulashev: Super glue it for real ;-)
[2022-01-25T00:37:12] rosheee: where xD?
[2022-01-25T00:37:15] rosheee: i fear glue
[2022-01-25T00:37:23] Artem Bulashev: The switches
[2022-01-25T00:37:25] rosheee: my friend used it for my XT90s
[2022-01-25T00:37:37] Artem Bulashev: Ohh wait
[2022-01-25T00:37:40] Artem Bulashev: What board?
[2022-01-25T00:37:46] rosheee: connector battery <-chargerport->vesc it fucking melted
[2022-01-25T00:37:46] Artem Bulashev: I was thinking adc board
[2022-01-25T00:37:51] rosheee: yes adc board XD
[2022-01-25T00:38:22] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that you need to put a drop of super glue on plastic switches so that they don’t accedenty switch
[2022-01-25T00:38:38] rosheee: the 3.3v - 5v?
[2022-01-25T00:38:43] rosheee: i just have throttle connected XD
[2022-01-25T00:38:51] Artem Bulashev: Poor connector choice Xt60 is nominal power 30a, remember that
[2022-01-25T00:39:00] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-01-25T00:39:02] rosheee: i used xt90
[2022-01-25T00:39:07] rosheee: wait i show u
[2022-01-25T00:39:40] Artem Bulashev: 45-60a yeah, if original dual 45a battery limit setting can melt it
[2022-01-25T00:39:50] Paolo ⁭: 45 nominal
[2022-01-25T00:40:03] Artem Bulashev: If not original than dual 30a will melt it
[2022-01-25T00:40:18] rosheee: wait wait 😆now we mix up things
[2022-01-25T00:40:25] rosheee: he took 2x xt90
[2022-01-25T00:40:26] Artem Bulashev: Amass is the original manufacturer
[2022-01-25T00:40:36] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-01-25T00:40:37] rosheee: ok i open the scooter cD
[2022-01-25T00:40:48] Paolo ⁭: But ubox is 2x100
[2022-01-25T00:40:50] Paolo ⁭: 😱
[2022-01-25T00:41:03] Artem Bulashev: Yeap fun isn’t it 😂
[2022-01-25T00:41:42] Artem Bulashev: Xt90 gets super hot with dual 40a battery limit set on both halves of the ubox
[2022-01-25T00:41:55] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I replaced with as150u
[2022-01-25T00:42:16] Paolo ⁭: Lol I not use connector
[2022-01-25T00:42:20] Artem Bulashev: Also such heat can account for 20% power loss easily
[2022-01-25T00:42:25] Paolo ⁭: Just terminal and not power loses
[2022-01-25T00:42:33] Artem Bulashev: 🥰🥰😍
[2022-01-25T00:43:00] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I figured 8mm bullets of as150u will do the trick with no losses :) it’s around 100a nominal
[2022-01-25T00:43:43] Paolo ⁭: As150 is 6mm 😳
[2022-01-25T00:43:56] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-01-25T00:43:58] rosheee: Shit melted xD
[2022-01-25T00:44:16] rosheee: <photos/photo_2044@25-01-2022_00-44-16.jpg>
[2022-01-25T00:44:45] Artem Bulashev: Oh you know why?
[2022-01-25T00:44:46] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2022-01-25T00:45:04] Artem Bulashev: I bet you interconnected them with no wire but just solder
[2022-01-25T00:45:10] rosheee: same as like heatshrink melted from battery
[2022-01-25T00:45:16] rosheee: it is just solder
[2022-01-25T00:45:16] rosheee: XED
[2022-01-25T00:45:17] rosheee: XD
[2022-01-25T00:45:26] rosheee: wire only for charging soldered on
[2022-01-25T00:45:30] Paolo ⁭: I put all external
[2022-01-25T00:45:38] Artem Bulashev: Solder is terrible conductor, worse than steel
[2022-01-25T00:45:46] Paolo ⁭: Easiest for save when get fire😂
[2022-01-25T00:45:50] rosheee: XD
[2022-01-25T00:45:58] rosheee: but guys...i asked that question ...at least 10
[2022-01-25T00:46:07] rosheee: times ^^
[2022-01-25T00:46:11] Artem Bulashev: You found just connect charging wire at the same place as main power cables entered of of the plugs
[2022-01-25T00:46:18] rosheee: can i use a AWG32 for throttle + start button?
[2022-01-25T00:46:22] Artem Bulashev: No need for such construction
[2022-01-25T00:46:32] rosheee: 2x3 wires every wire is awg32
[2022-01-25T00:46:39] rosheee: cat6a lan cable ^^
[2022-01-25T00:46:55] Artem Bulashev: Should be ok
[2022-01-25T00:47:05] rosheee: perfect xD
[2022-01-25T00:47:14] rosheee: ❤️❤️❤️ THANKS
[2022-01-25T00:47:42] Artem Bulashev: As150 is 7mm
[2022-01-25T00:47:51] Artem Bulashev: As150u has 8mm
[2022-01-25T00:48:30] Artem Bulashev: I think
[2022-01-25T00:48:35] Artem Bulashev: Let me double check
[2022-01-25T00:49:50] Paolo ⁭: I’m just seen by xt150 by amass
[2022-01-25T00:49:56] Paolo ⁭: Just think same size
[2022-01-25T00:50:06] Paolo ⁭: I prefer QS8
[2022-01-25T00:50:25] Paolo ⁭: But now I love copper terminal 😁
[2022-01-25T00:51:03] rosheee: pics pls
[2022-01-25T00:51:19] rosheee: omg
[2022-01-25T00:51:34] rosheee: XD THX GOD I OPENED IT
[2022-01-25T00:52:41] rosheee: no solderballs so far
[2022-01-25T00:53:40] rosheee: <photos/photo_2045@25-01-2022_00-53-40.jpg>
[2022-01-25T00:54:08] Artem Bulashev: https://media.suzakugiken.jp/ec/AMASS/AMASS_Catalogue_2020.pdf
[2022-01-25T00:55:05] rosheee: so to disassemble it -» ..
[2022-01-25T00:55:59] rosheee: losen all screws then take it out
[2022-01-25T00:56:58] Artem Bulashev: As150 is 65a nominal Va as150u 80a nominal, big jump I know as150 is 7mm, that’s why I think as150u is 8mm but it may be design of the bullet and resistor that allows it for higher nominal
[2022-01-25T00:58:19] rosheee: jesus
[2022-01-25T00:58:50] rosheee: so to disassemble it -»
[2022-01-25T00:58:56] rosheee: Now out?
[2022-01-25T00:59:01] Paolo ⁭: Got QS8 and you will be sure is 8mm hahaha
[2022-01-25T01:00:52] rosheee: XD HEELP
[2022-01-25T01:01:11] Artem Bulashev: Lol :)
[2022-01-25T01:01:11] rosheee: how i get the shit off xD?
[2022-01-25T01:01:29] Artem Bulashev: Man it’s just some screws and seperate
[2022-01-25T01:01:36] rosheee: ya sorry xD
[2022-01-25T01:01:44] rosheee: then take the on on top off?
[2022-01-25T01:03:34] Artem Bulashev: No offense but if you can’t take it apart you probably should not :)) it is strength forword as highway 66
[2022-01-25T01:03:54] rosheee: it doesn't go off XD
[2022-01-25T01:03:58] rosheee: me so retard
[2022-01-25T01:04:07] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2022-01-25T01:05:21] Artem Bulashev: Did you seperate logic board from power board?
[2022-01-25T01:09:49] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-01-25T01:09:52] rosheee: not yet
[2022-01-25T01:10:00] rosheee: but looks clean af
[2022-01-25T01:10:21] rosheee: and i need new thermalpads omg
[2022-01-25T01:11:48] Artem Bulashev: Why?
[2022-01-25T01:12:08] rosheee: fucking clean
[2022-01-25T01:12:18] rosheee: because ^^' they have like aluminium dust on them
[2022-01-25T01:12:22] rosheee: and i fcked them up
[2022-01-25T01:12:49] Artem Bulashev: That should not be there 😀
[2022-01-25T01:12:58] rosheee: that's my fault ^^'
[2022-01-25T01:13:08] Artem Bulashev: Can you send some photos
[2022-01-25T01:13:12] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-01-25T01:14:19] rosheee: <photos/photo_2047@25-01-2022_01-14-19.jpg>
[2022-01-25T01:14:35] rosheee: <photos/photo_2048@25-01-2022_01-14-35.jpg>
[2022-01-25T01:15:41] rosheee: better took 3x100V
[2022-01-25T01:17:04] Happy Giraffe: I think Spintend thermal pads not the highest conductive either
[2022-01-25T01:17:41] rosheee: they feel better than the one nvidia/EVGA use for 3090 XD
[2022-01-25T01:17:57] rosheee: U BOI
[2022-01-25T01:18:00] rosheee: U GOT DEM GOOD PADS
[2022-01-25T01:18:04] rosheee: fcking amazon
[2022-01-25T01:18:05] Artem Bulashev: They are preaty good but could be improved up on
[2022-01-25T01:18:28] Happy Giraffe: Lol, yeah and half memory modules wont even touch the backplate of gpu...
[2022-01-25T01:18:28] rosheee: i add some liquid metal for absolute cooling
[2022-01-25T01:18:40] rosheee: 😃
[2022-01-25T01:18:46] Happy Giraffe: You gotta understand how it works first lol
[2022-01-25T01:18:59] rosheee: liquidmetal -> vesc
[2022-01-25T01:19:31] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-25T01:19:34] Happy Giraffe: Most liquid metal in room temp is almost like a solid material, when heated up to 70°c etc it becomes liquid
[2022-01-25T01:20:07] Happy Giraffe: So yeah😅 not sure how it will do with pressure and all of that
[2022-01-25T01:20:09] Artem Bulashev: Ideal in shaky electric scooter 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-01-25T01:20:15] rosheee: lol XD?
[2022-01-25T01:20:21] Happy Giraffe: Exactly...
[2022-01-25T01:20:33] rosheee: <photos/photo_2049@25-01-2022_01-20-33.jpg>
[2022-01-25T01:20:47] Artem Bulashev: Good shit
[2022-01-25T01:20:55] rosheee: yes BUT NOT FOR VESC X
[2022-01-25T01:20:56] rosheee: XD
[2022-01-25T01:21:02] rosheee: use it for direct die
[2022-01-25T01:21:06] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-01-25T01:22:10] Happy Giraffe: https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Thermal-Grizzly-Pad-Thermo-Minus/dp/B00ZJSBRE6?ref_=d6k_applink_bb_marketplace
[2022-01-25T01:22:49] rosheee: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B084V6VR9D/ref=sspa_dk_detail_3?pd_rd_i=B084V6VR9D&pd_rd_w=zYF2n&pf_rd_p=4f2ceb27-95e9-46ab-8808-db390b56ec01&pd_rd_wg=J1hjo&pf_rd_r=GDFYF50PV3AG83M192Y0&pd_rd_r=314bc2d8-a52e-4616-be94-d58db2b4c691&smid=A11MXDKDGXPB5U&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExTFJRRjBPN1VZQlZJJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDA5MTk2OUtQNkU2R1VLMDkxJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA4MDUzMzIyUEhHQVFINkU5NDlRJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfZGV0YWlsJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1
[2022-01-25T01:22:49] Happy Giraffe: Thinking maybe this kind, 8w/k not that high of a number but most manufacturers just put up some random number anyways
[2022-01-25T01:23:24] Happy Giraffe: 16.6wk yeah, that would be better than 90% of pastes
[2022-01-25T01:24:06] Paolo ⁭: But you still haven’t understand the problem
[2022-01-25T01:24:29] rosheee: i just got particles of aluminium/metal on them
[2022-01-25T01:24:37] rosheee: and maybe others are better XD
[2022-01-25T01:24:42] Paolo ⁭: Where you put the thermal pad is in contact with resin not mosfet die
[2022-01-25T01:25:00] Paolo ⁭: The you can also put copper radiator, but anyway useless😂 will help only a less more
[2022-01-25T01:25:31] rosheee: inside the vesc
[2022-01-25T01:26:09] Happy Giraffe: Also those thermal pads dry in one month what I see in reviews
[2022-01-25T01:26:35] rosheee: hmm
[2022-01-25T01:26:48] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_2050@25-01-2022_01-26-48.jpg>
[2022-01-25T01:26:51] rosheee: but why me has ma 27 degrees mosfet n vesc temp xD?
[2022-01-25T01:26:55] Paolo ⁭: This is the heat point of mosfet
[2022-01-25T01:27:11] Paolo ⁭: Here is where touch thermal pad
[2022-01-25T01:27:49] rosheee: true
[2022-01-25T01:29:50] Paolo ⁭: I’ve received a used mosfet by Ali😂
[2022-01-25T01:30:06] Paolo ⁭: Ordered ncep85t25t but delivered this
[2022-01-25T01:30:24] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-25T01:30:57] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2053@25-01-2022_01-30-57.jpg>
[2022-01-25T01:31:03] Artem Bulashev: A good chart :)
[2022-01-25T01:31:12] Paolo ⁭: But I’m almost lucky because it’s original :)
[2022-01-25T01:31:24] rosheee: XD
[2022-01-25T01:31:28] Artem Bulashev: Thermal grizzly crypto 👍👍
[2022-01-25T01:31:31] rosheee: lol...but cmon
[2022-01-25T01:31:45] Happy Giraffe: No Der8Bauer special there😭
[2022-01-25T01:31:54] Artem Bulashev: We don’t need anything extreme
[2022-01-25T01:31:55] rosheee: the best of best would be if u make CPU + cooler even
[2022-01-25T01:32:01] rosheee: that it is like 1 part not 2 :D
[2022-01-25T01:32:26] rosheee: vesc case out of silver would be nice ^^
[2022-01-25T01:32:37] rosheee: or copper lul
[2022-01-25T01:32:38] rosheee: gold ^^
[2022-01-25T01:32:45] Happy Giraffe: More like extreme longevity
[2022-01-25T01:33:06] rosheee: word
[2022-01-25T01:33:24] Happy Giraffe: Yeah sure I cut out a hole in scooter and put Noctua NH D15 heatsink on the side😂
[2022-01-25T01:34:07] rosheee: why not
[2022-01-25T01:34:12] rosheee: the other thing i was thinking about is this
[2022-01-25T01:34:20] Happy Giraffe: But thats next thing, to maybe find a metal xiaomi bottom plate that has sort of 2cm radiator style fins/grooves going below
[2022-01-25T01:34:51] Happy Giraffe: Air would nicely catch those, atleast in the area of vesc, but its nieche and very little improvement
[2022-01-25T01:35:09] rosheee: Copper judt where the vesc is
[2022-01-25T01:35:19] rosheee: But that works best atm
[2022-01-25T01:35:47] rosheee: That steel plate
[2022-01-25T01:36:05] Happy Giraffe: Then I would need to make Vesc box - thermal paste - copper - thermal paste - bottom cover sandwich
[2022-01-25T01:36:22] rosheee: my friend has such a thing
[2022-01-25T01:36:24] rosheee: which is even
[2022-01-25T01:36:29] rosheee: like 0.00001mm or something
[2022-01-25T01:36:43] rosheee: make copper + vesc even and flat
[2022-01-25T01:36:45] rosheee: AND THEN
[2022-01-25T01:36:51] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-25T01:36:53] Artem Bulashev: I have nothing
[2022-01-25T01:36:56] Artem Bulashev: OroginL thermal pad
[2022-01-25T01:37:08] Happy Giraffe: Not efficient as vesc box already alu and not super efficiently designed
[2022-01-25T01:37:09] Artem Bulashev: Ubox not even screwed in
[2022-01-25T01:37:20] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t go above 55c
[2022-01-25T01:37:33] rosheee: get rid of the paintjob
[2022-01-25T01:37:49] Artem Bulashev: Good advice for extreme use
[2022-01-25T01:37:50] Happy Giraffe: How? I go 67°c and first time thermal throttle today, bolted in with paste...
[2022-01-25T01:38:02] rosheee: maybe 2 much XD?
[2022-01-25T01:38:07] rosheee: i use no paste
[2022-01-25T01:38:14] rosheee: just direct to the bottomplate and color off
[2022-01-25T01:38:25] Artem Bulashev: What are your settings on rear and front ?
[2022-01-25T01:38:27] Happy Giraffe: Maybe single ubox sensor is in weird place, or something is wrong
[2022-01-25T01:38:39] Happy Giraffe: Only front motor 50/120A 48v
[2022-01-25T01:38:47] rosheee: that's nothing
[2022-01-25T01:38:51] Artem Bulashev: If you polish it to be even than 🤝🤝
[2022-01-25T01:38:52] Happy Giraffe: Exactly
[2022-01-25T01:38:59] rosheee: i will
[2022-01-25T01:39:07] rosheee: u have logfile? this time?
[2022-01-25T01:39:17] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅 lol something is not in good contact
[2022-01-25T01:39:18] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-25T01:39:23] Happy Giraffe: Already analyzed logfiles
[2022-01-25T01:39:25] Artem Bulashev: Is that single ?
[2022-01-25T01:39:30] Happy Giraffe: Ye
[2022-01-25T01:39:37] Artem Bulashev: May be fets are different
[2022-01-25T01:39:42] Artem Bulashev: From my dual
[2022-01-25T01:39:55] Artem Bulashev: And well thermal mass of the case
[2022-01-25T01:39:56] Happy Giraffe: I will probs change thermal pads anyway and make sure all make contact
[2022-01-25T01:40:03] Artem Bulashev: 👍
[2022-01-25T01:40:10] Happy Giraffe: Hmm
[2022-01-25T01:40:29] Happy Giraffe: When I opened it for cleaning, pads might have gotten compromised
[2022-01-25T01:40:47] rosheee: maybe u're just to hot
[2022-01-25T01:40:59] Artem Bulashev: Also mine is on full metal body (plastic cover on top of the deck, bottom is solid metal, not just sheet of metal like Xiaomi has
[2022-01-25T01:41:01] Happy Giraffe: 😘

[2022-01-25T03:45:56] Artem Bulashev: CST on vsett10+ needs to have 48psi
[2022-01-25T03:46:31] Artem Bulashev: Normally we use 10x3 though not 10x2.5
[2022-01-25T03:46:37] rosheee: i know XD
[2022-01-25T03:46:42] Artem Bulashev: Ok 👍👍
[2022-01-25T03:46:47] rosheee: but DUE to the fail with brake
[2022-01-25T03:46:51] rosheee: i switch to 10x3 as well now
[2022-01-25T03:47:02] rosheee: since i know how to change the hydraulic hose

[2022-01-25T03:47:14] rosheee: these LM motors are soooo fucking smooth to ride
[2022-01-25T03:47:36] Artem Bulashev: Can be hard to fit on to the rim all the way to the rim lip - if you don’t put it evenly all around it will have side wobble
[2022-01-25T03:47:56] rosheee: why hard to fit on rim?
[2022-01-25T03:48:11] Artem Bulashev: On 10+ rim cst fits very hard
[2022-01-25T03:48:19] Artem Bulashev: Inner diameter is abit small
[2022-01-25T03:48:34] rosheee: i gonna use the TUVOT 10X3
[2022-01-25T03:48:38] Artem Bulashev: 👍
[2022-01-25T03:48:53] Artem Bulashev: CST is better over all though
[2022-01-25T03:48:57] rosheee: harder
[2022-01-25T03:49:12] rosheee: i had more grip with the tuvot 10x2.5 than cst 10x2.5
[2022-01-25T03:51:28] rosheee: 260A on motors omg
[2022-01-25T03:52:15] rosheee: and nearly 50 degrees mosfet ^^'
[2022-01-25T03:52:35] rosheee: maybe go down with amps and push positive throttle ramp
[2022-01-25T03:55:17] rosheee: scooter feels like Cadillac with these tires + the suspension lol
[2022-01-25T08:37:00] Federico77: Confermo, il motore originale è 113mm a battuta e la forcella posteriore dove si inserisce il motore è 115
[2022-01-25T09:01:56] rosheee: ma ho acceso il motore senza soffocare ^^ mi sento così sbalorditivo ora. ho un super g30?
[2022-01-25T09:02:12] Federico77: Il telaio senza le placche di scontro d l motore è 128 mm mirato ora con il calibro
[2022-01-25T09:02:58] Federico77: Vsett 10+ engine works well with ninebot control unit

[2022-01-25T09:04:12] rosheee: frame?

[2022-01-25T09:05:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Please, try to speak in English :)
[2022-01-25T09:05:50] Federico77: the frame is 129mm
[2022-01-25T09:06:28] Federico77: the frame without the rear few where the engine goes to rest is 129mm
[2022-01-25T09:08:22] rosheee: ^^' yes and the vsett 10+ motor fits with spacer
[2022-01-25T09:08:27] rosheee: mine is 135mm
[2022-01-25T09:09:30] Federico77: but you had to widen the rear fork otherwise it does not fit, I had seen the photos of your g30 with vsett engine on some other group
[2022-01-25T09:09:40] rosheee: ok
[2022-01-25T09:09:45] rosheee: i haven't done shit ^^'

[2022-01-25T09:10:37] Federico77: ok better that way if it goes in without forcing the frame is a good thing
[2022-01-25T09:10:52] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-25T09:11:06] rosheee: depends what u mean with "forcing"
[2022-01-25T09:11:18] Federico77: 😂
[2022-01-25T09:11:22] rosheee: without these black spacer things it goes like butter
[2022-01-25T09:11:27] Federico77: 2/3 mm max
[2022-01-25T09:11:57] rosheee: with the black things u can: var. A = take EXACTLY 50% off from both sides + make the "U" sexier
[2022-01-25T09:12:29] rosheee: var. B = use 2fingers together with hands and put in motor with minmalisatica force
[2022-01-25T09:13:29] Federico77: Have you thought about putting the steel reinforcements on the outside so that the washer block of the engine also take hold on those and not force the frame?
[2022-01-25T09:14:29] rosheee: ??
[2022-01-25T09:14:49] Federico77: <photos/photo_2068@25-01-2022_02-58-46.jpg>
[2022-01-25T09:15:10] Federico77: This thickness on the outside

[2022-01-25T09:15:47] rosheee: nah i put original covers on :D and i think it doesn't help outside, or does it?
[2022-01-25T09:15:58] Federico77: Yes, so as not to force the frame, if you say you haven't forced it, I believe you
[2022-01-25T09:16:26] rosheee: forcing for me is rly force "BITCH GO IN!+!+"!*+"!*ç!+"ç!" but i was gentle
[2022-01-25T09:17:02] Federico77: Anyway constructive discussion for me, the vsett10 + engine is well priced on AliExpress right now
[2022-01-25T09:17:33] rosheee: true dat
[2022-01-25T09:17:33] Federico77: Ok I understand what you mean, thanks for the info

[2022-01-27T17:57:39] Artem Bulashev: But I’m not sure how safe it would be on single wheel scooter at that speeds
[2022-01-27T17:57:49] Artem Bulashev: What platform it will be built on?
[2022-01-27T17:57:55] Valentin Holländer: Xiaomi pro
[2022-01-27T17:58:01] Artem Bulashev: 🤦‍♂️
[2022-01-27T17:58:08] Valentin Holländer: I dont care about safe..
[2022-01-27T17:58:10] Artem Bulashev: You have death wish?
[2022-01-27T17:58:16] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-01-27T17:58:16] Valentin Holländer: Yeah
[2022-01-27T17:58:23] Valentin Holländer: Just need a motor
[2022-01-27T17:58:34] Artem Bulashev: I’m not sure what motor will fit best
[2022-01-27T17:58:45] Valentin Holländer: I have fork
[2022-01-27T17:58:49] Valentin Holländer: So i can have a big motor
[2022-01-27T17:59:11] Artem Bulashev: Saw vsett10+ motor fits nicely - 1400-2300w stock single motor should get you up to 75kmh for sure
[2022-01-27T17:59:16] Valentin Holländer: Have try highway 1000w that burn up
[2022-01-27T17:59:20] Artem Bulashev: With 50a battery
[2022-01-27T17:59:36] Mirono escooters: Highway?
[2022-01-27T17:59:38] Valentin Holländer: Okey i go for that thx
[2022-01-27T17:59:46] Artem Bulashev: But it is expensive
[2022-01-27T17:59:57] Face de Pin Sucé: x)

[2022-01-27T17:59:59] Artem Bulashev: There may be more cost effective motors out there RHD fit
[2022-01-27T18:00:04] Face de Pin Sucé: you can reach maybe 70Kmh
[2022-01-27T18:00:20] Face de Pin Sucé: oh wait, single motor ?
[2022-01-27T18:00:20] sombre_enfant: Sa recrute chez smb😂
[2022-01-27T18:00:38] Artem Bulashev: 50a motor and 60v yeah will do
[2022-01-27T18:00:44] Valentin Holländer: 70 sounds nice
[2022-01-27T18:00:47] Face de Pin Sucé: won't able to reach more than 60Kmh I think x)
[2022-01-27T18:00:52] Face de Pin Sucé: En vrai oui mdr
[2022-01-27T18:00:58] Artem Bulashev: Vsett10+ on 60v gets to 68kmh on stock 30-35a single motor
[2022-01-27T18:01:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Dual Motor 2*30-35A
[2022-01-27T18:01:25] Face de Pin Sucé: oh okay
[2022-01-27T18:01:29] Artem Bulashev: On dual it gets to 78kmh
[2022-01-27T18:01:30] Face de Pin Sucé: well let's go then
[2022-01-27T18:01:41] Artem Bulashev: Price is high for that motor
[2022-01-27T18:02:02] Face de Pin Sucé: 100A for 5min30s 😁
[2022-01-27T18:02:03] Artem Bulashev: But it should take 50a battery and 150a phase no problem
[2022-01-27T18:03:05] Artem Bulashev: Each motor ? 100a is easy for Spintend
[2022-01-27T18:03:18] Valentin Holländer: Where to buy that motor with tier mounted on?
[2022-01-27T18:03:22] Artem Bulashev: Let’s see 135a each 😄😄
[2022-01-27T18:03:47] Artem Bulashev: I’m not sure if 3inch wide tire will clear your frame
[2022-01-27T18:04:05] Artem Bulashev: I saw people used it with 2.5inch tire on max rear
[2022-01-27T18:04:06] Face de Pin Sucé: I talk about 100A continuous, Spintend doesn't last more than 1min at 100A phase continuous on open loop
[2022-01-27T18:04:11] Face de Pin Sucé: already tested
[2022-01-27T18:04:22] Artem Bulashev: Oh, battery amps??
[2022-01-27T18:04:35] Valentin Holländer: I have monorim in front
[2022-01-27T18:04:41] Valentin Holländer: So can have big tier
[2022-01-27T18:04:48] Valentin Holländer: Motor
[2022-01-27T18:04:51] Face de Pin Sucé: it's phase amps but openloop so it's continuous that you pull this current
[2022-01-27T18:05:12] Artem Bulashev: Ok best tire is PMT 10x3, or cheaper second best is CST 10x3
[2022-01-27T18:05:24] Artem Bulashev: Interesting
[2022-01-27T18:05:26] rosheee: Vsett 10+ LM goes 82gps with 16S
[2022-01-27T18:05:27] Face de Pin Sucé: when tested spintend in same configuration with fan it reached 80°c in less than 3 minutes
[2022-01-27T18:05:34] Face de Pin Sucé: (for 100A)

[2022-01-27T18:28:47] Artem Bulashev: Die of the fets May heat up a lot faster than temp sensor that is located next to the get will, and thus burn out
[2022-01-27T18:29:29] Federico77: I sent it to show at what price they sell it on AliExpress
[2022-01-27T18:29:30] sombre_enfant: This link is a lies, he tell you to pay supplement...

[2022-01-27T18:31:16] Luis Magalhaes: Relive is not accurate, try speed view gps is more acurate
[2022-01-27T18:31:23] rosheee: Vsett is 1400W

[2022-01-27T18:35:15] Artem Bulashev: I think it was mainly due to shipping cost, I remember it being like 180€
[2022-01-27T18:35:20] rosheee: When i saw ur video witz the crazy sound i was like impressed AF
[2022-01-27T18:35:43] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but all sellers so the same bs with 200$ shipping

[2022-01-27T18:38:25] Paolo ⁭: 72v 80A with yuyang king
[2022-01-27T18:38:30] rosheee: If sny has evidemxe then ols show
[2022-01-27T18:38:34] Artem Bulashev: If motor is made for 60v than it is rated at that voltage mine is rated at 48v 650-1100w = 23a
[2022-01-27T18:38:38] rosheee: Talk but no data
[2022-01-27T18:38:39] Paolo ⁭: Bldc square wave
[2022-01-27T18:38:47] Luis Magalhaes: Uh square brute force 😂
[2022-01-27T18:39:08] sombre_enfant: You send me this screen ago on your vesc tab
[2022-01-27T18:39:27] Happy Giraffe: Blade motor takes easy 2000w (48v50A) for as long as my road is clear. Handwarm side was my record on that so maybe 35°c (summer gonna change this)
[2022-01-27T18:39:36] rosheee: I hhave the whole 40km fullspeed in summer on video xD
[2022-01-27T18:39:43] Artem Bulashev: So I only push it 7a more but my voltage is 60v
[2022-01-27T18:39:51] Artem Bulashev: That’s why it is cold
[2022-01-27T18:39:57] Artem Bulashev: And yet higher watts
[2022-01-27T18:40:56] Artem Bulashev: It’s 1000w right? So yeah should be with in its specs
[2022-01-27T18:41:06] Happy Giraffe: 1200w
[2022-01-27T18:41:06] Artem Bulashev: 2x the nominal
[2022-01-27T18:41:15] Artem Bulashev: Even easier than
[2022-01-27T18:41:29] Artem Bulashev: Mine is over 3x nominal spec (2000w / 650w) (or max spec 2000w / 1100w= 1.81)
[2022-01-27T18:41:34] Artem Bulashev: So that’s why warmer
[2022-01-27T18:42:08] Happy Giraffe: And summer is coming so, +25°c to ambient temps
[2022-01-27T18:43:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Guys, just take a uphill of 5-10Km and try to stay at the power all of you are speaking
[2022-01-27T18:43:13] Face de Pin Sucé: We'll see who burns first 😂
[2022-01-27T18:43:26] Happy Giraffe: Vesc overheats first😂
[2022-01-27T18:43:41] Artem Bulashev: Based on that vsett 10+ should take at least 4200w barely warm
[2022-01-27T18:43:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Ah shit 😂😂😂😂
[2022-01-27T18:43:53] Happy Giraffe: Already without uphills mosfets go 67°c against wind...
[2022-01-27T18:44:49] Artem Bulashev: Adam need you here
[2022-01-27T18:45:14] Happy Giraffe: I really need to sand the paint of single ubox and mount it against a custom metal bottom plate with good pressure
[2022-01-27T18:45:24] Artem Bulashev: Can you test vsett 10+ on rear motor only mod 😃😃 you got temp sensor right?
[2022-01-27T18:45:44] Artem Bulashev: Add some thermal past 👍
[2022-01-27T18:46:07] Happy Giraffe: Ofc, that I have already
[2022-01-27T18:46:14] Unknown: Sup?
[2022-01-27T18:46:23] Happy Giraffe: But current mounting is not optimal, need more pressure
[2022-01-27T18:46:48] Paolo ⁭: I want change mosfet of my flipsky and push 200A from them😂

[2022-01-27T19:00:27] Face de Pin Sucé: "50m"
[2022-01-27T19:00:35] Unknown: My 1400w dual Vsett motors both have temp sensors and 6ml of statorade. Before statorade motor temps were in the range of 145F MAX. Rear motor was 37a batt and 120a phase and Front was 35a batt and 90 phase. All at 16s 67v-55v range. Battery amps were limited by stock battery. Always run dual motor mode though, so didn't test single motor only. After 6ml of statorade, real deal direct from Grin Tech, was added motor temps wouldn't rise above 104F with identical settings, most of the ride motor temps stayed under 100F with 45F ambient. Shits absolutely amazing and will probably use it always moving forward. Got the 50ml jug 😎
[2022-01-27T19:01:45] Happy Giraffe: Here we use C°😳
[2022-01-27T19:01:49] sombre_enfant: Speed ?

[2022-01-27T19:03:02] Face de Pin Sucé: You Americans, love big numbers 😂
[2022-01-27T19:03:04] Unknown: But yea, the statorade made a huge difference in motor temps
[2022-01-27T19:03:04] Happy Giraffe: Freedoms per Kelvin also ok
[2022-01-27T19:03:34] Face de Pin Sucé: 145F for only 62°C
[2022-01-27T19:03:37] Unknown: We're obsessed with excess everything
[2022-01-27T19:03:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Love those Americans 😂😂🥰

[2022-01-27T19:24:40] Unknown: I wrapped each cell with good thick heat shrink and then warpled each cell individually with 1 layer of kapton. Going to use some .1 heat resistant wax paper between the series groups. Fish paper at .25mm thick mighttt work but I'm super limited on space.
[2022-01-27T19:24:58] Happy Giraffe: Mod?
[2022-01-27T19:25:10] Face de Pin Sucé: if it's not faster, will definitely have more torque x)
[2022-01-27T19:25:20] Luis Magalhaes: I think it was paid the pro version so.. mod 😂
[2022-01-27T19:25:21] sombre_enfant: About dragy i dont understand how to use it...

[2022-01-27T19:25:40] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-01-27T19:25:40] Face de Pin Sucé: I have one dragy
[2022-01-27T19:26:02] Unknown: The "wax paper" is actually the white fish paper backing (that you usually peel off and throw away). It's .1mm thick and has really good heat and abrasion resistance, similar to the fish paper itself
[2022-01-27T19:26:09] sombre_enfant: Bruh couldve tell this b4
[2022-01-27T19:26:17] Luis Magalhaes: That dragy is cool but a little expensive for just some tests 😂
[2022-01-27T19:26:17] Face de Pin Sucé: have told many times x)

[2022-01-27T19:27:56] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2022-01-27T19:28:16] Face de Pin Sucé: 0.2 Duty Cycle (pull 3A) and fan on it, it cools much better than just waiting

[2022-01-27T19:46:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2022-01-27T19:48:44] Unknown: The width is exactly 171mm. I have my Nucular controllers mounted outside the deck, so I have 455m of usable length. Custom made 24mm deck spacer gives me plenty of room for BMS on top of battery along with all of the wires/connectors
[2022-01-27T19:48:57] Unknown: Thanks man 😎
[2022-01-27T19:50:17] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3 What shielded multicore cable would you recommend for throttle, brake and power button?
[2022-01-27T19:50:31] Happy Giraffe: I tried looking for them but its quite hard to find usable ones (Im making the cables nice and tidy. Also thinking about not directly soldering and maybe using some compact connectors)
[2022-01-27T19:50:40] Paolo ⁭: Omg unlimited space
[2022-01-27T19:50:48] Paolo ⁭: I have 145mm😭
[2022-01-27T19:51:28] Unknown: The wooden jig I have the cells in is 169mm wide. After I got the p groups glued last night, they fit inside the deck perfectly, with about 2mm of width to spare. So good for wrappings and expoxy resin boards for hard outer shell.
[2022-01-27T19:53:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Keep in mind while kapton isolates electricity stops some heat also
[2022-01-27T19:56:22] Paolo ⁭: How much time you wait for nuclear?
[2022-01-27T19:56:26] Unknown: Yes, for sure. Jumping from 16s to 20s and using the 48x cells, which are safe for around 16-17a max... I don't think I'll be maxing them out due to magnetic saturation and finished returns. Even 90 battery amps total would only 10a per cell. Thanks for pointing that out tho
[2022-01-27T19:57:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sure thing mate👌 was only some feedback
[2022-01-27T19:57:55] Unknown: I found 2 12F with display used on endless sphere. Got insanely lucky. They're currently only making the 24F, hopefully 12F production will resume within the next 4-6 months... But they have a hugeee backorder already for them. Unfortunately they're unattainable unless you find them used
[2022-01-27T19:58:06] Unknown: 👌
[2022-01-27T19:59:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You live in Vienna ?
[2022-01-27T19:59:23] Unknown: I think I have 4 12F and 2 6F on backorder 🤣. Stocking up when they're ready. Total fanboy here, sorry VESC guys LoL
[2022-01-27T20:00:41] Unknown: But I follow the chat here. Would probably consider VESC in the future. Used VESC on my drones for years, so I know it's good stuff. Just finding good hardware is tricky sometimes
[2022-01-27T20:01:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Keep on having fun☺️😜 Keep being crazy😁
[2022-01-27T20:01:21] Paolo ⁭: $$$
[2022-01-27T20:01:24] rosheee: I passed the policr before...omg
[2022-01-27T20:01:28] Unknown: Only way to be brother
[2022-01-27T20:01:33] rosheee: Just wanns tr, out gps tool
[2022-01-27T20:01:35] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-27T20:02:10] rosheee: At least the new brakesetup is best
[2022-01-27T20:02:24] Unknown: Indeed, very much $$. But I love them. And the display and uLight is the cherry on top
[2022-01-27T20:05:59] Paolo ⁭: Just sabvoton cost too much for me😂
[2022-01-27T20:07:11] Unknown: They really do for what they are. And limited to 72v max. Not user friendly at all and over sized and over priced
[2022-01-27T20:08:24] Unknown: I wonder if Vedder or someone can figure out how implement this in VESC. Amazing feature. Charging thru controller/phase wire with any power supply under battery voltage

[2022-01-27T20:14:26] Paolo ⁭: That I like of vesc is because it’s open source
[2022-01-27T20:14:43] Paolo ⁭: I prefer fucking my money in motors lol

[2022-01-27T20:24:41] Happy Giraffe: Where could this be applied?
[2022-01-27T20:24:46] Unknown: I completely agree with you there. VESC actually has more features overall because it's used in tons of different applications by tons of people. Nucs are more geared towards EV only, so less overall features. The ones they do have are all very useful. The display is killer. Koxx smartdisplay is going to be a god send for VESC users
[2022-01-27T20:24:53] rosheee: kers
[2022-01-27T20:25:25] Happy Giraffe: Regen braking already there but power supply😳
[2022-01-27T20:25:36] Unknown: <photos/photo_2125@27-01-2022_20-25-36.jpg>
[2022-01-27T20:25:49] rosheee: ah i mean how the recharge should work
[2022-01-27T20:26:34] Happy Giraffe: Im too noob to understand haha
[2022-01-27T20:29:00] Unknown: Any PSU with voltage under Batt voltage can be used. Flatpack2 for instance... 56v and 52a or 3000w max. Able to charge any 16s or larger battery with same power supply. Motor phase acts as a strip/coil. So you don't need a dedicated charger for your battery. Also, a 3000w charger is capable of charging a 20s battery at 13a on 110v or 26a on 220v. So, much higher charge rates for huge e bike batteries. Most dedicated CC to CV chargers are capped at 5a max. Controller settings control max voltage, max current, constant current to constant voltage threshold, etc... So the controller is the brain and the power supply is the muscle
[2022-01-27T20:30:12] Unknown: You can use EV charge stations, 12v cigarette lighter plug in your car, other lithium battery, car battery, etc... To charge your scoot
[2022-01-27T20:30:24] Happy Giraffe: This sounds cool, a giant ebike could largely benefit from this
[2022-01-27T20:33:46] Unknown: Absolutely. My 20s9p will be 41ah or so. A dedicated CC to CV charger capped at 5a would take forever to charge at .1C(ish) So using a 2000w/3000w PSU, I'll be able to charge up to 13a (.3C) using my home wall plug of 110v.
[2022-01-27T20:34:57] Happy Giraffe: And its still cell life optimized, cool. Maybe even this has the ability to stop charge at 95%?
[2022-01-27T20:35:36] Happy Giraffe: If you have big pack and dont need the 5% could be nice
[2022-01-27T20:35:42] Unknown: Thru the controller you can set max charge voltage, so you can stop at any voltage (state of charge) you choose

[2022-01-27T20:37:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 2s, I'll gibe you my ali link
[2022-01-27T20:37:37] Happy Giraffe: My 13s12p project also would benefit from this, so I could use like 16A charge current instead of 5😂
[2022-01-27T20:37:51] Happy Giraffe: If In need of a fast charge

[2022-01-27T20:39:20] Happy Giraffe: What wire gauge you recommend? And also a newbie question, can I share the GND or 5v between the throttle, brake and button?
[2022-01-27T20:39:31] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-27T20:40:09] Happy Giraffe: Not shielded
[2022-01-27T20:40:24] rosheee: why the heck u need that?
[2022-01-27T20:40:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: usually 24 or 26
[2022-01-27T20:40:30] Happy Giraffe: I want absolute best ADC signal integrity
[2022-01-27T20:40:33] sombre_enfant: Dont do ground loop they should already be shared if the power come from same battery
[2022-01-27T20:40:34] rosheee: ^^' ok
[2022-01-27T20:40:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2022-01-27T20:41:03] rosheee: i tried shielded, unshieled, STP, SFTP
[2022-01-27T20:41:12] Happy Giraffe: I have everything independent now and I think I keep it that way
[2022-01-27T20:41:30] rosheee: all crap signal was mostly same ^^' the cable was thick so i had to make bigger holes but yah :D
[2022-01-27T20:43:00] Paolo ⁭: Can cable :/
[2022-01-27T20:44:55] Happy Giraffe: And if I take awg24 8-core, it should still fit ok through the xiaomi holes?🤔
[2022-01-27T20:45:06] rosheee: xD
[2022-01-27T20:45:37] rosheee: brake + that fat cable + motor it is massiv that cable
[2022-01-27T20:45:40] Happy Giraffe: Because I need another 4 core in addition I think
[2022-01-27T20:46:05] Happy Giraffe: I have 13-core car trailer cable, talking about massive😏
[2022-01-27T20:46:18] rosheee: where?
[2022-01-27T20:46:27] rosheee: that is what u using now?
[2022-01-27T20:46:28] Happy Giraffe: Gathering dust in corner
[2022-01-27T20:46:35] Happy Giraffe: Nope, didnt fit haha😂
[2022-01-27T20:46:36] rosheee: what u use now then?

[2022-01-27T20:47:56] rosheee: omg
[2022-01-27T20:48:00] rosheee: i can't fit everything inside the g30 ..motorcable, only 6 wire cable,
[2022-01-27T20:50:03] Happy Giraffe: Last question😅 would you directly solder the cables or is there a small connector that could fit 3,3,4 and 3 pins inside xiaomi display?🤣
[2022-01-27T20:50:21] rosheee: here
[2022-01-27T20:50:28] Happy Giraffe: The ones they use in Xiaomi esc are tiny
[2022-01-27T20:51:48] Happy Giraffe: I could then use two 8-core cables and leave the last 5 pins unused for future projects and stupid ideas
[2022-01-27T20:52:02] rosheee: u're so hardcore ^^' holyshit
[2022-01-27T20:52:07] rosheee: XD TANK

[2022-01-27T21:01:29] Unknown: 20s9p. 4800mah x 9 = 43.2ah 🤓
[2022-01-27T21:03:53] Paolo ⁭: Really can fit that battery?🥺
[2022-01-27T21:03:55] Unknown: And yes, 10+ is an amazing platform to mod. Standard size shocks (125mm / 165mm) and stem latch system are the goodies. Mount your controllers externally and inside deck is huge for monster battery
[2022-01-27T21:04:05] rosheee: what bms u use?
[2022-01-27T21:04:08] Unknown: Most definitely. Controllers are mounted outside

[2022-01-27T21:10:19] Artem Bulashev: Still can’t believe it fits of top my head even though Im the one who 3d modeled it and made sure it will fit haha
[2022-01-27T21:10:33] Paolo ⁭: I need only frame
[2022-01-27T21:10:36] Happy Giraffe: For that frame, insane motors and controllers. It will kill a Rion
[2022-01-27T21:10:54] Artem Bulashev: Ubox could fit horizontally than ahha 2.5 only occupied lol
[2022-01-27T21:10:56] rosheee: XD that as well because it is part of the whole

[2022-01-27T21:11:06] Paolo ⁭: I think some dualtron killed rion😅😅
[2022-01-27T21:11:12] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2022-01-27T21:11:39] Paolo ⁭: Extreme uses 250A (750A max phase) square wave controllers each on their dualtron lol
[2022-01-27T21:11:40] Unknown: Yes, credit to @artBula for the design and sourcing the cells. You da man bro!
[2022-01-27T21:11:56] Artem Bulashev: Motors are nice too ;-)

[2022-01-27T21:12:17] rosheee: damn fuckers with yoor big ass wide motors -__-
[2022-01-27T21:12:20] Unknown: My 10+ will be a Rion killer. Eat em for breakfast
[2022-01-27T21:12:42] rosheee: it is so hard with max 135mm wide per motor
[2022-01-27T21:12:47] Unknown: Bro, me either!! Got the p packs glued last night and 20s9p absolutely fits!!
[2022-01-27T21:12:55] Paolo ⁭: I have also their motor, are from longyu. But be sure can’t be used at 750A continuos phase😂😂 or will become bacon
[2022-01-27T21:13:14] Artem Bulashev: Have photo ? Careful not to short it by metal
[2022-01-27T21:13:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cool
[2022-01-27T21:13:34] Paolo ⁭: But if you think rion uses 4mm2 wire and 60mm motor with 400A phase xd, maybe possible
[2022-01-27T21:13:59] Artem Bulashev: Lol shurely now, but I wonder what they can handle max continues
[2022-01-27T21:14:26] Artem Bulashev: 60mm magnets only ? That’s same as vsett
[2022-01-27T21:14:29] Unknown: I just dry fit them last night to confirm width. P packs fit and length is 450mm long. Have to tear out my stock battery to fit everything in at once but I'll take some pics tonight of how the p packs fit
[2022-01-27T21:14:38] Paolo ⁭: Vsett 10+ is 50mm
[2022-01-27T21:14:46] rosheee: true
[2022-01-27T21:14:51] Paolo ⁭: Vsett 11+ is 60
[2022-01-27T21:15:19] Paolo ⁭: Yes, but it have very high Kv, front motor don’t slip under 250A phase
[2022-01-27T21:16:04] Paolo ⁭: Highest Kv= highest current supported
[2022-01-27T21:17:51] Unknown: Best setup would be 10+ frame with 11+ 60mm motors. Still not a fan of the wolf style dual stem with built in suspension in the forks. Much prefer the 10+ shock style suspension and stem latch design. I've looked into using zero 11x swingarms to fit the 11" motors on 10+ but don't think the suspension geometry would line up.
[2022-01-27T21:18:46] rosheee: u have 0 problems with the state tr00pers right? like cruising with vsett 10+ here u get busted, they take it away, maybe lose ur driving licence 😆
[2022-01-27T21:19:53] Paolo ⁭: Rion motor 60mm can handle double of power than vsett 11+ motor, maybe for highest Kv
[2022-01-27T21:19:59] Unknown: Cops in my town give me the right of way at stop signs 😂. USA is quite different with their rules and I also live in a very liberal country town, so I think I should be good.
[2022-01-27T21:20:06] Unknown: Hmm, interesting
[2022-01-27T21:20:18] rosheee: word
[2022-01-27T21:21:19] rosheee: u rly lose ur driving licence here when they get u with something more than 500W and not street legal..jess. in the states ...omg ... I HAVE A DREAM
[2022-01-27T21:22:21] Unknown: Wow, that's brutal. We've had at least 1 person on Vsett chat sell their 10+ due to new regulations put in place. Forget the country but was EU for sure
[2022-01-27T21:22:38] rosheee: the nice thing here is
[2022-01-27T21:23:01] rosheee: if u earn like 100k a year ^^ u get like 10k
[2022-01-27T21:23:12] rosheee: *fine
[2022-01-27T21:23:22] rosheee: for fapping around with the scooter

[2022-01-27T21:29:13] Paolo ⁭: Price is the same 🤔
[2022-01-27T21:29:28] rosheee: sensorless is nice as well

[2022-01-27T21:29:53] Artem Bulashev: Max power model - square wave controller vs 8-10+ sinewave modulated controllers better at low and mid range efficiency
[2022-01-27T21:30:26] Artem Bulashev: 11+ is squarewave = max top speed, no effiency compromise
[2022-01-27T21:30:31] Unknown: Forgot about that
[2022-01-27T21:30:49] rosheee: shiiit
[2022-01-27T21:31:50] Artem Bulashev: Real milage of 28ah 60v is 66km going aggressive, or 75km if you go more decent 40-45kmh
[2022-01-27T21:32:05] rosheee: whuat
[2022-01-27T21:32:19] rosheee: i made with 25Ah 42km
[2022-01-27T21:32:21] rosheee: @ max b00st
[2022-01-27T21:32:29] Artem Bulashev: Sinewave modulated controllers are more Efficient at low and mid range
[2022-01-27T21:32:32] rosheee: 60-80kmh
[2022-01-27T21:33:02] Artem Bulashev: 25ah version does 55km going super aggressive and 68-70km going 40-45kmh Btw dual motor is more efficient than single for most people
[2022-01-27T21:33:13] Paolo ⁭: Yeah but why motor is without hall sensor 🤔they can leave them anyway for further upgrade
[2022-01-27T21:33:31] rosheee: 55KM!?
[2022-01-27T21:33:32] Unknown: No joy for me with Rion. Anyone can buy a 5k (or more) scooter out of the box and say they have something. My 10+ is completely custom built and is a fun project for me. Nobody else will have a 10+ same as mine. Like most of the guys here, custom and mod your scoots to be your own and something to be proud of.
[2022-01-27T21:33:42] Artem Bulashev: Squarewave doesn’t use hall sensors, so no use
[2022-01-27T21:33:46] Unknown: I agree. Seems very limited
[2022-01-27T21:33:51] Mirono escooters: Rlly?
[2022-01-27T21:33:59] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-01-27T21:34:06] Artem Bulashev: BLDC
[2022-01-27T21:34:14] Mirono escooters: Weird. My controller alieexpress didnt work without but has square
[2022-01-27T21:34:15] Paolo ⁭: And so?
[2022-01-27T21:34:24] Paolo ⁭: Not all square wave don’t use hall
[2022-01-27T21:34:31] Paolo ⁭: Also foc can work sensorless
[2022-01-27T21:34:32] Artem Bulashev: Didn’t know that
[2022-01-27T21:34:33] Mirono escooters: It went to 6kmh and then did weird noise
[2022-01-27T21:34:47] Mirono escooters: Yea but not as efficiënt
[2022-01-27T21:34:55] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but not very well, BLDC was made sensorless to begin with
[2022-01-27T21:35:19] sombre_enfant: U pull 120A on a 60A max battery too😂
[2022-01-27T21:35:31] Paolo ⁭: If you won’t earthquake in start you need hall sensor
[2022-01-27T21:36:26] Paolo ⁭: Work well but you need some “advanced” settings
[2022-01-27T21:37:15] Unknown: This is reason for combined mode correct? Hall to sensorless. Nuc is FOC sinewave and I run combined mode, start on halls and transition to sensorless. I haven't tried square wave at all but have the option...
[2022-01-27T21:37:27] rosheee: ofc
[2022-01-27T21:37:45] rosheee: that makes vesc as well, not?
[2022-01-27T21:37:49] Paolo ⁭: And anyway foc has highest top speed
[2022-01-27T21:38:04] rosheee: untill 500 i have hall then sensorless and at least it get b00sted by FW
[2022-01-27T21:38:25] rosheee: GUYS 😆anyone played or tried ever to setup PID correctly ^^'
[2022-01-27T21:38:42] rosheee: that's the best and worst ^__^
[2022-01-27T21:39:52] Paolo ⁭: I run with hall to 9000ERPM or due to saturation will fuck esc 👌
[2022-01-27T21:41:33] rosheee: <photos/photo_2132@27-01-2022_21-41-33.jpg>
[2022-01-27T21:41:37] rosheee: shiiit
[2022-01-27T21:41:43] rosheee: gps and speed vesc are nearly 1:1
[2022-01-27T21:42:26] rosheee: <photos/photo_2133@27-01-2022_21-42-26.jpg>
[2022-01-27T21:42:50] Happy Giraffe: 12x 10A haha
[2022-01-27T21:43:04] Paolo ⁭: 12x10x4
[2022-01-27T21:43:07] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-01-27T21:43:25] Paolo ⁭: No, only 280A , an little baby :(
[2022-01-27T21:43:46] Mirono escooters: Only
[2022-01-27T21:43:59] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-27T21:44:02] Paolo ⁭: Yeah I need 400 hahaha
[2022-01-27T21:44:18] rosheee: i wanna see these cables
[2022-01-27T21:44:19] rosheee: 400A
[2022-01-27T21:44:22] rosheee: awg2
[2022-01-27T21:44:27] Paolo ⁭: But I want 2s in series, so I’m confused if better more voltage or capacity
[2022-01-27T21:45:11] Paolo ⁭: Peak power doesn’t need these size :/
[2022-01-27T21:45:28] rosheee: how long u go 400A?
[2022-01-27T21:45:39] rosheee: 0.5sec?
[2022-01-27T21:45:44] Paolo ⁭: I don’t go 400A, I want only this rating for don’t kill cells
[2022-01-27T21:46:14] rosheee: get it
[2022-01-27T21:46:24] Paolo ⁭: Configuration will don’t get a fire, but anyway will heat much up to 80 degrees
[2022-01-27T21:46:35] rosheee: pfff
[2022-01-27T21:46:45] rosheee: if that happens i shit on that battery
[2022-01-27T21:46:48] Paolo ⁭: Cable isn’t a problem, esc work with pulses
[2022-01-27T21:47:00] Artem Bulashev: All FOC runs like this to my knowledge
[2022-01-27T21:47:11] Artem Bulashev: Sensored till some rpm
[2022-01-27T21:47:22] Artem Bulashev: Than switches to sensorless
[2022-01-27T21:47:37] Paolo ⁭: You can choose
[2022-01-27T21:47:51] Paolo ⁭: That depends by motors current capacity
[2022-01-27T21:47:58] Artem Bulashev: Because after some rpm rotor position can be deducted without sensors just as well
[2022-01-27T21:48:10] Artem Bulashev: Can you explain?
[2022-01-27T21:48:42] rosheee: if that happens with samsung 50G and they still living after pushing out over 120A then a pack rated 240A cont. should keep cool, not?
[2022-01-27T21:49:33] rosheee: and btw -> the vsett 10+ LM have more SPEED but are absolute worst in efficiency
[2022-01-27T21:49:38] Paolo ⁭: If you have a very high Kv motor like rion you need put erpm switching to sensorless point to higher, or motor will vibrate very much . Default vesc setting is 4000ERPM, I’ve switched to 9000ERPM
[2022-01-27T21:49:47] Paolo ⁭: Sorry for my shit English
[2022-01-27T21:50:02] rosheee: why vibrate?
[2022-01-27T21:50:09] rosheee: set the PID correct
[2022-01-27T21:50:58] Happy Giraffe: And here comes the power?
[2022-01-27T21:51:04] Paolo ⁭: Motor saturation
[2022-01-27T21:51:27] Unknown: Hmm. I believe I can use FOC with hall, sensorless or "combined"
[2022-01-27T21:51:28] Unknown: Oh gotcha.. I see what you're saying. High kv/ERPM on halls only can go bad
[2022-01-27T21:51:28] rosheee: explaiiin
[2022-01-27T21:51:47] rosheee: u can even use BMFE with sensor/hall
[2022-01-27T21:51:57] rosheee: nooo
[2022-01-27T21:52:02] rosheee: when u set the shit correct not
[2022-01-27T21:52:18] rosheee: i had vibrations yesterday at 80kmh
[2022-01-27T21:52:21] rosheee: today nothjing
[2022-01-27T21:52:42] rosheee: get the right setting here
[2022-01-27T21:53:08] Unknown: Gotcha gotcha
[2022-01-27T21:53:09] rosheee: current decoupling + vector frequency correct
[2022-01-27T21:53:12] rosheee: it worked for me
[2022-01-27T21:53:27] Paolo ⁭: No, you need use more hall when you’ve high Kv motor with high current
[2022-01-27T21:53:36] rosheee: how many ERPM u go
[2022-01-27T21:53:38] Paolo ⁭: I put 300A motor current in rion motor
[2022-01-27T21:53:47] rosheee: i go 250A current
[2022-01-27T21:54:09] Paolo ⁭: Total or each motor?
[2022-01-27T21:54:13] rosheee: each mot0r
[2022-01-27T21:54:14] Artem Bulashev: It mented over cable line, which mins temp of the cable was excessive
[2022-01-27T21:54:25] Paolo ⁭: Let me seen app record pls
[2022-01-27T21:54:30] rosheee: i p0sted all
[2022-01-27T21:54:31] Artem Bulashev: Be careful problem May be not the cells but the way battery designed
[2022-01-27T21:54:58] Artem Bulashev: What is LM?
[2022-01-27T21:55:03] rosheee: casn u show us some records pls?
[2022-01-27T21:55:09] rosheee: i am the only fagot who shares that
[2022-01-27T21:55:16] rosheee: can i see 300A pls?
[2022-01-27T21:55:29] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-27T21:55:29] sombre_enfant: Wich one dual phase or normal ?
[2022-01-27T21:55:35] rosheee: dual
[2022-01-27T21:55:37] Paolo ⁭: You need ask me that before burn all vesc I have
[2022-01-27T21:55:42] Paolo ⁭: 😆😆😆😆
[2022-01-27T21:55:47] rosheee: u alrdy said u burn them 😆
[2022-01-27T21:55:53] rosheee: i record every ride
[2022-01-27T21:55:54] sombre_enfant: Normal have less speed ?
[2022-01-27T21:55:59] rosheee: yes
[2022-01-27T21:56:04] sombre_enfant: F
[2022-01-27T21:56:04] rosheee: like 10-15kmh
[2022-01-27T21:56:09] sombre_enfant: Bruh
[2022-01-27T21:56:19] sombre_enfant: Thats a lot
[2022-01-27T21:56:21] Paolo ⁭: I’ve burned 2 flipsky 200A battery continuos vesc, 2 spintend single ubox and a flipsky 75100
[2022-01-27T21:56:25] sombre_enfant: On the feeling
[2022-01-27T21:56:33] rosheee: and never recorded
[2022-01-27T21:56:54] Paolo ⁭: Yeah, easy motivation. I don’t use Bluetooth
[2022-01-27T21:57:06] sombre_enfant: With what u record not everyone got stuff to film porn
[2022-01-27T21:57:16] rosheee: yah when it has bluetooth
[2022-01-27T21:57:34] Paolo ⁭: But if you want, when I’ve again vesc I will show you how motor vibrates without 9000ERPM hall switching to sensorless
[2022-01-27T21:57:36] rosheee: i wanna show my mini benis here when all have 6969W and 1337A
[2022-01-27T21:57:55] rosheee: ok then u test my settings :D
[2022-01-27T21:58:04] rosheee: if it still vibrates i vibrate to shut my fuck up
[2022-01-27T21:58:33] sombre_enfant: 😂😂
[2022-01-27T21:58:40] rosheee: ah
[2022-01-27T21:58:45] rosheee: it reached 4kw each
[2022-01-27T21:58:50] Paolo ⁭: Bro this is theory, foc when motor saturates can’t follow more motor
[2022-01-27T21:59:03] rosheee: say it in italian
[2022-01-27T21:59:23] rosheee: how many duty u get there? maybe it is current switch frequency which is lacking
[2022-01-27T21:59:27] rosheee: then it goes brbrbrbrbr
[2022-01-27T22:01:12] Artem Bulashev: It’s not a decrease as such, it is transferred away from windings to the magnets/rim mass that is air cooled
[2022-01-27T22:01:30] Artem Bulashev: So on one end it is bad as magnets get to highertemp
[2022-01-27T22:01:43] Paolo ⁭: U know what motor saturation means? If yes you will know what I’m mean
[2022-01-27T22:01:45] Artem Bulashev: But also it is good as entire motor incl startor is now cooled
[2022-01-27T22:02:13] Paolo ⁭: This problem doesn’t happen with bldc , but with foc yes. Motor saturation cause foc bad working
[2022-01-27T22:08:21] rosheee: what is it?
[2022-01-27T22:09:26] Paolo ⁭: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(magnetic)
[2022-01-27T22:10:07] Paolo ⁭: Maybe @koxx3 can explain you better, I’m not good in english and I’m this field 😅
[2022-01-27T22:10:24] rosheee: You are right, the saturation is related to the magnetic flux density [B] measured in Gauss [or Wb/sqr.m=Tesla]. [10000 gauss=1Wb/sqr.m] If we neglect the field losses in adjacent air, the same magnetic flux [measured in Wb [Webers] circulates from rotor through the air gap to the stator and again through the air gap to the rotor. The flux density is roughly the ratio flux/area. The air gap area is the largest. The rotor teeth area is the minimal area. The maximum B will be in the rotor teeth and then in the stator teeth. The rotor is less solicited than the teeth and the stator lesser. The minimum B is in entrefer [air gap]. From the Attachment one can see how for 31% voltage rise the MMF rises 350%. MMF=magnetomotive Force is total Ampere-turns of the motor [of both stator and rotor] direct proportional with Imiu [as per Van Wormer model]
[2022-01-27T22:10:39] rosheee: yes u go full retard and give steroids
[2022-01-27T22:11:46] Paolo ⁭: I still doesn’t know if my motor was get fucked since when I opened it or is due to Kv
[2022-01-27T22:12:25] Paolo ⁭: Just waiting new motor and see😅
[2022-01-27T22:12:59] Paolo ⁭: Bought this
[2022-01-27T22:14:41] rosheee: sry i told u bullshit
[2022-01-27T22:14:49] rosheee: i just push 125A per motor
[2022-01-27T22:14:57] rosheee: means togewther 250
[2022-01-27T22:16:02] rosheee: but max temp 51 degrees C
[2022-01-27T22:19:58] Paolo ⁭: My motor problem are only torque at low rpm
[2022-01-27T22:20:25] Paolo ⁭: Over 40kmh start torque
[2022-01-27T22:22:06] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-01-27T22:22:18] rosheee: can't get his ass up and goes max retard in the end
[2022-01-27T23:07:19] Unknown: Yes, good way to put it. Heat is transferred from stator thru ferrofluid to magnets, which are then air cooled by design on the outside of the hub. Magnets do get warmer but overall motor stays much cooler. Maybe accurate to say... Magnets are more similar temperature to stator... So instead of "hot stator and cold magnets" you now "get warm stator and warm magnets". Motor cover near stator is always warmer/hotter than outside hub at magnets but now with ferrofluid temperature is now evenly distributed and overall less due to larger cooling area
[2022-01-27T23:22:07] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, for me same 25-30kmh insane torque
[2022-01-27T23:22:35] rosheee: Gimme some torque
[2022-01-27T23:23:09] Happy Giraffe: I think the moment when vesc switches to sensorless it gives you all the boost
[2022-01-27T23:23:22] Happy Giraffe: It was like 2 seconds from that and I hit 60kmh lmao
[2022-01-27T23:23:39] rosheee: I have no boost
[2022-01-27T23:23:43] rosheee: 60kmh uphill
[2022-01-27T23:23:47] rosheee: That motor thicc
[2022-01-27T23:24:34] rosheee: Y no share cfg?
[2022-01-27T23:24:38] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-27T23:24:45] rosheee: We are so family
[2022-01-27T23:26:18] Paolo ⁭: Anyway better than vsett motor 🍌
[2022-01-27T23:27:36] rosheee: Yes
[2022-01-27T23:27:56] rosheee: It is wider bettter more expensive
[2022-01-27T23:28:03] rosheee: But i cant fit
[2022-01-27T23:28:30] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-27T23:28:31] rosheee: I mean i have 0-80 3.3sec
[2022-01-27T23:28:38] Paolo ⁭: No it’s also 50mm
[2022-01-27T23:28:49] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-01-27T23:28:50] rosheee: Thst is why it is 1cm wider
[2022-01-27T23:28:55] rosheee: 145mm
[2022-01-27T23:29:01] rosheee: Not 135mm
[2022-01-27T23:29:05] rosheee: Anyway
[2022-01-27T23:29:40] rosheee: Not all have money to throw out like you 2 guys
[2022-01-27T23:29:51] Paolo ⁭: It’s 135, I’m confused with my motor
[2022-01-27T23:29:55] rosheee: Maybe u can give 1-2 for charity?
[2022-01-27T23:30:04] rosheee: It is 135mm wide?
[2022-01-27T23:30:07] rosheee: Not 145mm?
[2022-01-27T23:30:13] Paolo ⁭: Yes, mine is 145
[2022-01-27T23:30:18] Paolo ⁭: Blade one is 135
[2022-01-27T23:30:26] rosheee: Ahhhh
[2022-01-27T23:30:27] rosheee: Ok
[2022-01-27T23:30:33] rosheee: And u talk about,?
[2022-01-27T23:30:36] rosheee: Happy blade
[2022-01-27T23:30:38] rosheee: And u rion
[2022-01-27T23:30:49] Paolo ⁭: I never used it with vesc
[2022-01-27T23:31:02] Paolo ⁭: But many customers use it with vesc
[2022-01-27T23:31:11] rosheee: How much is 1?
[2022-01-27T23:31:23] rosheee: And it has less power and more better?
[2022-01-27T23:31:48] Happy Giraffe: The motor is insane but problem is vesc at low speed
[2022-01-27T23:31:59] rosheee: The blade motor?
[2022-01-27T23:32:05] rosheee: What jappens?
[2022-01-27T23:32:15] Paolo ⁭: Need more phase current
[2022-01-27T23:32:20] Happy Giraffe: Yes, why cant they just push some more amps right away
[2022-01-27T23:32:24] Happy Giraffe: 120A🌚
[2022-01-27T23:32:41] Paolo ⁭: Chinese controllers have higher current in start
[2022-01-27T23:32:46] Happy Giraffe: But something happens at 25kmh, I get massive power there
[2022-01-27T23:32:56] rosheee: Lol?
[2022-01-27T23:33:03] Happy Giraffe: And theres no way to set this in vesc?
[2022-01-27T23:33:22] rosheee: THISNIS WHY I ASKBU
[2022-01-27T23:33:22] Paolo ⁭: Yes you can, but spintend heat as crazy ahhaha

[2022-01-27T23:39:35] Unknown: This is the clearest explanation I could find regarding why FOC/VESC don't have that initial power like cheap Chinese controllers. It's how the power is delivered based on throttle request
[2022-01-27T23:40:29] Mirono escooters: I thought it was because thé bldc has aggresive spikes
[2022-01-27T23:40:36] sombre_enfant: Speed based algorithm
[2022-01-27T23:40:51] Unknown: Exactly
[2022-01-27T23:41:02] rosheee: use duty cycle ^^
[2022-01-27T23:41:11] Unknown: Cheap Chinese controllers are dumb so they just use max power to achieve goal
[2022-01-27T23:41:35] Unknown: And in turn have more intial power but inefficient power
[2022-01-27T23:42:18] Mirono escooters: 80€ AWD with Dash controllers we're so fucking dumb progermmed.
[2022-01-27T23:42:39] Mirono escooters: Ebrake with linear sensor was on or off. And the throttle is so aggresive it was a hell to learn to ride. Was scary
[2022-01-27T23:42:39] sombre_enfant: Acceleration feeling is better that way sometime than powerbased
[2022-01-27T23:44:17] Unknown: It can be for sure. Things like acceleration and adjustable current can somewhat make up for this to a point. But they will always be less efficient by design
[2022-01-27T23:44:55] rosheee: then change throttle curve XD
[2022-01-27T23:45:02] Happy Giraffe: For me I want throttle to control power, low position efficiency, medium faster but efficient, max is balls to walls
[2022-01-27T23:45:03] rosheee: or with chunese?
[2022-01-27T23:45:12] Happy Giraffe: Im kinda disappointed vesc doesnt have this
[2022-01-27T23:45:19] rosheee: current?
[2022-01-27T23:45:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha pay me 😁😏
[2022-01-27T23:45:31] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but start current is shit
[2022-01-27T23:45:39] rosheee: yes
[2022-01-27T23:45:39] Paolo ⁭: Give you baguette
[2022-01-27T23:45:47] rosheee: because u maybe have shitty setting
[2022-01-27T23:45:58] rosheee: go to adc -> Throttle
[2022-01-27T23:46:03] rosheee: and change there
[2022-01-27T23:46:04] sombre_enfant: I would like speedbased start up then powerbased at certain speed it would be aggressive and efficient...
[2022-01-27T23:46:10] Mirono escooters: On a 80€ controller. Good luck
[2022-01-27T23:46:16] Paolo ⁭: I be set on vesc that option I think , still not tried
[2022-01-27T23:46:53] rosheee: or choose RPM
[2022-01-27T23:47:27] sombre_enfant: 0-20😐 30-60😎
[2022-01-27T23:47:32] rosheee: ^^ maybe the motor is not that good
[2022-01-27T23:47:45] rosheee: vsett goes like a fucking hell beast from 0-10
[2022-01-27T23:47:57] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-27T23:48:41] sombre_enfant: I've been used of dual now on single thats why
[2022-01-27T23:48:49] rosheee: but happy when i ever see videos of that superhardcore acceleration
[2022-01-27T23:49:00] rosheee: I RLY JUST WANNA SEE BECAUSE
[2022-01-27T23:49:09] rosheee: or dude
[2022-01-27T23:49:12] rosheee: how much for 1 motor?
[2022-01-27T23:49:19] rosheee: or if 135mm then how much for 2?
[2022-01-27T23:49:35] rosheee: if gay i say
[2022-01-27T23:49:39] rosheee: if nice as well

[2022-01-27T23:52:08] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't have this motor in stock
[2022-01-27T23:52:22] Paolo ⁭: Only 75mm you have damn
[2022-01-27T23:52:23] Unknown: That's a cool idea and would be best of both worlds
[2022-01-27T23:52:24] sombre_enfant: Datasheet is trust me they fast askip

[2022-01-27T23:53:11] Face de Pin Sucé: X)
[2022-01-27T23:53:22] Mirono escooters: Lol Greentime i have. As said programmed like proper garbage
[2022-01-27T23:53:22] Paolo ⁭: How much you sell them including rim?
[2022-01-27T23:53:45] Paolo ⁭: If I find way to put biggest axis maybe I can bought 1😂
[2022-01-27T23:53:46] Unknown: 🤣
[2022-01-27T23:54:05] Mirono escooters: It's fun tho
[2022-01-27T23:54:09] Mirono escooters: AWD 40a each lol
[2022-01-27T23:54:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't sell rims yet, hard to find those ones x)
[2022-01-27T23:54:52] Paolo ⁭: Omg I wanna seen double sabvoton on my scoot, maybe battery will die hahaha, it’s without bms
[2022-01-27T23:55:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Can have but, wait for FastRide to tell me the public price so I sell same price
[2022-01-27T23:55:36] Paolo ⁭: You work in fast ride?
[2022-01-27T23:55:41] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-01-27T23:55:50] Mirono escooters: No bms??
[2022-01-27T23:55:57] Paolo ⁭: Wtf useless motor without rim
[2022-01-27T23:56:11] Paolo ⁭: Nope, only for balancing and charging like rion
[2022-01-27T23:56:46] Face de Pin Sucé: No, I work with them, but they are Weped Europe so when I sell a WEPED product I sell at same price
[2022-01-27T23:57:05] Face de Pin Sucé: It's for WEPED those 75mm
[2022-01-27T23:57:10] Happy Giraffe: Dual Blade and Sabvoton🌚
[2022-01-27T23:57:40] Paolo ⁭: If isn’t a problem pls tell me where you work❤️ at march I come to Paris and want see you😏
[2022-01-27T23:57:44] Unknown: Buddy of mine built a 20s 10+ battery with no BMS and only active cell balancer. So discharge with fuse protection and charge normally. Then switch on cell balancer to balance the cells... No bottleneck and battery stays balanced. Seems to be working good so far. I decided to go for the BMS with the active balancer, same idea but with integrated 150a BMS and charge protection
[2022-01-27T23:57:51] Face de Pin Sucé: I'll soon be able to sell the rims too with those 75mm motors but for now I only sell hub for Weped users x)
[2022-01-27T23:58:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha I live in Lyon
[2022-01-27T23:58:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Why don't you come in May ?

[2022-01-27T23:59:35] Face de Pin Sucé: May
[2022-01-27T23:59:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Those batteries can wait
[2022-01-27T23:59:46] Face de Pin Sucé: 😁
[2022-01-28T00:00:29] Paolo ⁭: I will also come in may hahah , not expensive ticket price
[2022-01-28T00:00:40] Paolo ⁭: Just not good for transport escooter :(
[2022-01-28T00:03:30] Paolo ⁭: If I’m not wrong also WEPED motor is longyu right ? Are very similar
[2022-01-28T00:04:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Really ?
[2022-01-28T00:04:36] Face de Pin Sucé: By train is okay x)

[2022-01-28T00:06:35] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2022-01-28T00:06:57] Paolo ⁭: It’s really similar I’m see
[2022-01-28T00:07:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Look similar
[2022-01-28T00:08:02] Paolo ⁭: They says produce also motor for WEPED , and is this 😂 but just ask you as more expert
[2022-01-28T13:47:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't feel any startup power issue with vesc. just have to set pid and ramping time correctly for current mode 😉
[2022-01-28T13:49:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/animation.gif>
[2022-01-28T13:50:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: selecting speed/current mode just change the input in the foc algo
[2022-01-28T16:25:30] Luis Magalhaes: Well im runing minimotors again and shit.. i miss vesc and sinewave 😂
[2022-01-28T16:26:27] Luis Magalhaes: When i start it looks a monster kick after 50 its a kitten 😂
[2022-01-28T16:32:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤣

[2022-01-28T17:36:46] rosheee: So my slow vsett mostly uphill video Still working on the settings but it is faster and use much less amps and check the temp. (120-250A before) PID settings are b0ss I am 90kg not very aerodynamic and can hit full throttle only above 30kmh.
[2022-01-28T18:10:13] Luis Magalhaes: running nice 👌
[2022-01-28T18:10:30] rosheee: thank you and it sounds better and better 😆
[2022-01-28T18:10:39] rosheee: when u throttle it makes "z000000000000000000000m"
[2022-01-28T18:10:45] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-01-28T18:10:53] rosheee: and use 100A less for more b00st
[2022-01-28T18:11:03] Luis Magalhaes: have to capture screen with sound haha
[2022-01-28T18:11:11] rosheee: u can't hear it rly
[2022-01-28T18:11:13] rosheee: will do
[2022-01-28T18:11:16] rosheee: later
[2022-01-28T18:15:19] Luis Magalhaes: 😂 ok
[2022-01-28T18:15:34] rosheee: maybe it's a bad sound XD
[2022-01-28T18:15:36] Luis Magalhaes: if the tyres slips you can hear haha
[2022-01-28T18:15:50] rosheee: ah yes but hate that
[2022-01-28T18:16:00] rosheee: u hear more the motor itself not the tire 😃
[2022-01-28T18:16:05] rosheee: electricity
[2022-01-28T18:16:07] rosheee: can'0t explain
[2022-01-28T18:16:58] rosheee: i do
[2022-01-28T18:18:25] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-01-28T18:18:32] Luis Magalhaes: but your not runing foc ?
[2022-01-28T18:18:48] rosheee: I DO
[2022-01-28T18:19:30] rosheee: just changed some stuff @ PID and else
[2022-01-28T18:19:37] Luis Magalhaes: and your hear motor scream ?
[2022-01-28T18:19:46] rosheee: it isn't screaming
[2022-01-28T18:20:10] rosheee: u have video to that?
[2022-01-28T18:20:14] rosheee: maybe it is xD
[2022-01-28T18:20:14] Luis Magalhaes: way of saying 🤣
[2022-01-28T18:20:29] rosheee: it sounds happy :D
[2022-01-28T18:22:17] rosheee: maybe cuz switching frequency
[2022-01-28T18:22:21] rosheee: i can share my settings if u want
[2022-01-28T18:22:29] Mirono escooters: Maybe resonating
[2022-01-28T18:22:40] rosheee: it begins at 20
[2022-01-28T18:22:47] rosheee: then goes meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeioioiiiiiip
[2022-01-28T18:22:56] rosheee: need spinners for the wheels with happy cat face
[2022-01-28T18:23:11] Mirono escooters: Have you tried asking it politely to stop
[2022-01-28T18:23:15] rosheee: nono
[2022-01-28T18:23:18] rosheee: itt should keep going
[2022-01-28T18:24:13] rosheee: at least i can watch logs again ❤️
[2022-01-28T18:24:29] rosheee: it works better than before idk why
[2022-01-28T18:24:57] rosheee: only sad thing is ..boost until 65kmh then slowdown :D
[2022-01-28T18:25:12] rosheee: maybe use field weakening kicking in at 65kmh
[2022-01-28T18:25:23] rosheee: maybe try +20A kicking in at 85% duty
[2022-01-28T18:28:21] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>

[2022-01-28T19:57:13] rosheee: 0 force
[2022-01-28T19:57:39] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-01-28T19:57:39] rosheee: Fits perfect
[2022-01-28T19:58:04] rosheee: Regarding the discussion about the motor
[2022-01-28T20:12:54] sombre_enfant: @feddec77 its your time to buy with aliexpress shipping 😂
[2022-01-28T20:18:04] rosheee: Here u have teh evidence
[2022-01-28T20:24:26] Federico77: ok ok The engine of the vsett10 goes perfectly in the FRAME of the g30, last thing I ask you, front and rear motor are the same ??
[2022-01-28T20:25:27] rosheee: Yes
[2022-01-28T20:26:46] Federico77: 👍
[2022-01-28T20:28:12] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-28T20:28:26] rosheee: Monorim u have to bend
[2022-01-28T20:28:34] Mirono escooters: Sssht
[2022-01-28T20:29:26] Face de Pin Sucé: amazing x)
[2022-01-28T20:34:23] Federico77: <photos/photo_2145@28-01-2022_20-34-23.jpg>
[2022-01-28T20:36:13] rosheee: Yes wider if u want dual
[2022-01-28T20:37:37] Happy Giraffe: And turn the arms around I think
[2022-01-28T20:43:01] Federico77: the arms of the suspension right to left and left to right must be reversed
[2022-01-28T20:52:04] rosheee: Like @Happy_Giraffe said
[2022-01-28T20:58:55] rosheee: And drill hole
[2022-01-28T20:59:01] rosheee: <photos/photo_2146@28-01-2022_20-59-01.jpg>
[2022-01-28T20:59:09] rosheee: Otherwise it gets ugly like mine
[2022-01-28T20:59:16] rosheee: <photos/photo_2147@28-01-2022_20-59-16.jpg>
[2022-01-28T21:00:03] Artem Bulashev: That’s bad mix 😅😅😅
[2022-01-28T21:00:31] Artem Bulashev: They have terribly different discharge curves under 8a load and more
[2022-01-28T21:02:04] Artem Bulashev: You are at around 8-10a per cell it seems (estimate 133a from vat)
[2022-01-28T21:05:24] Federico77: but it was not enough to reverse the rotation of the motor and enlarge the original hole ???
[2022-01-28T21:07:11] rosheee: Cuz brake
[2022-01-28T21:07:15] Luis Magalhaes: Was , no im using mínimotors lolol
[2022-01-28T21:07:50] rosheee: U can if u want
[2022-01-28T21:10:15] Federico77: Understand
[2022-01-28T21:11:19] sombre_enfant: The axle turned ? No sécurity washer or ?
[2022-01-28T21:11:44] rosheee: Securitywasher?
[2022-01-28T21:11:50] rosheee: It has this
[2022-01-28T21:12:07] sombre_enfant: The one who are bent at the end
[2022-01-28T21:12:18] rosheee: <photos/photo_2148@28-01-2022_21-12-18.jpg>
[2022-01-28T21:12:26] rosheee: This on bothsides
[2022-01-28T21:12:29] sombre_enfant: U cutted here😂
[2022-01-28T21:12:36] rosheee: Yes xD
[2022-01-28T21:12:45] rosheee: Because i can fit thesw
[2022-01-28T21:13:00] rosheee: <photos/photo_2150@28-01-2022_21-13-00.jpg>
[2022-01-28T21:13:14] rosheee: But i may change to better quality than this
[2022-01-28T21:13:18] sombre_enfant: I removed the plate im lazy to put them back... I know i should
[2022-01-28T21:13:26] rosheee: <photos/photo_2152@28-01-2022_21-13-26.jpg>
[2022-01-28T21:13:36] rosheee: U got it xD
[2022-01-28T21:14:37] sombre_enfant: Do those slipper are actually effective if u crash i always spank my axle when i go out of ascensor
[2022-01-28T21:14:55] rosheee: The one i get from a friend yes
[2022-01-28T21:15:04] rosheee: For motorbike racing
[2022-01-28T21:15:19] rosheee: Is customers scooter btw..he gave me them
[2022-01-28T21:15:29] rosheee: True alu xD
[2022-01-28T21:15:50] rosheee: 1-2mm alu
[2022-01-28T21:22:44] sombre_enfant: Dont really help
[2022-01-28T21:22:52] rosheee: Nope
[2022-01-28T21:22:56] rosheee: But looks cool
[2022-01-28T21:23:02] rosheee: The one i get help
[2022-01-28T21:23:15] sombre_enfant: Ye
[2022-01-28T21:23:23] rosheee: But scooter looks so shit..gonna drill hole as well and and and
[2022-01-28T21:26:07] sombre_enfant: I hate drill frame because im a bicycle rider...
[2022-01-28T21:26:37] sombre_enfant: When my friend started to drill my pole for hydro hose😐
[2022-01-28T21:27:50] rosheee: Hydro hose?
[2022-01-28T21:28:03] rosheee: Im swiss german swimsuit xD
[2022-01-28T21:28:19] rosheee: Yah i hate drilling as well but
[2022-01-28T21:28:47] rosheee: I learned..look at this shit i havr done..omg
[2022-01-28T21:29:26] sombre_enfant: U know the wire for brake, its not the name ?
[2022-01-28T21:29:46] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-01-28T21:29:47] rosheee: I know what u mean but not the ahh hydraulic hose
[2022-01-28T21:29:49] rosheee: Yaya xF
[2022-01-28T21:30:12] rosheee: Hole
[2022-01-28T21:30:23] rosheee: Yah but as swiss u can do the cheeze
[2022-01-28T21:30:39] Mirono escooters: Omg lol. This u meant. 😂
[2022-01-28T21:42:36] sombre_enfant: Twin
[2022-01-28T21:42:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Twin teen
[2022-01-28T21:58:13] rosheee: hmm
[2022-01-28T23:18:00] rosheee: yo
[2022-01-28T23:18:06] rosheee: anyone has 300A spintend 5.3 FW?
[2022-01-28T23:25:18] Luis Magalhaes: only 5.2
[2022-01-28T23:25:20] rosheee: ME2
[2022-01-28T23:25:47] rosheee: all except 5.3 300A

[2022-01-28T23:27:57] rosheee: but these are all except 5.3 V2
[2022-01-29T00:31:01] rosheee: anyone has a link for field weakening? seems like it was more my head who thought it works ^^
[2022-01-29T00:31:11] rosheee: tried 40A now @ 70% duty
[2022-01-29T00:31:27] Happy Giraffe: Its just 5.3 fw
[2022-01-29T00:31:31] Happy Giraffe: And option there
[2022-01-29T00:31:57] Happy Giraffe: I analyzed my logs and when I hit 60kmh it was 95% max duty cycle...
[2022-01-29T00:33:17] rosheee: yah but there should be boost , not?
[2022-01-29T00:33:41] rosheee: cuz i always hit 98%
[2022-01-29T00:33:54] rosheee: thought when i set it to 70% it starts kicking in then
[2022-01-29T00:36:39] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, I havent studied that yet. Need to try sensorless earlier tomorrow
[2022-01-29T00:37:01] rosheee: ^^ try the one i send u as well if u want and have time ❤️
[2022-01-29T01:19:15] Happy Giraffe: Im too afraid to mess with that stuff this early, gotta learn bit more
[2022-01-29T01:20:17] rosheee: with which one
[2022-01-29T01:20:25] rosheee: field or the other?
[2022-01-29T01:21:50] Happy Giraffe: Any of them😂
[2022-01-29T01:21:57] rosheee: XD
[2022-01-29T01:22:08] Happy Giraffe: Is it ok for you if I share those messages here?😂
[2022-01-29T01:22:17] rosheee: NO !!
[2022-01-29T01:22:19] rosheee: ofc ^^
[2022-01-29T01:22:23] rosheee: wait
[2022-01-29T01:22:25] rosheee: i share it
[2022-01-29T01:22:28] rosheee: then ppl can say
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: HERE
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: Reconfig motor from start Then what helped me: When u do detection set the Watt of motor at loss power where u choose the motor size Set there 1200W And dont check the box where u can set the current limit at the beginning Then finish the wizard After that: Set your current n shit But dont change powerlimit @ watt or rpm Also dont change anything at motor- advanced Then go to FOC do the FOC measurement again WITH THESE values
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: Then
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: <photos/photo_2154@29-01-2022_01-22-51.jpg>
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: If motor doesnt run up set 400 hall interpolation
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: Now fun part FOC advanced Set this
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: <photos/photo_2156@29-01-2022_01-22-51.jpg>
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: Start here with 20 khz
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: U habe 3 shunts like vesc 6, right?
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: Motor cfg additonal settings det your 30 poles 253-254mm tire and battery..gear 1
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: now PID
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: Thrn try this
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: <photos/photo_2159@29-01-2022_01-22-51.jpg>
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: <photos/photo_2160@29-01-2022_01-22-51.jpg>

[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: <photos/photo_2162@29-01-2022_01-22-51.jpg>
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: Then configure throttle and tell me how the motor sounds
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: And if u give a shit i wasted my life again xD
[2022-01-29T01:22:51] rosheee: Otherwise we have to finetune in PID
[2022-01-29T01:23:48] rosheee: just wasn't in the group don't wanna harm anyones HW so =D feel free to give input please
[2022-01-29T01:23:57] rosheee: would be welcome ❤️
[2022-01-29T01:27:42] Happy Giraffe: Who gave you this info?
[2022-01-29T01:27:59] rosheee: i tested it myself
[2022-01-29T01:28:03] rosheee: XD i read alot
[2022-01-29T01:28:05] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-29T01:28:10] rosheee: asked friend what PID does
[2022-01-29T01:28:11] rosheee: what that
[2022-01-29T01:28:21] rosheee: looked at universities
[2022-01-29T01:28:24] Happy Giraffe: Then definitely Im not gonna do that without others input first😂
[2022-01-29T01:28:31] rosheee: ^^' ok...thx
[2022-01-29T01:28:43] rosheee: well i'm trying out vesc since 2 years
[2022-01-29T01:28:45] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-01-29T01:28:54] rosheee: the ones i asked since long and program drones
[2022-01-29T01:29:11] rosheee: but yah =D then let's go
[2022-01-29T01:29:24] Happy Giraffe: I try sensorless tomorrow, and feel if its different
[2022-01-29T01:29:40] rosheee: ^^ find out how it works and what it does 😉
[2022-01-29T01:29:54] rosheee: drone motors are sensorless as example
[2022-01-29T01:29:57] Happy Giraffe: I feel sensor start is the slow problem
[2022-01-29T01:30:14] rosheee: could be 😃 try it out and share it tomorrow with us
[2022-01-29T01:30:27] rosheee: with flipsky vesc only sensorless worked for me less solder work
[2022-01-29T01:30:34] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-29T01:30:37] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-29T01:31:15] rosheee: at least u ask everything also how to install mobile application =D if u don't use the 300A no limit FW spintend is pretty secure
[2022-01-29T01:31:42] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-29T01:33:24] rosheee: here @PaoloWu is the burnmaster not me
[2022-01-29T01:41:09] Happy Giraffe: Problem is mosfets going 65°c and starting to lower power a bit. I will open vesc later and make cooling improvements as much as I can do
[2022-01-29T01:41:36] rosheee: have u checkled my csv's?
[2022-01-29T01:41:43] rosheee: my temps are like 30-40 degrees
[2022-01-29T01:41:48] rosheee: i even use less Amps now
[2022-01-29T01:41:51] rosheee: and have more boost
[2022-01-29T01:42:12] rosheee: before u used like 250A peak now max 200
[2022-01-29T01:42:33] Happy Giraffe: I'm not sure what's happening with my single ubox. Now I got 50/120-130A
[2022-01-29T01:42:55] rosheee: max current?
[2022-01-29T01:43:14] rosheee: motor max 120 overall 130 battery 50
[2022-01-29T01:44:34] rosheee: <l_current_max>135</l_current_max> <l_current_min>0</l_current_min> <l_in_current_max>61</l_in_current_max> <l_in_current_min>0</l_in_current_min> <l_abs_current_max>160</l_abs_current_max>
[2022-01-29T01:45:22] rosheee: u still dont wanna share a log file?
[2022-01-29T01:47:32] Happy Giraffe: Trampa guy talks about HFI startup giving 100% torque at very low rpm
[2022-01-29T01:48:37] rosheee: ok my motors didn0t moved after just cjhanged something @ hfi
[2022-01-29T01:49:18] rosheee: but just to understand it without seeing log when u push the throttle like an idiot from 0-30 it needs like 10sec?
[2022-01-29T01:49:25] Happy Giraffe: HFI start is a silent version of normal noisy HFI. They talk about motor temperature sensor being needed for this so its bit weird. And also hot motors having different resistances to cold ones🤔
[2022-01-29T01:49:44] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, 5 seconds
[2022-01-29T01:50:10] Happy Giraffe: And if I start uphill its not related to time but for speed
[2022-01-29T01:56:54] rosheee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaFeAjzTqfc
[2022-01-29T01:56:55] rosheee: ok
[2022-01-29T01:56:59] rosheee: never tried it
[2022-01-29T02:00:39] rosheee: video is very nice holycrap
[2022-01-29T02:01:57] rosheee: High Frequency Injection (HFI) is the most significant update of FW 4.00, which almost gives sensorless motors the same performance as sensored ones at the cost of some noise. It requires a bit of tweaking and does not work for all motors, but for some applications this can be a game
[2022-01-29T02:02:10] Happy Giraffe: I watched that earlier, first I think I try messing around with very sensorless rpm speed. Sensored from 0-10kmh, basically me kicking scooter once
[2022-01-29T02:02:43] Happy Giraffe: Yeah,big inductance difference needed for this
[2022-01-29T02:02:48] rosheee: yep
[2022-01-29T02:02:51] rosheee: hope u get it
[2022-01-29T02:03:17] rosheee: VSS sounds nice
[2022-01-29T02:03:52] Happy Giraffe: Vedder Sensorless Startup?
[2022-01-29T02:03:55] rosheee: yes
[2022-01-29T02:03:58] Happy Giraffe: Or what is it
[2022-01-29T02:04:15] Happy Giraffe: Oh, havent tried. Maybe its his optimized no current HFI
[2022-01-29T02:05:22] Happy Giraffe: Trampa made big marketing claims about it as A.S.S
[2022-01-29T02:05:30] Happy Giraffe: Advanced Sensorless Start lol
[2022-01-29T02:05:33] rosheee: XD
[2022-01-29T02:15:05] rosheee: at least u have no stuttering
[2022-01-29T14:00:14] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2022-01-29T14:00:19] Happy Giraffe: Damn wind...
[2022-01-29T14:40:26] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_2163@29-01-2022_14-40-26.jpg>
[2022-01-29T14:41:20] Happy Giraffe: Selecting VSS startup is confusing, anyone knows which of these is the VSS encoder?
[2022-01-29T14:41:20] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_2165@29-01-2022_14-41-20.jpg>
[2022-01-29T14:42:04] Happy Giraffe: Maybe @artBula @koxx3 or @SibClimb know😳
[2022-01-29T14:50:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: never tried yet
[2022-01-29T14:53:09] Happy Giraffe: I'm just confused, why don't they just type there VSS instead
[2022-01-29T14:53:24] Happy Giraffe: Maybe it's under sensorless tab, I check
[2022-01-29T14:53:49] sombre_enfant: Why u want to use sensorless ?
[2022-01-29T14:56:34] Happy Giraffe: Found it
[2022-01-29T14:57:18] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2022-01-29T15:01:03] Happy Giraffe: Will try these settings bit later
[2022-01-29T15:02:30] Face de Pin Sucé: VSS is sensorless
[2022-01-29T15:03:31] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-01-29T15:03:38] Happy Giraffe: Oh, but normal sensorless doesnt involve HFI
[2022-01-29T15:03:54] Happy Giraffe: Vedder Sensorless Startup uses HFI sound as you can hear

[2022-01-29T15:09:21] Luis Magalhaes: Why is only the ssgt on fast ride only? Is it modified by fast ride?
[2022-01-29T15:09:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2022-01-29T15:10:18] Luis Magalhaes: I tried to convince wife too 😂 but she tells me to sell the wolf and the motorbike 😂😂
[2022-01-29T15:10:31] Luis Magalhaes: Its the SS chassis then?
[2022-01-29T15:10:36] Face de Pin Sucé: It's made reliable by FastRide so they can warranty
[2022-01-29T15:10:41] Face de Pin Sucé: No, it's GTS
[2022-01-29T15:10:45] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2022-01-29T15:11:22] Luis Magalhaes: Thats why i wouldent bother to install halls 😂
[2022-01-29T15:11:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Really interested in your testings
[2022-01-29T15:11:46] Luis Magalhaes: Made by nume ?
[2022-01-29T15:11:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Yup
[2022-01-29T15:12:05] Luis Magalhaes: Ok 👌
[2022-01-29T15:12:25] Luis Magalhaes: They should sell only chassis without motors and electronic 😂
[2022-01-29T15:15:25] sombre_enfant: You got a pig at home ? 😂
[2022-01-29T15:17:29] sombre_enfant: Did you selled yours yet ?

[2022-01-29T16:22:37] Happy Giraffe: HFI as the settings I had didnt work
[2022-01-29T16:22:54] Happy Giraffe: Had to push scooter so it basically was in standard sensorless mode already then
[2022-01-29T16:23:19] Happy Giraffe: I had 20v signal so it should have been enough to saturate the coils a bit
[2022-01-29T16:24:07] Happy Giraffe: And same shity acceleration with or without sensors. Also Spintend single shit is overheating, I gotta order thermal pads and fix it
[2022-01-29T17:48:55] rosheee: Tried my stuff?
[2022-01-29T17:50:02] rosheee: Set throttle to duty instead current
[2022-01-29T17:50:20] rosheee: Could u share your motorsettongs xml teh pls?
[2022-01-29T17:58:27] Happy Giraffe: Nothing fancy

[2022-01-29T22:49:41] rosheee: ?
[2022-01-29T22:49:51] rosheee: When it jumps?
[2022-01-29T22:49:53] rosheee: Gps failed
[2022-01-29T22:50:02] rosheee: Gonna do proper video tomorrow
[2022-01-29T22:52:06] rosheee: But it felt faster than before with modded setting
[2022-01-29T22:52:12] rosheee: Have to check vesc log
[2022-01-29T22:53:15] rosheee: This is the strange one
[2022-01-29T22:53:58] rosheee: Omfg 2h for 1mb?!
[2022-01-29T22:54:00] Luis Magalhaes: It looks like it freezes and jump

[2022-01-29T22:54:26] rosheee: Yes gps was bad thetr
[2022-01-29T22:54:31] rosheee: Thst is why vesclog
[2022-01-29T22:55:19] rosheee: N1 no gps because insta app
[2022-01-29T22:56:11] rosheee: 81.67kmh max

[2022-01-30T00:22:48] rosheee: what?
[2022-01-30T00:22:55] rosheee: it was always g30 XD
[2022-01-30T00:23:15] rosheee: 4 m365 pro1+2 with max 15S but the G30D is road legal in switzerland
[2022-01-30T00:23:23] rosheee: and ^^' it looks pretty stock ^__^ police don't care
[2022-01-30T00:23:28] Artem Bulashev: 👍
[2022-01-30T00:23:57] Artem Bulashev: Until they see you or follow you before you notice at 50kmh ahaha
[2022-01-30T00:23:59] Artem Bulashev: Happened to me
[2022-01-30T00:24:03] Artem Bulashev: On vsett9
[2022-01-30T00:24:07] Artem Bulashev: Also legal
[2022-01-30T00:24:10] rosheee: happened
[2022-01-30T00:24:11] Artem Bulashev: But well, they followed me 400m at 55kmh haha
[2022-01-30T00:24:30] rosheee: hmm
[2022-01-30T00:24:36] rosheee: with 500w motor :D
[2022-01-30T00:24:42] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-01-30T00:24:44] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2022-01-30T00:25:11] rosheee: but so far so good

[2022-01-30T00:25:34] Artem Bulashev: Get rear view mirror lol
[2022-01-30T00:25:42] rosheee: no
[2022-01-30T00:25:43] rosheee: XD
[2022-01-30T00:25:45] rosheee: looks awful
[2022-01-30T00:25:48] Artem Bulashev: I know right :))
[2022-01-30T00:25:51] rosheee: i watch my back
[2022-01-30T00:25:55] Artem Bulashev: Back up camera
[2022-01-30T00:25:55] rosheee: or i use camera ^^
[2022-01-30T00:25:56] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2022-01-30T00:25:56] rosheee: yes
[2022-01-30T00:25:57] rosheee: XD
[2022-01-30T00:26:00] Artem Bulashev: 🤓
[2022-01-30T00:59:12] Unknown: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
[2022-01-30T01:00:07] Unknown: Sadly glued.........why....???
[2022-01-30T01:08:47] Unknown: It depends on your settings but yes you need good cells for have fun and torque. I have with g30 stock cells and pack 27 km reach. Now trying to make it efficient. Correction of positional shifting. But it is a pack killer
[2022-01-30T01:09:37] rosheee: i used 48V nordbot battery..idk how many Ah but 20-30km was no problem with 65A FW ^^
[2022-01-30T01:09:50] rosheee: 36V also no prob with 65A for 20km
[2022-01-30T01:10:24] Unknown: I'm talking about the stock pack with shitty eve cells....
[2022-01-30T01:13:14] Happy Giraffe: I tried 100A phase now, I think it suits the single ubox better
[2022-01-30T01:14:41] Happy Giraffe: Hahhaaa, this is so nice😂
[2022-01-30T02:39:47] Happy Giraffe: Spintend response to my question abour cooling:
[2022-01-30T02:39:55] Happy Giraffe: the thermal pad thickness is 0.5mm. I checked with engineer that the most effective way to strengthen cooling, maybe by exchange the outer case. our original single ubox come with thermal pad in touching the MOSFETS.
[2022-01-30T02:40:37] Happy Giraffe: So maybe I get 1mm durable pads that wont dry like the shitty Gelid and create a bit better pressure
[2022-01-30T02:43:52] Paolo ⁭: Useless 😂
[2022-01-30T02:45:12] Paolo ⁭: You just cannot cool these mosfet xd , case touch resin not die of mosfet. And anyway case is so little , you need fix the mosfet board face
[2022-01-30T02:45:31] rosheee: poor chinese new year for them :D
[2022-01-30T02:46:25] Happy Giraffe: Can I put anything on mosfet die?
[2022-01-30T02:46:35] Happy Giraffe: I cant remember exactly how it looked like
[2022-01-30T02:48:52] Paolo ⁭: No because mosfet die is the drain of mosfet, and is soldered with pcb copper. Then is impossible
[2022-01-30T02:48:53] rosheee: <photos/photo_2174@30-01-2022_02-48-53.jpg>
[2022-01-30T02:48:53] rosheee: <photos/photo_2175@30-01-2022_02-48-53.jpg>
[2022-01-30T02:52:32] Happy Giraffe: Then I wonder what can I do, use some thermal transfering compound on them to atleast trying to take the peak heat away?
[2022-01-30T02:53:37] Happy Giraffe: Now I stick to 100A phase, but planning to increase battery current to 80A
[2022-01-30T02:54:13] rosheee: And take the paint away from the casemaBe opwn the case theough a cut?
[2022-01-30T02:54:41] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but I feel like the problem here is the mosfet
[2022-01-30T02:54:45] rosheee: Yes
[2022-01-30T02:54:58] Happy Giraffe: So anything after that is minor difference
[2022-01-30T02:55:23] rosheee: Mosfets are on top where the body is cut, right?
[2022-01-30T02:55:31] Happy Giraffe: +50c and -50c dont react to each other if theres 10 meter insulator in between so same situation
[2022-01-30T02:55:55] rosheee: U use alubottomplate or steel?
[2022-01-30T02:56:42] rosheee: I have to tesr how it is with plastic Because vesc and bms directly dispense heat to the plate and that one.cools
[2022-01-30T02:56:49] Paolo ⁭: Buy more powerful vesc😂 I think flipsky is better for power xd
[2022-01-30T02:57:08] Happy Giraffe: Lol, I think about some thermal conducting grease
[2022-01-30T02:57:27] Happy Giraffe: So whatever the pcb heats up etc it can cool down even a littlebit
[2022-01-30T02:57:57] Happy Giraffe: I think if I build ebike later on I go other stuff, I want instant torque and not this waiting bs
[2022-01-30T02:58:13] rosheee: Flipsky always hall sensor error xD like 100% I would test alu/steelbottom then mpunt it to it
[2022-01-30T02:58:26] Happy Giraffe: Why is there a throttle in firsr place if I can read newspaper before anything happens
[2022-01-30T02:58:31] Paolo ⁭: Flipsky logic board is shit
[2022-01-30T02:58:34] Happy Giraffe: Flipsky also shit
[2022-01-30T02:58:41] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-30T02:58:42] Happy Giraffe: Maybe Trampa then?
[2022-01-30T02:58:53] rosheee: We can buy 2 to get better price
[2022-01-30T02:59:04] Paolo ⁭: Rion 😂
[2022-01-30T02:59:06] rosheee: And to switzerland then no tax
[2022-01-30T02:59:10] rosheee: Link
[2022-01-30T02:59:16] Happy Giraffe: Shit is shit no matter the pricw
[2022-01-30T02:59:21] Paolo ⁭: tronicsystems.com
[2022-01-30T03:00:16] Happy Giraffe: 400$ single vesc haha, but that still has same vesc software limits
[2022-01-30T03:00:20] Happy Giraffe: Slow throttle etc
[2022-01-30T03:00:50] rosheee: The single one..hmm The flipsky i had had no issues when it worked xD
[2022-01-30T03:01:07] rosheee: The dual 1000w i had first instant burnout from 0
[2022-01-30T03:02:20] rosheee: Focbox?

[2022-01-30T03:06:02] Paolo ⁭: Work anyway with 13s
[2022-01-30T03:06:14] Happy Giraffe: I stay with what I have, I try to mod it to work better
[2022-01-30T03:07:42] rosheee: I try the stock plastic bottomplate and see what happens to temp. Also i try the vesc with still paint on it
[2022-01-30T03:08:49] Happy Giraffe: Because if hotspot is against pcb then theres not much I can do, even with open powerboard and 100kmh wind on it its not much
[2022-01-30T03:08:58] rosheee: Truee
[2022-01-30T03:09:14] rosheee: It has 12V?
[2022-01-30T03:09:21] Happy Giraffe: I'm kinda afraid of summer temps lol
[2022-01-30T03:09:31] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but needs to be closed case
[2022-01-30T03:09:31] rosheee: But it is kinda strange o.O

[2022-01-30T03:13:17] rosheee: My amp settings are pretty high. Having installed the Ubox in a closed box it has no cooling beside the aluminium heatsink case. The max. temperature reached with this setup (in 21degrees Celsius ambient temperature) after 10km of riding is 40 degrees which is below the cut off temperature. During this 10km ride I pushed it quite hard with some long and short steep hills.
[2022-01-30T03:13:21] Happy Giraffe: Dont put -40 batt regen

[2022-01-30T03:13:26] rosheee: Dude omg..
[2022-01-30T03:13:27] Happy Giraffe: You will kill the cells
[2022-01-30T03:13:29] rosheee: I know how to
[2022-01-30T03:13:32] rosheee: And do t use that
[2022-01-30T03:13:36] rosheee: I am not an idiot
[2022-01-30T03:13:42] Happy Giraffe: I disagree
[2022-01-30T03:13:43] rosheee: This is from a tester
[2022-01-30T03:13:45] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-01-30T03:13:55] rosheee: At least my shit works since 5000km
[2022-01-30T03:14:01] rosheee: Anyway
[2022-01-30T03:14:06] rosheee: Habe u read?
[2022-01-30T03:14:16] rosheee: He use this settings and get 40 degrees?
[2022-01-30T03:14:24] rosheee: Wtf are u using to get what u get?
[2022-01-30T03:14:36] rosheee: Sekd the whole config as xml please
[2022-01-30T03:15:01] Happy Giraffe: It's just 50A/120A nothing special
[2022-01-30T03:15:08] rosheee: And u get that heat
[2022-01-30T03:15:46] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, some fuckery going on with their thermal pads
[2022-01-30T03:18:37] rosheee: <photos/photo_2178@30-01-2022_03-18-37.jpg>
[2022-01-30T03:18:50] rosheee: Or u are just not yet rdy for this shit
[2022-01-30T03:18:53] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-30T03:20:36] rosheee: Cut out the shrink where mosfets are

[2022-01-30T03:23:48] rosheee: Why ur duty goung up so slow?
[2022-01-30T03:24:58] rosheee: When i push throttle 100% down it goes directly to max
[2022-01-30T03:25:00] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-01-30T09:57:40] Gigolo Joe: Lol battery dropped faster than buildings on 911
[2022-01-30T12:04:23] Happy Giraffe: Nah, it drops 5v in reality
[2022-01-30T12:04:57] Happy Giraffe: If vesc logs are accurate at all
[2022-01-30T12:07:13] Happy Giraffe: But yeah I will redo motor wizard etc. acceleration this slow is weird
[2022-01-30T12:55:01] Gigolo Joe: Battery specs?
[2022-01-30T12:57:03] Happy Giraffe: 13s6p 35E
[2022-01-30T12:57:24] Happy Giraffe: So 8.2Amp load per cell
[2022-01-30T12:58:16] Happy Giraffe: Also with Xiaomi esc I used 40A batt current and vdrop was only 4v or something even using some xt30😂
[2022-01-30T12:58:39] Mirono escooters: Yea i don't understand People. Asking 60a bAttery with xt30
[2022-01-30T13:17:21] Happy Giraffe: XT30 was in the xiaomi esc
[2022-01-30T13:17:47] Happy Giraffe: So nothing was asked
[2022-01-30T13:18:04] Unknown: You have to tell them it will make kawoooom
[2022-01-30T13:25:42] Mirono escooters: I always recommend going xt60 atleast
[2022-01-30T13:25:46] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi esc u can mod it
[2022-01-30T13:37:52] Happy Giraffe: Ofc I modded it later
[2022-01-30T13:38:00] Mirono escooters: Good
[2022-01-30T14:01:02] Gigolo Joe: Nice performance if so👌🏻 What vesc?
[2022-01-30T14:07:28] Artem Bulashev: I find front 80a on my 8.5ibch motor to be the max I can safely use without loosing traction every time in just abit non-ideal conditions
[2022-01-30T14:08:00] Artem Bulashev: 8.2a max is perfect cell choice indeed than 👍
[2022-01-30T14:10:54] Happy Giraffe: 53m ohm
[2022-01-30T14:11:01] Happy Giraffe: Seems bit high
[2022-01-30T14:12:22] Happy Giraffe: I did check the connections were tight etc, might have to take another look bit later
[2022-01-30T14:18:03] Face de Pin Sucé: If low kV doesn't seem very high to me
[2022-01-30T14:31:43] Happy Giraffe: It's 13s 60kmh+ kv
[2022-01-30T14:31:52] Happy Giraffe: It was less resistance before
[2022-01-30T14:37:36] Happy Giraffe: Sorry I was talking shit
[2022-01-30T14:37:36] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_2180@30-01-2022_14-37-36.jpg>
[2022-01-30T14:37:42] Happy Giraffe: This is the old, but after new detection vesc didnt want to go forward after pressing brake so I had to restore old configs
[2022-01-30T14:42:47] Face de Pin Sucé: X)
[2022-01-30T14:43:39] Happy Giraffe: Im so confused atm
[2022-01-30T15:10:26] Artem Bulashev: :) wonder what is mine
[2022-01-30T15:10:34] DNP: Where do you drill the hole on 500w motor?
[2022-01-30T15:10:41] Artem Bulashev: 😀
[2022-01-30T15:10:46] Artem Bulashev: What
[2022-01-30T15:10:49] DNP: <photos/photo_2181@30-01-2022_15-10-49.jpg>
[2022-01-30T15:10:57] Artem Bulashev: Why you want a hole?
[2022-01-30T15:11:07] DNP: Air tyre
[2022-01-30T15:11:31] Mirono escooters: Xt150?
[2022-01-30T15:11:50] Mirono escooters: Ask in Xiaomi group or check vta
[2022-01-30T15:12:00] Artem Bulashev: Motors are soldered directly
[2022-01-30T15:12:11] Artem Bulashev: On power I have As150u
[2022-01-30T15:12:17] Mirono escooters: Same here
[2022-01-30T15:12:53] DNP: Oh my bad, i tought im writing in xiaomi group
[2022-01-30T15:13:24] Artem Bulashev: As150u has same 20mohm ir as xt150, but with anti spark (as150 - older design has ir 30mohm)
[2022-01-30T15:13:35] Artem Bulashev: 👍😀
[2022-01-30T15:23:02] Happy Giraffe: Im using 6mm phase😳 Should be still enough for 100A peak
[2022-01-30T15:26:48] Mirono escooters: 8mm 🌚
[2022-01-30T15:28:31] Happy Giraffe: Spintend ships with 4mm🌚
[2022-01-30T15:35:20] rosheee: Very high..thought about that last night. Redo solder
[2022-01-30T15:35:38] Happy Giraffe: Thats gonna be a pain haha
[2022-01-30T15:36:44] Happy Giraffe: But yeah, I gotta try to make the wire strands as close to the side of the xt150 as possible so theres as little as possible solder between them
[2022-01-30T15:36:59] Happy Giraffe: I think I forgot this and put it in the middle😂
[2022-01-30T15:37:27] rosheee: U can do it! I had to do it again as well I check data later. Also i chexked the internet for vesc temp. Problems..seems like u are the only one xD
[2022-01-30T15:37:41] rosheee: One solved with new solderign
[2022-01-30T15:37:52] Happy Giraffe: Yeah...can be related to phase resistance aswell
[2022-01-30T15:38:55] rosheee: U seee what data brings ^___^? In next 48h it is fixed and u run h0t
[2022-01-30T15:39:24] Artem Bulashev: That’s over kill by like twice 😄😄
[2022-01-30T15:39:45] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, and I still got resistance high as Trump tower
[2022-01-30T15:40:25] rosheee: I use hxt 6mm
[2022-01-30T15:42:09] Happy Giraffe: If I redo solder I must try to get the strands to touch the connector as close as possible right?
[2022-01-30T15:42:52] Happy Giraffe: Right instead of left?
[2022-01-30T15:43:12] rosheee: And shirten the cables as much as possible Inside the connector i form like a small snail
[2022-01-30T15:43:39] Happy Giraffe: Cables are quite short already
[2022-01-30T15:45:49] sombre_enfant: How much ohm on vsett 10+ not the dual
[2022-01-30T15:46:32] rosheee: Habe to check later
[2022-01-30T15:46:58] Happy Giraffe: Resistance would explain it a bit as it shows 100A is pumped to phase but it never arrives as it gets eaten away
[2022-01-30T15:47:00] sombre_enfant: Thx ma
[2022-01-30T15:48:11] sombre_enfant: Hm1600w=> 132mR Blade motor=> 85mR Rion motor=> 50mR
[2022-01-30T15:51:34] Happy Giraffe: Then this should be good resistance then? If the values are comparable or same at all
[2022-01-30T16:02:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Rage Mechanics 20mOhm 😏
[2022-01-30T16:05:05] Happy Giraffe: At this point I'm very confused what's going on
[2022-01-30T16:06:41] Luis Magalhaes: 👀
[2022-01-30T16:36:17] Artem Bulashev: Isn’t certain amount of resistance is needed to produce sufficient flux ?
[2022-01-30T16:45:44] Face de Pin Sucé: 🤷

[2022-01-30T19:43:32] Mirono escooters: Big boy motor
[2022-01-30T19:43:43] Mirono escooters: I have 2 Free kugoo motors just dead sensors so why not use em
[2022-01-30T19:44:04] Mirono escooters: Magnets are "close'
[2022-01-30T19:44:24] Artem Bulashev: 👍
[2022-01-30T19:44:35] Artem Bulashev: Airgap is important metric
[2022-01-30T19:45:13] Artem Bulashev: Make sure diameter between magnet ring and startor diamter is 1.5mm or less (mine is 1mm - Airgap 0.5mm)
[2022-01-30T19:45:43] Mirono escooters: It was tight enough
[2022-01-30T19:45:47] Mirono escooters: Bearing tolerances too
[2022-01-30T19:45:52] Mirono escooters: Pretty surprised for kugoo
[2022-01-30T19:46:11] Mirono escooters: Thé windings do look smol. But it's not like it Will see much much power
[2022-01-30T20:02:52] Face de Pin Sucé: 35mm magnets :o
[2022-01-30T20:03:07] Mirono escooters: For you smol
[2022-01-30T20:03:14] Mirono escooters: For me more then enough. Xiaomi frame 😂😂

[2022-01-30T20:04:06] Mirono escooters: What you guys use to glue hall sensors?
[2022-01-30T21:22:45] Luis Magalhaes: Half of yours 👀😂
[2022-01-30T21:23:13] Luis Magalhaes: Imagine a xiaomi with 75mm motors 😂
[2022-01-30T21:27:08] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb a friend of mine is testing a 7218 in the rear motor, he was using 7212 on the 2 motors, he was saying that looks like the rear wheel want's to pass forward 😂😂
[2022-01-30T21:29:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Not even half x)
[2022-01-30T21:29:17] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂😂

[2022-01-30T21:31:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Until I release my own VESC yes x)
[2022-01-30T21:33:07] Happy Giraffe: I had a crazy thought if Spintend redesignes the power board of Single Ubox and could then just sell that to existing customers🌚 It will be hard in those space limitations to improve cooling but still
[2022-01-30T21:33:19] Mirono escooters: If i had thé money
[2022-01-30T21:47:53] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂👌 waiting to see that one too 😁 really like vesc tools

[2022-01-30T23:04:39] Luis Magalhaes: But not 75mm motors 😂
[2022-01-30T23:04:54] Luis Magalhaes: But it can be done 😁
[2022-01-30T23:09:06] Mirono escooters: Yes jelly
[2022-01-30T23:09:11] Mirono escooters: Donate me and ill do it

[2022-01-30T23:18:19] Luis Magalhaes: First had to put some on mine too 😂
[2022-01-30T23:57:21] Artem Bulashev: They do offer to ship power board if mosfet dies
[2022-01-30T23:59:15] Happy Giraffe: Thats nice, I was just looking if they decide to improve thermal design and could get an upgrade. I dont wanna buy another expensive Rion vesc😂
[2022-01-30T23:59:47] Artem Bulashev: Rion vesc is huge no?
[2022-01-31T00:00:05] Happy Giraffe: They have a smaller 250 single vesc
[2022-01-31T00:22:25] Paolo ⁭: Yes, offer as 120 dollars price 😂
[2022-01-31T00:23:28] Paolo ⁭: Definitely single ubox is a useless vesc for their price 🤮
[2022-01-31T00:23:41] Mirono escooters: Flipsky gang
[2022-01-31T00:23:49] Mirono escooters: Ill shut up sorry

[2022-01-31T07:06:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What they said?
[2022-01-31T07:07:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fun is that we have an ex cop customer ,who just asked for more speed😂
[2022-01-31T07:09:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would love that ,but one more screen to brake ,get wet🙈 We need build in one in helmet lens

[2022-01-31T17:07:59] Happy Giraffe: Soon 100A batt
[2022-01-31T17:08:04] sombre_enfant: Vsett better then
[2022-01-31T17:08:12] Artem Bulashev: I think you are at the limit of your your winding getting to 80c
[2022-01-31T17:08:16] Mirono escooters: Donate me too😂
[2022-01-31T17:08:23] Mirono escooters: 150a phase on 4.2 flipsky. 😂
[2022-01-31T17:08:26] Artem Bulashev: Do you have temp sensor on the motor ?
[2022-01-31T17:08:35] Happy Giraffe: No, but its ice cold all the time
[2022-01-31T17:08:51] Artem Bulashev: Vsett is higher power rated so yeah no Suprise (and their rating is actually under spec rather than over spec as are most Chinese motors)

[2022-01-31T17:10:25] Artem Bulashev: For vsett 175 phase and 50a battery I think would be getting windings to 80c
[2022-01-31T17:10:40] Artem Bulashev: What da fuck
[2022-01-31T17:10:51] Artem Bulashev: How is it soo high?? Longer shocks?
[2022-01-31T17:10:57] Mirono escooters: Guess sso
[2022-01-31T17:10:59] Mirono escooters: Rip stability
[2022-01-31T17:11:51] Artem Bulashev: Also front fork is likely to simply brake instead of shock compressing as the angle is basically perpendicular
[2022-01-31T17:12:33] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2199@31-01-2022_17-12-33.jpg>
[2022-01-31T17:12:58] Artem Bulashev: Angle of attach will push assembly back rather than engaging shock
[2022-01-31T17:13:13] Artem Bulashev: Whose is that?

[2022-02-01T13:41:57] Mirono escooters: Yes that's My plan, i am still experimenting
[2022-02-01T13:41:58] Unknown: Definitely on my buy list
[2022-02-01T13:42:05] Mirono escooters: It's so good for scooter stuff
[2022-02-01T13:42:10] Mirono escooters: Loads of potential
[2022-02-01T13:42:40] Unknown: Sadly 3d printing is not the way.....
[2022-02-01T13:43:03] Mirono escooters: Don't mean structural stuff.
[2022-02-01T13:43:22] Unknown: Das filament German company has nice fire retardant filament
[2022-02-01T13:43:29] Mirono escooters: Bottom plates i defo wanna try. And the extenders are a good opportunity too. Instead of 3 times 1 u just print all of em at once
[2022-02-01T13:43:42] Unknown: It's not efficient and two expensive
[2022-02-01T13:43:43] Mirono escooters: Pla will melt with cells lol

[2022-02-01T13:45:10] Mirono escooters: But i guess you don't like cheap filament . :)
[2022-02-01T13:45:14] Unknown: By time it gets brittle
[2022-02-01T13:45:22] Unknown: Very bad experience
[2022-02-01T13:45:33] Mirono escooters: Sunlu i am happy with
[2022-02-01T13:46:05] Unknown: Make long term test and heating battery...
[2022-02-01T13:46:15] Unknown: Like customer would do
[2022-02-01T13:46:38] Unknown: You have to think like customers
[2022-02-01T13:46:41] Mirono escooters: I Will make my own holders for thé rental and test. I never printed holders lol
[2022-02-01T13:46:58] Mirono escooters: So sssht. I don't do it for customers yet and didnt say i Will use "cheap" for them
[2022-02-01T13:47:04] Mirono escooters: I Will test and see

[2022-02-01T13:58:18] Paolo ⁭: Expensive but good
[2022-02-01T14:00:24] Paolo ⁭: Depends what you need to use. For print a useless things yes😂 but technician thing not good
[2022-02-01T14:01:15] Unknown: Use an SVG program like Corel or inkscape to design 2d shapeS and with tinkercad you can extrude and change. If you want to do pro go fusion 360. Btw you can export now from tinkercad to fusion...
[2022-02-01T14:01:56] Unknown: I tried with the heat and the flexing it gets brittle
[2022-02-01T14:02:05] Mirono escooters: Tinkcercad works fine for me
[2022-02-01T14:02:53] Unknown: I use it for first ideas I'm not good in fusion but learning
[2022-02-01T14:03:17] Unknown: You can export tinkercad to fusion same company
[2022-02-01T15:00:46] Mirono escooters: Where you guys get statorade?
[2022-02-01T15:01:27] Unknown: https://nexun.pl/
[2022-02-01T15:01:54] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2022-02-01T15:01:59] Unknown: The guys are funny they even have a tax avoid faq
[2022-02-01T15:02:24] Mirono escooters: Hahaha Every Company has just not many tell
[2022-02-01T15:02:40] Mirono escooters: Some People use oil. Othr statorade I guess statorade less resistance and better?
[2022-02-01T15:04:04] Unknown: I'm a statorade fan. And grin is a great company. Oil involves a lot of problems...wait links search....

[2022-02-01T15:06:57] Unknown: https://youtu.be/ykAH3wPBHlI
[2022-02-01T15:08:04] Unknown: After this video i was convinced and bought it right away... The guy is great and very trustworthy
[2022-02-01T15:08:36] Unknown: But watch the data, data don't lie
[2022-02-01T16:45:18] Martin Kaktits: what problems oil has
[2022-02-01T16:49:01] Unknown: Read the docs
[2022-02-01T16:53:24] Martin Kaktits: so leaking, which is not that big of a problem to solve and quantity.. they say you need a lot lf oil, but centrifugal force would push it to the outer ring anyway, so i doubt it trully needs 100ml+
[2022-02-01T16:57:29] Happy Giraffe: Hard to see it leaking if sealed with silicone sealant made for car parts
[2022-02-01T17:02:52] Unknown: Same here. Got my statorade directly from Grin Tech. Amazing results with motor cooling, around 30% heat reduction. I've heard bad things about cheapo ferrofluid, being conductive, drying out and leaving shit residue, etc.. I would stick with statorade from Grin if possible. It's tested and safe for our beloved motors
[2022-02-01T17:03:15] Mirono escooters: Fair. Don't wanna cheap out on that
[2022-02-01T17:03:30] Unknown: Exactly. Not a corner anyone should cut LoL
[2022-02-01T17:57:43] Unknown: I think statorade is the brand name of grins techn. ferrofluid. All scooters that i touch have it....in summer you feel it with bare hand..
[2022-02-01T18:00:29] Mirono escooters: Yes correct.
[2022-02-01T18:00:40] Mirono escooters: But statorade is ferrofluid But not all ferrofluid is statorade
[2022-02-01T18:00:44] Mirono escooters: Their are Quality things
[2022-02-01T18:00:46] Unknown: Yup, "statorade" is Grin Tech's brand name for their ferrofluid. I haven't used it in the summer yet but have had amazing results so far. I actually would never run a motor without it again
[2022-02-01T18:01:00] Unknown: Haha, that's exactly right. Well said
[2022-02-01T19:10:09] Artem Bulashev: I wonder if it caused any wear on magnets
[2022-02-01T19:14:39] Unknown: I'm not real sure. As we we're discussing the other day, everything now (stator and magnets) are more balanced temperature wise. So instead of hot stator cold magnets, we now have warm stator and warm magnets. However, overall cooling effect is reduced so I imagine the amount of heat generated shouldn't be enough to harm the magnetic field of the magnets. If, by touch, the outside hub (at magnets) is much hotter than the motor cover (near stator)... Then it would be cause for concern as the magnets would be the hottest part. I don't think that's the case but will keep my eye on it once I can ride again and the snow melts lol
[2022-02-01T19:29:01] Happy Giraffe: Also magnets taking more heat means they transfer it to the case of motor faster as Delta between ambient and magnet is higher. Could be little to no increase in magnet temps tbh.
[2022-02-01T19:29:35] Happy Giraffe: Also magnet having the ferro around it can increase surface area to conduct heat out so theres that
[2022-02-01T20:16:25] Unknown: Yup for sure. I really don't think the magnets would ever get that much hotter than the stator. As long as you're not cooking your stator, I don't believe you would ever be cooking your magnets either
[2022-02-01T21:11:57] Artem Bulashev: From my knowledge it also smooths the gaps between magnets which causes air resistance reduction and resistance is heat and air moves very fast in spining motor
[2022-02-01T21:12:08] Artem Bulashev: Not sure how much it effects in reality
[2022-02-01T22:50:01] Happy Giraffe: If it spins that fast I think it might be minimal difference
[2022-02-01T22:52:19] Happy Giraffe: Like in a PC fan the gap between the blade and outer ring is minimal not to allow any air go back the unwanted direction. Also not much space in motor
[2022-02-01T23:11:55] Unknown: Some interesting info... When I did the auto set-up on my controllers (before and after statorade)... After statorade showed ever so slight increase in ERPM as well as almost identical flux linkage, inductance and phase resistance. Not sure how much this means, but the higher ERPM (like I said, it was slightly) was very surprising. Definitely no added resistance with 6ml. Using too much for a given motor can (and has been shown to) increase resistance at the air gap.
[2022-02-01T23:12:50] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I could soak the single ubox PCB in ferrpfluid then?😂
[2022-02-01T23:13:10] Unknown: So using the proper amount for a given motor should not have any affect on resistance. If anything, the right amount may may act as a lubricant
[2022-02-01T23:13:45] Happy Giraffe: And if there appears some metal dust inside motor the fluid could absorb some of that
[2022-02-01T23:13:46] Mirono escooters: It's conductive tho
[2022-02-01T23:13:52] Happy Giraffe: Is it?
[2022-02-01T23:13:55] Mirono escooters: How would it appeqr
[2022-02-01T23:13:55] Unknown: LoL. If the PCB is magnetic, possibly!
[2022-02-01T23:14:02] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-02-01T23:14:16] Unknown: It should not be conductive
[2022-02-01T23:14:27] Unknown: If it was, it would short the hall sensor board.. no??
[2022-02-01T23:14:30] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_2206@01-02-2022_23-14-30.jpg>
[2022-02-01T23:14:32] Happy Giraffe: This is what I was thinking
[2022-02-01T23:14:41] Unknown: Because it does slosh around inside
[2022-02-01T23:14:47] Unknown: It would short the shit of the halls
[2022-02-01T23:15:05] Mirono escooters: U would have to be very unlucky to have a long enough piece of it to short it i think?
[2022-02-01T23:15:14] Mirono escooters: Also 5v over it with high resistance
[2022-02-01T23:15:25] Mirono escooters: But a esc is another story.. thé chips legs are super close
[2022-02-01T23:15:28] Unknown: From hall 5v to Gnd... Not so much is needed
[2022-02-01T23:15:38] Mirono escooters: It's far apart
[2022-02-01T23:15:45] Mirono escooters: And reissta'ce rather high
[2022-02-01T23:16:36] Unknown: <photos/photo_2207@01-02-2022_23-16-36.jpg>
[2022-02-01T23:17:00] Mirono escooters: Well compared to chips
[2022-02-01T23:17:02] Unknown: I dunno. I don't think statorade is conductive. That's the concern with cheaper ferrofluid... Some has been found to be conductive
[2022-02-01T23:17:15] Unknown: And that causes problems
[2022-02-01T23:17:23] Mirono escooters: Maybe statorade is special
[2022-02-01T23:17:31] Unknown: 🤣
[2022-02-01T23:17:43] Happy Giraffe: Also what I thought in first place, having conductive material near 140A currents not good
[2022-02-01T23:18:20] Mirono escooters: Ferrofluid is conductive but high resistance Statorade is nowhere findable
[2022-02-01T23:18:30] Paolo ⁭: It’s conductive but not so much
[2022-02-01T23:18:36] Mirono escooters: But it's based on.. so idk. If i get my 10ml i Will put one on esc
[2022-02-01T23:18:39] Mirono escooters: Thanks
[2022-02-01T23:18:41] Mirono escooters: As i thought..
[2022-02-01T23:18:56] Paolo ⁭: Have a high resistance, not a normal conductor
[2022-02-01T23:19:05] Mirono escooters: Doesnt matter with motor hall sensors.. but a esc with chip? No thanks
[2022-02-01T23:19:54] Paolo ⁭: Ferrofluid if you put correctly they will not go to touch sensors 😂
[2022-02-01T23:20:07] Happy Giraffe: Anything to make the fucking spintend survive 140A
[2022-02-01T23:20:23] Mirono escooters: U Will kill it
[2022-02-01T23:20:25] Paolo ⁭: Ive kill it with 250A xd
[2022-02-01T23:20:36] Mirono escooters: Bolt it Well? Better thermal Pads?
[2022-02-01T23:20:40] Mirono escooters: Flipsky? 😂
[2022-02-01T23:21:00] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt matter, mosfet heat load is against pcb
[2022-02-01T23:21:12] Happy Giraffe: Havent killed yet😂
[2022-02-01T23:21:23] Mirono escooters: Don't put statorade in u Will
[2022-02-01T23:21:28] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-02-01T23:21:38] Happy Giraffe: Then some thermal grease
[2022-02-01T23:21:40] Mirono escooters: Flipsky design is at that point better. Say what you want xd
[2022-02-01T23:21:44] Happy Giraffe: I will make it swim on it
[2022-02-01T23:21:46] Mirono escooters: Better
[2022-02-01T23:22:04] Happy Giraffe: Its not efficient but whatever it takes to cool pcb😂
[2022-02-01T23:22:36] Happy Giraffe: LN2 cant use because of condensation
[2022-02-01T23:22:48] Paolo ⁭: Put N2
[2022-02-01T23:23:15] Paolo ⁭: No😆 but you will broke pcb and all semiconductor
[2022-02-01T23:23:15] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-01T23:23:44] Unknown: <photos/photo_2208@01-02-2022_23-23-44.jpg>
[2022-02-01T23:23:51] Happy Giraffe: I wonder why TF did they design it this way in first place?
[2022-02-01T23:24:49] Paolo ⁭: Put it in resistance mode, not in continuity mode
[2022-02-01T23:27:26] Mirono escooters: +1
[2022-02-01T23:27:32] Unknown: Nothing
[2022-02-01T23:27:38] Mirono escooters: Bcs spintend
[2022-02-01T23:27:53] Unknown: I don't have better multimeter here
[2022-02-01T23:27:56] Mirono escooters: I guess bcs more A would kill it and thé cooling is made for 100+-
[2022-02-01T23:28:30] Unknown: But i think not conductive
[2022-02-01T23:28:45] Mirono escooters: Do resistance mode xd
[2022-02-01T23:29:10] Unknown: Nothing
[2022-02-01T23:29:17] Unknown: I did
[2022-02-01T23:29:49] Unknown: I fucked my rocketbook page....up lol
[2022-02-02T00:11:03] Unknown: It shouldn't be conductive at all guys LoL. At least not in any measurable way. It absolutely sloshes around in the motor (think of hitting a huge bump at 40mph or riding an off road edirt bike with statorade in hub motor) which is why it will leak out of motor covers thay aren't sealed.
[2022-02-02T00:18:07] Unknown: So I'm sure at some point in time it will bridge the hall sensor board and short 5v to Gnd. Also if it was conductive, your magnets would be electrically charged...so I doubt that. It's created to be non conductive so it's safe for all applications. All ferrofluid should be non-conductive but some cheap shit isn't... That's where problems happen buying cheap shit. I also did a multimeter continuity test when I received mine and there was nothing... So it cannot carry current which makes it non-conductive
[2022-02-02T00:19:51] Paolo ⁭: It’s a really little conductive , like water for example . It will give you problems with very high voltage
[2022-02-02T00:20:07] Mirono escooters: +1
[2022-02-02T00:21:40] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_2209@02-02-2022_00-21-40.jpg>
[2022-02-02T00:21:45] Unknown: Okay.. that I can understand 👍. After all they are metal particles. So probably safe for any voltage we would be using.
[2022-02-02T00:21:48] Paolo ⁭: More or less
[2022-02-02T00:22:52] Paolo ⁭: Yes but anyway better don’t use. You have better choose for esc , but for motor I don’t seen problems…
[2022-02-02T00:24:21] Unknown: In certain situations I think it is beneficial. For example, my battery and controllers are over specced like crazy.. so motors are the weakest link. Being able to reduce heat by 30% allows me to push them 30% harder (in theory)
[2022-02-02T00:25:34] Paolo ⁭: Yes for motor isn’t an problem, windings copper are isolated, and will never touch hall sensor board
[2022-02-02T00:26:26] Unknown: Oh gotcha... I misread your last post
[2022-02-02T00:26:51] Paolo ⁭: ?
[2022-02-02T00:26:54] Unknown: Agreed, not ideal for controllers. Motors only
[2022-02-02T00:27:42] Paolo ⁭: Also holes help very much ;)
[2022-02-02T00:28:46] Unknown: Without question. Just need to be careful with debris and moisture
[2022-02-02T00:31:03] Paolo ⁭: Yes :) I didn’t use it in off road and when rains
[2022-02-02T00:32:20] Happy Giraffe: For me its same but turned around😂
[2022-02-02T00:32:37] Happy Giraffe: Blade motor can take hell lot more than 120A, maybe 180A with ferro
[2022-02-02T00:34:32] Paolo ⁭: In summer is different :)
[2022-02-02T00:40:42] Happy Giraffe: Sure all temperatures rise 20c
[2022-02-02T00:41:56] Mirono escooters: If air gets mostured it's a hell tho
[2022-02-02T00:41:59] Happy Giraffe: Single ubox is not that different because heat never gets away from pcb😂
[2022-02-02T00:42:03] Mirono escooters: Everyone has sleep problems i see

[2022-02-02T10:27:49] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-02T10:50:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But to make it dual ,you need serious modding on the rear forks to be able to fit,more like redo forks
[2022-02-02T10:55:44] Mirono escooters: And with suspension?
[2022-02-02T11:01:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe monorims but surly custom axis everywhere to have space for the disc and you need to cut body edge after it
[2022-02-02T11:02:00] Mirono escooters: I fitted my dual kugoo with dual monorim. Front inverted
[2022-02-02T11:02:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Blade engine doenst fit single invert
[2022-02-02T11:02:33] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2022-02-02T11:02:33] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-02-02T11:02:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's 11 cm
[2022-02-02T11:02:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This 14
[2022-02-02T11:02:46] Mirono escooters: U can space it with me monorim kit
[2022-02-02T11:03:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes u can ,but i didn't

[2022-02-03T16:08:40] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2216@03-02-2022_16-08-40.jpg>
[2022-02-03T16:08:51] Artem Bulashev: Nuks have acceleration settings
[2022-02-03T16:08:54] Artem Bulashev: Of this sort
[2022-02-03T16:09:01] Artem Bulashev: Vesc doesn’t have such right?
[2022-02-03T16:09:45] Happy Giraffe: Saw some settings in mobile app
[2022-02-03T16:19:13] Unknown: This is what the current change speed setting can accomplish on Nuc
[2022-02-03T16:19:14] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-02-03T16:20:52] Unknown: Dualtron Nucular burning rubber off his tires. Dirt bike guys have gotten their settings where they can wheelie and get thrown off the back. 100% true FOC sinewave. So when I hear VESC guys talking about off the line punch, I always thought to myself just adjust the current change speed... Curious to know if VESC has a similar setting
[2022-02-03T16:21:49] Unknown: That is a powerful ass dualtron to be able to lay rubber on the pavement. My Vsett 10+ will in that category shortly LoL
[2022-02-03T16:23:03] Unknown: They have the acceleration, brake and shutdown change speed settings, so, in addition to acceleration, you can smooth out your switching type e-brake and control how fast the current ramps down when off throttle.
[2022-02-03T16:23:04] Happy Giraffe: This sounds exactly what I would want from my future ebike😂
[2022-02-03T16:23:52] Unknown: Nuc 24F would be the way to go on a single motor e-bike/e dirt bike. That's where they're used most. I'm an outlier with Nucs on a scooter LoL
[2022-02-03T16:24:18] Unknown: 24F is 30kw I believe. It's a froggin beast
[2022-02-03T16:24:27] Happy Giraffe: Nucular is the Samsung 50S of batteries
[2022-02-03T16:24:41] Unknown: 48x... Long life and reliable
[2022-02-03T16:24:46] Unknown: 🤣
[2022-02-03T16:24:56] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-03T16:26:10] Unknown: I've been part of the Nucular chat for about 6 months and have not, I repeat.. have not.. heard of 1 case of someone frying their Nuc just because. Like ever. It's mostly user error and some stupid shit ground loop with dual setup. Insanely reliable and fail safe.
[2022-02-03T16:26:30] Happy Giraffe: Still amazing they cant ramp up production
[2022-02-03T16:26:47] Artem Bulashev: Yeap that’s where the money goes - they are like tanks
[2022-02-03T16:26:49] Unknown: With their newest firmware I believe they integrated a ground loop failsafe on the 12v line
[2022-02-03T16:26:52] Artem Bulashev: Little russian tanks
[2022-02-03T16:26:59] Unknown: Damn Russians do it again
[2022-02-03T16:27:01] Unknown: LoL
[2022-02-03T16:27:43] Happy Giraffe: 6f v.2 would be dream in xiaomi
[2022-02-03T16:28:20] Happy Giraffe: Delivery time, after CyberTruck
[2022-02-03T16:29:25] Unknown: I found both of my 12F's and display used on endless sphere. It's worth putting up a want ad if you're interested in one. They're unicorn controllers, like tracking down a damn unicorn. Took me around 3 months of searching but I was able to find them and well worth the wait
[2022-02-03T16:29:59] Unknown: The display is tits. In my opinion, the best display out there, sorry koxx.. haven't seen yours yet LoL
[2022-02-03T16:30:36] Happy Giraffe: I think I go Kelly 7218S, trying to figure some crazy shit for the battery. Maybe 16s10p, will see...
[2022-02-03T16:30:58] Unknown: Unfortunately you need the display. It can be unhooked after setup but necessary for setup purposes. No PC or Bluetooth. All settings and auto set-up are done directly on the disolay
[2022-02-03T16:31:19] Happy Giraffe: And no police modes?
[2022-02-03T16:31:25] Unknown: Would you use a display with Kelly? Do they make one?
[2022-02-03T16:31:58] Unknown: 3 speed modes set to whatever you'd like. Can setup with a switch, button or hotkey on display... So it can be "hidden"
[2022-02-03T16:32:01] Happy Giraffe: They got Bluetooth dongle, but I needed to study them more. Paolo just gave me the idea
[2022-02-03T16:32:12] sombre_enfant: All that on a fwd xiaomi 🤨
[2022-02-03T16:32:30] Happy Giraffe: Why not🌚 can put it later on an ebike
[2022-02-03T16:32:47] sombre_enfant: Yeah that would be more realist
[2022-02-03T16:33:09] Happy Giraffe: I just want stuff not designed head in the ass
[2022-02-03T16:33:32] Unknown: I just love the display and real-time readouts. Much easier to see than a phone with VESC tool mounted to the bars
[2022-02-03T16:34:45] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-02-03T16:35:30] Unknown: Many of the same features as VESC tool but communication to controllers via Canbus and no need for Bluetooth or PC ever. On the fly adjustments super simple
[2022-02-03T16:39:54] Paolo ⁭: You are the guy with huameng motor with stranger disc
[2022-02-03T16:40:14] Unknown: That's not me LoL
[2022-02-03T16:40:25] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-02-03T16:41:03] Unknown: All light, horn, fan functions controlled by uLight module. Can adjust running light brightness on front and rear independently and brake light brightness, turn signal brightness and duration, fans, LEDs, etc...
[2022-02-03T16:41:04] Unknown: <photos/photo_2217@03-02-2022_16-41-04.jpg>
[2022-02-03T16:42:35] Unknown: No idea what his full setup is but I know he's running Nucs and laying down rubber from a standstill. Takes care of the "low power on startup" problem seen in VESC

[2022-02-03T16:53:54] sombre_enfant: @PaoloWu what disk u use ?
[2022-02-03T17:02:00] Unknown: Disk for what? Brake rotor disc?
[2022-02-03T17:08:56] sombre_enfant: Rotor. But caliper is good info too
[2022-02-03T17:16:38] Unknown: Avid/SRAM Cleansweep G2 160mm with Nutt Brakes on Vsett 10+. Stock rotors were 140mm (or 145) so used the brackets for the 160mm upgrade
[2022-02-03T17:17:08] Unknown: Really nice rotors. Damn expensive though. I think like $45 each
[2022-02-03T17:17:34] Mirono escooters: Brackets from where? Im tired of washets
[2022-02-03T17:17:45] Mirono escooters: Also. Bigger rotor disk. Why? Cooling?
[2022-02-03T17:22:20] sombre_enfant: I always bent mine maybe my mount isnt sturdy enough
[2022-02-03T17:22:36] sombre_enfant: More braking force indeed
[2022-02-03T17:52:14] Unknown: I actually found the brackets on Amazon US. But they're standard post mount to be used with the Vsett IS (international standard) brackets. So IS to Post Mount. The ones I needed were post mount R160/F180 (they're identical). And yea, upgraded to larger rotors for better braking power and cooling. There is a noticable difference between the 140 and 160 rotors, especially with ceramic pads for the Nutt brakes. One of the last upgrades I have left is Magura mt5e conversion, which will use the same 160mm rotors but the Nutt brakes work just fine for the time being with the larger rotors and quality pads
[2022-02-03T17:52:14] Unknown: <photos/photo_2220@03-02-2022_17-52-14.jpg>
[2022-02-03T17:53:18] Unknown: It could be but also a rotor that gets very hot can warp and distort itself... Especially if it's really hot and you hit a puddle causing instant cooling.
[2022-02-03T17:56:20] Mirono escooters: Good point
[2022-02-03T17:56:28] Mirono escooters: Me with 120mm Brake only..

[2022-02-03T18:05:04] Paolo ⁭: I’m go to building thirt config
[2022-02-03T18:05:26] Paolo ⁭: Magic flip sky with 1cm alluminium
[2022-02-03T18:05:34] Happy Giraffe: I think I will get similar for my MT5e, thanks
[2022-02-03T18:05:44] Paolo ⁭: Bolt fixed
[2022-02-03T18:05:50] Mirono escooters: If u find alieexpress send me xd
[2022-02-03T18:06:13] Happy Giraffe: I try locally I think
[2022-02-03T18:07:20] Happy Giraffe: Also gotta get this type of part I think
[2022-02-03T18:07:58] Mirono escooters: I gotta hack something tocether for rear brake on my g30
[2022-02-03T18:09:50] Unknown: Yup that's the IS mount (to the frame) those caliper mounts can be tricky, there so many different ones
[2022-02-03T18:10:17] Unknown: The IS goes to the frame and the post mount goes to the IS
[2022-02-03T18:10:34] Unknown: And caliper mounts to the post mount.. LoL
[2022-02-03T18:10:42] Happy Giraffe: For IS I just need Magura compatible, then drill holes to my suspension😂
[2022-02-03T18:11:10] Unknown: The tricky part is getting the proper height brackets for your size rotors
[2022-02-03T18:11:12] Happy Giraffe: Last one is bolt😂
[2022-02-03T18:11:22] Unknown: LoL yup yup
[2022-02-03T18:11:25] Unknown: True
[2022-02-03T18:11:32] Unknown: 😎
[2022-02-03T18:11:37] Happy Giraffe: I will drill and diy
[2022-02-03T18:12:01] Unknown: Always the best method 👍 anything is possible with some common sense and ingenuity
[2022-02-03T18:12:07] Happy Giraffe: Just need to decide optimal pad position
[2022-02-03T18:13:26] Unknown: For sure. Not sure how important placement is, like more forward or rearwards (others might know better) but you definitely want as much pad to rotor contact area as possible
[2022-02-03T18:14:24] Happy Giraffe: Small adjustments I can make with thin washers but want it to be perfectly levelled
[2022-02-03T18:15:05] sombre_enfant: @PaoloWu wich one dont bend for no reason
[2022-02-03T18:16:39] Paolo ⁭: Magura better, but minimum is 180mm and won’t fit good in my configuration
[2022-02-03T18:17:07] sombre_enfant: I seen dean connector, faut bosser
[2022-02-03T19:37:33] Face de Pin Sucé: I have 2 24F coming in 2-3 weeks to put on a Weped for customer :p
[2022-02-03T19:42:51] Face de Pin Sucé: A little bit affraid, have seen it's 500A phase capable
[2022-02-03T19:43:04] Face de Pin Sucé: and 250-300A battery
[2022-02-03T19:43:05] Face de Pin Sucé: each
[2022-02-03T19:43:07] Face de Pin Sucé: 😆

[2022-02-03T19:47:09] Paolo ⁭: @Happy_Giraffe @SibClimb have some kelly
[2022-02-03T19:47:38] Happy Giraffe: Aah him😂 Is there police mode for kelly?😳 Thinking about putting 7218S inside xiaomi frame after cutting off the mounting holes
[2022-02-03T19:54:15] Luis Magalhaes: 👀
[2022-02-03T19:54:21] Luis Magalhaes: Beast
[2022-02-03T19:54:43] Unknown: Amazing. Do you have experience with them?
[2022-02-03T19:56:06] Unknown: <photos/photo_2227@03-02-2022_19-56-06.jpg>
[2022-02-03T19:56:31] sombre_enfant: We already know he will use full potential of it😂
[2022-02-03T19:56:33] Mirono escooters: Beast
[2022-02-03T19:58:11] Unknown: Beast mode. Besides, the display is amazing. Honestly the best controller system out there in my opinion. If something happened to my 12F(s), since only 24F is currently available, I would buy dual 24F and carry them in a backpack 😂😂. I respect VESC very much but I love my Nucs
[2022-02-03T20:01:23] Unknown: As I said before... With dual 12F and 20s9p 48x copper clad battery... My 10+ motors will be my weakest point, hence the statorade to push them babies to the max
[2022-02-03T20:01:59] Face de Pin Sucé: not yet
[2022-02-03T20:02:48] Face de Pin Sucé: little bit worried to saturate and burn the motors, even with 75mm ones x)
[2022-02-03T20:03:04] sombre_enfant: Really 😂
[2022-02-03T20:03:07] Mirono escooters: Dumb Saturate?
[2022-02-03T20:03:16] Face de Pin Sucé: not really, you can set 3 speeds with button so hide a button for 25Kmh
[2022-02-03T20:03:39] sombre_enfant: Rotor not big as ebike too...
[2022-02-03T20:03:51] Face de Pin Sucé: tbh I find the display very ugly x)
[2022-02-03T20:07:01] Happy Giraffe: Spintend single 120A/45A, mosfet 67°c gg
[2022-02-03T20:07:03] Unknown: It's super informative. Shows all realtime telemetry. Color/design may not be the prettiest but it's the most fully functional display out there. Besides all settings and adjustments are direct from display to controllers
[2022-02-03T20:07:35] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-03T20:08:04] Happy Giraffe: Something like magnetic switch would be fancy
[2022-02-03T20:08:51] Paolo ⁭: Fsesc 120A / 80A 50°C
[2022-02-03T20:08:52] Unknown: You can use the display buttons as speed mode hotkey button (with short or long press), so nobody would ever know what button to press or what it does
[2022-02-03T20:09:15] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, single ubox much worse
[2022-02-03T20:10:09] Happy Giraffe: Do you know guys who tested max potential of 7212?
[2022-02-03T20:16:59] Paolo ⁭: I’ve 1cm alluminium fixed more all frame surface directly to mosfet :)
[2022-02-03T20:17:37] Paolo ⁭: Very similar to dualtron X controller
[2022-02-03T20:21:06] Luis Magalhaes: a friend of mine have tested at 17S and said the front wheel dont want to mantain traction, he burn the rear one because of the rear motor wires short, and now has a 7218 in the back and says its insane 🤣
[2022-02-03T20:21:47] Luis Magalhaes: voltage drops 10V, the front wants to lift from floor 🤣
[2022-02-03T20:21:49] Paolo ⁭: I will try 7230 with 20s :)
[2022-02-03T20:21:52] Luis Magalhaes: its a short frame
[2022-02-03T20:22:16] Paolo ⁭: Work with or without hall?
[2022-02-03T20:22:20] Luis Magalhaes: film it 🤣
[2022-02-03T20:22:34] Luis Magalhaes: with halls only
[2022-02-03T20:25:02] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb you dont use temperature sensor on your motors?
[2022-02-03T20:32:46] Happy Giraffe: Beware voltage spike over 90v
[2022-02-03T20:33:07] Paolo ⁭: Mosfet are for 100V no problem
[2022-02-03T20:33:18] Happy Giraffe: Do you know how many amps he used and what was mosfet temps?
[2022-02-03T20:33:47] Happy Giraffe: Because 7212 is same size as single vesc
[2022-02-03T20:37:07] Luis Magalhaes: dont know mosfet temperature as it dont display in app, amps it was at 100%
[2022-02-03T20:38:30] Happy Giraffe: So 120A motor and what battery?
[2022-02-03T20:38:46] Luis Magalhaes: the app is all in % 😂 yes
[2022-02-03T20:39:29] Happy Giraffe: Lmao, ok 120A has to do then I guess...I searched whole night for 7212 tests and found nothing with numbers
[2022-02-03T20:41:45] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-02-03T20:42:57] Happy Giraffe: For real, its weird nobody in forums tested these. Or somehow dont appear in google search
[2022-02-03T20:43:23] Happy Giraffe: And nucular is...yeah😂
[2022-02-03T20:45:09] Happy Giraffe: Perfect size for xiaomi

[2022-02-03T20:46:00] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-02-03T20:46:17] Luis Magalhaes: anyone knows what is what ?
[2022-02-03T20:46:21] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-02-03T20:46:30] Happy Giraffe: Thats a bread box
[2022-02-03T20:47:02] Luis Magalhaes: on the left ykz7280 , kelly 7218, kelly 7212
[2022-02-03T20:47:19] Happy Giraffe: 7212 looking sexy
[2022-02-03T20:47:24] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_2231@03-02-2022_20-47-24.jpg>
[2022-02-03T20:47:56] Mirono escooters: How much is kelly programmabld VS vesc?
[2022-02-03T20:48:00] Luis Magalhaes: ykz is so dam big 🤣
[2022-02-03T20:48:26] Paolo ⁭: Vesc is the most programmable esc
[2022-02-03T20:48:37] Paolo ⁭: But not means work better
[2022-02-03T20:48:57] Luis Magalhaes: https://fastride.fr/en/accessoires/514-controleur-kelly-kls-7212s.html
[2022-02-03T20:49:01] Luis Magalhaes: on fastride
[2022-02-03T20:49:33] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-03T20:49:36] Luis Magalhaes: true, kelly are pre programed or something like this 🤪
[2022-02-03T20:49:56] Happy Giraffe: Fuck I want just power, on/off switch I dont care at this point😂😂😂 Brakes optional
[2022-02-03T20:50:13] Mirono escooters: Same specs as flipsky 4.2 lol
[2022-02-03T20:50:50] Paolo ⁭: Max 60v spikes
[2022-02-03T20:50:58] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if those limits are real or guidelines
[2022-02-03T20:51:00] Luis Magalhaes: but they say it gives you more torque and stays colder
[2022-02-03T20:51:10] Paolo ⁭: And these are 50A battery continuos , up to 120A battery boost mode
[2022-02-03T20:51:21] Paolo ⁭: 4.2 melt with 20A continuos xd
[2022-02-03T20:51:28] Happy Giraffe: So maybe 80A batt boost?
[2022-02-03T20:51:46] Luis Magalhaes: https://www.kellycontrollers.eu/kls7212s
[2022-02-03T20:51:56] Happy Giraffe: And how does boost work? If 19second throttle, then one second without and throttle again😂
[2022-02-03T20:52:30] Artem Bulashev: On vsett comtrollers it gives you +5 battery amps on each controller for 3 min of use, after that 5min cooldown Preaty smart considering 8p 60a Normal is max for mh1 and mj1
[2022-02-03T20:52:35] Mirono escooters: I did run them :)
[2022-02-03T20:52:56] Happy Giraffe: I mean kelly limits
[2022-02-03T20:53:10] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2022-02-03T20:53:43] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow I should try 50/100A and see spintend burn
[2022-02-03T20:53:58] Happy Giraffe: I suspect still 67°c mosfet crap
[2022-02-03T20:55:13] Luis Magalhaes: did not burn at 80ºc
[2022-02-03T20:55:17] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-02-03T20:56:13] Luis Magalhaes: my dual ubox had run 70A/220A each side
[2022-02-03T21:08:06] Artem Bulashev: Motor cut off is very nice and slow / progressive
[2022-02-03T21:09:34] Happy Giraffe: I wish...Im like : Bruh, where my power went?
[2022-02-03T21:09:47] Happy Giraffe: Check RT data, 68°c mosfet
[2022-02-03T21:10:32] Face de Pin Sucé: I personally prefer @koxx3 display, more fancy and does almost the same as Nucular display (not possible to do the motor detection but that's all)
[2022-02-03T21:10:47] Face de Pin Sucé: I did, what do you want to know ?
[2022-02-03T21:11:16] Happy Giraffe: What phase and batt current is possible? How are mosfet temps?
[2022-02-03T21:11:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Never x) my hand is my temp sensor
[2022-02-03T21:11:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Phase current we don't know
[2022-02-03T21:12:03] Face de Pin Sucé: But for batt current, I've seen 220+A using 2 7212S
[2022-02-03T21:12:12] Face de Pin Sucé: 16000+W in 20S
[2022-02-03T21:12:21] Happy Giraffe: For real?!
[2022-02-03T21:13:05] Face de Pin Sucé: If you use it inside deck, will get hot quick if you push it hard then you loose boost and locked at 50A battery max waiting for mosfets to cool down
[2022-02-03T21:13:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes for real
[2022-02-03T21:14:05] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_2232@03-02-2022_21-14-05.jpg>
[2022-02-03T21:14:14] Face de Pin Sucé: You can see both 7212S on this one on pole
[2022-02-03T21:14:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Never lost boost because outside deck
[2022-02-03T21:14:36] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, I had plan to bend 7218S legs to make it fit in xiaomi😂
[2022-02-03T21:14:39] Artem Bulashev: I hear single is not as good in terms of heat as red ubox
[2022-02-03T21:15:13] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I wonder how its so bad
[2022-02-03T21:16:07] Artem Bulashev: May be contact pad is not fully attached ?
[2022-02-03T21:16:22] Happy Giraffe: ESC on pole not my favourite for rainy days
[2022-02-03T21:16:43] Happy Giraffe: Mosfet die against pcb
[2022-02-03T21:16:45] Artem Bulashev: Different motors May heat up fets differently
[2022-02-03T21:18:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Kelly are waterproof, only need to have waterproofed connectors
[2022-02-03T21:18:22] Happy Giraffe: I can also put the battery connector inside frame also
[2022-02-03T21:21:59] Happy Giraffe: So hard to think about the best solution, Kelly 7212 in front and battery inside + a bag battery. Or Kickass metal rack box on top of rear wheel with a battery and 7218S inside
[2022-02-03T21:25:56] Luis Magalhaes: If it won't handle then it should burn! 😂😂😂
[2022-02-03T21:26:12] Paolo ⁭: Depends very much also by motor
[2022-02-03T21:26:19] Paolo ⁭: Send insta link
[2022-02-03T21:32:02] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i was talking with my wolf motors 1200w
[2022-02-03T21:33:17] Paolo ⁭: More torque :)
[2022-02-03T21:45:21] Luis Magalhaes: My motors have less torque as the hm2800 and 3000 aome people uses
[2022-02-03T21:45:41] Luis Magalhaes: But more top speed if have amps to feed 😂
[2022-02-03T21:56:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Ragemechanics
[2022-02-03T21:56:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Rider is z100Xrider
[2022-02-03T22:12:17] Paolo ⁭: Hm is the motor with lowest default winding KV
[2022-02-03T22:12:47] Paolo ⁭: Because they say their motor is more efficient, and compare dualtron thunder with wolf and say how their motor is better xd
[2022-02-03T22:19:27] Happy Giraffe: I found blade to be quite efficient at 35kmh speeds, really good consumption
[2022-02-03T22:23:41] Happy Giraffe: 24wh/km on cold weather and some wind
[2022-02-03T22:24:10] Happy Giraffe: With maybe 5 traffic lights stops in 3km
[2022-02-03T22:28:40] Paolo ⁭: If is up hill , isn’t efficient
[2022-02-03T22:29:15] Paolo ⁭: But in the plain yes, with fixed speed .
[2022-02-03T22:31:26] Luis Magalhaes: With 40A yes it has more torque 😂
[2022-02-03T22:33:07] Artem Bulashev: Lower kv is more efficient over all
[2022-02-03T22:33:35] Luis Magalhaes: Higher torque less work 😁
[2022-02-03T22:34:00] Paolo ⁭: No, in fixed speed in plain you have more range .
[2022-02-03T22:35:03] Paolo ⁭: Maybe it’s just only hm motor is too shit and anyway with lower Kv is worse
[2022-02-03T22:45:49] Happy Giraffe: On summer I get about 55-60km range from 1kwh so its about 17wh/km
[2022-02-03T22:46:18] Happy Giraffe: This includes also some max speed runs aswell so its not 30kmh all the time
[2022-02-03T22:47:53] Paolo ⁭: In downhill I got -10Wh/km
[2022-02-03T22:49:21] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-03T22:57:23] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-02-03T22:58:09] Luis Magalhaes: in plan i was getting from 25 to 30 wh/km
[2022-02-03T22:58:19] Luis Magalhaes: going like 35 or 40kmh
[2022-02-03T22:58:28] Unknown: Love the outside mounted controllers. That's how I have my Nucs mounted. Stay nice n cool and allows for monster battery inside the deck
[2022-02-03T22:59:14] Unknown: Same here, totally waterproof controllers and all Higo waterproof connectors inside and outside the deck
[2022-02-03T23:02:22] Paolo ⁭: Yes, and is safest😂 when I got fire my vesc if it was inside , maybe battery will explode due to vesc’s fire
[2022-02-03T23:05:57] Unknown: Good point. However, that seems to be more of a VESC thing 🤣. Kelly and Nuc don't usually make fireworks lol. Temperature protection shuts them down before that happens even to the most extreme users and solder balls don't exist in Russia 😜
[2022-02-03T23:10:52] Paolo ⁭: Did you know sabvoton? I’ve ordered them for my scooter
[2022-02-03T23:12:48] Paolo ⁭: I was think not need an ebike controller for my escooter😂 but seem yes, I need
[2022-02-03T23:15:21] Face de Pin Sucé: VESC also has temperature protection almost impossible to kill only because of high current from my experience (and trust me, I've burnt a lot of controllers x) )
[2022-02-03T23:15:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Kelly likes to die for no reason at all
[2022-02-03T23:15:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Nucular, don't know enough yet
[2022-02-03T23:19:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1. i've seen one die in front of me just because the guy connected bt at 2km/h 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-02-03T23:50:56] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2022-02-03T23:51:34] Luis Magalhaes: conected to bt device or to bt ?
[2022-02-03T23:51:52] Luis Magalhaes: hardware or software 😂
[2022-02-03T23:52:05] Mirono escooters: Kelly i heard mixed resilts
[2022-02-03T23:59:38] Unknown: I don't know much but I believe they are 72v limited, can be larger in size/power ratio than most and making setting adjustments can be really tedious
[2022-02-04T00:01:00] Unknown: They don't die just because. Since being part of their support chat for 6 months, I have not heard of one controller going bad. Most "issues" are resolved easily due to user error or lack of knowledge
[2022-02-04T00:07:03] Paolo ⁭: Ive only 18s
[2022-02-04T00:07:22] Paolo ⁭: In Italy is impossible to exceed 80kmh🤣
[2022-02-04T00:10:26] Unknown: I believe 18s should still have enough headroom for Regen. Not sure if it cuts Regen on full charge or limits 75v max but many run 18s on them with no issues
[2022-02-04T00:11:44] Unknown: 95v max, 72v nominal. So perfectly fine
[2022-02-04T00:11:45] Paolo ⁭: Hardware of sabvoton are 100v , 18s is a safe voltage. Abs e-scooter have lower back-emf
[2022-02-04T00:12:01] Unknown: 👍👍
[2022-02-04T00:12:12] Paolo ⁭: Anyway sabvoton have tvs diodes as protection, and a good capacitor
[2022-02-04T00:13:32] Unknown: Very nice. Now that I think about it, ASI was the one with super finiky settings and adjustments, not sabvoton
[2022-02-04T00:15:12] Paolo ⁭: Seems very nice, my friend have kit for inokim, but he never shares me ride info. And no so much ride test on YouTube
[2022-02-04T00:15:15] Unknown: ASI needs like technical support from manufacturer to make major setting adjustments from what I've heard. Usually they're ordered for a particular motor and have preset settings. My bad. Sabvoton is completely different
[2022-02-04T00:16:30] Unknown: Many e bike guys use them with good results. Out of curiosity, do they use an app or setting adjustments? Bluetooth?
[2022-02-04T00:16:34] Paolo ⁭: Have easiest configuration ?
[2022-02-04T00:16:48] Artem Bulashev: New ubox VESC have it on all 5v and 12v and 3.3v lines as well as self rest fuses, it was nice addition to v2
[2022-02-04T00:16:54] Paolo ⁭: Idk, he sent me only photo of controller xd
[2022-02-04T00:17:42] Unknown: Hmm... Got me thinking now. I *think* they use a proprietary app like VESC tool
[2022-02-04T00:17:51] Paolo ⁭: Idk why but ubox v2 have problem in adc, very very much problem for configurare input adc
[2022-02-04T00:18:14] Paolo ⁭: Every “your firmware on can bus is old”
[2022-02-04T00:18:24] Paolo ⁭: You need retry 100 times and work 😂
[2022-02-04T00:18:50] Artem Bulashev: Not sure, I have not seen others to report such
[2022-02-04T00:18:53] Unknown: I've heard guys on here trying to figure it out and having some issues but I don't know anything about it personally
[2022-02-04T00:19:07] Artem Bulashev: May be defective unit be careful all a ball shorting something 😉
[2022-02-04T00:19:08] Unknown: LoL. I feel like I have
[2022-02-04T00:19:38] Paolo ⁭: No, because once you’ve configurated work well , never problem.
[2022-02-04T00:20:05] Artem Bulashev: What you likely saw was about adc in general as it can’t take 5v signal needs 3.3v siganl but all throttles work better from 5v and that is not good for VESC mcu
[2022-02-04T00:20:06] Unknown: But could be thinking of something else... Maybe with the 3.3v vs 5v firmwares or something.
[2022-02-04T00:20:28] Unknown: Ok ok, that's right. That was it
[2022-02-04T00:20:31] Artem Bulashev: That’s called logic - pi MCU operate on 5v logic level
[2022-02-04T00:20:32] Paolo ⁭: I use only 3.3v input, then can’t is that problem
[2022-02-04T00:20:44] Artem Bulashev: While ESP32 work on 3.3v logic
[2022-02-04T00:20:54] Artem Bulashev: That depends on mcu
[2022-02-04T00:21:06] Artem Bulashev: And VESC is based around 3.3 🤦‍♂️
[2022-02-04T00:21:14] Paolo ⁭: If you use vesc tool 3.01 will go to crashed immediately, if use 3.00 after many time you can configure it
[2022-02-04T00:21:27] Artem Bulashev: Odd
[2022-02-04T00:21:44] Artem Bulashev: Did you try new FW?
[2022-02-04T00:21:58] Paolo ⁭: 5.3?
[2022-02-04T00:22:12] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-02-04T00:22:18] Artem Bulashev: It’s on Spintend website
[2022-02-04T00:22:28] Artem Bulashev: People report good things
[2022-02-04T00:22:36] Artem Bulashev: Better sounding motor is one of them
[2022-02-04T00:22:43] Artem Bulashev: And better regen down to 0
[2022-02-04T00:23:28] Paolo ⁭: Yes, but I prefer 5.2, because vesc tool 3.01 crush very much . Is so slow , when they fix vesc tool I will instal 5.03 again
[2022-02-04T00:24:10] Paolo ⁭: Be sure isn’t a pc hardware problem
[2022-02-04T01:18:17] Happy Giraffe: Pls dont say this😭
[2022-02-04T03:46:30] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2022-02-04T10:00:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2022-02-04T15:11:26] rosheee: shii
[2022-02-04T16:33:37] Gigolo Joe: 3.01 crashes? Been using it flawlessly for 300km now, zero crashes, works fast
[2022-02-04T16:43:44] Artem Bulashev: During adc configuration he said :)
[2022-02-04T16:58:20] Gigolo Joe: Can't see where he mentioned it tbh...
[2022-02-04T23:25:45] rosheee: Whut? Where?
[2022-02-04T23:25:56] rosheee: Pc?
[2022-02-05T01:24:22] Unknown: I used 6ml in the front and 6.5ml in the rear on 1400w 10 inch. No drag and excellent cooling
[2022-02-05T01:48:57] Unknown: Careful because you get diminishing returns with too much and start adding friction and resistance to the motor. There is a happy medium and even large e bike motors limit to around 8ml, maybe 10ml absolutely max
[2022-02-05T01:50:48] Unknown: Different controller (not VESC) with adjustable current change speed setting for more off the line punch. Can be achieved with speed or current throttle mode
[2022-02-05T08:09:04] rosheee: ?? What dis?
[2022-02-05T08:09:16] rosheee: Fluid for motorcooling?
[2022-02-05T10:37:56] rosheee: ;___;
[2022-02-05T10:38:41] rosheee: <photos/photo_2233@05-02-2022_10-38-41.jpg>
[2022-02-05T10:39:13] rosheee: Best cable so far 6 pin Can take up to 8 or more with plug ^__^
[2022-02-05T13:50:44] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_2234@05-02-2022_13-50-44.jpg>
[2022-02-05T13:50:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Who wants some used 40T ? 😂😂
[2022-02-05T13:51:28] Mirono escooters: Tasty
[2022-02-05T13:51:30] Mirono escooters: Good for leds
[2022-02-05T13:53:52] rosheee: hmm
[2022-02-05T14:14:10] Gigolo Joe: 2ml is not enough, use 4-5ml at least
[2022-02-05T14:26:11] rosheee: Wtf of what xD?!
[2022-02-05T14:26:17] rosheee: Why put shit in motor?
[2022-02-05T14:27:01] Gigolo Joe: Shit? Go read some mah dude
[2022-02-05T14:27:26] rosheee: Yah u put the cheap or expensive shizzl in?
[2022-02-05T14:27:34] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-05T14:27:46] Gigolo Joe: The expensive one
[2022-02-05T14:28:09] Gigolo Joe: Bought couple packs when it was in stock
[2022-02-05T14:28:25] rosheee: Which is?
[2022-02-05T14:28:36] Gigolo Joe: From grintech
[2022-02-05T14:30:08] Gigolo Joe: Dis
[2022-02-05T14:30:27] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I think 6ml for 6.1 inch motor with 50mm magnets like vsett is fair, but 6.5 motor with 60mm magnets likely could use 7-8ml I guess it should depend on motor size (it can be different even with same tire outer diamter)
[2022-02-05T14:30:56] Mirono escooters: Im gonna open my 1200w flj and send specs 👍
[2022-02-05T14:35:17] Artem Bulashev: Xiaomi is 6.5inch for example
[2022-02-05T14:35:27] Artem Bulashev: While vsett is 6.1
[2022-02-05T14:36:00] Artem Bulashev: But outer diameter is both 10”, that makes a lot more sidenwall on 10+ and hence more comfort
[2022-02-05T14:36:05] rosheee: Hmm my friend said there is something like this but muxh better than ferofluid
[2022-02-05T14:36:11] rosheee: XD but hella expensive
[2022-02-05T14:36:27] rosheee: Is it so good that fero stuff?
[2022-02-05T14:37:09] Artem Bulashev: Adam reported about 30% temp decrease on windings
[2022-02-05T14:37:29] rosheee: Oh shit
[2022-02-05T14:37:45] rosheee: Hmm i need temp. Sensor on motor Finally got one on battery

[2022-02-05T14:39:46] rosheee: Hmmm but does it rly dmg the motor so brutal?
[2022-02-05T14:48:27] Gigolo Joe: Yeah it's a bit pricey
[2022-02-05T14:48:33] Mirono escooters: Ordered some ferrofluid
[2022-02-05T14:49:08] Mirono escooters: If it saves a motor of 180€..
[2022-02-05T14:50:10] Gigolo Joe: Been using it for 2 years now, on different motors and different power levels. No problems at all. Used 3ml on a stock xiaomi, after 15km ride at full throttle the motor was almost cold which wasn't the case before
[2022-02-05T14:50:36] Gigolo Joe: It really does help dissipate the heat
[2022-02-05T14:56:28] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-05T14:57:22] rosheee: Ok then let's go How much needed for 4x vsett10+?

[2022-02-05T14:57:39] Mirono escooters: I Will test cheap ferrofluid inside xiaomi potor
[2022-02-05T14:58:09] rosheee: Dennis aka delta boi uses that stuff in his g30 delta motors
[2022-02-05T14:58:25] Mirono escooters: Will see

[2022-02-05T14:59:02] rosheee: Damn what is the other stuff...
[2022-02-05T15:01:58] rosheee: UHV — Advanced Power Drives https://powerdrives.net/uhv
[2022-02-05T15:11:58] Gigolo Joe: Yeah you kinda right, but that scooter is used on a daily basis for 15-20km a day. If the customer wants something and willing to pay i won't say no 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-02-05T15:12:54] Unknown: 6-6.5ml is a sweet spot for Vsett 10+ motors. 10" hub motor w 50mm magnets. Temp sensor at windings was around 145F max prior to statorade and 104F max after statorade with identical settings. Stuff is amazing
[2022-02-05T15:13:11] Gigolo Joe: This 👌🏻❗❗❗

[2022-02-05T15:13:49] Gigolo Joe: Another thing to consider is to add heatsinks on the motor case if possible
[2022-02-05T15:13:58] rosheee: what temp. sensors u used? ^^ ❤️
[2022-02-05T15:14:17] Unknown: I've looked everywhere for a 10" heatsink with no luck. Would probably be a custom job
[2022-02-05T15:14:37] Unknown: Nucular controllers with NTC 10k B:3950 temp sensors
[2022-02-05T15:14:42] rosheee: oh cmon XD why not make carbonf1ber aerodynamics for direct airflow to motor through frame and outta back and more downforce :D?
[2022-02-05T15:14:59] rosheee: u nucluar fanboi 😜
[2022-02-05T15:15:08] rosheee: u got discount code ^^?
[2022-02-05T15:15:09] Gigolo Joe: Ayyy🤑

[2022-02-05T15:15:44] Unknown: 6F n 12F not available currently. Backordered. Only 24F is available right now unfortunately
[2022-02-05T15:16:14] rosheee: yah i stay spintend until it burns or overheats 😃 don't want outside controller
[2022-02-05T15:16:16] rosheee: this?
[2022-02-05T15:16:17] Unknown: And they don't do discount codes. Hand made controllers from Russia 💪
[2022-02-05T15:16:29] Gigolo Joe: Funny that u mentioned it🤣🤣 As it was planned but said nuh
[2022-02-05T15:16:41] rosheee: yah my bike friend told me that ^^'
[2022-02-05T15:16:51] Unknown: NTC 10k B3950 sensor will work perfectly on VESC as well. @artBula uses these on his ubox
[2022-02-05T15:17:05] rosheee: the funny part gonna be how to fit them inside XD
[2022-02-05T15:17:23] Unknown: DIKAVS 3950 NTC 10K Precision Epoxy Thermistor Temperature Sensor (Pack of 2) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074JBZ63Z/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_1VRTWW5YFX0XHQZR6RXP?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

[2022-02-05T15:17:36] Unknown: The ones I used are there and they're tiny
[2022-02-05T15:17:40] rosheee: the same back in the days for overclocking
[2022-02-05T15:17:45] Unknown: They slide right into the windings
[2022-02-05T15:17:54] rosheee: can i use my pc temp sensors?
[2022-02-05T15:18:35] Unknown: Would have see what VESC accepts. Nucular can use multiple types of sensor but not sure about VESC's. They all have different resistance and beta values
[2022-02-05T15:19:24] Gigolo Joe: <photos/photo_2241@05-02-2022_15-19-24.jpg>
[2022-02-05T15:19:25] rosheee: lol 😆sooo...but they can only have 1 wire? not 2? like +/-?
[2022-02-05T15:19:31] rosheee: oh lol
[2022-02-05T15:19:37] Unknown: I'm sure a VESC guy can point you in the right direction but I know for sure Artem uses the NTC 100k, not the 10k. Just more resolution on the 100k
[2022-02-05T15:19:45] Gigolo Joe: Plan was to get rid of the front and back light
[2022-02-05T15:19:59] rosheee: k&n respect
[2022-02-05T15:20:23] Gigolo Joe: Dremel out the internal plastic and use it as an air duct as it's super close to the motor
[2022-02-05T15:22:58] rosheee: as g30 boii..u can't do shizzl like this..
[2022-02-05T15:29:48] rosheee: anyone overclocks RAM here ^^'?

[2022-02-05T17:50:19] Artem Bulashev: May cause vibrations
[2022-02-05T18:05:57] Unknown: They do make special hubsinks for certain e-bike motors. They're bolted together (pressure fit) to the outside of the hub and thermal paste is used to transfer the heat from the hub to the hubsink. Was trying to figure a way to get these to fit on my motor but wasn't going to work. If made properly they, like these are, they will be balanced and not cause any type of vibration
[2022-02-05T18:07:13] Luis Magalhaes: In ebikes is very used i think
[2022-02-05T18:07:48] Luis Magalhaes: Someone should try in a escooter inside the tyre 😂

[2022-02-05T21:10:49] Gigolo Joe: SMOL
[2022-02-05T21:10:56] Gigolo Joe: 6f is tiny
[2022-02-05T21:10:56] rosheee: rly?
[2022-02-05T21:11:18] Gigolo Joe: 6f a bit bigger than 75100

[2022-02-05T21:25:28] Gigolo Joe: no but you can connect 2 via can
[2022-02-05T21:25:56] Gigolo Joe: the display takes care of the setup
[2022-02-05T21:26:03] rosheee: argh
[2022-02-05T21:26:06] rosheee: why not 1
[2022-02-05T21:26:07] rosheee: only 1
[2022-02-05T21:36:16] rosheee: so i need : 2x Nucular controller 12F — $350 or 2x Thermo Nucular controller 24F — $600 + On-board computer — $110 ??
[2022-02-05T21:41:57] Unknown: 24F are huge. Meant for e-bikes and e-dirt bikes or giant single motor scooter. I mean, externally mounted 2 24F would absolutely work but they are big. 12F and 6F is backordered for a long time. I've had a preorder for multiple 12F and 6F for about a year. They're using the components they have to make the more profitable and requested 24F. Chip/components shortage. Everything hooks to display and can make your own CANBUS splitter for up to 8 controllers per display LoL
[2022-02-05T21:42:24] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-05T21:42:39] rosheee: has to fit g30

[2022-02-05T21:44:12] Unknown: Yup. 2 controllers. Even 1 12F and 1 6F... Any combination of controllers and 1 display. You can make your own splitter but can also buy one from Nuc
[2022-02-05T21:44:42] Unknown: And uLight is amazing for light/horn/turn signal control

[2022-02-05T21:45:56] Unknown: 95v max input
[2022-02-05T21:46:05] rosheee: i saw it
[2022-02-05T21:46:11] rosheee: but the frame doesn't want that big
[2022-02-05T21:46:29] rosheee: max max max XD
[2022-02-05T21:46:35] rosheee: this is max
[2022-02-05T21:46:38] Unknown: In a nutshell... Anyone who uses them, never really ever uses anything else
[2022-02-05T21:47:05] rosheee: so this everything has to fit

[2022-02-05T21:50:14] rosheee: or go smaller
[2022-02-05T21:53:53] Unknown: That's definitely possible. I made a spacer out of PVC and acrylic but controllers are external and needed the spacer for my battery with BMS on top
[2022-02-05T21:53:53] Unknown: <photos/photo_2261@05-02-2022_21-53-53.jpg>

[2022-02-05T22:17:58] Face de Pin Sucé: 75200 is a bad copy of A200s V2 that was not exactly working well at first 😂
[2022-02-05T22:18:21] Paolo ⁭: Isn’t a copy, is exactly the same, they’ve produced by their design
[2022-02-05T22:18:37] Paolo ⁭: A200s is open source
[2022-02-05T22:18:41] Unknown: Total weatherproof and shock proof for off-road dirt bikes. They even able to repair by using a solvent to "un-pot" LoL. I've literally not seen or heard of one fried unit in the 6 months I've been following them on telegram and paetron. Their products just don't break like that. Many guys have been using their same original controllers from 2015 when they were first launched

[2022-02-05T22:21:58] Paolo ⁭: Yes, I’ve checked the pcb when burned
[2022-02-05T22:22:11] Face de Pin Sucé: And components ?
[2022-02-05T22:22:13] Paolo ⁭: They’ve only replaced some unavailable chip with available one
[2022-02-05T22:22:55] Paolo ⁭: Mosfet is the same, mosfet driver no. Current sense amplifier no, dc-dc no , and some other
[2022-02-05T22:23:44] Face de Pin Sucé: That's what I thought x)
[2022-02-05T22:23:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Because A200S V2 wasn't working well

[2022-02-05T22:51:02] Mirono escooters: Rich People
[2022-02-05T22:51:31] Unknown: Beautiful man! Exactly what I'll be doing with the split nickel/steel tabs and QS8 connectors
[2022-02-05T22:52:15] Unknown: Those nickel tabs have cutouts in the copper??
[2022-02-05T22:53:30] Paolo ⁭: Are laser prewelded strip
[2022-02-05T22:53:34] Unknown: Solid copper wire on the main buses soldered to the copper plate bus... That's a beautiful job man
[2022-02-05T22:53:53] Paolo ⁭: Cost very much, for 20s9p cost are 170$ copper including DHL ship fee
[2022-02-05T22:55:19] Unknown: 😯 damn. Those are perfect welds and I love how the nickel tabs are recessed at the cell tips and pre welded. I know exactly what you mean. That's seriously amazing
[2022-02-05T22:55:29] Paolo ⁭: Thank you bro, that’s also mine
[2022-02-05T22:55:33] rosheee: n1
[2022-02-05T22:55:35] Paolo ⁭: Without nickel
[2022-02-05T22:55:54] Unknown: Nice nice. Did you use copper probes?

[2022-02-05T22:55:58] Paolo ⁭: I can share you their contact
[2022-02-05T22:56:08] Paolo ⁭: https://m.italian.alibaba.com/p-detail/detail-1600251653107.html?__sceneInfo=%7B%22type%22:%22appDetailShare%22,%22data%22:%7B%22filterKey%22:%227.8.2_share%22,%22cacheTime%22:%221800000%22%7D%7D
[2022-02-05T22:56:33] Unknown: I see you were able to solder your balance leads direct to the copper. I was wondering about that and how to attach mine
[2022-02-05T22:56:55] Unknown: Awesome. Thanks bro. I'll check them out for sure
[2022-02-05T22:57:11] Paolo ⁭: Just use solder paste, in copper bottom and normally spot weld it
[2022-02-05T22:57:55] Unknown: Gotcha, thanks for the tip
[2022-02-05T22:58:31] Paolo ⁭: It’s enought kWeld 20joule
[2022-02-05T22:59:31] Paolo ⁭: What you are mean? Copper attack immediately with tin
[2022-02-05T22:59:48] Unknown: Really nice.
[2022-02-05T23:00:25] Paolo ⁭: You mean here?
[2022-02-05T23:01:07] Unknown: I wasn't sure.. I mean, without using too much and making the cells hot. I know we solder copper wires all the time, just wasn't sure about soldering balance wires after the plates are attached
[2022-02-05T23:01:12] Unknown: Was the other picture
[2022-02-05T23:01:26] Unknown: This I'm sure you soldered before spot welding, right?
[2022-02-05T23:01:45] Paolo ⁭: You need 0.5second for solder balance wire xd
[2022-02-05T23:01:54] Unknown: <photos/photo_2278@05-02-2022_23-01-54.jpg>
[2022-02-05T23:01:59] Paolo ⁭: 0.5 is very little time and don’t damage battery
[2022-02-05T23:01:59] Unknown: Those...
[2022-02-05T23:02:07] Unknown: 👍👍
[2022-02-05T23:02:15] Paolo ⁭: You can also touch copper strip when you solder and don’t get hot
[2022-02-05T23:02:35] Unknown: Oh really? Copper sort of acts a heatsink right?
[2022-02-05T23:03:05] Unknown: Doesn't hold the heat like nickel
[2022-02-05T23:05:20] Paolo ⁭: Yes but if you have solder with 400 degrees need just 0.5 second for melt tin
[2022-02-05T23:05:25] Unknown: I've heard it is like a heatsink which is another reason it's good for building batteries... It pulls the heat away from the cells where Nickel acts like a heat insulator and traps the heat in the middle of the pack
[2022-02-05T23:05:58] rosheee: why not copper + nickel?
[2022-02-05T23:06:25] Unknown: Perfect. Good to know man. Thank you. I have solder irons from 20w all the way up to 140w 👍
[2022-02-05T23:07:32] Paolo ⁭: Less material, less time, less Energy joule needs. And more beautiful xd
[2022-02-05T23:07:36] Unknown: That one is not mine. If I could get away without using the nickel plated steel tabs I would, just easier to manage with the tabs, especially split/slotted tabs
[2022-02-05T23:08:04] Unknown: LoL. Exactly. Beautiful presentation and easier to work with
[2022-02-05T23:14:52] Unknown: I was thinking of using the same bus style with the "L" shaped mains but bending the pre-soldered main wires back on themselves instead of folded over the back/front. So the main negative and main positive would sit on the top of the battery instead of at the rear/front. Do you see any problem doing that? I have plenty of height since BMS is on top but limited on width and length
[2022-02-05T23:17:35] Unknown: Exactly what you did but folded back on top instead. Something like this. Would presolder wires first, then spot weld, then bend down fully on top of the spot welded area. Make sense?
[2022-02-06T00:27:58] Paolo ⁭: Yes. Anyway I don’t like put bms on the top of battery. But yes can be done . If you have space limit
[2022-02-06T00:28:26] Paolo ⁭: Before solder a reinforcement copper wire before weld it on battery
[2022-02-06T00:37:22] Unknown: Very cool man. Thanks for the tip. Was going to maybe put a solid core copper wire right in the fold/crease and solder it in place with the BMS B- wires before spot welding. I made room by raising the deck w spacer for BMS on top only because my 20s9p would not have otherwise. Would have had to go with 18s and that's no fun when 20s is an option LoL
[2022-02-06T00:37:55] Paolo ⁭: Fit in vsett 20s9p😱?
[2022-02-06T00:42:12] Unknown: Yes Sir. Controllers mounted outside
[2022-02-06T00:43:36] Paolo ⁭: Have same zero 11x deck?
[2022-02-06T00:44:16] Unknown: 9p fits widthwise (deck is 171mm wide, 9p 21700 in "W" config is 168mm wide) and total length is 445mm after hot glued. Total deck inside is 462mm long max.

[2022-02-06T00:45:08] Unknown: Very similar. Not sure if they're exact. Total deck inside is 171 wide x 462 long and 71 high. I made a 24mm spacer for 21700 and BMS on top 👍
[2022-02-06T00:45:22] rosheee: u have spacer for vsett 10+?
[2022-02-06T00:45:26] rosheee: for the whole deck?
[2022-02-06T00:45:27] rosheee: 3dprint
[2022-02-06T00:45:29] rosheee: pls paolo
[2022-02-06T00:45:36] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-06T00:46:03] rosheee: ok i do it by myself and share it here then
[2022-02-06T00:46:04] Unknown: LoL. Nothing 3d printed from me. Just a good eye, smart brain and elbow grease 🤪
[2022-02-06T00:46:12] rosheee: problem is i have no vsett 10+ xD
[2022-02-06T00:46:22] rosheee: i have to go to friends shop and take measurements from there xD
[2022-02-06T00:46:33] Unknown: The rubber deck gasket is a perfect stencil.
[2022-02-06T00:46:39] rosheee: out of stock
[2022-02-06T00:46:45] Unknown: Ick
[2022-02-06T00:46:53] rosheee: 😃
[2022-02-06T00:56:07] Paolo ⁭: You need also to consider protect layer , and insulation plastic. Is many important
[2022-02-06T00:56:46] Unknown: Oh absolutely. I have it covered I believe. Here's what I have, tell me what you think...
[2022-02-06T01:00:02] Unknown: Each cell is heat shrink wrapped (obviously) with good thick heat shrink, I wrapped each cell with 1 layer of kapton (yes, I wrapped 180 individual cells with kapton 🤣) before hot gluing with super strong black hot glue. In between the p groups I have .1mm wax paper (similar to fish paper) to protect the series groups. On the outer shell I'll be wrapping with 70mm fish paper and using .3 epoxy resin board on the sides, bottom, rear and top for a "hard shell" and then final wrap with large heat shrink to hold it all together. There will also be a few layers of kapton on the outer shell prior to the fish paper
[2022-02-06T01:02:27] Unknown: By the time I have all of outer protection layers, it should end up around 170mm wide. Right now it's 168.5mm wide. Since it's literally going to drop into the deck, I'm going to have to use sort of cradle (maybe thin acrylic sheet underneath) with a Velcro strap to get the beast back out of the deck since I won't be able to get under it with my fingers. Any suggestions for that?
[2022-02-06T01:08:20] Mirono escooters: This is art
[2022-02-06T01:24:12] Paolo ⁭: Good option, but anyway I don’t like too slalom batteries (I mean for my build because is more difficult).
[2022-02-06T01:31:38] Unknown: Thanks man. I've planning been it out in my mind for a while.
[2022-02-06T01:33:03] Unknown: It is definitely a pain LoL. No premade material at all. All custom plates. Strips can work for series but don't work for parallel connections 🤦🏻
[2022-02-06T02:13:01] Paolo ⁭: Idk why they’ve these waiting time
[2022-02-06T02:13:05] Paolo ⁭: Very much ahahaha
[2022-02-06T02:13:33] Paolo ⁭: Anyway I was think nuclear uses a to247 but not…
[2022-02-06T02:22:58] Paolo ⁭: Just buy one and sent them to China for copy😂
[2022-02-06T02:37:02] rosheee: Adam please could u?
[2022-02-06T02:37:19] rosheee: Sell it as BATVID-21
[2022-02-06T02:44:05] Unknown: Haha. Well that's a double edge sword guys. Chinese cannot replicate Russian quality. This is why they don't fail and have the reputation they do... Because they don't sell their design for mass production
[2022-02-06T02:44:31] Unknown: If they mass produced them we would be picking solder balls out of Nucular, which is not their aim
[2022-02-06T02:44:48] Unknown: If ya get my drift
[2022-02-06T02:45:03] rosheee: They have like 133769 orders?
[2022-02-06T02:45:08] rosheee: Or it is just HYPE HYPE
[2022-02-06T02:45:18] Unknown: It's hyped for a reason brother
[2022-02-06T02:45:31] rosheee: Because rare
[2022-02-06T02:45:32] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-06T02:45:33] Unknown: There's a lot. Huge demand

[2022-02-06T02:47:19] rosheee: Or 90 days like china?
[2022-02-06T02:47:51] Unknown: Many opinions. But yes, it is an opinion nonetheless
[2022-02-06T02:48:15] rosheee: Just kidding ;-P
[2022-02-06T02:48:27] rosheee: Software? Vesc? Logfiles?

[2022-02-06T02:48:42] Unknown: Not many scooter guys use or really even know about them. Mostly e bike guys
[2022-02-06T02:49:33] rosheee: UHV — Advanced Power Drives https://powerdrives.net/uhv
[2022-02-06T02:49:33] rosheee: What about this?
[2022-02-06T02:49:51] rosheee: Lol a guy bought my flippersky 7550 for ebike
[2022-02-06T02:49:53] Unknown: It's snowy and icy here for the next month or two, so unfortunately I can't ride in the snow. Sucks. By spring time I'll have my new battery in and will be able to post some results
[2022-02-06T02:50:00] rosheee: XD when he told me that on phone i was like
[2022-02-06T02:50:06] Unknown: 😬

[2022-02-06T02:50:56] Unknown: Sorry man haha. Just got like 1/4" ice storm yesterday
[2022-02-06T02:51:33] Unknown: Salt and sand all over the wet roads. Can't expose my lovely 10+ to those conditions! LoL
[2022-02-06T02:52:44] rosheee: Just ride :D
[2022-02-06T02:53:37] rosheee: This is the real test. Bur understand u -D it is like with cars xD the mofo living next to me driving his mclaren even when snowstorm lul
[2022-02-06T02:53:51] Unknown: I only run dual motors. With stock 16s battery and a bit of field weakening I got up to 53mph. New 20s battery and much higher amp capability I'll be easy over 70mph if I really wanted to..
[2022-02-06T02:54:29] Unknown: Crazy crazy. That's what it looks like here. My PMT E-Fire's probably won't grab too good 🤪
[2022-02-06T02:54:52] rosheee: 53mph gps?
[2022-02-06T02:55:34] rosheee: @Ghost_911 set 100A field weak xD holy shit. I set 25A and have massiv (more heat n juice) more endspeed
[2022-02-06T02:55:41] Unknown: 53mph Nucular calibrated to proper magnet pairs and wheel diameter. So, accurate
[2022-02-06T02:55:51] rosheee: Interestiiiing
[2022-02-06T02:56:23] rosheee: Bit faster than me..shit..so sad now..
[2022-02-06T02:56:25] Unknown: Yea, field weakening pulls tons of extra amps if you let it. Gotta be careful with the heat. That's what temp sensors are for 👍
[2022-02-06T02:56:37] rosheee: Order next week
[2022-02-06T02:56:50] Unknown: Well, that's just with stock 16s 70a battery
[2022-02-06T02:57:11] rosheee: Jah me also 16S5P 60A xD
[2022-02-06T02:57:25] Unknown: Keep an eye on endless sphere for sale forum. There's a 24f and display for sale right now. 12f and 6f sometimes pop up randomly
[2022-02-06T02:57:27] rosheee: 20S..u happyguy
[2022-02-06T02:57:53] Unknown: Ya never know. That's how I found mine bro

[2022-02-06T02:59:23] Unknown: Haha... I respect that
[2022-02-06T02:59:25] rosheee: I struggle with 10x2.5 atm cuz brakes What is expensive? Need 1x slicks 10x3 and 1x semi ^^
[2022-02-06T03:00:09] Unknown: I had 2 of the new 10x3 E-Fires shipped from PMT Italy to USA and was around $175 shipped for the pair
[2022-02-06T03:00:31] rosheee: XD ok italy is next to me. Maybe cheaper
[2022-02-06T03:00:36] rosheee: Lol 175$
[2022-02-06T03:00:46] Unknown: I had to try them. They're awesome but I also enjoy CST 10x3
[2022-02-06T03:00:50] rosheee: I habr to change tires every month damn
[2022-02-06T03:00:50] Unknown: Yea...
[2022-02-06T03:00:59] Unknown: Then probably not worth it
[2022-02-06T03:01:15] rosheee: Yah 2 scooters. 1 woth the 2x3000w wanna put slicks there
[2022-02-06T03:01:28] rosheee: The other is daily pocketrocket
[2022-02-06T03:01:31] Unknown: The CSTs are just as smooth and almost as grippy.
[2022-02-06T03:01:40] rosheee: I tried them both
[2022-02-06T03:01:43] Unknown: 👍 nice
[2022-02-06T03:02:19] rosheee: 10x3 tuvot 10x2.5 tuvot 10x2.5 cst
[2022-02-06T03:03:17] rosheee: Cst hard Tuvot soft n smooth
[2022-02-06T03:04:16] Unknown: Hmm. Maybe the CSTs I got were different? They're the 10x3 tubeless ones
[2022-02-06T03:06:52] Paolo ⁭: Much choise
[2022-02-06T03:07:14] rosheee: Tubeless for vsett o.O?
[2022-02-06T03:07:20] rosheee: I have 10x2.5
[2022-02-06T03:07:36] Paolo ⁭: Pmt are all tubeless and have efire 2.5
[2022-02-06T03:09:57] rosheee: So no prob fit them on vsett 10 motors?
[2022-02-06T03:10:12] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-06T03:17:15] Paolo ⁭: Vsett fit this tire
[2022-02-06T03:17:25] rosheee: so no prob tubless?
[2022-02-06T03:17:43] Paolo ⁭: Can work as tubeless but also with inner tube
[2022-02-06T03:17:44] rosheee: how is the rubbermix @ slick?
[2022-02-06T03:19:24] Paolo ⁭: Sincerely I don’t like too e-fire series . They have more hard rubber mix than pmt stradale and slick that I use. Because are projected for better endurance , not for better grip but less endurance. But anyway better than tuovt & company xd
[2022-02-06T03:19:50] rosheee: hmm
[2022-02-06T03:19:56] Paolo ⁭: 11 inch motor is good upgrade for vsett
[2022-02-06T03:19:59] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-02-06T03:20:05] rosheee: yah for adam xD

[2022-02-06T03:20:59] rosheee: yah but g30 with vsett motor 😆
[2022-02-06T03:21:08] rosheee: and the fucking brakes
[2022-02-06T03:21:43] Paolo ⁭: You bought vsett motor because you think is good or because you get it for good prices?
[2022-02-06T03:23:13] rosheee: hmm because i had 1000W before (worst) and i get it for good price and they do their work so far and they fit g30 front + rear without any customisation and they look "stock" and they don't have the wattage on it ^^' if police get's me i never get back my license
[2022-02-06T03:23:24] rosheee: and i'm done after the 17S and maybe 20S for the moment
[2022-02-06T03:24:13] rosheee: BUT
[2022-02-06T03:24:39] Paolo ⁭: Ive 500W marking on 4kW motor xd
[2022-02-06T03:24:40] rosheee: before i had vsett i bought the massive 3000W ones ^^' which were ..yah massiv and they didn't fit front nor rear so i bought vsett ^^'
[2022-02-06T03:25:00] rosheee: 😉
[2022-02-06T03:25:08] rosheee: idk spend sooo many $
[2022-02-06T03:25:23] Paolo ⁭: 3000W is 55mm or 60mm?
[2022-02-06T03:25:29] rosheee: 60mm
[2022-02-06T03:25:42] rosheee: XD the tire omg..
[2022-02-06T03:26:07] rosheee: the disc was at the axle point @ rear so had to stretch it like 5cm each side
[2022-02-06T03:26:14] Paolo ⁭: Gg
[2022-02-06T03:26:19] rosheee: new owner has fun with them..now he can go uphill with 25kmh
[2022-02-06T03:26:21] Paolo ⁭: No difference by 3500W model
[2022-02-06T03:26:22] rosheee: for 100$

[2022-02-06T03:27:22] Paolo ⁭: Xd
[2022-02-06T03:27:49] rosheee: 70-80kmh uphill downhill straight maybe backwards that's good but the range...damn
[2022-02-06T03:27:57] rosheee: 25-35km are nothing
[2022-02-06T03:28:22] rosheee: @PaoloWu dr. ..
[2022-02-06T03:28:45] rosheee: when u have a battery..with 6P each cell has max 35A with how many A can u charge the battery?
[2022-02-06T03:28:57] rosheee: 6x35A and then / 2?
[2022-02-06T03:29:01] rosheee: for 0.5C?
[2022-02-06T03:29:08] Paolo ⁭: I charge my battery with 30A xd, because is limit of them
[2022-02-06T03:29:58] rosheee: exactly
[2022-02-06T03:30:06] rosheee: so is my calculation correct?
[2022-02-06T03:30:10] rosheee: or is it per 1 cell?
[2022-02-06T03:30:14] Paolo ⁭: USVTC6A21700 is 9A maximum continuos charge current, 9x7 in my pack is 63A . But my charger is max 30A
[2022-02-06T03:30:21] Paolo ⁭: Sorry I mean my charger is max 30A
[2022-02-06T03:30:21] rosheee: so 0.5C
[2022-02-06T03:30:28] rosheee: yaya :D then i'm right
[2022-02-06T03:30:36] rosheee: so i can charge with 60A
[2022-02-06T03:30:39] Paolo ⁭: But correct safe charge current depend by datasheet
[2022-02-06T03:30:49] Paolo ⁭: Which cell you have?
[2022-02-06T03:30:55] Paolo ⁭: I use Sony and are different
[2022-02-06T03:30:59] rosheee: the 40T for 17S
[2022-02-06T03:31:06] rosheee: next one hopefully the new molicel
[2022-02-06T03:31:48] Paolo ⁭: You will not see it before 2023
[2022-02-06T03:32:21] rosheee: this?
[2022-02-06T03:32:27] rosheee: i asked friends in taiwan 😆maybe they can check
[2022-02-06T03:32:34] rosheee: even wrote molicel an email
[2022-02-06T03:32:35] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_2286@06-02-2022_03-32-35.jpg>
[2022-02-06T03:32:40] Paolo ⁭: 6A is the maximum charge
[2022-02-06T03:32:59] rosheee: wtf
[2022-02-06T03:33:06] rosheee: are these the cells with 35A contin?
[2022-02-06T03:33:39] Paolo ⁭: Hahah scam data, already moli P42a is not a 45A, I can’t believe p45b is 45 too xd
[2022-02-06T03:34:16] rosheee: https://www.molicel.com/inr21700-p45b/
[2022-02-06T03:34:17] rosheee: but they say
[2022-02-06T03:34:45] Paolo ⁭: Moli is 30A, Samsung 40t 35, 30T 40A , and 30T is better cell for high discharge
[2022-02-06T03:35:01] rosheee: omg

[2022-02-06T16:27:36] Unknown: If a battery is plugged with the wrong terminals, the cells still have normal charge but the BMS restricts and sends 7v instead of 40v What would need replacing ?
[2022-02-06T16:31:20] Unknown: Probably entire bms if wrongly connected haha, had this problem once, entire burned out on the inside and the case basicly nearly melted 😆 was connected that way for like 4 sec untill i noticed haha
[2022-02-06T16:31:54] Mirono escooters: Yea bms
[2022-02-06T16:32:23] Unknown: Connected my charger wrongly about 2 weeks ago, thank god for arma xt90 plugs connected that way for like 15 mins no probs at all besides a broken xt90 plug 😆
[2022-02-06T16:32:30] Unknown: Lucky me haha
[2022-02-06T17:07:13] Unknown: When the person connected they disconnected straight away, gonna try bridge fuse and see if it works

[2022-02-06T19:48:59] Happy Giraffe: If it's a metal screw how you avoid mosfet shorting?
[2022-02-06T19:49:50] Happy Giraffe: Hole in mosfet is that much bigger than the screw diameter?
[2022-02-06T19:50:28] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-06T19:50:53] Mirono escooters: You insert a plastic isolation
[2022-02-06T19:51:17] Happy Giraffe: Yeah that is there but screw is metal
[2022-02-06T19:51:40] Mirono escooters: It cant touch it due to plastic insert
[2022-02-06T19:52:11] Happy Giraffe: Insert between mos hole and screw thread also?
[2022-02-06T19:52:22] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-02-06T19:52:28] Happy Giraffe: Cool
[2022-02-06T19:53:13] Happy Giraffe: Wish I could bolt single ubox same way

[2022-02-06T19:53:48] rosheee: FFS i drive crazy for that magura hydraulic change 😆can i take whatever M6 banjo i want and also the bleeding screw m5?
[2022-02-06T19:57:22] Unknown: Screw is short, doesn't reach fets
[2022-02-06T19:58:40] Unknown: Short screws on right side and longer screws on left side. I switched to all short screws to avoid confusion. When I got my controller, the previous owner put the long screw in the short hole (🤣) and was causing the phases to short. Found out during auto set-up but didn't harm anything. Another win for Nuc LoL
[2022-02-06T19:59:35] Unknown: Show phase error during auto set-up, found it, fixed it and moved on

[2022-02-07T02:09:01] Paolo ⁭: Mine :(
[2022-02-07T02:09:02] Happy Giraffe: Luckily Samsung has good short circuit protection, thats why your cells are not on fire yet
[2022-02-07T02:09:16] Paolo ⁭: This is Samsung 50E
[2022-02-07T02:09:18] Paolo ⁭: Xd
[2022-02-07T02:09:29] rosheee: Samsung 50G better then
[2022-02-07T02:09:32] Happy Giraffe: You are better at burning than him😂
[2022-02-07T02:09:38] rosheee: Absolut
[2022-02-07T02:09:42] rosheee: Not possible anymore
[2022-02-07T02:09:51] Paolo ⁭: Just short circuited for less than two minut
[2022-02-07T02:10:10] rosheee: Hotto only
[2022-02-07T02:11:04] rosheee: How fix charging problem?
[2022-02-07T02:11:12] Artem Bulashev: The only cell that can take 160a from 5p is p42a
[2022-02-07T02:11:20] Artem Bulashev: Nothing else from high capacity
[2022-02-07T02:11:28] Artem Bulashev: Even that cell will offer heat
[2022-02-07T02:11:38] rosheee: That crap between batter x esc
[2022-02-07T02:11:43] Paolo ⁭: Fake
[2022-02-07T02:12:00] Artem Bulashev: Why would any one need it?
[2022-02-07T02:12:02] rosheee: I can send u poc that 50G 5P can do vesc 158A
[2022-02-07T02:12:07] Paolo ⁭: P42a is the worse cell in discharge as Samsung 40T/30T/VTC6A
[2022-02-07T02:12:11] rosheee: To charge xD
[2022-02-07T02:12:22] rosheee: Forgot to solder cable
[2022-02-07T02:12:23] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-07T02:12:29] Paolo ⁭: Just not see only datasheet declared value :)
[2022-02-07T02:12:42] Artem Bulashev: It’s better than any of above and identical to 40t in terms of temp heat up over current
[2022-02-07T02:12:48] Artem Bulashev: But higher capasity
[2022-02-07T02:13:08] Artem Bulashev: I don’t look at data sheets, I look at real world test results
[2022-02-07T02:13:19] Paolo ⁭: No, isn’t same. You can see clearly voltage drop difference and temp difference
[2022-02-07T02:13:39] Paolo ⁭: If you have a dc load, you can self test
[2022-02-07T02:13:50] Artem Bulashev: I compared 40t and p42a and they are identical basically
[2022-02-07T02:14:40] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2298@07-02-2022_02-14-40.jpg>
[2022-02-07T02:14:40] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2299@07-02-2022_02-14-40.jpg>
[2022-02-07T02:14:50] Paolo ⁭: Just you can see ac impedance is different, and also with dc current load is different. Mine test are based at 40A discharge continuos
[2022-02-07T02:14:51] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2300@07-02-2022_02-14-51.jpg>
[2022-02-07T02:14:51] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2301@07-02-2022_02-14-51.jpg>
[2022-02-07T02:14:53] rosheee: Thx for that info
[2022-02-07T02:15:10] Paolo ⁭: Give me few day, I will reorder a molicel and show you test result :)
[2022-02-07T02:15:17] rosheee: I can test
[2022-02-07T02:15:41] Paolo ⁭: Yea, but they haven’t show 40A test
[2022-02-07T02:15:46] Artem Bulashev: You can see how P42a win ever so slightly on 20a and 30a
[2022-02-07T02:15:58] rosheee: <photos/photo_2302@07-02-2022_02-15-58.jpg>
[2022-02-07T02:16:12] Artem Bulashev: Because those cells over heat at 30a, there is no point to do 40a on them - it’s a bomb at that current
[2022-02-07T02:16:37] rosheee: But why samsubg 50G perform like a boss?
[2022-02-07T02:16:39] Artem Bulashev: 40t could not even complete 20a without over heating before full cycle ended
[2022-02-07T02:16:49] Artem Bulashev: Also won’t, not at 30a
[2022-02-07T02:17:01] Paolo ⁭: 3.82v at 30A discharge
[2022-02-07T02:17:01] rosheee: Then vesc lies?
[2022-02-07T02:17:16] Paolo ⁭: 3.7 molicel
[2022-02-07T02:17:42] rosheee: Then 40t is crap?
[2022-02-07T02:18:01] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-02-07T02:18:04] Artem Bulashev: Look at 0.5ah, they are both at 3.6v
[2022-02-07T02:18:13] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-02-07T02:18:22] Artem Bulashev: Just no point to get it over P42a
[2022-02-07T02:18:39] Paolo ⁭: Without discussion at discharge current is better 40T :)
[2022-02-07T02:18:41] Artem Bulashev: Wh graphs I attached - they account for voltage sag
[2022-02-07T02:19:04] Paolo ⁭: Yea but because higher capacity, it’s normal😅
[2022-02-07T02:19:18] Paolo ⁭: We are talking about discharge rate or I’m wrong?
[2022-02-07T02:19:25] Artem Bulashev: - look at wh full to 3v - p42a wins at 20a and 30a
[2022-02-07T02:19:50] Artem Bulashev: Sorry moment
[2022-02-07T02:20:07] Paolo ⁭: .

[2022-02-07T02:20:55] rosheee: Samsung better
[2022-02-07T02:21:01] Artem Bulashev: P42a one managed to complete cycle even at 30a
[2022-02-07T02:21:11] Artem Bulashev: While 40t failed due to over heat
[2022-02-07T02:21:23] rosheee: Omg..u make me nervous
[2022-02-07T02:21:26] Paolo ⁭: Just see them at 40A
[2022-02-07T02:21:34] Artem Bulashev: Why would I?
[2022-02-07T02:21:43] Happy Giraffe: 120x20mm is good size for single ubox mosfets?
[2022-02-07T02:21:50] Paolo ⁭: You can look how molicel dies fast, because internal temperature is very very high
[2022-02-07T02:21:55] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-07T02:22:02] rosheee: Arctic are better than these

[2022-02-07T02:22:56] Artem Bulashev: Just don’t run them without temp sensor about 25a for long time at that load (long time is about 6min before over heat)
[2022-02-07T02:23:04] rosheee: Should i try the alpha?
[2022-02-07T02:23:09] Happy Giraffe: Cant be worse than stock Spintend going 68°c mosfet with 110A phase

[2022-02-07T02:26:44] Happy Giraffe: Yes single lol, should be enough but I want to confirm as I cant think😂

[2022-02-07T02:36:06] Happy Giraffe: Here I see reason why the fet is 68°c....
[2022-02-07T02:36:27] Artem Bulashev: Metalncase May be obstructing heat transfer more than helping. May be copper heat pipe under mosfets some past to put on scooter body 👌
[2022-02-07T02:36:33] Paolo ⁭: I’ve tried that with minimotors
[2022-02-07T02:37:03] Artem Bulashev: Considering casing of minimotors I think it should work well?
[2022-02-07T02:37:11] Artem Bulashev: Never seen actual test
[2022-02-07T02:37:50] Paolo ⁭: Yes and I use 50A controller at 100 with shunt

[2022-02-07T14:09:43] Paolo ⁭: Better stay low 15% than maximum allowed voltage that productor suggest
[2022-02-07T14:10:02] rosheee: One guy even use 18S on it no prob
[2022-02-07T14:10:05] Paolo ⁭: You need more capacitor
[2022-02-07T14:10:28] Paolo ⁭: Bro, I can’t tell this more ahaha. If you no problem not mean this is safe

[2022-02-07T14:18:32] rosheee: What could be dangerous?
[2022-02-07T14:19:55] Paolo ⁭: Voltage spikes, also if regen is disable you have back emf anyway
[2022-02-07T14:22:53] rosheee: How do they come? No regen No brake
[2022-02-07T14:25:05] Paolo ⁭: Motor field. You have back emf also during acceleration

[2022-02-07T19:59:11] Unknown: Why so many issues? I don't understand why it's hard to make a decent piece of hardware. Too bad trampa is insanely expensive, are they good or bad? I imagine they should be good for the money they cost but I have no experience
[2022-02-07T19:59:35] Unknown: I mean I've got trampa for my ebike
[2022-02-07T20:00:01] Unknown: And I mean, aside from a Weird cutout that happens sometimes if I throttle too long max then it's fine
[2022-02-07T20:00:19] Unknown: What's the problem with all these other vescs haha
[2022-02-07T20:00:23] Unknown: Been out of the scoot game for a whole
[2022-02-07T20:00:25] Unknown: While
[2022-02-07T20:00:33] Unknown: My trampa's fets go above 70° with 40 batt 75 motor
[2022-02-07T20:00:50] Unknown: Full on throttle for like 15 mins and they're above 70
[2022-02-07T20:00:51] rosheee: so my spintend v1 runs cool lol
[2022-02-07T20:01:18] Unknown: Mounted inside a battery bag at the bottom of my deck so pretty descent cooling
[2022-02-07T20:01:21] Unknown: My trampa runs decent temps under loads , but it is bolted to a ebike controller case with thermal paste and wind hitting it constantly at 40mph
[2022-02-07T20:02:06] Unknown: I see the real struggles here many have with VESC's. End of the day, VESC is software... Someone make a decent God damn controller for Chris sake. If I had to change controllers I don't even know what I'd do... Probably Kelly or sabvoton
[2022-02-07T20:02:41] rosheee: they look ugly ^^
[2022-02-07T20:03:12] Unknown: <animation>
[2022-02-07T20:03:29] Artem Bulashev: Without regen ubox will work no problem others don’t know
[2022-02-07T20:03:32] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-07T20:03:54] rosheee: so i am fine if i just can push throttle xD
[2022-02-07T20:03:57] Artem Bulashev: Same here. Not that I’m pushing it, but yeah it runs at least no issues haha
[2022-02-07T20:03:58] rosheee: like i do all time
[2022-02-07T20:04:52] Unknown: Is'nt sabvoton rc based?
[2022-02-07T20:05:03] Unknown: Only 120$ at 72v 200A??
[2022-02-07T20:05:08] Unknown: Seems a bit cheap
[2022-02-07T20:05:10] Unknown: I dont see how they would support 15s or higher
[2022-02-07T20:05:27] Unknown: I'm not sure. Maybe can handle high RPM RC motors as well but many use sabvoton on EVs
[2022-02-07T20:05:47] Unknown: That's the downside. Not sure if there's an HV version
[2022-02-07T20:05:58] Artem Bulashev: What are the dimensions?
[2022-02-07T20:06:25] Artem Bulashev: I don’t think they are scooter friendly
[2022-02-07T20:07:50] Unknown: Tons of e-bike guys use them, Like all the time. Pages and pages of reviews on endless sphere regarding sabvoton and electric vehicles
[2022-02-07T20:08:16] Artem Bulashev: I mean size wise not friendly
[2022-02-07T20:08:20] Unknown: But I don't know much, I do know they're used and have fairly decent success
[2022-02-07T20:08:26] Artem Bulashev: But I don’t know for sure
[2022-02-07T20:08:26] rosheee: that one looks ot
[2022-02-07T20:08:27] rosheee: https://teamtriforceuk.com/a200s-v3/
[2022-02-07T20:08:29] Unknown: Oh right right... Gotcha
[2022-02-07T20:08:41] rosheee: Current Handling 20S (100V FETs) 200A continuous with no additional cooling 400A continuous with forced air or water cooling 500A burst
[2022-02-07T20:08:52] Unknown: In that case, you are very right.
[2022-02-07T20:08:53] Artem Bulashev: 500€ for single
[2022-02-07T20:08:55] rosheee: £670.00
[2022-02-07T20:09:24] Unknown: Once you fry 3-4 flipshits or 2 uBox... You can buy 1 good controller that will last
[2022-02-07T20:09:38] Unknown: Invest upfront and save money and major headaches down the line
[2022-02-07T20:09:49] Unknown: <photos/photo_2345@07-02-2022_20-09-49.jpg>
[2022-02-07T20:10:12] Artem Bulashev: You would have to burn 3 dual ubox to get 2 single once like that :)) and I’m not sure how much more reliable it would be than Nukes that are a lot cheaper than
[2022-02-07T20:10:25] Unknown: Oh nice. Had a feeling I heard something about the higher voltage versions before
[2022-02-07T20:10:55] Unknown: Looks descent too
[2022-02-07T20:10:59] Unknown: <photos/photo_2346@07-02-2022_20-10-59.jpg>
[2022-02-07T20:11:02] Unknown: That one in particular, yes. Just talking in general. Buy good, buy once and keep your sanity
[2022-02-07T20:11:11] Unknown: No pricing included though 🤔😆
[2022-02-07T20:11:17] rosheee: https://firduo.com/collections/hgltech-esc
[2022-02-07T20:11:20] Unknown: Nice. I have seen that version before
[2022-02-07T20:11:22] rosheee: look like crapsky

[2022-02-07T20:12:02] Happy Giraffe: Also retarded to have logic board facing the side of case which has to transfer heat, the designer had no clue how thermodynamics work
[2022-02-07T20:12:24] rosheee: https://www.antinnotech.com/collections/brushless-motor-controlleresc/products/ant-innovation-24s-300a-high-voltage-powerful-esc-for-heavy-lift-drone
[2022-02-07T20:13:32] Happy Giraffe: Fuck I will buy 300A capable Kelly to run 120A next, Im so mad at this point
[2022-02-07T20:13:41] Paolo ⁭: I think isn’t it
[2022-02-07T20:14:10] Unknown: There are TONS of drone controllers that are amazing. I used many of them in the past. Not sure how setup would work or if they're efficient in low rpm hub motors. Castle, Kontronik, HobbyWing to name a few....???
[2022-02-07T20:14:31] Happy Giraffe: 100$ china esc better than spintend confirmed
[2022-02-07T20:14:36] Paolo ⁭: Cost less rion 400a
[2022-02-07T20:14:43] Happy Giraffe: KT esc way better with display etc
[2022-02-07T20:15:00] Unknown: KT is Kelly?
[2022-02-07T20:15:01] rosheee: but to make u angry
[2022-02-07T20:15:03] Artem Bulashev: Can you explain ?
[2022-02-07T20:15:16] rosheee: u use single ^^ being single is kinda sad dual works better
[2022-02-07T20:15:25] Happy Giraffe: KT a China esc often found in ebike motor kits
[2022-02-07T20:15:30] Artem Bulashev: Vesc is sine wave and motor heats up less = more power can take the weak motor
[2022-02-07T20:15:32] Happy Giraffe: KT LCD3 (this also sine)
[2022-02-07T20:15:44] rosheee: i bought that XD!!
[2022-02-07T20:15:47] Unknown: Ahh gotcha. I'm a sucker for a nice diaplay
[2022-02-07T20:15:59] Happy Giraffe: Exactly, it's better
[2022-02-07T20:16:07] rosheee: still waiting
[2022-02-07T20:16:16] rosheee: but i am happy with the dual spintend
[2022-02-07T20:16:23] Happy Giraffe: 45A version propably whoops ass with Single
[2022-02-07T20:16:25] rosheee: if it brakes down with 17S tgeb ha
[2022-02-07T20:18:12] Artem Bulashev: Without regen it won’t and I caused over voltage on mine and no issue
[2022-02-07T20:18:22] Artem Bulashev: Bmw charging was disabled
[2022-02-07T20:18:33] Artem Bulashev: So vesc could not deal with regen
[2022-02-07T20:18:38] Artem Bulashev: And went to over charge
[2022-02-07T20:18:49] Artem Bulashev: Many times before I understood what is happening, No issues
[2022-02-07T20:18:50] rosheee: i hate regen since m365
[2022-02-07T20:19:39] Artem Bulashev: I love it with my scroll throttle that has regen 50->0%
[2022-02-07T20:19:49] Artem Bulashev: And throttle 50->100%
[2022-02-07T20:21:00] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_2347@07-02-2022_20-21-00.jpg>
[2022-02-07T20:21:33] Happy Giraffe: Poor contact
[2022-02-07T20:24:31] Happy Giraffe: Mosfets are not even at same level...
[2022-02-07T20:27:13] Unknown: Ohh, that what happens with JK BMS when charging is disabled? The Regen gets transferred direct to controller fets = heat and high voltage spikes??
[2022-02-07T20:27:52] Artem Bulashev: Nothing
[2022-02-07T20:28:04] Artem Bulashev: It just dpes nothing and doesn’t let battery charging
[2022-02-07T20:28:21] Artem Bulashev: Fets open for charging but opposite flow is stopped right away
[2022-02-07T20:28:34] Artem Bulashev: So all voltage accumulates in VESC
[2022-02-07T20:28:43] Mirono escooters: Ah spintend Quality
[2022-02-07T20:28:46] Unknown: Ahhh.. understood. Super good to know
[2022-02-07T20:28:50] Artem Bulashev: Ubox dual red had no problemos
[2022-02-07T20:29:01] Artem Bulashev: Yeah it works so well but I was sooooo confused
[2022-02-07T20:29:10] Artem Bulashev: I see over voltage than under voltage
[2022-02-07T20:29:14] Unknown: Do you leave "balance" tab on or off while riding? Off I assume
[2022-02-07T20:29:21] Artem Bulashev: And than short circuited protection
[2022-02-07T20:29:29] Artem Bulashev: I leave it on
[2022-02-07T20:29:31] Unknown: Mhmm. Makes sense
[2022-02-07T20:29:46] Artem Bulashev: But I opt saw it balance once haha new cells Samsung
[2022-02-07T20:30:12] Unknown: Oh really? With voltage constantly dynamic/changing/sagging while riding wouldn't it gets confused lol?
[2022-02-07T20:30:36] Unknown: That's awesome. Hopefully same for mine
[2022-02-07T20:31:09] Artem Bulashev: Voltage should not sag inequality to begin with
[2022-02-07T20:31:12] Artem Bulashev: Mine doesn’t
[2022-02-07T20:31:43] Artem Bulashev: Even under 60a for 8p 35e it is not much though I suppose, could take a lot more
[2022-02-07T20:31:57] Unknown: Wow... I thought the p groups would sag slightly different... I mean different enough to trigger the balance mv threshold... But if not then your cells are amazing balanced and same IR
[2022-02-07T20:32:44] Happy Giraffe: And this obviously makes different thermal pad mounting pressure...
[2022-02-07T20:32:56] Unknown: ....So I guess with excellent cells it wouldn't make a difference. Hopefully my cells are as excellent 🤞
[2022-02-07T20:33:14] Happy Giraffe: Easy
[2022-02-07T20:33:22] rosheee: XD
[2022-02-07T20:33:37] Unknown: 😯
[2022-02-07T20:34:24] Happy Giraffe: And If amd cooler isnt enough I have some big boy noctua ready😂😂😂😂
[2022-02-07T20:34:54] rosheee: why not make loop with alphacool eisbaer?
[2022-02-07T20:35:19] rosheee: small + pump + reservoir in 1
[2022-02-07T20:36:00] Happy Giraffe: Haha, LN2 is only way to cool this vesc
[2022-02-07T20:36:08] Happy Giraffe: Nothing else can go through resin
[2022-02-07T20:36:55] rosheee: liquid helium

[2022-02-07T20:38:48] Martin Kaktits: ++
[2022-02-07T20:38:59] rosheee: or the wind of changes
[2022-02-07T20:39:10] Unknown: Haha, that was good
[2022-02-07T20:39:28] rosheee: omg what a flame day
[2022-02-07T20:39:55] rosheee: flamed @ magura that they should produce an official kit for changing the hose instead of writing me "sadly"
[2022-02-07T20:40:15] rosheee: then crapsky about why the shit burned again
[2022-02-07T20:40:35] Unknown: Elvedes hydro kit 2 bro. Magura doesn't"recommend" switching sides LoL
[2022-02-07T20:41:01] Unknown: Or M6 banjo and M6 banjo screw. That's really all that's needed from the kit
[2022-02-07T20:41:06] rosheee: official from magura
[2022-02-07T20:41:06] rosheee: Unfortunately, we do not have a kit for this and unfortunately cannot recommend such a conversion.
[2022-02-07T20:41:13] Unknown: So ends up being a $50 banjo 🙄
[2022-02-07T20:41:17] rosheee: LOL
[2022-02-07T20:41:20] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-07T20:41:22] Unknown: Yup, that's them
[2022-02-07T20:41:48] Unknown: Why not just make the damn calipers universal!
[2022-02-07T20:42:01] Unknown: Such a pain
[2022-02-07T20:42:12] rosheee: so just to get it like 100%
[2022-02-07T20:42:26] rosheee: i can buY ANY M6 BANJO AND BANJO SCREW?
[2022-02-07T20:42:33] rosheee: and m5 bleeding screrw
[2022-02-07T20:42:37] Unknown: Pretty sure the only part in the elvedes kit that's needed is the M6 banjo and M6 banjo screw
[2022-02-07T20:42:51] Unknown: M5 bleed screw can be any m5x10mm or shorter
[2022-02-07T20:42:59] Unknown: And M5 brass/copper washer
[2022-02-07T20:43:10] rosheee: lol
[2022-02-07T20:43:25] rosheee: i was looking whole aliexpress through to get one looking the same
[2022-02-07T20:43:38] Unknown: But then you need to figure out how to bleed from the M5 side. There are bleed adapters that have m5 threads
[2022-02-07T20:43:43] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-07T20:43:49] Unknown: I couldn't find one either
[2022-02-07T20:43:54] rosheee: that's no problem
[2022-02-07T20:44:16] Unknown: Which is why guys spend 50 bucks for that hydro kit.. for a god damn 50 cent piece
[2022-02-07T20:44:24] Unknown: 👍

[2022-02-07T20:45:27] Happy Giraffe: We will see soon
[2022-02-07T20:45:37] Unknown: But barb also needs to fit the brake line...

[2022-02-07T20:46:07] rosheee: read that 4x
[2022-02-07T20:46:16] Happy Giraffe: This is best I can humanly do, even fucking solder joint is cooled
[2022-02-07T20:47:06] Unknown: Jagwire quick disconnect kits also work but require jagwire lines to fit their barb
[2022-02-07T20:47:34] rosheee: now it's undercooled
[2022-02-07T20:47:53] rosheee: with jagwire kit i can fit it outside..just get their stuff..
[2022-02-07T20:48:21] Happy Giraffe: Now with thicker thermal pad the mounting pressure will be insane
[2022-02-07T20:48:40] rosheee: and u have bottom plate out of NOT PLASTIC?
[2022-02-07T20:49:03] Happy Giraffe: I bolt into xiaomi frame
[2022-02-07T20:49:07] rosheee: ok
[2022-02-07T20:49:07] rosheee: let's go
[2022-02-07T20:49:08] Artem Bulashev: You missed the shunts
[2022-02-07T20:49:20] Happy Giraffe: In 5 montha Im riding ebike
[2022-02-07T20:49:25] Artem Bulashev: You need to cool them they are resistance point
[2022-02-07T20:49:36] Happy Giraffe: That pad is on different piece
[2022-02-07T20:49:45] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok
[2022-02-07T20:50:04] Happy Giraffe: I left stock pad for them as it made good enough contact
[2022-02-07T20:50:16] Paolo ⁭: And…
[2022-02-07T20:50:26] Happy Giraffe: But still not taking pressure away from others
[2022-02-07T20:50:34] Artem Bulashev: Try it without original case :-)
[2022-02-07T20:50:44] Happy Giraffe: Too much work
[2022-02-07T20:50:51] Happy Giraffe: This is my last effort
[2022-02-07T20:51:00] Paolo ⁭: Translation: Centro Scambi Internazionale Milano Gateway Poste Italiane, Problems reported during the verification for the release of the shipment due to incomplete documentation. The recipient will be contacted
[2022-02-07T20:52:47] rosheee: so i buy the kit for magura or the kit for hope?
[2022-02-07T20:53:22] Gigolo Joe: Gg wp
[2022-02-07T20:54:32] Unknown: Sorry, kit for hope
[2022-02-07T20:54:41] rosheee: perfect and that is it
[2022-02-07T20:54:52] Unknown: And yea, I've read it a few times lol. Very... Detailed
[2022-02-07T20:54:59] rosheee: buy 1 for front 1 for rear -> type: HOPE and i can STFU and thank you ❤️?
[2022-02-07T20:59:29] Unknown: I believe quick disconnects would be 1 for front and 1 for rear, yes. But like I said, you need the jagwire pro hydro lines to fit their banjo barb. For 10+ I would need 2X 3m sections and they're expensive. Basically the 2 quick disconnects and 2 lines would well over 100 bucks .. probably more like 125 or so... For me anyways. That's the downside for sure. Maybe you can make due with 1 3m line?
[2022-02-07T21:00:36] rosheee: more expensive but maybe "safer"
[2022-02-07T21:00:42] Unknown: Who you kiddin.. you'll never STFU 🤣
[2022-02-07T21:00:56] Unknown: It would be a great setup
[2022-02-07T21:01:35] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-07T21:06:45] Happy Giraffe: Thermal paste even between the two case parts
[2022-02-07T21:07:05] Happy Giraffe: Because john has his head upside down as we have seen
[2022-02-07T21:07:22] Paolo ⁭: Weld it

[2022-02-07T22:10:36] Paolo ⁭: Self detection please
[2022-02-07T22:10:41] Paolo ⁭: Go to foc page
[2022-02-07T22:10:54] Paolo ⁭: And try manual detection
[2022-02-07T22:10:58] rosheee: always
[2022-02-07T22:11:07] rosheee: like i told u the whole menu again manual

[2022-02-07T22:19:09] Happy Giraffe: Your tips made my motor not move at all😂😘
[2022-02-07T22:21:50] Unknown: Guys, does new VESC software use MTPA? I know Nucular does but for non-IPM (internal permanent magnet) motors, such as ours, mine runs more powerful when MTPA is off by adjusting flux linkage to zero.
[2022-02-07T22:22:48] Unknown: <photos/photo_2354@07-02-2022_22-22-48.jpg>
[2022-02-07T22:25:00] rosheee: yes
[2022-02-07T22:25:02] Unknown: MTPA is usually meant for IPM motors to help them run smoother and more efficient. MTPA ON, my hub motor still runs super smooth and efficient but turning off MTPA (flux linkage to zero) increases power and punch. Not sure if new VESC software has MTPA on by default
[2022-02-07T22:25:22] rosheee: i get message that i should enable it
[2022-02-07T22:25:44] Unknown: Hmm... I wonder. Ask Koxx. He knows about it
[2022-02-07T22:26:34] Unknown: Nucular recommend trying both ways, on and off to see what works better. E bike guys were complaining they could no longer wheelie with new MTPA software but turning it off they're happy again flipping over
[2022-02-07T22:30:00] rosheee: ok
[2022-02-07T22:30:03] Unknown: <photos/photo_2355@07-02-2022_22-30-03.jpg>
[2022-02-07T22:30:05] rosheee: so i enable it i show u settings
[2022-02-07T22:31:03] rosheee: <photos/photo_2356@07-02-2022_22-31-03.jpg>
[2022-02-07T22:31:08] rosheee: activate this and here
[2022-02-07T22:31:11] Unknown: I don't know much about the details... But do know it's for IPM motors in particular and many have reported less power on non-IPM motors when it's on... Which was my experience as well.
[2022-02-07T22:31:53] Unknown: Gotcha. Maybe just try with and without and see what the difference is. VESC may have different algorithm, so maybe not as big of a difference on/off as Nuc. Not sure
[2022-02-07T22:35:02] rosheee: This parameter will enable the Maximum Torque Per Amp (MTPA) algorithm that injects a negative d axis current to follow the optimum torque trajectory. This is specially valuable on Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) motors because they have large saliency and can yield a substantial torque increase. The available modes are: Disabled This disables the MTPA algorithm. IQ Target The D-axis current is based on the set Q-axis current. This makes the target value less noisy, but relies on the current controller keeping keeping the Q-axis current close to the set value. This mode does not work well with duty cycle control. IQ Measured The D-axis current is based on the measured Q-axis current. The commanded D-axis current will be more affected by noise, but it does not rely on the Q-axis current controller to keep the current at the set value. Note: Only enable this feature if you know very well what you are doing. IPM motors are not popular and injecting negative id current can increase the motor speed. If id current suddenly collapses (under a fault condition for example) the DC Bus voltage can increase well beyond the powerstage rating causing a fire and maximum braking power at the motor shaft.

[2022-02-07T22:40:31] rosheee: ^^
[2022-02-07T22:53:13] rosheee: any other tipps? :_D
[2022-02-07T23:02:06] Unknown: 🤓
[2022-02-07T23:04:10] Unknown: Maybe @Happy_Giraffe is having heat issues from MTPA???? I mean, worth a shot to disable and see what happens. Not likely but it could be a strange interaction. So yea, they add these features and not really explain to anyone what the hell they are. Nuc came right out and said, this is geared for IPM motors but can work on non-IPM motors. Try both and pick your poison.
[2022-02-07T23:05:22] Happy Giraffe: I havent studied this, does it apply to BLDC motors running FOC?
[2022-02-07T23:06:10] Unknown: I imagine it does. Just check to see if it's turned on in your VESC tool
[2022-02-07T23:06:42] Unknown: Maybe that negative d axis current is causing heat issues
[2022-02-07T23:07:25] Unknown: Maybe those runn ubox without heat issues are using older non-mtpa firmware? I don't know... I'm just speculating. Worth looking into

[2022-02-07T23:10:29] rosheee: and field weak. os also set to 0
[2022-02-07T23:10:33] Unknown: Just kidding. Wanted to point that out tho, MTPA is meant for IPM motors. I didn't know about it until developer at Nuc mentioned turning it off
[2022-02-07T23:10:47] Unknown: 👍
[2022-02-07T23:11:58] Happy Giraffe: I will go test thermal pad mod in 10mins

[2022-02-07T23:57:03] rosheee: then give less ramp time
[2022-02-07T23:57:09] rosheee: like default
[2022-02-08T00:02:29] Happy Giraffe: 130A works nice also
[2022-02-08T00:02:36] rosheee: +10cm
[2022-02-08T00:02:45] Happy Giraffe: 67°c because wind and uphill
[2022-02-08T00:02:53] rosheee: REMEMBER
[2022-02-08T00:02:55] rosheee: it is winter

[2022-02-08T00:03:17] rosheee: congraz!
[2022-02-08T00:03:28] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but single vesc has no cooling
[2022-02-08T00:03:31] Happy Giraffe: Closed system
[2022-02-08T00:03:42] rosheee: has duallvesc cooling?
[2022-02-08T00:03:46] Happy Giraffe: Next 50/140
[2022-02-08T00:03:54] Happy Giraffe: It has better design
[2022-02-08T00:03:58] rosheee: TEST
[2022-02-08T00:04:00] rosheee: DON'T ANSWER
[2022-02-08T00:04:01] rosheee: TEST
[2022-02-08T00:04:08] rosheee: LOL
[2022-02-08T00:04:12] rosheee: u have beefy firmware?
[2022-02-08T00:04:14] rosheee: no limits ^^?
[2022-02-08T00:04:27] rosheee: normally 135A motor max
[2022-02-08T00:11:55] Unknown: Good point. Cold air has dramatic effects. Mostly on external hardware. Deck mounted controller is still enclosed inside so cool to hot air won't have as much as an affect as say the motors
[2022-02-08T00:19:35] Happy Giraffe: 150A phase hahaha
[2022-02-08T00:22:35] Paolo ⁭: I got kelly 7230
[2022-02-08T00:23:29] Happy Giraffe: Never had so much torque from single motor, 150A in uphill is insane
[2022-02-08T00:23:40] Happy Giraffe: It just goes on and on
[2022-02-08T00:24:20] Happy Giraffe: And its a fkin high kv number, now 50/140A performs better than 45/110A before
[2022-02-08T00:24:39] Unknown: 👏 nice man. So the thermal pads are doing something?
[2022-02-08T00:24:59] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, even wrong side of fet...

[2022-02-08T00:40:05] Paolo ⁭: Impossible, this is 2000w only, mine 4500
[2022-02-08T00:40:09] Unknown: But our standard wall plugs are 100v, so half. Still good enough for around .3C charge rate on new battery
[2022-02-08T00:40:42] Unknown: Would be around 27a at 72v
[2022-02-08T00:41:09] Paolo ⁭: More or less
[2022-02-08T00:41:17] Unknown: So yes, capped at 2000w. But charger is capable of 37a at lower voltages.
[2022-02-08T00:41:27] Unknown: Still plenty for my needs

[2022-02-08T00:45:28] Paolo ⁭: :/
[2022-02-08T00:46:01] Happy Giraffe: I forgot to test motor side after all the torture😭
[2022-02-08T00:46:18] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow will ride 150A again to see
[2022-02-08T00:46:23] Unknown: Wish I could bro
[2022-02-08T00:46:30] Unknown: Motor temp you mean?
[2022-02-08T00:46:45] Paolo ⁭: 😒
[2022-02-08T00:46:45] Happy Giraffe: Side only, I have no idea what happens inside
[2022-02-08T00:46:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I Guess yes by hand
[2022-02-08T00:47:08] Happy Giraffe: Can be 30°c side 100°c inside
[2022-02-08T00:47:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nah
[2022-02-08T00:47:35] Happy Giraffe: Need sensor, but hand gives some comparison to previous hand test
[2022-02-08T00:47:58] Paolo ⁭: Do holes like me and you can measure internal temp
[2022-02-08T00:48:04] Happy Giraffe: Dont start to copy Spintend and their thermodynamics😂
[2022-02-08T00:48:09] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2022-02-08T00:48:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Engine made for more power basically than you run it
[2022-02-08T00:48:20] Happy Giraffe: Here every other day rain
[2022-02-08T00:48:50] Happy Giraffe: 1200w and 2800w with 13s is enough 150A phase😂
[2022-02-08T00:49:05] Happy Giraffe: Would want ferrofluid for more
[2022-02-08T00:49:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you open ,change Bearings as well
[2022-02-08T00:49:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also i could send u some fluid
[2022-02-08T00:49:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Have open bottles
[2022-02-08T00:50:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also grintech cooler ring would fit on this
[2022-02-08T00:51:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: After fluid you will feel more heat outside
[2022-02-08T00:51:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also this engine is not totally covered by rubber that way like small ones
[2022-02-08T00:52:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have heatsensor in the awd and , reasonless
[2022-02-08T00:52:09] Happy Giraffe: I only ride until this summer, I can sell you my blade tho😉
[2022-02-08T00:52:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How hard i try i could not even stress it
[2022-02-08T00:52:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well
[2022-02-08T00:52:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just dont forget it
[2022-02-08T00:52:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz i will😂
[2022-02-08T00:53:01] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-08T00:54:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But you know me ,i will take it probably ,like lot other stuff🤣
[2022-02-08T00:54:16] Happy Giraffe: Then 1500w Mxus with ferrofluid low Kv and stuff🌚
[2022-02-08T00:55:48] Happy Giraffe: I can also send you the thermal pad in 4€ letter
[2022-02-08T00:56:09] Happy Giraffe: Or maybe you want to try different brand
[2022-02-08T00:56:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Will see how this performs
[2022-02-08T00:57:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Will check tomorrow and before summer for sure if i dont change them now
[2022-02-08T00:57:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But its not mine
[2022-02-08T00:58:48] Happy Giraffe: I think when we open the vesc first time for solder ball bukkake cleaning, it compromises the stock pads (or the stock pads plain suck)
[2022-02-08T01:13:03] Artem Bulashev: Glad it worked well enough for sure
[2022-02-08T01:15:48] Happy Giraffe: Yes, now its usable
[2022-02-08T01:16:56] Happy Giraffe: Just a small video, was nice to see how slow it went up this time and how fast it comes down
[2022-02-08T01:24:52] rosheee: U have ebrake?
[2022-02-08T01:32:15] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2022-02-08T01:33:23] Happy Giraffe: I think in this run it was wind against me and I stood up as much as I could to increase the air resistance to stress it
[2022-02-08T01:34:56] rosheee: Just aksing myself why the duty doesnt go more/faster to like 95 and amps higher.
[2022-02-08T01:35:56] rosheee: Consumption goes up, temp, amps a bit, duty not at all
[2022-02-08T01:37:24] rosheee: U pushed throttle 100%, right? Like it is speed throttle not current
[2022-02-08T01:39:05] Happy Giraffe: Mine is current throttle
[2022-02-08T01:39:19] Happy Giraffe: Usually maxed out
[2022-02-08T01:39:55] rosheee: I have current throttle as well but it reacts total different
[2022-02-08T01:41:32] Happy Giraffe: Havent tried that (speed throttle)
[2022-02-08T01:43:07] rosheee: Ok Idk maybe it acts different (doesnt makes sense but could be) I set @inputsetting (duty cycle) to read volts 0-50-100 but throttle mode current Idk
[2022-02-08T01:43:50] rosheee: At least it works for you ^___^ And i gonna copy it #meow
[2022-02-08T01:57:04] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-08T01:57:25] rosheee: But uf duty should go to 95% earlier
[2022-02-08T01:57:37] rosheee: Amso current should go higher
[2022-02-08T02:01:31] Happy Giraffe: It does
[2022-02-08T02:12:33] Happy Giraffe: 50kmh 90% duty, max speed on flat is 60-61kmh
[2022-02-08T10:45:08] Paolo ⁭: Your motor is for 16s :(
[2022-02-08T10:45:14] rosheee: ^^
[2022-02-08T10:45:16] rosheee: and he use 48V
[2022-02-08T10:45:21] rosheee: that was my last thoguht this night
[2022-02-08T10:45:25] rosheee: but didn't say it
[2022-02-08T10:45:34] Paolo ⁭: And says no torque 🥲
[2022-02-08T10:45:59] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-08T10:47:13] rosheee: it's like when u have small dick and big pussy
[2022-02-08T10:47:17] rosheee: no penetration motor is sad
[2022-02-08T10:47:21] rosheee: battery tries best
[2022-02-08T10:47:25] rosheee: but need surgery
[2022-02-08T10:47:34] rosheee: #IQ300OFTHEDAY
[2022-02-08T10:48:01] Paolo ⁭: Sad story
[2022-02-08T10:48:11] Paolo ⁭: 😢
[2022-02-08T10:49:05] rosheee: the try to penetrate is there (AMPS) but the size not (volt)
[2022-02-08T10:49:23] rosheee: there u see it once again even if they deny it..volt matters
[2022-02-08T10:53:50] Face de Pin Sucé: WTF
[2022-02-08T10:55:29] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-08T11:11:23] Happy Giraffe: Now there is🌚
[2022-02-08T11:12:40] Happy Giraffe: Next ebike will be overvolted lov kv 48v motor I use with 16s
[2022-02-08T11:19:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2022-02-08T11:23:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: good !
[2022-02-08T11:24:00] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-08T12:00:02] rosheee: Big happy D
[2022-02-08T12:07:57] Happy Giraffe: Exactly, cant wait to feel the torque of 7/9 winding
[2022-02-08T15:30:17] Paolo ⁭: Stranger things guys, flipsky has removed 75100 in all their official channel, including official website and AliExpress
[2022-02-08T15:33:19] Mirono escooters: Out of stock
[2022-02-08T15:38:23] rosheee: Shit ass product
[2022-02-08T15:38:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, a friend told me yesterday
[2022-02-08T15:38:44] Face de Pin Sucé: It's very strange
[2022-02-08T15:39:45] Mirono escooters: Lmao no it's not
[2022-02-08T15:40:05] Mirono escooters: They told me they we're out of stock and with chinese new year have to restock for a while
[2022-02-08T15:40:21] Mirono escooters: Anyone here got a 4.2 to sell?
[2022-02-08T15:45:55] Luis Magalhaes: what cable do you guys use for hall sensors ?
[2022-02-08T15:47:35] Face de Pin Sucé: I use cable that I take on old motors 😂
[2022-02-08T15:47:49] Face de Pin Sucé: You received your package ?
[2022-02-08T15:47:59] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-02-08T15:48:18] Luis Magalhaes: not yet but is already in portugal but in lisbon
[2022-02-08T15:48:31] Luis Magalhaes: tomorrow should be here
[2022-02-08T15:48:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha yeaaah
[2022-02-08T15:49:24] Luis Magalhaes: 😁
[2022-02-08T15:49:43] Luis Magalhaes: so its time to start mounting halls lolol
[2022-02-08T15:51:04] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb should this be a good option for phase?
[2022-02-08T15:51:05] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_2366@08-02-2022_15-51-05.jpg>
[2022-02-08T15:51:05] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_2367@08-02-2022_15-51-05.jpg>
[2022-02-08T15:51:11] Luis Magalhaes: its silicon
[2022-02-08T15:51:24] Luis Magalhaes: a friend of mine is using this
[2022-02-08T15:52:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Try PTFE 10AWG or 9AWG if you're good 👍
[2022-02-08T15:52:35] rosheee: <photos/photo_2368@08-02-2022_15-52-35.jpg>
[2022-02-08T15:52:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Silicon, big waste of place
[2022-02-08T15:53:14] Face de Pin Sucé: But, if you have those easily, it's okay
[2022-02-08T15:54:06] Luis Magalhaes: ok thanks for the advice 😁
[2022-02-08T15:55:02] Luis Magalhaes: and will it pass on my motors easy ? 🤣🤣
[2022-02-08T15:55:52] Mirono escooters: Is this 75100? No it isnt
[2022-02-08T15:56:07] Mirono escooters: 75100 is good and been proven reliable. Stop shitting for no reason :)
[2022-02-08T15:56:28] rosheee: Mimimi
[2022-02-08T15:56:30] Mirono escooters: Cheaper then spintend with cooling problems and bad thermal Pads :))
[2022-02-08T15:56:31] rosheee: It is fapsky
[2022-02-08T15:56:45] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-08T15:56:48] Mirono escooters: People buy what they buy
[2022-02-08T15:58:39] Paolo ⁭: If out of stock they will put as out of stock, but they be deleted completely
[2022-02-08T15:58:49] Mirono escooters: Weird
[2022-02-08T15:59:51] Mirono escooters: Tried asking them?
[2022-02-08T16:36:52] Unknown: I've read something about them removing it from their store as they would make a new model but weird that they removed all info then
[2022-02-08T16:37:43] Unknown: SMD fuse I need has 125VAC but 32VDC rating? I can't find suitable 42VDC anywhere :( Is it useable?
[2022-02-08T16:53:43] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2022-02-08T16:54:28] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_2369@08-02-2022_16-54-28.jpg>
[2022-02-08T17:00:03] Paolo ⁭: Where
[2022-02-08T17:00:55] Mirono escooters: Lol it's been out. For like 5 months
[2022-02-08T17:01:59] Happy Giraffe: Something else also changed in my vesc after thermal pad change, I get way more torque now from 45/135Amps
[2022-02-08T17:02:28] Happy Giraffe: Its actually so much fun to ride now, the motor goes brrrr
[2022-02-08T17:06:07] Unknown: Reddit i think not sure, someone was asking why it was gone from the store but still available on ali etc, and someone replied they removed it from their store because they'll be making a newer version, no clue if true or not
[2022-02-08T17:15:29] Paolo ⁭: Let me ask
[2022-02-08T17:28:44] rosheee: Video or it didnt happen
[2022-02-08T17:29:19] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-08T17:32:49] Happy Giraffe: I keep my sextapes for myself
[2022-02-08T17:58:35] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-08T20:47:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha I don't remember the hole on Wolf motors
[2022-02-08T20:55:55] Luis Magalhaes: Mission impossible 😂
[2022-02-08T22:07:01] Artem Bulashev: That’s what mine does :)
[2022-02-08T22:07:22] Artem Bulashev: Try to re configure motor with higher amp in the gui during configuration
[2022-02-08T22:08:07] Artem Bulashev: It does it if I floor it on low speed
[2022-02-08T22:08:25] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2022-02-08T22:08:36] Happy Giraffe: I meant it goes fast but also small brrrr noise on first 1-3kmh
[2022-02-08T22:08:41] Happy Giraffe: Maybe thats just foc
[2022-02-08T22:08:52] Happy Giraffe: Hahaghaa
[2022-02-08T22:09:41] Artem Bulashev: What the fuck :))
[2022-02-08T22:09:46] Artem Bulashev: Not like that lol
[2022-02-08T22:10:31] Artem Bulashev: Mine does confit fine but May jerks a bit few times during if I apply max throttle - usually around 8-12kmh
[2022-02-08T22:10:34] Happy Giraffe: That is Flipsky
[2022-02-08T22:10:56] Artem Bulashev: That’s seems like something else :)
[2022-02-08T22:10:59] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, mine doesnt do it if I kick 4-5kmh start speed
[2022-02-08T22:11:00] Mirono escooters: Idk how you all do that to flipsky
[2022-02-08T22:11:24] rosheee: frequency lower or higher
[2022-02-08T22:11:28] Artem Bulashev: That’s what I though first but than realised it is closer to 8k h
[2022-02-08T22:11:44] rosheee: I PLUGED IT IN STARTED DETECT FOC AND BABMMAMBA IT IS RECORDED
[2022-02-08T22:12:06] Artem Bulashev: May be solder ball between phases
[2022-02-08T22:12:13] Artem Bulashev: Shorts it out and jumps
[2022-02-08T22:12:24] rosheee: anyway it's history
[2022-02-08T22:12:27] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-02-08T22:12:47] Happy Giraffe: Luckily mine is 2-3
[2022-02-08T22:12:49] Artem Bulashev: I think what we experience is motor saturation
[2022-02-08T22:12:59] rosheee: 0.1kmh and it goes
[2022-02-08T22:13:03] Happy Giraffe: Hhahahhaaha
[2022-02-08T22:13:07] rosheee: change frequency
[2022-02-08T22:13:13] rosheee: PID
[2022-02-08T22:13:15] Artem Bulashev: Which setting it would be ?
[2022-02-08T22:13:20] Artem Bulashev: Ok I will play with it
[2022-02-08T22:13:23] Artem Bulashev: Thanks
[2022-02-08T22:13:24] rosheee: play with it
[2022-02-08T22:13:33] rosheee: i played nobody wanna play with what i played
[2022-02-08T22:13:40] rosheee: so i play alone
[2022-02-08T22:13:45] rosheee: then this comes
[2022-02-08T22:13:45] Artem Bulashev: Because it really disturbs acceleration
[2022-02-08T22:13:57] rosheee: i have b00st from 0
[2022-02-08T22:13:58] rosheee: 0 .1.
[2022-02-08T22:14:12] rosheee: now ppl think "blalblblblaabl"*
[2022-02-08T22:14:24] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-08T22:14:32] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, when we talk about settings it must be exact setting name or screenshot even better
[2022-02-08T22:14:42] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise people are just confused
[2022-02-08T22:15:14] rosheee: then we go next level
[2022-02-08T22:15:25] rosheee: ^^ send video from disturbing part
[2022-02-08T22:15:36] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-08T22:16:20] Happy Giraffe: But it's no problem I just kick it like xiaomi
[2022-02-08T22:16:29] Happy Giraffe: Then goes off nice and smooth
[2022-02-08T22:16:37] rosheee: vedder said "smooth is from 0.."
[2022-02-08T22:17:05] Happy Giraffe: Link to his words?
[2022-02-08T22:17:21] rosheee: here u have screenshot

[2022-02-09T09:04:43] rosheee: ordered the brake jasgwire kit from aliexpress
[2022-02-09T09:05:10] rosheee: 2x kit = 28$ / 2x hydraulic ^^' = 60$
[2022-02-09T09:59:41] Cass: 😳 Links pls 🙃
[2022-02-09T10:11:45] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-09T10:16:27] Cass: by the way spintend discount
[2022-02-09T10:24:00] Happy Giraffe: High quality = Engineer has no idea about thermodynamics
[2022-02-09T10:24:02] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-09T10:24:56] Happy Giraffe: Btw anyone with single ubox you want to actually bolt it down upside down to actually cool the case
[2022-02-09T10:26:04] Cass: good to know, want to order it in 1-2 week
[2022-02-09T10:26:18] Happy Giraffe: Bolting the bottom to the scooter frame doesnt cool anything except maybe the 2w ARM chip😂
[2022-02-09T10:26:31] Happy Giraffe: Yes the topside is against mosfets
[2022-02-09T10:26:47] Happy Giraffe: And case splits in half so only topside heats while bottom ice cold
[2022-02-09T10:27:10] Cass: nice design
[2022-02-09T10:27:43] Happy Giraffe: Remember to open it up and clean solder balls, especially from power board side. You might want to get also spare thermal pads like Thermal Grizzly Minus pad 12x2cm 1mm
[2022-02-09T10:28:29] Happy Giraffe: Opening the vesc for cleaning might compromise the stock pads, mounting it in a box outside so the top part of case gets airflow will be best for cooling
[2022-02-09T10:29:53] Happy Giraffe: Lastly ordering 2x ADC adapters also recommended as they tend to not work sometimes (and gluing the switch to 5v position if you use that as even 0.1mm travel is enough to make it not work)😅
[2022-02-09T10:37:07] Cass: With those prices still full with problems? goddamnit
[2022-02-09T10:38:13] Happy Giraffe: Yes, there are many things to think so you dont have to warranty it and wait extra month for them to repair it like mine😂
[2022-02-09T10:39:02] Happy Giraffe: They even forgot screws from my repaired unit so had to diy them, so prepare for some work😂

[2022-02-09T15:05:00] Unknown: Sweet. I have some QS8's coming today/tomorrow as well. They're... Big lol
[2022-02-09T15:06:14] Unknown: Good price. Would love to see how that kit works out with Magura. Your the test rabbit 🐰 LoL You got the hope kit right?
[2022-02-09T15:10:12] Unknown: Have AS150 as well, original plan was 8awg with AS150 but only accepts 8awg wire max. QS8 is up to 6awg so I figure bigger is always better 🤪... if bigger wires fit, why not right. AS150 is nice because positive and negative are separate, so easier to manuver that single housing but whatevs
[2022-02-09T15:11:26] Unknown: Vsett you say? What's the plan for those forks?
[2022-02-09T15:25:56] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-02-09T15:26:36] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-02-09T17:03:38] Unknown: Damn, yea those are some monster connectors. Definitely going to use those over the as150s for the 6awg option. Love the anti spark only, gotta protect my beautiful controllers LoL. My xt90 anti spark (currently on my controllers/stock battery) will need to be changed out as well. I read that xt90s don't like high voltage such as 20s. Is that correct?
[2022-02-09T17:04:00] Unknown: So using Vsett motor??
[2022-02-09T17:24:36] Gigolo Joe: No problem in going over 70
[2022-02-09T17:25:38] Paolo ⁭: not problem yes, but temperature sensor in spintend isnt accurate, because it dont touching directly mosfet. then you need consider this
[2022-02-09T17:26:02] Paolo ⁭: spintend sensor rear just thermal pad temp

[2022-02-09T21:40:25] Martin Kaktits: its at temps your motor shouldnt be anyway, but its close

[2022-02-10T14:15:58] Mirono escooters: Whot
[2022-02-10T14:17:24] rosheee: Copycats everywhere
[2022-02-10T14:17:58] Mirono escooters: The maximum current of the firmware is defined as 120amps and the maximum voltage is 120V. This is determined by the range of the shunt and voltage dividing resistance, not MOSFETs.
[2022-02-10T14:18:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think flipsky never designed a single vesc... just clone & sell
[2022-02-10T14:18:11] Mirono escooters: They did change some layouts no?
[2022-02-10T14:18:29] Mirono escooters: They bought his vesc but it was messy pcb apperantly Idk 25$ Parts. Lol
[2022-02-10T14:18:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what's interesting isnthe guy also talk about some design flaws (flipsky copied and didn't solve of course)
[2022-02-10T14:23:55] Paolo ⁭: All flipsky design are copy
[2022-02-10T14:49:11] Happy Giraffe: How fucking shameful

[2022-02-10T16:20:50] Gigolo Joe: Hey, I'm having this weird problem. In air the wheel kinda stuttering as soon as i go over 50A field weakening. It rides fine, problem is in freewheeling. Any clue what can it be? 110A phase 60A battery
[2022-02-10T16:46:27] Happy Giraffe: I had similar, doesnt feel unnatural when riding
[2022-02-10T16:46:54] Happy Giraffe: Depending on your setup might not be worth it to use FW under 80Amp battery currents anyway
[2022-02-10T17:27:34] Gigolo Joe: Can you explain why?
[2022-02-10T17:28:44] Gigolo Joe: As the battery can output more than 60A
[2022-02-10T18:13:11] Happy Giraffe: You arrive at voltage limit at some point and after that air resistance is so huge the field weakening needs fuckton of current
[2022-02-10T18:13:48] Happy Giraffe: In my testing 50A batt current vs 55A field weakening did same topspeed, hitting V limit
[2022-02-10T18:14:37] Happy Giraffe: Thats only my testing but if normally motor pulls 1°/360° and suddenly wants to pull 3° or 5° it will be damn tough against that wind
[2022-02-10T18:37:19] Gigolo Joe: Hmmmm Interesting In my test i do gain speed when going over 50a FW
[2022-02-10T20:26:33] rosheee: Mx throttle from zero inkl max brake in the garage..much traction

[2022-02-10T23:55:42] Unknown: Looks like it. Would also need to know the Magura brake line ID so the banjo barb fits the lines. The jagwire kit requires their brake lines because of this. Can't use Magura/Nutt brake lines with the jagwire banjo

[2022-02-11T15:09:56] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣
[2022-02-11T15:53:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i started with a 2.4" display, but it was too small.
[2022-02-11T15:58:54] Happy Giraffe: Could there be a smart button combo for police mode in display aswell? The vesc profiles are buggy and work only 80% of the time
[2022-02-11T15:59:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: already done. you have some buttons manipulations for speed locking/unlocking
[2022-02-11T16:00:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and changing speed modes
[2022-02-11T16:00:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and motor currents
[2022-02-11T16:00:48] Happy Giraffe: Seems like my ebike price went up at this very moment....
[2022-02-11T16:01:15] Happy Giraffe: Maybe in 4-5 months I can play Doom on it while in traffic lights
[2022-02-11T16:53:46] Unknown: That's is good looking display man. I'm a total sucker for a nice display no question. Excellent work. I haven't checked the GitHub lately but have you been able implement with Kelly? Any plans for Sabvoton? In my opinion, any controller should have a good display option. Since using Nucular I couldn't imagine not having one
[2022-02-11T16:56:30] Unknown: Being able to see telemetry in real time is extremely satisfying (on a good n easy to read display) without having to use a phone. I personally think this is one of the most worthwhile projects out there
[2022-02-11T16:57:22] Happy Giraffe: Aluminium box with heatsink🤔 Or copper heat spreader in between could be safer when using thermal pads
[2022-02-11T16:58:22] Unknown: ... not to mention being able to make setting adjustments direct from the display, no crashing phone app or PC needed. That's another insanely huge benefit
[2022-02-11T17:01:44] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, like switching to default profile manually
[2022-02-11T17:02:00] Unknown: JK BMS. Quite a piece of hardware. Quality seems really nice, soldering is clean and neat. One main P- black wire has a very slight cold solder joint but nothing of concern. Did find one solder "chunk" wedged in between the components (at the red line). Even with nicely made units, always good to open and check for potential catastrophic remnants 🤓

[2022-02-11T17:02:11] Happy Giraffe: Then custom profile from phone app is no problem, but to have option for reliable police mode is must
[2022-02-11T17:02:15] Mirono escooters: Yea good bmses
[2022-02-11T17:02:43] Unknown: Absolutely. Setting adjustments on the fly is unbelievably convenient
[2022-02-11T17:02:47] Mirono escooters: Balancing circuit mosfets look Overkill lol
[2022-02-11T17:03:00] Unknown: Thing is beefy as hell!!
[2022-02-11T17:03:00] Happy Giraffe: Bms porn
[2022-02-11T17:03:31] Mirono escooters: Yea i just saw thé tracés between mosfets. Sick
[2022-02-11T17:13:57] Unknown: I know right. Those copper rods are a really nice idea to transfer current to/from leads to the fets. Seems really well built. Should've gotten the 2a balance version instead of the 1a version. At the time I thought the 2a version was larger, it is not. Same size. 1a balance should be fine with all new Samsung cells 🙏 LoL
[2022-02-11T17:15:11] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse. More then enough
[2022-02-11T17:16:12] Unknown: Got this fancy little display for the BMS as well. Makes turning on (powering up) much easier and nice to have mounted in a discrete location for quick reference
[2022-02-11T17:16:53] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2022-02-11T17:16:54] Unknown: BMS also comes with 2 temp sensors which is another nice touch
[2022-02-11T17:17:11] Mirono escooters: I had daly display until i discovered you cant turn bms output on off..
[2022-02-11T17:17:15] Mirono escooters: "had to ask factory "
[2022-02-11T17:17:20] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2022-02-11T17:21:07] Unknown: Hmm.. interesting. These JK BMS have a strange power up method. No on/off button on the BMS and doesn't come to life when connected. You need to apply 5v above battery voltage to trigger it on. They say to "just connect a charger" but some have had problems with that. So I'm not sure what's going to work and what isn't. An external 5v-7v power source across B- and P- is typically the way people power it on. That little display actually has an ON button, which is basically the whole reason I got it. Imagine having your battery/BMS final wrapped and can't power the damn thing on?! Haha
[2022-02-11T17:22:32] Unknown: Simply connecting a charger should do it... But I wasn't taking any chances. Plus the display is pretty cool anyways
[2022-02-11T17:23:57] Unknown: Wierd thing is.. the display with trigger the BMS ON, but will not shut it OFF. Some say a long press on the button shuts it down but others says it's ON only. So strange these things 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-02-11T17:27:49] Unknown: I think their power up method has to do with safety. B- and P- are common to charge and discharge, toggled in the app. No "C-" wire. Unlike Daly which has a specific BMS for each battery size (voltage) but this BMS is 14s-24s and has to be adjusted accordingly. Once powered up for the first time, all parameters have to be set in the app to match your particular battery.
[2022-02-11T18:35:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i coult try sabvoton, but I need to get my hands on it to test the interface. I'll see if I can find some interface specs. for Kelly, yes, it supports KLS/KLS
[2022-02-11T18:36:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🥰🥰
[2022-02-11T18:38:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_2409@11-02-2022_18-38-00.jpg>

[2022-02-11T18:38:28] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2022-02-11T18:40:16] Unknown: Absolutely awesome man! Keep up the good work 👍
[2022-02-11T18:40:30] Luis Magalhaes: You made it already work with kelly kls?
[2022-02-11T18:40:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but I doubt someone will give one to me considering the price to those beasts 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-02-11T18:40:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2022-02-11T18:40:47] Mirono escooters: i can fund
[2022-02-11T18:40:49] Mirono escooters: Part
[2022-02-11T18:41:00] Unknown: Ergg .. very true
[2022-02-11T18:41:29] Luis Magalhaes: Nice, i will mount kelly on my scooter, after that i will talk to you about this ok? 😁
[2022-02-11T18:42:16] Unknown: I donated to you last summer because I support what you're doing and think it's a very important for our use since most controllers lack a display, let alone a good display.. I'm sure every bit helps 😎
[2022-02-11T18:44:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thanks guys. I've just checked at hardware level everything is ready. for now I must focus on getting the screen ready for production. I'll see how to add more controllers in few months (sabvoton, asi bac ...)
[2022-02-11T18:44:27] Luis Magalhaes: With kelly we dont have any display, the one they sell is shit 😂 good looking but faulty as shit
[2022-02-11T18:44:28] Unknown: Having a good display option for Kelly/VESC opens up many new options for a lot of people. I personally hate hate hate not having a display, maybe I'm spoiled. Kelly with your display is a winning combo man
[2022-02-11T18:44:37] Unknown: Exactly man! Exactly
[2022-02-11T18:44:52] Unknown: Beautiful 🥰
[2022-02-11T18:45:43] Luis Magalhaes: With vesc i used the phone, its not the same as a wired display but it was manegeble, with kelly i can't get info by Bluetooth 😅
[2022-02-11T18:45:53] Luis Magalhaes: Not a good app for that
[2022-02-11T18:46:06] Unknown: @koxx3 let me ask. When we purchase a display from you, does it have to be a specific version for a specific controller?? Or does one general display work with all controllers you have done to this point
[2022-02-11T18:47:00] Unknown: Gotcha .. so even more reason a good display is crucial. It's a game changer in my opinion, once you have an awesome display like Nucular or Koxx, you'll never want to be without again
[2022-02-11T18:47:52] Unknown: If it's a general smartdisplay that works with all controllers (that have been added) I will definitely buy one just to have on hand. I'm a display freak haha
[2022-02-11T19:13:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, it needs to come with a software version according to some soldered jumpers (UART voltage levels, power switch ...), but i could plan for a custom feature allowing you to change it and download any firmware version on it. no issue for that. you'll just have to be sure of what you do. since I don't intent to get copied by people like flipsky, you won't be able to flash a firmware yourself with USB (no USB port & flash is encrypted). but OTA in Wifi works perfectly :D
[2022-02-11T19:15:12] Artem Bulashev: It’s active balancing up to 2amps! It is for huge packs 👍
[2022-02-11T19:15:57] Artem Bulashev: But even with that and built in BT and insane protections it is sooo compact compare to ant BMS and daly smart BMS
[2022-02-11T19:16:41] Artem Bulashev: Also I had hard time trusting Chinese Aliexpresa bmss, until I found JKbms
[2022-02-11T19:18:16] Artem Bulashev: No no reason even for your size battery. 1amp is a lot! All other companies make passive balancing BMS, current is typically like 0.08a 😅😅
[2022-02-11T19:24:41] Artem Bulashev: oTA can be intercepted - that’s how they hacked Xiaomi back in the days
[2022-02-11T19:26:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: HTTPS with certificates ;)
[2022-02-11T19:30:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't care if some random hacker manage to customize/improve the firmware and share like (like xiaomi). i just don't want any chinese company to clone it and sell it.
[2022-02-11T19:31:08] Artem Bulashev: Yeah absolutely
[2022-02-11T19:31:57] Artem Bulashev: I didn’t think Flipsky will waist resources trying to hack - seems like they only copy open designs, based on known history
[2022-02-11T19:32:09] Artem Bulashev: So good point yeah 👍🤝
[2022-02-11T19:32:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: in the plev world, i've been disgusted by companies like flipsky which use open source projects for their own goals (making money), without understand the electronic on it (many open source projects come with 'bugs'), without any support, and without rewarding the creator (and even without mentionning him)
[2022-02-11T19:33:19] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2022-02-11T19:34:56] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I went for - spintend - original self developed design - JKbms - original, self developed design - smartController - original, self developed design 😁😁
[2022-02-11T19:35:35] Unknown: Very nice man, great to know. Thanks for the information
[2022-02-11T19:35:40] Artem Bulashev: Don’t trust those generic BMS when there are 4 different re-labels of it and same for VESC like Flipsky
[2022-02-11T19:36:10] Mirono escooters: Good for my powerwall
[2022-02-11T19:36:15] Unknown: Agreed. Many of the BMS'S on Ali scare the crap out of me. Putting a lot of trust into that thing
[2022-02-11T19:36:54] Unknown: Very much so. Tons of guys use them for solar and/or power walls. The 2a active balancing is something else.
[2022-02-11T19:37:43] Unknown: Oh, right.. You do have a good point there 👍.
[2022-02-11T20:01:34] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_2410@11-02-2022_20-01-34.jpg>
[2022-02-11T20:02:12] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that’s actually very popular use for JKbms
[2022-02-11T20:02:43] Mirono escooters: Yea im gonna consider it
[2022-02-11T20:03:05] Unknown: Yup.. most of the information I found on forums regarding JK BMS was solar sites
[2022-02-11T20:05:13] Unknown: Can balance cells without having to charge. Once cell delta threshold is set, it will balance as soon as cells go out of that voltage threshold difference
[2022-02-11T20:05:43] Unknown: So, makes it really useful for power walls.
[2022-02-11T20:12:36] Mirono escooters: Seems fine to me

[2022-02-11T21:47:27] Paolo ⁭: Gigant😭
[2022-02-11T21:47:46] Artem Bulashev: My motor used to get statter if I set phase amps to 85 or more!
[2022-02-11T21:48:16] Artem Bulashev: Today I updated to 5.3 with latest VESC tool 3.0.1 on mac
[2022-02-11T21:48:27] rosheee: naiis
[2022-02-11T21:48:32] Artem Bulashev: And it is now butter smooth
[2022-02-11T21:48:39] Artem Bulashev: Even 115a phase!!
[2022-02-11T21:48:44] Artem Bulashev: Nutts!!!
[2022-02-11T21:48:49] rosheee: yep
[2022-02-11T21:48:51] Artem Bulashev: I’m shocked
[2022-02-11T21:49:10] Artem Bulashev: I wonder what and how
[2022-02-11T21:49:43] Artem Bulashev: Soooo much power 😄😄😄 Adam ferrofluid here I come! Where do I order your good stuff?
[2022-02-11T21:49:56] rosheee: directly from canada
[2022-02-11T21:50:00] rosheee: grid

[2022-02-11T21:50:28] Artem Bulashev: Thanks
[2022-02-11T21:50:57] Artem Bulashev: I have a guy flying in from Canada in March, just in time for good season
[2022-02-11T21:51:34] rosheee: =D
[2022-02-11T21:51:40] rosheee: get 1l of it
[2022-02-11T21:54:58] Unknown: Grin Tech is the manufacturer. They're in Canada but I'm sure EU dealers carry it. It's called Statorade ferrofluid
[2022-02-11T21:55:07] rosheee: directly from canada
[2022-02-11T21:55:11] rosheee: dejan has it

[2022-02-11T21:55:35] Unknown: It's only ferrofluid I would trust. Grin Tech is an amazing company. Super technical guys
[2022-02-11T21:55:38] rosheee: directly from the source is best
[2022-02-11T21:55:46] Unknown: They make the statiator chargers

[2022-02-11T21:57:16] Unknown: Justin is the owner and posts all of research findings on endless sphere. There are pages and pages of test results for statorade on his endless sphere topic
[2022-02-11T21:57:40] rosheee: so i ordered the sensors u posted Adam 4 times + various other bullshit
[2022-02-11T21:58:00] rosheee: they look huuue

[2022-02-11T22:03:31] rosheee: §yesa
[2022-02-11T22:03:35] rosheee: rofl expensive
[2022-02-11T22:03:42] rosheee: i paid like shit
[2022-02-11T22:03:45] Unknown: They fit right under the windings. Super small with epoxy coated probe

[2022-02-11T22:07:34] Unknown: Nice. You got the NTC (negative temp coefficient) 100k B:3950. Good for VESC, Artem uses the 100k with good results. Nucular recommends the NTC 10k B:3950 for their controllers.
[2022-02-11T22:08:02] sombre_enfant: Did u needed to remove your phase and hall wire ?
[2022-02-11T22:08:05] Unknown: <photos/photo_2421@11-02-2022_22-08-05.jpg>
[2022-02-11T22:08:06] Unknown: You may have a point
[2022-02-11T22:10:10] Unknown: Nope. Can inject it a few different ways. Some motors have a ferrofluid port, so simply open the port (small screw) and I ject into the motor cover, magnets will automatically attract the fluid. Other way is drill your own port in the motor cover. Best way is to open the motor cover and just inject in the air gap and then put your motor cover back on. Best to seal around the motor covers so it doesn't leak out when riding
[2022-02-11T22:10:15] Unknown: Safe for halls
[2022-02-11T22:10:59] Unknown: I mean, I re-wired my phase and hall wires and added temp sensor, but nothing to do with the ferrofluid
[2022-02-11T22:12:14] sombre_enfant: Yeah i was meaning for the ntc
[2022-02-11T22:12:24] Paolo ⁭: Sucé
[2022-02-11T22:13:09] sombre_enfant: 🤨🤨
[2022-02-11T22:13:17] rosheee: damn
[2022-02-11T22:13:26] rosheee: rewire fuck
[2022-02-11T22:13:45] sombre_enfant: I feel u queen😕
[2022-02-11T22:15:35] rosheee: WHAT U USE FOR ISOLATION?
[2022-02-11T22:15:38] Unknown: Oh gotcha.. yea I had to add a temp sensor wire which was a 2 wire non-polarized (the wires attached to the temp sensor itself). So temp sensor wire 1 to controller and wire 2 is shared with ground from halls
[2022-02-11T22:16:09] rosheee: omg
[2022-02-11T22:16:31] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-11T22:16:33] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-11T22:16:41] Unknown: Haha
[2022-02-11T22:17:35] Unknown: You have to wire the temp sensor bro... And feed it out of the axle wire slot where the phase/hall wires go...
[2022-02-11T22:17:44] rosheee: i know
[2022-02-11T22:17:49] rosheee: but how to isolate the whole shit
[2022-02-11T22:17:52] Unknown: Haha ok
[2022-02-11T22:17:55] rosheee: i don't do that
[2022-02-11T22:17:59] rosheee: i give that to my friend
[2022-02-11T22:18:00] Unknown: Isolate what?
[2022-02-11T22:18:28] Unknown: We're talking about different things?
[2022-02-11T22:18:53] rosheee: the cable
[2022-02-11T22:18:59] rosheee: looks crappy then
[2022-02-11T22:19:06] sombre_enfant: He talk about the white insulation on phase wire to the copper winding
[2022-02-11T22:19:13] rosheee: no
[2022-02-11T22:19:18] rosheee: tempsensor cable -> vesc
[2022-02-11T22:19:34] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2022-02-11T22:19:50] rosheee: yes
[2022-02-11T22:20:04] sombre_enfant: With the phase and hall tube ig
[2022-02-11T22:20:17] rosheee: ?
[2022-02-11T22:20:19] rosheee: there is no space
[2022-02-11T22:20:29] rosheee: have to retube
[2022-02-11T22:20:32] rosheee: don't want that
[2022-02-11T22:20:56] sombre_enfant: Since u will remove them and solder all of them back space will create
[2022-02-11T22:21:06] rosheee: no xD
[2022-02-11T22:21:06] Luis Magalhaes: Is it running ? 😂
[2022-02-11T22:21:11] rosheee: i don't remove anything
[2022-02-11T22:21:15] Unknown: It's already isolated... Like silicone wire
[2022-02-11T22:21:15] rosheee: open motor
[2022-02-11T22:21:16] rosheee: add sensor
[2022-02-11T22:21:20] Unknown: Just need to run 1 wire to VESC. The other wire can be spliced into hall ground wire or directly to hall PCB ground. Only 1 wire needs to go to VESC
[2022-02-11T22:21:29] rosheee: ok
[2022-02-11T22:21:57] rosheee: i want the temp sensor cable inside the motorwire tube
[2022-02-11T22:21:59] sombre_enfant: Is that even possible
[2022-02-11T22:22:07] rosheee: to open the motor?
[2022-02-11T22:22:14] rosheee: how u add temp sensor then?
[2022-02-11T22:22:22] sombre_enfant: Just put it straight without redo phase and hall ?
[2022-02-11T22:22:26] Unknown: Trickiest part is feed that 1 temp sensor wire out of the axle slot since phase/hall is already pretty tight in there
[2022-02-11T22:22:35] Unknown: 🤦🏻
[2022-02-11T22:22:47] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-11T22:22:52] Unknown: Yes
[2022-02-11T22:23:15] sombre_enfant: Ah nice mine is way too tight
[2022-02-11T22:23:16] rosheee: sounds very stressful
[2022-02-11T22:23:22] Unknown: It sits tucked into the windings. I put some silicone on the wire (not the probe) to hold it in place
[2022-02-11T22:23:37] Unknown: Temp sensor has absolutely nothing to do with halls or phase. Just running the wire is tricky
[2022-02-11T22:24:02] rosheee: yah he has to resolder a new motor + hallcable on 2 motors so no prob
[2022-02-11T22:24:09] Unknown: Yup, that's the tricky part. I replaced my phase/hall wires with this....
[2022-02-11T22:24:14] Unknown: Higo L1019
[2022-02-11T22:24:27] Unknown: All wires included in 1 single wire/connector
[2022-02-11T22:24:38] rosheee: damn vsett
[2022-02-11T22:24:41] sombre_enfant: Yeah put the wire with original phase housing seems impossible with my motor...
[2022-02-11T22:25:05] rosheee: with g30'?
[2022-02-11T22:25:06] rosheee: or what

[2022-02-11T22:26:10] Unknown: Phase, halls, temp sensor all in 1 wire/connector
[2022-02-11T22:26:16] sombre_enfant: Clean👍🏾👍🏾
[2022-02-11T22:26:19] rosheee: clean
[2022-02-11T22:26:22] Unknown: Phase wires are 1awg thicker than stock Vsett phase wires

[2022-02-11T22:27:44] rosheee: instead of that plastic crap all use
[2022-02-11T22:27:44] Unknown: So I have no worries it isn't sufficient... Phase bullets on Higo L1019 connector are solid gold plated. They use these connectors on certain bafang ebike motors/controllers. Motors much more powerful than my 1400w Vsett motor
[2022-02-11T22:28:11] Unknown: Yea real sharp

[2022-02-11T22:30:47] rosheee: brand new
[2022-02-11T22:30:52] rosheee: it was like "wH0H0H00H0H0H0H0H0H0"
[2022-02-11T22:31:19] rosheee: then the faster u go the slower u feel
[2022-02-11T22:31:56] Martin Kaktits: its a drug
[2022-02-11T22:33:44] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I start to think I can run 50+
[2022-02-11T22:34:01] rosheee: now it is close to 100
[2022-02-11T22:34:03] Happy Giraffe: Kinda dangerous when you dont feel speed anymore
[2022-02-11T22:34:06] rosheee: and 80kmh feels slow
[2022-02-11T22:34:09] rosheee: exactly
[2022-02-11T22:34:19] Happy Giraffe: I kinda want my ebike to go 70
[2022-02-11T22:34:27] rosheee: shii
[2022-02-11T22:34:31] rosheee: send nudes then
[2022-02-11T22:34:45] Happy Giraffe: 80 too much, 60 too little😂
[2022-02-11T22:34:59] rosheee: idk when u snowboard u go 80 no prob
[2022-02-11T22:35:20] rosheee: u can go also 110kmh on snowboard
[2022-02-11T22:35:23] rosheee: what a feeling
[2022-02-11T22:35:24] Happy Giraffe: Also higher kv motor gives more mercy on frame and doesnt crack it in half😅
[2022-02-11T22:35:33] rosheee: mercy xD?
[2022-02-11T22:35:40] Happy Giraffe: Less torque
[2022-02-11T22:35:50] Paolo ⁭: Merci madame
[2022-02-11T22:35:56] Happy Giraffe: 7/9 winding will just crack a frame in half
[2022-02-11T22:35:58] rosheee: less torque?
[2022-02-11T22:36:43] Happy Giraffe: But yeah, gotta find a good medium between the windings. As I havent tried any proper ebike yet its hard to choose
[2022-02-11T22:37:00] rosheee: i just ordered 3x 1500W motor CST for our bike
[2022-02-11T22:37:13] rosheee: then we go 13S
[2022-02-11T22:37:14] Happy Giraffe: What brand?
[2022-02-11T22:37:18] rosheee: CST
[2022-02-11T22:37:25] Happy Giraffe: ....
[2022-02-11T22:37:29] rosheee: wtf

[2022-02-11T22:56:30] rosheee: think it is 125 or 135mm
[2022-02-11T22:56:32] rosheee: then it is straight
[2022-02-11T22:56:50] rosheee: but 160mm from axle point until bending point (cuz brake)
[2022-02-11T22:56:57] rosheee: then it is perfect ^__^
[2022-02-11T22:57:06] rosheee: calculation is pretty easy :D
[2022-02-11T22:57:40] Unknown: True haha haven't measured original flipped size

[2022-02-11T23:01:44] Unknown: Plasmacutter available, can cut holes and motor input at work, and can make it thicker steel. Could even harden the steel anyway and what you mean straight arm
[2022-02-11T23:01:55] rosheee: longer bolts
[2022-02-11T23:02:00] Mirono escooters: Plasma cutter? 🤤

[2022-02-11T23:04:19] rosheee: and make longer bolts
[2022-02-11T23:05:19] Unknown: Yea sure, but that puts way more force on the bolts then making a single long extender between the side plates
[2022-02-11T23:06:20] Unknown: Could go a bit thicker in size too for firmness and better safe then sorry anyways

[2022-02-12T02:14:13] Artem Bulashev: And than they wonder why people don’t buy Trumpa in masses lol
[2022-02-12T02:20:51] rosheee: Yah they retard
[2022-02-12T02:20:56] rosheee: Wtf the prices...
[2022-02-12T02:27:12] Artem Bulashev: If anything better of with https://www.ennoid.me/bms/xlite 24s version. Also smaller and 180$ not 200£= 270$!!
[2022-02-12T02:28:08] Artem Bulashev: Even that 180$ is too much for charge bms 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
[2022-02-12T02:58:06] Unknown: Speaking of BMS. What a beast this thing is. So much heat needed to heat that bus and melt the solder
[2022-02-12T02:58:57] Unknown: 140w solder gun. Multiple minutes of heat needed with real deal paste flux
[2022-02-12T02:59:50] Unknown: Short wires need to be longer

[2022-02-12T03:00:30] Unknown: Seems to be lol
[2022-02-12T03:00:47] Unknown: Going back with 8awg. Dual 8awg is more than enough
[2022-02-12T03:01:26] Unknown: It's a 150a BMS. Dual 7awg. Bit overkill, we rarely see that. Usually skimpy shit
[2022-02-12T03:05:03] Artem Bulashev: Most people run single 8awg on 120a battery 😂
[2022-02-12T03:05:21] rosheee: Oh yes
[2022-02-12T03:06:10] rosheee: So bms manifac. Failed if single awg 6?
[2022-02-12T03:06:48] Artem Bulashev: What?
[2022-02-12T03:08:11] Artem Bulashev: Why would larger diameter conductor fail? 6awg is bigger than 8awg, so no why would it fail 🤷‍♂️
[2022-02-12T03:08:42] Artem Bulashev: I was laughing at jk going over kill with dual 7awg 😁 because that is equal to 4Awg single 😂😂
[2022-02-12T03:13:20] rosheee: Just ask for 120A bms

[2022-02-12T03:22:57] Unknown: Literally cannot get the fet side bus to melt. The traces are so huge they just absorb the heat. I'm leaving that side LoL
[2022-02-12T03:24:30] Artem Bulashev: What’s that? BMS 😍
[2022-02-12T03:24:30] Unknown: Wow. Fets got really super hot thru the traces. Can't be healthy to heat them that much... I'm not pushing it
[2022-02-12T03:24:50] Artem Bulashev: Neh they can get hot no problem, like 90c hot
[2022-02-12T03:24:52] rosheee: Doesnt matter :-D i am sorry for my spam
[2022-02-12T03:25:04] Unknown: Really? Like burning hot?

[2022-02-12T03:26:05] Artem Bulashev: What iron you have ?
[2022-02-12T03:26:15] Artem Bulashev: Need massive tip
[2022-02-12T03:26:21] Unknown: This fet side close to the fets and directly on the traces. Seems impossible with 140w solder gun

[2022-02-12T03:26:29] Artem Bulashev: Than let it heat up for 5min
[2022-02-12T03:26:31] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2022-02-12T03:26:38] Unknown: I bent the damn tip from pushing so hard

[2022-02-12T03:28:12] Unknown: Will these help??
[2022-02-12T03:28:17] Artem Bulashev: That tip is pure copper
[2022-02-12T03:28:32] Artem Bulashev: What is that?
[2022-02-12T03:28:36] Unknown: Nice..
[2022-02-12T03:28:45] Unknown: Those are the tips... For the solder gun
[2022-02-12T03:28:46] Artem Bulashev: Your problem is not “power”
[2022-02-12T03:28:53] Artem Bulashev: No man :))
[2022-02-12T03:28:56] Unknown: Wrong shit
[2022-02-12T03:28:59] Unknown: I gotcha
[2022-02-12T03:29:07] Artem Bulashev: Your problem is heat capacity
[2022-02-12T03:29:19] Artem Bulashev: Thine tiny tip heats up yes
[2022-02-12T03:30:02] Artem Bulashev: But it doesn’t have much capacity so when you try to melt large heat capacity, your tip gets cold super fast
[2022-02-12T03:30:19] Artem Bulashev: Vs that thing can melt solder 15min after it was unplugged
[2022-02-12T03:30:53] Artem Bulashev: exaggerating, a bit
[2022-02-12T03:31:00] Unknown: That's exactly right. The tip sticks when I touch it
[2022-02-12T03:31:08] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-02-12T03:31:10] Unknown: I understand what you're saying

[2022-02-12T03:31:32] Artem Bulashev: Get nice big fat tip iron
[2022-02-12T03:31:55] Artem Bulashev: For large awg tinning it is very useful
[2022-02-12T03:31:56] Unknown: I'll get one and continue with the right one. Thanks man. Had a feeling this would do it but it is not lol
[2022-02-12T03:32:32] Unknown: For sure. I see that... Haven't really done a lot with things like this, mostly smaller scale soldering. I appreciate the tips 👍👍
[2022-02-12T03:32:56] Artem Bulashev: I mean it’s powerful, so it fights, but lol, it’s like pushing river through a kitchen tap
[2022-02-12T03:34:00] Unknown: Yup yup... Learning quick haha.
[2022-02-12T03:34:48] rosheee: Wtf u building xD? Holycow
[2022-02-12T03:34:56] Unknown: Maybe better? Only 60w iron
[2022-02-12T03:35:19] Unknown: Trying to desolder these damn 7awg wires from my BMS to put longer wires... So I don't have to splice
[2022-02-12T03:35:33] rosheee: Ahhhh xD
[2022-02-12T03:36:07] rosheee: 20S bms o.O huge
[2022-02-12T03:45:42] rosheee: Sry so absorbed with trashing stuff
[2022-02-12T03:47:30] Artem Bulashev: Yes thick but 60w is better
[2022-02-12T03:47:44] Artem Bulashev: Let it really heat up first for 5min
[2022-02-12T03:47:57] Artem Bulashev: And pre heat board with other iron mean while
[2022-02-12T03:48:13] Artem Bulashev: Than it will work like butter
[2022-02-12T03:48:19] Unknown: Gotcha.. thanks my man
[2022-02-12T03:48:48] Artem Bulashev: Preheating work wonders - less delta slower heat leaves the iron tip
[2022-02-12T03:48:58] Unknown: Absolutely...
[2022-02-12T03:49:25] Unknown: This good you think? 100w. Going to need it for 8awg to copper anyways

[2022-02-12T04:29:47] Unknown: I ended up getting with that fat tip. No prob actually
[2022-02-12T04:29:48] Artem Bulashev: Good 😃👌 physics vs marketing
[2022-02-12T04:30:42] Unknown: So, any tips for keeping the solder from wicking up the new wire? I need it flexible so it can make that sharp bend with BMS lengthwise. I know gravity... But don't want solder to flow onto the components either, so fine line there
[2022-02-12T04:30:53] Unknown: Haha yes siree
[2022-02-12T04:31:20] Artem Bulashev: Yes - gravity
[2022-02-12T04:31:44] Artem Bulashev: Solder penetrates wire, but it can’t climb up against gravity
[2022-02-12T04:31:59] Artem Bulashev: Well not much
[2022-02-12T04:32:10] Unknown: 👍 I'll give it a shot
[2022-02-12T04:32:31] Artem Bulashev: So hold it looking down and it won’t penetrate up too high
[2022-02-12T04:32:43] Artem Bulashev: But also it may not get through the wire fully
[2022-02-12T04:33:31] Artem Bulashev: So I start usually wire up and heat it up than add solder to the wire center of the cut and let it go in abit than flip and finish running all around
[2022-02-12T04:34:31] Unknown: Thanks, will give that a try
[2022-02-12T04:35:13] Unknown: Wish I could fit BMS widthwise like we were thinking originally... Damn balance wires protrude a little bit for my liking and sharp bend hard to keep them running clean lines ya kno

[2022-02-12T18:28:02] Mirono escooters: Wrong word
[2022-02-12T18:33:53] Artem Bulashev: Oh no shit
[2022-02-12T18:33:54] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2022-02-12T18:33:58] Artem Bulashev: Yah
[2022-02-12T18:51:32] Gigolo Joe: <animation>
[2022-02-12T18:55:42] Happy Giraffe: Rewind, thermal glue on magnets, custom sideplate, ferrofluid, turbonators
[2022-02-12T18:56:25] Happy Giraffe: 400€ motor costs 1800€ after all this work, but then the coils can take up 250°c instead of burning at 140°c
[2022-02-12T18:57:32] Gigolo Joe: Make sense now👌🏻👌🏻
[2022-02-12T19:11:59] sombre_enfant: Atp they could do their own hub

[2022-02-12T19:17:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: let's ferofluid this
[2022-02-12T19:18:38] Artem Bulashev: Lol 😄 it’s not possible haha
[2022-02-12T19:18:58] Artem Bulashev: Nice man! Measure before and after 😍
[2022-02-12T19:19:35] Happy Giraffe: Well its reality
[2022-02-12T19:19:40] Artem Bulashev: Ohh
[2022-02-12T19:19:42] Artem Bulashev: With rewind
[2022-02-12T19:19:44] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-02-12T19:19:53] Artem Bulashev: It’s no longer same motor :)
[2022-02-12T19:19:56] Happy Giraffe: Chinese shit copper, polish pure copper
[2022-02-12T19:20:35] Artem Bulashev: Yeah OCC copper with better heat resistant coating
[2022-02-12T19:20:50] Artem Bulashev: But problem is still there
[2022-02-12T19:21:14] Artem Bulashev: If coils go 180c than magnets will also get above 110c and loose charge
[2022-02-12T19:21:19] Happy Giraffe: I would love to do the same for Mxus XF40 30H motor but motor itself is 170€ and all the work would make it 1200€😂
[2022-02-12T19:21:29] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-02-12T19:21:45] Artem Bulashev: Would be cheaper and better buy Tesla motor used 🤣🤣
[2022-02-12T19:21:49] Paolo ⁭: 100ml?😱
[2022-02-12T19:22:05] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, they use some highly conductive glue on magnets, directly against heatsink and turbonators
[2022-02-12T19:22:18] Paolo ⁭: For 1 second yes :)
[2022-02-12T19:22:27] Happy Giraffe: Sexy
[2022-02-12T19:22:44] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁😁😁
[2022-02-12T19:23:07] Paolo ⁭: People use xiaomi motor 250w with 2500w
[2022-02-12T19:23:09] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-02-12T19:23:44] Mirono escooters: Maybe me
[2022-02-12T19:26:07] Happy Giraffe: Go to dyno test your scooter
[2022-02-12T19:28:54] Artem Bulashev: That motor is 500w max 13a at 37v If we go for 82v 22s = 2.2 times = 1100w - ferrofluid 30% gain 1430w - higher amps 30% gain to 17a = 1870W
[2022-02-12T19:30:20] Artem Bulashev: 2500w seems like it would cook it :) I consider reminded motor not to be same Motor any more, sort of unfair
[2022-02-12T19:32:14] Artem Bulashev: But it’s cool that we can get 70% gain actually just from ferrofluid and 30% amp increase
[2022-02-12T19:38:50] Happy Giraffe: I was really close to cooking it at 1300w 44.4v
[2022-02-12T19:39:22] Happy Giraffe: Littlebit wind against me and it got so hot it hurted to hold hand there
[2022-02-12T19:40:00] Luis Magalhaes: beast mode hehe
[2022-02-12T19:50:36] Paolo ⁭: I’ve tried with 23s 55A firmware lol
[2022-02-12T19:51:05] Paolo ⁭: 4500W as peak
[2022-02-12T19:51:06] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-02-12T19:51:21] Artem Bulashev: How long it lasted ? 1min?
[2022-02-12T19:51:23] Artem Bulashev: 😃😃
[2022-02-12T19:51:42] Paolo ⁭: 1 second

[2022-02-12T19:54:39] Happy Giraffe: What does Mi mean in Chinese? I know xiao means small/little
[2022-02-12T19:55:20] Happy Giraffe: Small Mi and you motherfucker push 4500w to it
[2022-02-12T19:55:57] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-12T19:59:40] Unknown: Beautiful! Usually 5-6ml will be just right depending on motor/magnet size. Vsett motors I have 6ml in front and 6.5ml in rear and no noticable resistance or reduction in ERPM. Always good to buy more than needed. Doesn't go bad and will probably require a top off every 6-12 months or so. Be sure to seal the motor covers for added safety
[2022-02-12T20:04:53] Happy Giraffe: Does it dry after a year or? And what if you leave it that way?
[2022-02-12T20:16:26] Unknown: To be honest, I'm not really sure but have heard of guys needing to reapply/top-off periodically. Not sure what the base is, it's definitely an oil-base so I imagine the "drying out" effect is very minimal
[2022-02-12T20:17:04] Unknown: Maybe loose some out the axle seals over time?
[2022-02-12T20:17:17] Happy Giraffe: Maybe needs old wiped off before applying new🤔
[2022-02-12T20:17:31] Unknown: I'm not really sure and won't pretend like I am LoL
[2022-02-12T20:18:03] Happy Giraffe: Im also new to this stuff, not that much info online either
[2022-02-12T20:18:09] Unknown: Certainly not a bad idea because if you reapply, it's hard to know how much is left vs how much you're adding. Maybe end up with 12ml hah
[2022-02-12T20:18:36] Happy Giraffe: BearEbike put like 5-6ml on their big 3000w motors
[2022-02-12T20:18:40] Unknown: The statorade endless sphere topic is the most helpful and grin Tech website also has lots of info on it
[2022-02-12T20:18:47] Happy Giraffe: Defo not wanna end up with 12ml
[2022-02-12T20:19:18] Unknown: Yup.. 4-8ml is basically the range. Magnet/hub size is determining factor for quantity obviously
[2022-02-12T20:22:54] Artem Bulashev: No just my leak though holes
[2022-02-12T20:23:04] Artem Bulashev: To my knowledge
[2022-02-12T20:23:30] Happy Giraffe: Then fully waterproofed motor should give a good performance on that regard aswell

[2022-02-12T20:45:21] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2022-02-12T20:45:30] Happy Giraffe: Propably some tuna cans in filled with sand
[2022-02-12T20:45:41] Artem Bulashev: Problem
[2022-02-12T20:46:28] Artem Bulashev: 10s4p = 40 cells - we can see 2 layers = 20 cells 21700 20*21 = 420mm length should be + BMS
[2022-02-12T20:46:38] Artem Bulashev: Soooo it is not 4p 🤣🤣
[2022-02-12T20:46:44] Artem Bulashev: Even that is not true
[2022-02-12T20:50:28] Martin Kaktits: One day kids will look back and wont see the problem with this. "72Ah battery, ye? I have that in my phone"
[2022-02-12T20:52:52] Happy Giraffe: Only thing that's true is this symbol
[2022-02-12T20:53:10] Happy Giraffe: Probably, with solid cells
[2022-02-12T20:54:51] Unknown: I'm pretty sure 720,000mah would be a 720ah battery 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-02-12T20:57:26] rosheee: <video_message>
[2022-02-12T20:57:31] Artem Bulashev: Not necessarily even that ahha if it is sand I mean it is not much of a flammable

[2022-02-12T21:42:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, we used all the bottle ! we'll beed another bottle for the second motor 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-02-12T21:43:31] Artem Bulashev: 😬😬 that’s 16 motors = 8 scooters!
[2022-02-12T21:43:34] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-02-12T21:44:13] Face de Pin Sucé: No
[2022-02-12T21:44:16] Face de Pin Sucé: It's only one motor

[2022-02-12T22:16:11] Artem Bulashev: 18s7p design that would fit inside!!! Vsett9 with single original controller OR dual Ubox 😁😁 without spacer at all! 395mm X 151mm X 49.2mm
[2022-02-12T22:16:32] Unknown: Nice man!!
[2022-02-12T22:19:16] Artem Bulashev: That would be 66.6v 24.5ah battery (just under 60v28ah in Wh=range )
[2022-02-12T22:19:56] Artem Bulashev: I guess 100v Ubox, here I come 😄😄
[2022-02-12T22:20:15] Paolo ⁭: Ohhh now have second man build 18s7p😍
[2022-02-12T22:20:35] Paolo ⁭: I was to think I’m only one with 18s7p config
[2022-02-12T22:24:46] Paolo ⁭: @artBula how much is fork opening of vsett 9?
[2022-02-12T22:26:15] Artem Bulashev: Not sure but vsett 9 motor is only 650w though I push it 1800w no problem (60v 30a per motor - 90a phase)
[2022-02-12T22:27:15] Artem Bulashev: I will measure tonight
[2022-02-12T22:29:32] Paolo ⁭: I want see if any solution available for my friend with vsett 9+
[2022-02-12T22:29:49] Paolo ⁭: He want powerful single motor configuration :)
[2022-02-12T22:30:44] Artem Bulashev: Why single if he has double alrwady?
[2022-02-12T22:32:13] Artem Bulashev: I can sell him my 60v28ah battery 750euro only - it’s super cheap technically, if he wants (fits vsett9 with 12mm spacer (sticks out only by 7mm as there is a lip on the frame)
[2022-02-12T22:34:24] Happy Giraffe: 16s blade?
[2022-02-12T22:34:38] Happy Giraffe: On rear so better grip
[2022-02-12T22:34:52] Happy Giraffe: Easy 75kmh
[2022-02-12T22:36:53] Paolo ⁭: Haha not legit in Italy dual motor
[2022-02-12T22:37:04] Paolo ⁭: Then him decide to remove one motor
[2022-02-12T22:37:19] Paolo ⁭: And buy powerfully motor
[2022-02-12T22:37:24] Happy Giraffe: Blade motor also 250w...🌚🌚🌚🌚
[2022-02-12T22:37:34] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-02-12T22:44:50] Artem Bulashev: Powerful motor also not legit …. What’s the point 🤣🤣
[2022-02-12T22:45:25] Artem Bulashev: Also police see - vsett 9+ Police goggles - vsett 9 single, vsett 9+ dual 😄😄
[2022-02-12T22:46:21] Paolo ⁭: Put 250W marking
[2022-02-12T22:46:23] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-02-12T22:46:35] Artem Bulashev: In Austria they just goggle the model
[2022-02-12T22:46:46] Artem Bulashev: Evennproblm because vsett9 is normally 650w
[2022-02-12T22:46:49] Artem Bulashev: Not 500w
[2022-02-12T22:47:08] Artem Bulashev: So you have to show them that some places have special 500w version
[2022-02-12T22:48:10] rosheee: So letz go 2 da club
[2022-02-12T22:48:27] Paolo ⁭: Italian seller rebrand them at 500W, not problem for private user.
[2022-02-12T22:48:34] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌

[2022-02-12T22:49:52] Paolo ⁭: @artBula
[2022-02-12T22:50:18] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that’s what I had to show to police here
[2022-02-12T22:50:29] Artem Bulashev: Because they think all vsett9 is 650w
[2022-02-12T22:50:52] Paolo ⁭: You need show police your invoice 😎
[2022-02-12T22:52:06] Happy Giraffe: Police has nothing more important to do there....
[2022-02-12T22:52:31] Artem Bulashev: They don’t like me flying 45kmh
[2022-02-12T22:53:04] Artem Bulashev: Or over taking bicycles on bicycle lane for some reason
[2022-02-12T22:53:08] Happy Giraffe: Oh, here they dont care. They had to floor their van to get side by side with me on bike pavement lol
[2022-02-12T23:03:43] rosheee: <photos/photo_2474@12-02-2022_23-03-43.jpg>

[2022-02-12T23:05:55] rosheee: Idk
[2022-02-12T23:19:48] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 hi man
[2022-02-12T23:19:57] Artem Bulashev: Do you have smart contorller dimensions ?
[2022-02-12T23:20:35] Artem Bulashev: Also I remember you were saying something about gps/sim module for it? I’m planning my second vsett9 😁
[2022-02-12T23:47:22] Happy Giraffe: Get an ebike for second ride😳
[2022-02-12T23:47:52] Happy Giraffe: In Finland its legal to have a throttle on those if you go max 25kmh and have insurance
[2022-02-12T23:48:38] Happy Giraffe: Then vesc profile suddenly changes and off you go
[2022-02-13T00:45:58] Paolo ⁭: Nkon
[2022-02-13T00:50:44] Artem Bulashev: If you are in eu I have supplier who can ship in eu
[2022-02-13T00:50:55] Artem Bulashev: Price will be better likely
[2022-02-13T00:52:09] Artem Bulashev: Stock Samsung 21700 48X, 50G, 40T, 50s Samsung 35E, LG Mj1, Sony VTC5A
[2022-02-13T01:25:00] Happy Giraffe: 50s?
[2022-02-13T01:25:11] Happy Giraffe: Also how much for 35E?😳
[2022-02-13T01:26:32] Artem Bulashev: Will ask prices
[2022-02-13T01:26:43] Artem Bulashev: 3.5€ 35e if I’m not mistaken
[2022-02-13T01:26:50] Artem Bulashev: When over 100pc
[2022-02-13T01:27:06] Artem Bulashev: Under 100 it’s abit more 3.8€ I think
[2022-02-13T01:27:11] Artem Bulashev: New
[2022-02-13T01:27:57] Artem Bulashev: He has some 35e that were spot welded on one side (not the other, still new ) those ate 0.2€ cheaper
[2022-02-13T01:28:32] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, nkon once welded 35E similar
[2022-02-13T01:29:51] Happy Giraffe: Has anyone tried these btw?
[2022-02-13T01:29:51] Happy Giraffe: https://www.nkon.nl/rechargeable/li-ion/21700-20700-size/lg-m50lt.html
[2022-02-13T01:30:22] Paolo ⁭: 🥲
[2022-02-13T01:30:30] Happy Giraffe: 4.89Ah and really cheap, 14A discharge not that bad either
[2022-02-13T01:30:57] Paolo ⁭: Has more voltage drop than 50E
[2022-02-13T01:31:05] Paolo ⁭: But good
[2022-02-13T01:32:12] Happy Giraffe: I have almost unused 13s7p so maybe I'll order new 35E to complete something like 16s8p (each parallel group will have same batch cells ofcourse)
[2022-02-13T10:54:33] Artem Bulashev: 35e 3.1€
[2022-02-13T10:54:35] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2022-02-13T10:59:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: smartcontroller or smartdisplay ? smartcontroller, i don't really do anymore for now
[2022-02-13T11:09:30] Artem Bulashev: Oh so you all those functions like displays / controllers translations are all no longer be utilised?
[2022-02-13T11:12:37] Face de Pin Sucé: ?
[2022-02-13T11:13:45] Artem Bulashev: Well those were meant to translate different controller to communicate to different screens like vesc to Zero display - but that function is not required in Smart Display, only in smartController
[2022-02-13T11:14:16] Artem Bulashev: That’s what I mean :)
[2022-02-13T11:15:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Ah yes okay
[2022-02-13T11:33:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: don't worry. everything is in the code, just have no time to adapt the electronic board for smartcontroller. it will come back later if people are interested.
[2022-02-13T11:56:31] Artem Bulashev: ✅
[2022-02-13T11:56:35] Artem Bulashev: I’m 😆😆
[2022-02-13T15:26:54] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2022-02-13T17:07:24] Artem Bulashev: Yeah great prices
[2022-02-13T17:15:58] Unknown: Hey guys... Does anyone know if there are any other "scrolling wheel" throttles out there that have dual action (forward throttle and reverse Regen) beside Rion curve and boosted rev? Finding the boosted is impossible unless someone parts something out on eBay (good luck) and the curve is insanely expensive and not available yet.
[2022-02-13T17:16:30] Unknown: Wasn't sure if there were any others out there like this
[2022-02-13T17:17:08] Mirono escooters: 220$???
[2022-02-13T17:17:09] Unknown: And if there's not, it would be an amazing thing for someone to create and produce 😉
[2022-02-13T17:17:24] Unknown: Yes LoL. For a... Throttle
[2022-02-13T17:17:32] Mirono escooters: What are the advantages
[2022-02-13T17:17:39] Mirono escooters: People Will still buy it
[2022-02-13T17:18:30] Unknown: It has throttle and e-brake in the same unit, scroll right for throttle and left for ebrake/Regen (or vise versa). Plus it looks really comfortable and ergonomic
[2022-02-13T17:19:11] Unknown: I might 🙈 lol. Only because it's the only one like it, besides boosted rev which is no longer.
[2022-02-13T17:19:29] Artem Bulashev: Great question
[2022-02-13T17:19:35] Artem Bulashev: I got one
[2022-02-13T17:19:51] Unknown: But principal alone... 220 for a throttle. Highway robbery
[2022-02-13T17:20:32] Unknown: I'm sure you do Artem! 😉
[2022-02-13T17:20:43] Artem Bulashev: I love it
[2022-02-13T17:20:44] Unknown: I want one.. badly

[2022-02-13T17:21:02] Artem Bulashev: Should see start manufacturing ?
[2022-02-13T17:21:04] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2022-02-13T17:21:20] Unknown: That's not boosted or curve is it??
[2022-02-13T17:21:27] Artem Bulashev: Company name “cheapRiono”
[2022-02-13T17:21:36] Unknown: ?? Really?
[2022-02-13T17:21:52] Artem Bulashev: That is Spintend remote controller 2.4ghz
[2022-02-13T17:21:57] Unknown: Can one purchase??
[2022-02-13T17:21:59] Artem Bulashev: I just zip tie it under
[2022-02-13T17:22:03] Unknown: OMG... Yeah it is
[2022-02-13T17:22:10] Unknown: Hah!
[2022-02-13T17:22:18] Unknown: So clever man
[2022-02-13T17:22:35] Artem Bulashev: Like this meant for eskate
[2022-02-13T17:22:39] Unknown: I know exactly what you did.
[2022-02-13T17:22:59] Unknown: Yup, I know exactly what it is.
[2022-02-13T17:23:15] Unknown: Awesome idea
[2022-02-13T17:23:16] Artem Bulashev: ✅👌
[2022-02-13T17:23:16] Artem Bulashev: But yes booster has one
[2022-02-13T17:23:17] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2476@13-02-2022_17-23-17.jpg>
[2022-02-13T17:23:25] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2022-02-13T17:23:28] Artem Bulashev: But they sell it only with entire handlebar
[2022-02-13T17:23:57] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2477@13-02-2022_17-23-57.jpg>
[2022-02-13T17:24:00] Artem Bulashev: About 120$
[2022-02-13T17:24:14] Unknown: Yea the Uni1 remote. Nice nice
[2022-02-13T17:25:06] Unknown: I saw that.. they have the throttle only but out of stock and obviously no more stock coming. I wonder if they do have the entire handlebar assembly available for sale. 120 isn't that bad, better than 220.
[2022-02-13T17:25:20] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-02-13T17:25:24] Artem Bulashev: They do
[2022-02-13T17:25:29] Artem Bulashev: I emailed them before
[2022-02-13T17:25:35] Artem Bulashev: Still too much
[2022-02-13T17:25:39] Unknown: Oh wow...
[2022-02-13T17:25:45] Artem Bulashev: I can CNC my own for that amount
[2022-02-13T17:25:51] Unknown: Good to know. It really is for a throttle
[2022-02-13T17:26:20] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 has booster and he tried your polish throttles
[2022-02-13T17:26:23] Unknown: But... Would be insanely nice to have that with variable Regen 🥰
[2022-02-13T17:26:30] Artem Bulashev: May be he can comment how they feel in compare
[2022-02-13T17:27:07] Unknown: Sorry I didn't follow that.. what's booster? Or did you mean boosted rev?
[2022-02-13T17:27:30] Artem Bulashev: Boosted rev
[2022-02-13T17:27:42] Unknown: Ahh ok. Gotcha gotcha
[2022-02-13T17:34:43] Unknown: I'm going to experiment with the Polish thumb throttle as variable Regen on the left side of the bars. With new battery will be able to set it high enough to use as primary brakes I bet. But would be super nice to have the scaling wheel with both. Would just be a much smoother and more natural feel
[2022-02-13T17:39:14] Artem Bulashev: Yeah i love how controllable regen is with reverse scroll
[2022-02-13T17:39:59] Mirono escooters: I just use second throttle
[2022-02-13T17:40:53] Unknown: Yea that's what I'm going to do. Trigger for throttle on right side and thumb throttle for Regen on left. But would be really nice to have them built into 1 unit as the scrolling wheel
[2022-02-13T17:41:25] Artem Bulashev: I was considering designing my own
[2022-02-13T17:41:31] Artem Bulashev: Idea was
[2022-02-13T17:41:45] Artem Bulashev: 70% of the travel to be used as throttle
[2022-02-13T17:41:53] Artem Bulashev: And 30% as regen
[2022-02-13T17:42:06] Artem Bulashev: Instead of simple 50/50
[2022-02-13T17:45:33] Mirono escooters: Better idea
[2022-02-13T17:48:26] Unknown: Absolutely. That would work perfectly. Scroll wheel design I assume?
[2022-02-13T17:49:04] Unknown: Really the only design to get action/throw both ways from center
[2022-02-13T17:53:52] Artem Bulashev: I think it should be possible to create scrolling both way away from center
[2022-02-13T17:54:28] Artem Bulashev: Quick idea is dual spring one each way
[2022-02-13T17:55:11] Artem Bulashev: But one with 3 turns vs 2 turns on other way
[2022-02-13T17:55:30] Artem Bulashev: That should creat equilibrium off center
[2022-02-13T18:01:37] Unknown: Hmm.. that does sound like it would it work if the housing was built to accommodate. Do you know if those dual action scrolling wheel throttles use 2 hall sensors or 1? Like 1 for throttle resolution and 1 for brake resolution? Is it possible to get both forward and reverse voltages from 1 sensor?
[2022-02-13T18:02:51] Artem Bulashev: One
[2022-02-13T18:03:16] Unknown: 🤔
[2022-02-13T18:03:32] Unknown: 2 magnets?
[2022-02-13T18:03:47] Artem Bulashev: It just detects change in magnetic field towards positive or negative
[2022-02-13T18:03:56] Artem Bulashev: One curved magnet
[2022-02-13T18:04:02] Artem Bulashev: And hall fallows it
[2022-02-13T18:04:48] Unknown: Interesting. Using both magnet poles north and south? I'm not able to picture the function in my head
[2022-02-13T18:04:58] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-02-13T18:05:03] Artem Bulashev: I show you
[2022-02-13T18:05:16] Unknown: Gotcha. That makes more sense to me
[2022-02-13T18:06:02] Unknown: So north pole would create positive voltage reading from hall and south pole would create negative voltage reading from hall? Maybe that? LoL
[2022-02-13T18:06:17] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2478@13-02-2022_18-06-17.jpg>
[2022-02-13T18:06:31] Artem Bulashev: That’s the trigger throttle in about 50%
[2022-02-13T18:06:40] Artem Bulashev: When released it will be at one end
[2022-02-13T18:06:46] Artem Bulashev: When 100% at other end
[2022-02-13T18:06:54] Unknown: Following
[2022-02-13T18:07:06] Artem Bulashev: Same happens with scroll just 0 is recorded at 50%
[2022-02-13T18:07:11] Artem Bulashev: In software
[2022-02-13T18:07:23] Artem Bulashev: And it autoreturn with spring to center
[2022-02-13T18:07:27] Unknown: Oh oh... Right. Change the "center" simple
[2022-02-13T18:07:39] Unknown: Got it
[2022-02-13T18:07:57] Artem Bulashev: That’s my understanding at least
[2022-02-13T18:08:01] Artem Bulashev: Seems about right
[2022-02-13T18:08:06] Unknown: And then simply calibrate "endpoints" in controller software
[2022-02-13T18:08:11] Unknown: I think it does
[2022-02-13T18:08:13] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-02-13T18:09:22] Unknown: So throttle would be say 2.2v to 4.2v and brake would be 2.2v to 0v (along those lines, not exact numbers obviously)
[2022-02-13T18:09:24] Unknown: ?
[2022-02-13T18:09:42] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-02-13T18:12:20] Artem Bulashev: In theory variable tension spring should offset center position
[2022-02-13T18:12:26] Artem Bulashev: Fuck it
[2022-02-13T18:12:33] Artem Bulashev: I will design throttle tonight
[2022-02-13T18:17:17] zekoslav mrkva: <photos/photo_2479@13-02-2022_18-17-17.jpg>
[2022-02-13T18:18:01] Artem Bulashev: Yes 🙌 magnet on moving part
[2022-02-13T18:19:00] Artem Bulashev: Though on the scroll wheel you could benefit from flipping it and attaching to the wheel section you scroll
[2022-02-13T18:19:09] Artem Bulashev: So you scroll around hall sensor
[2022-02-13T18:20:00] Artem Bulashev: Diameter on the scroll wheel will determine the magnet - can than you longer magnet 🤔
[2022-02-13T18:22:21] Artem Bulashev: 40t Samsung cells btw 4.35€
[2022-02-13T18:32:07] Artem Bulashev: Though I never lost grip with trigger throttle, but I did loose it with scroll wheel throttle twice 🤔
[2022-02-13T18:32:08] Unknown: 🥰 oh man, please do! I'll contribute if you need funds for parts/components
[2022-02-13T18:32:57] Unknown: Hmm, that's interesting. Still tho, having throttle and Regen together is really sweet
[2022-02-13T18:33:08] Artem Bulashev: I feel like trigger throttle of better design is actually best for safety
[2022-02-13T18:33:22] Artem Bulashev: If only we could integrate regen on it as well
[2022-02-13T18:35:08] Artem Bulashev: May be second axis like - closing finger bring throttle closer to you handlebar (throttle) - release it and now you can also push it down instead twords the ground for regen 🤔
[2022-02-13T18:35:33] Artem Bulashev: Some kind of dual axis trigger throttle
[2022-02-13T18:38:13] Unknown: Up/down and inwards/outwards. That would be a cool idea but would need to make sure both can't be applied at the same time. 2 completely separate axises with separate "rails" to follow
[2022-02-13T18:38:35] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-02-13T18:39:45] Artem Bulashev: But dual magnets I don’t think can live in one throttle without cross interfering
[2022-02-13T18:42:48] Unknown: This. Good point. Would be hard/impossible to isolate each magnet field
[2022-02-13T18:43:12] Artem Bulashev: We could use single axis for normal trigger throttle, but!! We could install analog pressure sensor under the tab at the 0 position
[2022-02-13T18:43:40] Artem Bulashev: That would mean that at 0 possition it would also register variable applied pressure as regen
[2022-02-13T18:43:43] Artem Bulashev: 😀🤔
[2022-02-13T18:44:09] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2480@13-02-2022_18-44-09.jpg>
[2022-02-13T18:45:45] Unknown: Hmm. The pressure sensor has resolution needed? Also sends variable "voltage"? 0-5v?
[2022-02-13T18:46:34] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-02-13T18:46:42] Unknown: <photos/photo_2481@13-02-2022_18-46-42.jpg>
[2022-02-13T18:46:44] Unknown: Indeed
[2022-02-13T18:46:51] Unknown: Hah!
[2022-02-13T18:47:10] Artem Bulashev: 0-3.3v output of signal Input power 3.3-5v
[2022-02-13T18:47:35] Artem Bulashev: 3.3v is highest pressure, 0 no pressure 😅
[2022-02-13T18:47:40] Artem Bulashev: 20g to 10kg
[2022-02-13T18:49:28] Artem Bulashev: I think that’s an option worth exploring and May be can even convert current trigger throttle to such for testing
[2022-02-13T18:50:12] Artem Bulashev: Normal zero/vsett throttle May work with little modification
[2022-02-13T18:50:26] Unknown: Nice nice. 0-3.3v is definitely all that's needed for brake sensor. Don't even need that much resolution but more the better
[2022-02-13T18:50:40] Unknown: Yea huh?! That would be ideal.
[2022-02-13T18:50:48] Artem Bulashev: 👀
[2022-02-13T18:53:13] Artem Bulashev: Just need throttle design that would only have pressure point on the scroll wheel under arm, but not further along, some plastic can be removed / shaved Off so it can’t touch pressure sensor any where along throttle movement beside 0 position
[2022-02-13T18:53:22] Artem Bulashev: Fun 😄
[2022-02-13T18:54:39] Unknown: Yes exactly.. that's what I was saying before with the separate "rails/guides" for each action since we wouldn't want to cut power accidentally while accelerating
[2022-02-13T18:54:55] Unknown: Heck yea man. Very worthwhile project in my opinion
[2022-02-13T18:55:32] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but two axis need likely two magnets which may not be good idea
[2022-02-13T18:55:54] Unknown: This is true...
[2022-02-13T18:56:09] Unknown: But pressure sensor would work if able to implement
[2022-02-13T19:03:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ❤️❤️❤️
[2022-02-13T19:04:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ah. crap. i thought you would design a boosted like throttle 😓
[2022-02-13T19:05:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if it can help, there are few open source esk8 remote design
[2022-02-13T19:14:20] Luis Magalhaes: That was a good design 😁
[2022-02-13T19:38:51] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-13T20:15:53] Artem Bulashev: That was a plan
[2022-02-13T20:16:49] Artem Bulashev: But I think proper trigger would be better than scroll in terms of secure grip on handle bar
[2022-02-13T20:17:14] Artem Bulashev: Idea is it moved close to handle bar and you accelerate more = even better grip
[2022-02-13T20:18:02] Artem Bulashev: I would like also it to be parallel movement instead of rotational as all trigger throttles are
[2022-02-13T20:25:55] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3 Is there an updated list of all features from display?

[2022-02-13T22:32:25] Luis Magalhaes: True
[2022-02-13T22:32:41] Luis Magalhaes: Dont need a broken stem
[2022-02-13T22:32:49] Paolo ⁭: Guys install anyway 10kg batteries on stem but I not like too this
[2022-02-13T22:32:59] Paolo ⁭: Like extreme with their dualtron
[2022-02-13T22:33:04] Luis Magalhaes: Even the 10x limited 😅
[2022-02-13T22:33:49] Paolo ⁭: Tiny pole
[2022-02-14T01:33:44] Paolo ⁭: Luis wolf gt motor is 60mm too

[2022-02-14T01:35:05] Luis Magalhaes: Is it? 😂
[2022-02-14T01:36:39] Luis Magalhaes: dam so why is it larger ? just the cases of the motor?😅
[2022-02-14T01:39:04] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu but the interior of the motor is bigger, maybe not larger

[2022-02-14T01:42:07] Luis Magalhaes: You can see the left one is bigger its the king and the right is the warrior
[2022-02-14T01:45:39] Paolo ⁭: Yea I’ve contact them , and they confirmed me they’re also factory of nanrobot
[2022-02-14T01:46:30] Paolo ⁭: Depends by stator size
[2022-02-14T01:46:35] Paolo ⁭: I need photo of them
[2022-02-14T01:55:11] Luis Magalhaes: dont have any more photos, just those two, that guy changed his wolf 60v motor to the king motors, not even the GT, i said they are larger to fit had to put some spacer in the arms to manage to fit then, maybe its because of the new cases
[2022-02-14T01:56:18] Luis Magalhaes: but stator seems to be larger, you can see it in those 2 photos i send, and the owner said it was too, but didnt mesure it
[2022-02-14T01:58:41] Paolo ⁭: Stator isn’t magnet 😂 but both are 60mm and is confirmed. And wtf cost a bit less gt motor
[2022-02-14T02:05:41] Luis Magalhaes: But the diameter of the stator is the same? Or just the 60mm magnets?
[2022-02-14T02:12:23] Paolo ⁭: Rim diameter is important too, but most important see stator and winding
[2022-02-14T02:12:44] Paolo ⁭: Magnet seems same width
[2022-02-14T02:17:26] Luis Magalhaes: Yes could be same width
[2022-02-14T02:17:48] Luis Magalhaes: But if the motor is bigger diameter it will give you more torque
[2022-02-14T02:18:11] Luis Magalhaes: Winding maybe are the same too
[2022-02-14T02:18:14] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2022-02-14T03:00:35] Artem Bulashev: guys how can we downgraed to 5.2? have link to ubox dual usb c software?
[2022-02-14T03:01:01] Artem Bulashev: I want to check if it will stater again once I flash old FW again
[2022-02-14T03:01:26] Artem Bulashev: may be I find paramter verience - is it safe to downgrade btw?/

[2022-02-14T10:21:05] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-14T11:25:54] Artem Bulashev: Just spoke with spintend
[2022-02-14T11:29:36] Artem Bulashev: V100 has 0.5 higher ir of mosfets But it heats up less because of new circuited design and wiring optimization and copper tracing Size wise they considering releasing new case that would be a lot smaller but they had alot of cases made and had to finish those and also they were in hurry to stay on time to release it, no time to manufacture new case even though they know they can reduce size by as much as 20% footprint wise! 100v has ports on front for production reliability - they said that ports up have high defect rate on manufacturing, and if it is defective whole board is toast, no repairable (traces are fucked), that’s why they are flat looking forword. They do suspect it is less than idea for use.
[2022-02-14T11:49:07] Happy Giraffe: Tell them to make mosfet die touch a fking heatsink for once😂
[2022-02-14T11:49:31] Happy Giraffe: And not to bolt down the 1w Arm cpu instead of the mosfet
[2022-02-14T11:53:54] Happy Giraffe: Motor expert, what's your opinion on this? https://nexun.pl/en/products/mxus-45h-v3-3k-turbo-3000w-4t-16x4-rear-414.html

[2022-02-14T17:55:19] Artem Bulashev: Not sure I understood , can you elaborate ? Have photo what you mean
[2022-02-14T18:07:06] Happy Giraffe: Mosfet heat source is against pcb, in xiaomi esc its much easier to cool because of direct contact mosfet-heatsink
[2022-02-14T18:08:43] Happy Giraffe: Biggest issue still is that spintend wants to bolt down logic side of pcb instead power side
[2022-02-14T18:42:01] Artem Bulashev: You mean if they were to reverse them and put side, that is now going to the pcb as cooling, to the heat pad it would be a lot better ?
[2022-02-14T18:42:38] Artem Bulashev: I think metal has better heat capasity so pcb cools it more effectively than pad would
[2022-02-14T18:44:34] Artem Bulashev: Are you sure ? 100v has power bolted and so does my ubox red original
[2022-02-14T18:51:59] Happy Giraffe: Now the pad is on the other side with resin case etc. what Paolo explained. Also case is bad design as its 2-piece that stops heat transfering
[2022-02-14T18:52:26] Happy Giraffe: If I ever have to open scooter again, I will sure bolt the vesc upside down
[2022-02-14T19:20:31] Artem Bulashev: Guys have motor question/ There is two options, 52v 650w 48v 650w Chances are they are same exact motor. Would any one know ?
[2022-02-14T19:21:37] Mirono escooters: Wouldnt 48v have higher kv
[2022-02-14T19:23:12] Artem Bulashev: In ideal world
[2022-02-14T19:23:28] Artem Bulashev: But 48v is used in dual to get slightly higher speed than single 52v
[2022-02-14T19:24:22] Artem Bulashev: I think slight gain comes from dual motor and twice the power thus. Rather than higher KV
[2022-02-14T19:24:53] Artem Bulashev: Would normally Chinese manufacturers even adjust kv for 1s less target?

[2022-02-14T19:46:36] Unknown: Pretty impressive stuff... But pricey. Get whatcha pay for. Also note, Higo L1019 connector 😎.
[2022-02-14T19:56:03] Happy Giraffe: 700-750$ oof, Mxus turbo I can get for just under 300€
[2022-02-14T19:56:56] Unknown: Yea very expensive but looks like one the best designs out there. Those guys don't mess around LoL
[2022-02-14T19:57:47] Happy Giraffe: Mxus is already almost too big for me, Im only running 48v 40A from it and its 3000w nominal😂 Just wanting a motor that doesnt overheat or shit bricks (and handles 130A phase when needed)
[2022-02-14T20:15:39] Happy Giraffe: Also they rate this motor 500-1000w, and costs...600usd😅
[2022-02-14T20:53:29] Unknown: I gotcha man. Just was interesting to me. I don't research much e-bike stuff and happen to come across this, thought it was 🆒
[2022-02-14T20:57:05] Happy Giraffe: Its cool until I push some amps to it😂
[2022-02-15T09:04:57] Happy Giraffe: I sent Spintend email about the thermal pad improvements and my stupid ideas of next single vesc cooling😂 Lets see their response
[2022-02-15T09:50:53] Happy Giraffe: They answered and thought we want to create balance boards, I told them we want 200A phase instead for ebike/scooter😂 And also I said the current 75v 100A could continue to exist for the smallest builds. Need just one bigger single vesc.
[2022-02-15T09:53:39] Happy Giraffe: @PaoloWu Is 200A enough for you?😂
[2022-02-15T09:53:46] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse not
[2022-02-15T09:54:01] Happy Giraffe: Aah, stupid question I see
[2022-02-15T09:54:34] Happy Giraffe: Im looking forward for their reaction to me pushing 150A on single ubox😂

[2022-02-15T10:17:25] Happy Giraffe: How do you keep the grip at these powers?😂
[2022-02-15T10:43:53] Happy Giraffe: Spintend uses copper bar for cooling 100v single🌚
[2022-02-15T10:44:03] Happy Giraffe: Fucking finally😂

[2022-02-15T11:16:59] Paolo ⁭: It’s pretty low resistance value of xt90s
[2022-02-15T11:17:07] Paolo ⁭: For 2000uf max is ok
[2022-02-15T11:17:39] Artem Bulashev: I would call it xt90 fire starter 😅😅 wonder how hot it will be at 90a 🤣🤣
[2022-02-15T11:18:24] Paolo ⁭: It’s peak 90a
[2022-02-15T11:18:29] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I like as150 design better - with only very tip of the connector being on resistance
[2022-02-15T11:18:29] Paolo ⁭: Continuos for 40A
[2022-02-15T11:18:49] Artem Bulashev: Remaining part of the bullet is direct connection

[2022-02-15T11:22:41] Paolo ⁭: 5.1ohm I think
[2022-02-15T11:28:05] Face de Pin Sucé: how ?
[2022-02-15T11:28:12] Face de Pin Sucé: never burnt any XT90
[2022-02-15T11:30:17] Paolo ⁭: Depends by capacitor you have inside controllers
[2022-02-15T11:30:29] Paolo ⁭: It’s good for 16s up to 2000uf capacitor
[2022-02-15T11:30:58] Paolo ⁭: More than this resistance will burn because resistor value is very low and resistor wattage is little.
[2022-02-15T11:31:17] Paolo ⁭: They use 5.6ohm, I use 100ohm

[2022-02-15T15:10:47] Unknown: I'm doing away with my xt90s for 20s battery. Have as150 and QS8 on hand. Like the as150 because of the separate POS/neg bullets. More flexibility for running the wires rather than 1 solid housing. Qs8 does seem nice and beefy tho. Not sure which I'll use yet. Both are overrated for mysetup so may come down to convenience
[2022-02-15T15:12:33] Unknown: But yea, I heard xt90s is no good for higher voltages and bottlenecks current flow. Glad to hear others agree

Just a few steps left before she roars to life (hopefully, many fingers crossed 🤞) All balance lead voltages check out in order, so that's a good sign. Does anyone see anything immediately concerning or have suggestions? I kept the balance wires spaced from eachother and will reinforce them even more so they never shift. Going to put a piece of fish paper under the balance wires where they bend and feed down to make sure they don't get damaged at those hard bends. Also using the PCB resin board under the BMS itself as added protection

[2022-02-16T22:05:24] Happy Giraffe: Display connected to nuclear reactor, or Paolos battery in different words
[2022-02-16T22:08:34] Paolo ⁭: This temp is when I tried 250A phase in my ubox single
[2022-02-16T22:10:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Great 👌
[2022-02-16T22:12:15] Happy Giraffe: Btw, I figured what caused the bugs in Vesc Tool Mobile profiles. If you change some values in the app it sort of resets the profile order so everytime you make changes: the permanent profile needs to be activated again and then the temporary
[2022-02-16T22:15:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2022-02-16T22:16:15] Happy Giraffe: What was the highest phase you managed on that?
[2022-02-16T22:17:25] Artem Bulashev: Damm, I mean I knew that screen was hot looking, but finally we got numbers 😅😂

[2022-02-16T22:20:15] Artem Bulashev: Now v2 75v also got updated with case that has less screws
[2022-02-16T22:20:54] Happy Giraffe: Seems nice, does it affect temps?
[2022-02-16T22:22:12] Artem Bulashev: And Usb now also down

[2022-02-17T00:00:18] Unknown: Yes sir! Working out beautifully so far. Just main leads left to do and then power up BMS via JK display 👍
[2022-02-17T00:02:31] Paolo ⁭: Show me your bikeee
[2022-02-17T00:07:48] Luis Magalhaes: No video doesn't exist.. been told 😂

[2022-02-17T00:20:34] Paolo ⁭: Anyone know which temp sensor vesc use?
[2022-02-17T00:20:56] Unknown: NTC 10k or 100k B:3950
[2022-02-17T00:22:22] Unknown: Again, work in progress so some things have changed since the pictures
[2022-02-17T00:22:34] Paolo ⁭: Thank, I’m looking let factory produce motor with directly integrated temp sensor
[2022-02-17T00:23:50] Unknown: Nice nice. Artem uses the NTC 100k with his VESC. I use the NTC 10k with my Nucs. "B" is the beta value and I'm pretty sure Artem's is B:3950
[2022-02-17T00:24:09] Paolo ⁭: Yes I know
[2022-02-17T00:24:19] Paolo ⁭: Then vesc support both 10k and 100k?
[2022-02-17T00:24:42] Paolo ⁭: 3950 is mostly common, also used in bms for bq
[2022-02-17T00:24:44] Unknown: I believe it does. Better question for Artem regarding the VESC
[2022-02-17T00:24:48] Unknown: Yes, definitely
[2022-02-17T00:25:00] Unknown: 3450 also available but not common
[2022-02-17T00:26:11] Unknown: Temp sensors are game changer in my opinion. Allows to push motors safely to max
[2022-02-17T00:26:57] Unknown: Even if batt amps are limited at battery, can always crank phase amps to max motor temp.. if controller allows
[2022-02-17T00:27:59] Unknown: I think that's a great idea to integrate temp sensors in your motors
[2022-02-17T00:31:38] Paolo ⁭: yes vesc offer extra functions with temp sensor
[2022-02-17T00:31:49] Paolo ⁭: Like power boost and power limiting
[2022-02-17T00:46:06] Unknown: Oh nice. Even more reason
[2022-02-17T02:43:25] Artem Bulashev: Yes 100k is more stable
[2022-02-17T02:43:46] Artem Bulashev: Reason is simple - 5degree change = 1 ohm change (just random values as example only)
[2022-02-17T02:44:00] Artem Bulashev: But on 10k that is 10% vs 100k it is 1%
[2022-02-17T02:45:49] Unknown: For some reason Nuc recommends the 10k. Not sure why. Dev told me the 100k would also work but 10k would be more accurate with their software
[2022-02-17T02:46:15] Unknown: But yes, generally the 100k has more resolution therefore more accurate
[2022-02-17T02:55:59] Artem Bulashev: Interesting
[2022-02-17T02:56:55] Artem Bulashev: From my understanding resolution is same, it just % change depending on temp is 10 times less on 100k but may be im wrong about how it all works
[2022-02-17T03:33:41] Unknown: <photos/photo_2535@17-02-2022_03-33-41.jpg>
[2022-02-17T03:35:21] Unknown: <photos/photo_2536@17-02-2022_03-35-21.jpg>
[2022-02-17T03:37:32] Unknown: Nuc supports 6 different sensor types, but each of the NTC's are 10k, just different Beta values 🤷🏻‍♂️ I went with the 10k B:3950 epoxy covered probe. It works perfectly. At ambient temp, it displays exact temperature as internal built-in sensor. It is interesting. Are you able to select you sensor type in VESC tool?
[2022-02-17T03:46:46] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-02-17T07:22:27] Face de Pin Sucé: don't forget that VESC TEMP SENSOR isn't wired the same as usual controllers
[2022-02-17T07:24:42] Face de Pin Sucé: wiring is TEMP - GND
[2022-02-17T07:24:58] Face de Pin Sucé: (usually in most motors it is 5V - TEMP)
[2022-02-17T10:34:25] Artem Bulashev: Good point
[2022-02-17T16:31:34] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_2537@17-02-2022_16-31-34.jpg>
[2022-02-17T16:31:41] Mirono escooters: Anyone tried these uet? Look promising
[2022-02-17T16:38:11] Face de Pin Sucé: come on we like vesc here not chinese craps
[2022-02-17T16:38:28] Mirono escooters: Sorry, this group is just full of smort People
[2022-02-17T16:38:36] Mirono escooters: I thought i saw it before somewhere 🤔
[2022-02-17T16:54:58] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-02-17T17:02:53] sombre_enfant: <sticker>
[2022-02-17T17:04:13] Mirono escooters: Ok back to vesc, my bad Wich displays are normally used? I have 2 flipsky but want bigger I know koxx has 1, but are there any others?
[2022-02-17T17:11:58] Unknown: I'm curious to know as well. From my understanding the display options for VESC are very limited. Koxx and ....?
[2022-02-17T17:12:13] Mirono escooters: Yes limited
[2022-02-17T17:12:28] Mirono escooters: Flipsky was on sale 25€ or so. But small. Good for a skateboard or just basic info
[2022-02-17T17:12:57] Unknown: Essentially non existent besides Koxx. Which is why it's such a worthwhile project
[2022-02-17T17:13:09] Unknown: Ahh, gotcha. Booo
[2022-02-17T17:13:19] Mirono escooters: It's Tiny😂

[2022-02-17T17:14:24] Mirono escooters: Its "ok" as a display but it can b better
[2022-02-17T17:15:15] Unknown: Oh geez. Yea, pretty damn small. Better than nothing I suppose
[2022-02-17T17:16:25] Unknown: I bought this display for my BMS. Mostly because it has an ON switch for the BMS. But I'll mount it in a discrete place since I have my Nucular display
[2022-02-17T17:20:53] Mirono escooters: Ahh nuclear display
[2022-02-17T17:21:15] Mirono escooters: Im a fan of displays. Problably what stops me from using it on everything Thé cheap gt100 displays of kugoo are nice
[2022-02-17T17:21:30] Mirono escooters: And some smart dudes putted vesc firmware on Xiaomi controller and made Dash work!

[2022-02-17T17:43:08] Face de Pin Sucé: well, in reality, blue is darker than I see on this pictuge
[2022-02-17T17:45:50] Artem Bulashev: There are bunch of projects - but they are just that, half complete projects. Than few displays like flipsky and
[2022-02-17T17:49:59] Paolo ⁭: its same of zero 11x or vsett with different current model
[2022-02-17T17:50:11] Mirono escooters: Thanks
[2022-02-17T17:50:16] Mirono escooters: Current model?
[2022-02-17T17:50:39] Mirono escooters: Im gonna order and see. It looks promising :)
[2022-02-17T18:00:04] Luis Magalhaes: That display looks nice 👀
[2022-02-17T18:05:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Kelly Compatible 🙃
[2022-02-17T18:18:42] Luis Magalhaes: Next upgrade to think off 😜
[2022-02-17T20:24:54] Face de Pin Sucé: 😁😁😈
[2022-02-17T20:24:59] Face de Pin Sucé: mondial relay 😁
[2022-02-17T20:25:12] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-02-17T20:25:39] Luis Magalhaes: i think i have almost 4 people wanting them 🤣
[2022-02-17T20:27:38] Luis Magalhaes: @koxx3 what the price of the smart display for kelly controller?
[2022-02-17T20:40:07] Face de Pin Sucé: that's nice, stay connected, it's coming soon 😈🔥
[2022-02-17T20:41:15] Luis Magalhaes: nice go go go 😍
[2022-02-17T20:55:20] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb the display runs in any kelly or have to be the specific for the display ? they have one model specific to have display
[2022-02-17T20:56:19] Face de Pin Sucé: any kelly
[2022-02-17T20:56:32] Face de Pin Sucé: that's the point of this display
[2022-02-17T20:56:41] Face de Pin Sucé: to be compatible with anykelly
[2022-02-17T20:57:03] Luis Magalhaes: nice, its better then the display they sell with kelly without doubt 🤣
[2022-02-17T20:57:44] Luis Magalhaes: a friend have bougth a second one and its a peace of shit, dont work, just shows battery and hours 🤣
[2022-02-17T21:01:08] Luis Magalhaes: and it is pluged in same cable as the bluethooth ?
[2022-02-17T21:06:18] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2022-02-17T21:06:44] Face de Pin Sucé: if I remember well, yes, koxx will answer better than me
[2022-02-17T21:07:59] Luis Magalhaes: ok, one more thing you maybe know, you cant program the controller with the display pluged or does it have any feature to comunicate from phone app to controller ?
[2022-02-17T21:09:04] Face de Pin Sucé: same, I'll ask, I don't remember x)
[2022-02-17T21:11:44] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣👌 ok
[2022-02-17T21:12:10] Luis Magalhaes: would be great not having to plug a bluethooth device just the display 😁
[2022-02-17T21:14:38] Face de Pin Sucé: not possible, always need the BLE to program
[2022-02-17T21:15:28] Luis Magalhaes: Ok 😅👌
[2022-02-17T21:15:52] Face de Pin Sucé: when you modify parameters in Kelly, it reflashes whole firmware
[2022-02-17T21:16:03] Face de Pin Sucé: so not possible to do another way than official way
[2022-02-17T21:16:47] Luis Magalhaes: ok, no problem any way, just have to program it and then plug that mad ass display 😜
[2022-02-17T21:19:06] Face de Pin Sucé: yeah exactly
[2022-02-17T21:19:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2022-02-17T21:20:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly. you MUST never "program" (set new values) when the motor is spinning. you are sure to fry the controller
[2022-02-17T21:20:30] Luis Magalhaes: would be good 🤣 but not a problem
[2022-02-17T21:21:09] Face de Pin Sucé: yeah we saw it on live 😂
[2022-02-17T21:21:34] Luis Magalhaes: yes i think you guys already told that here hehe
[2022-02-17T21:21:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for kelly compatibility, yes, it is compatible, but i didn't test it since a loooooong time. so, it's certainly no working now due to multiple side modifications I made. we'll look to test again on kelly.
[2022-02-17T21:21:43] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-02-17T21:21:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅
[2022-02-17T21:22:31] Luis Magalhaes: ok, the four person here are using kelly 7218 and 7212
[2022-02-17T21:24:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's just a matter of hours to get it working again. but I won't sell a SmartDisplay if I can't test it in all "valid" configurations after a code release (mino, zero, vsett, vesc => baseline since I have controllers at home).
[2022-02-17T21:25:44] Face de Pin Sucé: yeah yeah I send you Kelly's 😁😁
[2022-02-17T21:30:28] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-02-17T21:32:41] Luis Magalhaes: And what's the price you sell? They are asking 😂
[2022-02-17T21:33:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahaha ... we are currently costing the whole thing with manufacrurers
[2022-02-17T21:33:47] Luis Magalhaes: ok so i tell them to wait 🤣
[2022-02-17T21:36:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so ... raw costs (PCB, components, glass, enclosure, cables, assembly ...) + enginering costs + VAT + company taxes ... + sales costs + margin we'll see, but I don't think it will be under 300€ ... yeh ... I know.
[2022-02-17T21:44:07] Unknown: Do these other controllers not use CanBus protocol to tap into? So for making setting adjustments, say on Kelly.. can't be done thru the display? Bluetooth in app only? Same for VESC? Sorry, little confused on that part.
[2022-02-17T21:44:30] Face de Pin Sucé: VESC does
[2022-02-17T21:44:40] Unknown: Oh ok.. good good
[2022-02-17T21:44:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Kelly not made for dual so no canbus
[2022-02-17T21:46:04] Unknown: Gotcha
[2022-02-17T21:46:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: everything on controller abilities. kelly, yyk and many controller doesn't support "live settings" programming interfaces aren't even described/published officially.
[2022-02-17T21:46:47] Unknown: Understood. So it's limited by actual hardware/software
[2022-02-17T21:46:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: CAN bus or UART, it's only an interface. if the software isn't done correctly, you can fry everything very quickly
[2022-02-17T21:47:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: let's say they are built to be integrated in factories. not by users.
[2022-02-17T21:47:44] Unknown: Makes sense 👍
[2022-02-17T21:53:21] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅😅
[2022-02-17T21:53:59] Artem Bulashev: Can i get naked smart controller board with nothing else plz 😄
[2022-02-17T21:57:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not for now. I focus on smartdisplay.
[2022-02-17T21:57:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: first production batch will be 20 for beta testing.
[2022-02-17T21:58:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 10 for the internal testing team 10 for other users at a reduced price
[2022-02-17T21:58:03] Face de Pin Sucé: and I get 4 🔥
[2022-02-17T21:59:00] Artem Bulashev: Well one day 😄👌will be happy to test it when time comes
[2022-02-17T21:59:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2022-02-17T21:59:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you want to keep the vsett display ?
[2022-02-17T21:59:27] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-02-17T21:59:29] Artem Bulashev: Have too
[2022-02-17T21:59:41] Artem Bulashev: Other wise lots of fines
[2022-02-17T21:59:50] Artem Bulashev: Must all look stock :)
[2022-02-17T21:59:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😳😳
[2022-02-17T21:59:59] Artem Bulashev: 1370€ to be exact
[2022-02-17T22:00:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it will look as stock 😊😜😂
[2022-02-17T22:00:11] Artem Bulashev: For having over 600w scooter
[2022-02-17T22:00:29] Artem Bulashev: Yeap 😁😁
[2022-02-17T22:01:54] rosheee: Police took my scooter last sunday
[2022-02-17T22:01:57] rosheee: Shiiit
[2022-02-17T22:02:05] rosheee: Can pickup tomorrow
[2022-02-17T22:02:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ?? how ? why ? which fine ? tu peux m'appeler si tu veux... j'ai pas mal creusé le sujet pour l'ANUMME et discuté avec pas mal de personnes dans le meme cas que toi
[2022-02-17T22:09:54] Luis Magalhaes: autch 🤣 it is what it is go for it
[2022-02-17T22:12:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: when/if I can produce more, costs will clearly reduce (-20 / -40%).
[2022-02-17T22:12:51] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-02-17T22:13:15] Luis Magalhaes: for a bigger batch ?
[2022-02-17T22:13:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. 100 ... 1000 😅
[2022-02-17T22:13:52] Luis Magalhaes: mass production haha
[2022-02-17T22:16:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i've designed it for that yes. I've spend the last few months in this direction (on technical level). prototypes have been running fine for nearly 1 year now. except @SibClimb who burnt 2 ... lol. but it helped me to improve the design
[2022-02-17T22:17:37] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb is very angry driver 🤣🤣
[2022-02-17T22:18:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2022-02-17T22:18:15] sombre_enfant: It will break again the sy8502 market😂😐
[2022-02-17T22:18:24] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2022-02-17T22:18:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😅😅 sy8501 for me ;)
[2022-02-17T22:18:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 100V proof
[2022-02-17T22:18:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: tested during few hours at 100V 😊
[2022-02-17T22:19:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so, 20S with regen ... no issue
[2022-02-17T22:20:38] Artem Bulashev: Problem with those they are super inefficient if current draw is outside specific level (too low)
[2022-02-17T22:21:24] Mirono escooters: Gg sibclimb
[2022-02-17T22:21:30] Artem Bulashev: Saw some people complaining about sy85xx but may just design needs to be adequate
[2022-02-17T22:21:34] Paolo ⁭: Sucé
[2022-02-17T22:22:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: true.... with 20S, you are around here
[2022-02-17T22:22:26] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌👌
[2022-02-17T22:22:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but since I am well below the 1A max, no issue
[2022-02-17T22:22:34] Artem Bulashev: Yeah exactly
[2022-02-17T22:22:57] Artem Bulashev: The lower the less efficient, so Inefficient but also too little Watts in heat to cause problems right?
[2022-02-17T22:23:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, I've designed the PCB to dissipate as energy as possible
[2022-02-17T22:24:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if I remember, we measured it at 45°C after 1 night at 100V
[2022-02-17T22:24:38] Artem Bulashev: Good than 👌
[2022-02-17T22:24:38] Face de Pin Sucé: thank you boys
[2022-02-17T22:24:53] Artem Bulashev: Nice testing
[2022-02-17T22:25:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we even added 100mA load (expansion boards) 🤣🤣
[2022-02-17T22:26:00] Artem Bulashev: 😄 what is that for, 100ma ? 😄
[2022-02-17T22:26:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: expansion boards like RTC/time, lights (only logic part, it will be isolated), temp/humidity sensors
[2022-02-17T22:27:01] Artem Bulashev: 100v * 0.1v = 10w = 2a at 5v
[2022-02-17T22:27:17] Artem Bulashev: Ok ok 👌
[2022-02-17T22:27:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, no, 100mA at 5V ;)
[2022-02-17T22:27:47] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok so yeah sensors type of extensions
[2022-02-17T22:28:00] Artem Bulashev: May be battery temp sensor and humidity yeah nice
[2022-02-17T22:28:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ~0.2A (for smartdisplay) + 0.1A @5V
[2022-02-17T22:30:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so ... 0.3A@5V used with ... let's say 60% efficiency => 2.5W (and 1W to dissipate)
[2022-02-17T23:55:21] Artem Bulashev: Yeah not much 👌
[2022-02-17T23:55:50] Artem Bulashev: But that pcb sure is will help
[2022-02-18T10:57:41] D J: my next update for kaabo wolf 😁
[2022-02-18T13:23:48] Luis Magalhaes: What are you w Still waiting? 😂

[2022-02-18T13:32:47] Face de Pin Sucé: 😁😁
[2022-02-18T13:33:46] D J: it was already a problem to install 4mm high temperature silicone cables...more installing hall sensor...too much work for me. I'm getting lazy 🙈
[2022-02-18T13:34:51] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-02-18T13:35:28] Luis Magalhaes: thats still my big problem the halls 😂
[2022-02-18T16:56:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: does any body use 2 single-core vesc ?
[2022-02-18T16:58:06] Mirono escooters: What would be thé point?
[2022-02-18T17:01:25] Happy Giraffe: Space
[2022-02-18T17:01:37] Happy Giraffe: And future upgrade from 1wd-AWD
[2022-02-18T17:02:07] Mirono escooters: Mjeh ok
[2022-02-18T17:02:20] Mirono escooters: But cooling of single is worse, and power, and eastness of use
[2022-02-18T17:04:11] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2022-02-18T17:06:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: some high end VESC only comes in single core (Tronic for example)
[2022-02-18T17:07:40] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2022-02-18T17:08:00] Happy Giraffe: Their website is weird, is it legit?
[2022-02-18T17:09:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, some people already received their Tronic
[2022-02-18T17:09:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: same for Little Foccers
[2022-02-18T17:09:19] Happy Giraffe: I guess cooling is properly done
[2022-02-18T17:09:37] Paolo ⁭: gal thomps ask peole to change termal pad due to dissipatiopn issue

[2022-02-19T23:55:45] Artem Bulashev: Nice that’s what I recommended to Adam, great welder even in stock for good money. What was wrong with stock power board?
[2022-02-20T00:01:12] Paolo ⁭: Because I use 3 lipo for prevent overheating of lipo, but 3 lipo means bigger short circuit current and if exceed mosfet limit you can get fireworks . If you use one lipo only for fast welding you will damage lipo, I’ve already burned one and cost me 70€ new lipo (cnhl 9500mAh 3s 180C)
[2022-02-20T00:01:34] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2022-02-20T00:01:39] Artem Bulashev: I use 2s
[2022-02-20T00:01:41] Artem Bulashev: On power
[2022-02-20T00:02:03] Artem Bulashev: And than small step up converter inside case to power logic
[2022-02-20T00:02:29] Artem Bulashev: I use 10ah 200c lipo
[2022-02-20T00:03:13] Paolo ⁭: Higher voltage is better
[2022-02-20T00:03:23] Paolo ⁭: As least 3s recommend
[2022-02-20T00:04:13] Paolo ⁭: I = V/R
[2022-02-20T00:04:19] Artem Bulashev: Actually
[2022-02-20T00:04:42] Artem Bulashev: Malectrics told be that welding happens at constant voltage 5-6v
[2022-02-20T00:05:00] Artem Bulashev: So anything above is being brought down
[2022-02-20T00:05:13] Artem Bulashev: So 2s will heat up fets the least
[2022-02-20T00:05:32] Artem Bulashev: But less convenient than 3s because need minimum 10v for logic
[2022-02-20T00:05:40] Artem Bulashev: 🤷‍♂️
[2022-02-20T00:05:55] Paolo ⁭: It’s logic😅 less power less heat
[2022-02-20T00:06:15] Artem Bulashev: I know
[2022-02-20T00:06:21] Artem Bulashev: But my fets are cold
[2022-02-20T00:06:25] rosheee: so if i take 20x2S1P i can go 40S20P
[2022-02-20T00:06:26] Artem Bulashev: Even welding copper
[2022-02-20T00:06:57] rosheee: u're from cold destination
[2022-02-20T00:07:02] Artem Bulashev: They said that excessive voltage only goes to waist
[2022-02-20T00:07:08] Artem Bulashev: As if they are stepping it down
[2022-02-20T00:07:16] Paolo ⁭: I haven’t anything heat problem on my power board
[2022-02-20T00:07:25] rosheee: heat?
[2022-02-20T00:07:27] Paolo ⁭: I’ve also integrated ntc for measure temps
[2022-02-20T00:07:33] Artem Bulashev: 👌 nice
[2022-02-20T00:07:47] Artem Bulashev: Just sharing their comment :)
[2022-02-20T00:07:53] Paolo ⁭: Copper needs big current :(

[2022-02-20T00:08:43] Paolo ⁭: If you see point are very profound
[2022-02-20T00:08:56] Paolo ⁭: That’s pure nickel not steel plated
[2022-02-20T00:08:59] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2022-02-20T00:09:11] Artem Bulashev: They look goood

[2022-02-20T00:09:25] Paolo ⁭: Copper help me very much to reduce voltage drop
[2022-02-20T00:09:38] rosheee: copper x nickel
[2022-02-20T00:10:01] Paolo ⁭: Generally in big battery I don’t use nickel
[2022-02-20T00:10:08] Paolo ⁭: Just copper directly
[2022-02-20T00:10:11] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I get 3.5v drop only at 60a load on my 60v28ah 35e cells
[2022-02-20T00:10:20] rosheee: copper and then nickel on top

[2022-02-20T00:11:48] rosheee: btw i measured with police today
[2022-02-20T00:12:06] rosheee: dualmotor vesc (spintend) set to 250W MAX and 25kmh
[2022-02-20T00:12:17] rosheee: gets out 665W
[2022-02-20T00:12:38] Artem Bulashev: Emm
[2022-02-20T00:12:42] Artem Bulashev: How
[2022-02-20T00:12:56] Artem Bulashev: Police machine is wrong than
[2022-02-20T00:13:15] Artem Bulashev: Because vesc has direct read out of amps going and voltage = watts
[2022-02-20T00:13:19] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2022-02-20T00:13:42] Artem Bulashev: Oh wait
[2022-02-20T00:13:50] Artem Bulashev: Police machine measures MAXIMUM
[2022-02-20T00:14:02] Artem Bulashev: law is directed - nominal power 250w
[2022-02-20T00:14:06] Artem Bulashev: Not maximum
[2022-02-20T00:14:55] Artem Bulashev: Also I think police machine manual stated margin of error - and it is huge
[2022-02-20T00:15:42] rosheee: vesc says 250W
[2022-02-20T00:15:50] rosheee: i also told police wtf
[2022-02-20T00:15:54] rosheee: police also thought wtf
[2022-02-20T00:15:58] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2022-02-20T00:15:59] Paolo ⁭: Only?
[2022-02-20T00:16:06] rosheee: because uphill i reached with 250W max top speed of 18kmh
[2022-02-20T00:16:16] rosheee: police was like "lol"
[2022-02-20T00:16:19] rosheee: i was like
[2022-02-20T00:16:25] Paolo ⁭: In my blade I have 7v drop at 60A
[2022-02-20T00:16:26] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-02-20T00:16:36] rosheee: 20V drop at 150A
[2022-02-20T00:16:43] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-02-20T00:17:06] Artem Bulashev: 150mm of 0.1mm copper + pure nickel between each series 14 series are head to tail = so interconnection Is not 18mm, but more like 0.4mm, because I compressed them super close and most series fold down touching each other - so direct jump

I was at 30ms for .1 nickel plated steel tabs and .1 copper. Absolutely solid solid welds

[2022-02-20T12:41:24] Mirono escooters: Cnhl 🤤i use 2 in parallel
[2022-02-20T12:41:46] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2022-02-20T12:41:48] Artem Bulashev: Same they have great lipos also GNB
[2022-02-20T12:42:22] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-02-20T12:42:25] Mirono escooters: I prefer cnhl tho
[2022-02-20T12:42:31] Mirono escooters: Also for drone flying
[2022-02-20T12:43:09] Artem Bulashev: I have not used Cnhl for drone, use turnigy graphen or GNB
[2022-02-20T12:43:15] Artem Bulashev: Will have to try some
[2022-02-20T12:49:08] sombre_enfant: At this era how did u brake ?
[2022-02-20T12:49:42] sombre_enfant: Bienvenue a bord du tgv en direction de barbes
[2022-02-20T12:53:39] rosheee: Ground xD because never had a brake
[2022-02-20T12:53:52] rosheee: The shoebrake xD
[2022-02-20T12:54:06] Mirono escooters: Super idea

[2022-02-20T13:51:36] Happy Giraffe: Are EIG out of business for good now? The C020 cells looked really cheap for what they can do😭

[2022-02-20T15:07:52] Paolo ⁭: It’s impossible to curve with WEPED bro
[2022-02-20T15:08:05] Paolo ⁭: @SibClimb
[2022-02-20T15:17:18] Unknown: Nice looking rides. Weped is really sharp. I like the black with small red accents. What is the scoot on the left?
[2022-02-20T15:18:59] Unknown: You good man? Let me know if you need any guidance 👍
[2022-02-20T15:20:06] Paolo ⁭: Mine self
[2022-02-20T15:20:18] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-02-20T15:20:42] Paolo ⁭: I’m not able with speed, road are very insane for 11 inch scoot
[2022-02-20T15:29:13] D J: Very fast
[2022-02-20T15:34:39] Luis Magalhaes: Need pmt 😂 i see the blade is back on road 👌
[2022-02-20T15:34:55] Paolo ⁭: This is blade Luis
[2022-02-20T15:35:44] Luis Magalhaes: I was seeing it now 😁👍
[2022-02-20T15:46:21] Unknown: Scoot on the left next to Weped is Blade? Blade GT?
[2022-02-20T15:46:54] Paolo ⁭: Only frame of blade
[2022-02-20T15:50:45] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-02-20T15:50:54] Luis Magalhaes: Blade upgrated
[2022-02-20T15:51:23] Unknown: Gotcha. So that is basically what a blade frame looks like in real life. Their website isn't great.
[2022-02-20T15:51:33] Unknown: Everything upgraded around here 💪
[2022-02-20T15:52:55] Unknown: 20s9p almost completed. Just need some final touches and as150s. Controllers are already converted to as150 👍. They're beautiful bullet to solder, love the solder port. All bullets should have those
[2022-02-20T15:52:55] Unknown: <photos/photo_2595@20-02-2022_15-52-55.jpg>
[2022-02-20T16:08:16] Luis Magalhaes: True 😂
[2022-02-20T16:46:50] Dejan Avramovic: Something like that makes my heart ❤ beat faster☺
[2022-02-20T17:01:12] Face de Pin Sucé: You bad driver :*

[2022-02-20T17:38:30] Luis Magalhaes: Autch 😂
[2022-02-20T17:39:01] Luis Magalhaes: Pmt?

[2022-02-20T18:06:17] rosheee: <photos/photo_2598@20-02-2022_18-06-17.jpg>
[2022-02-20T18:07:01] rosheee: Nice
[2022-02-20T18:07:14] rosheee: Nice
[2022-02-20T18:07:27] rosheee: So how put ferrofluid on?
[2022-02-20T18:07:30] rosheee: Please :-D
[2022-02-20T18:13:36] Face de Pin Sucé: nope
[2022-02-20T18:14:01] Artem Bulashev: In between magnets
[2022-02-20T18:14:52] Luis Magalhaes: But it's better with pmt right? I like more the look of it too 😂
[2022-02-20T18:15:47] Unknown: https://youtu.be/JFzICi-AMeQ
[2022-02-20T18:21:13] Unknown: I would probably put the stator in first
[2022-02-20T18:21:24] Unknown: And then inject 5ml or so into the air gap
[2022-02-20T18:22:35] Unknown: When ferrofluid is done before the stator is put in, when it snaps in place I can cause the ferrofluid to sort splash out or around. Probably won't lose much or any but it a little cleaner doing after stator is in place
[2022-02-20T18:24:00] Unknown: You don't need to do anything special really, just inject it near the magnets and I'll will get sucked in place and stick. Doesn't really even need to be even all the way around, it will place itself. There are E-bike hub motors that have a ferrofluid port on the motor cover. Those are done by simply injecting into the port and then the magnets grab it from there
[2022-02-20T18:24:36] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't like PMT on Weped
[2022-02-20T18:25:55] Luis Magalhaes: Really? Why? It slips more because of the surface??
[2022-02-20T18:26:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Shinko tyres are so damn soft
[2022-02-20T18:26:20] Face de Pin Sucé: never slip
[2022-02-20T18:26:33] Face de Pin Sucé: PMT stradale, harder so can slip
[2022-02-20T18:29:26] Luis Magalhaes: Hum ok, i was thinking it was because of the surface contact of the rubber, the shinko looks to have more contact but should feel like you ar droping when you curve
[2022-02-20T18:29:33] Luis Magalhaes: That was my idea
[2022-02-20T18:34:44] Face de Pin Sucé: it feels like you're dropping when curving
[2022-02-20T18:34:47] Face de Pin Sucé: but it's not x)
[2022-02-20T18:59:24] Luis Magalhaes: Yes 😂 just the feeling of a cliff but then you have rubber 😁
[2022-02-20T19:15:18] Face de Pin Sucé: 😆
[2022-02-20T19:16:53] Paolo ⁭: Sucé

[2022-02-20T19:27:12] Happy Giraffe: Good
[2022-02-20T19:27:38] Happy Giraffe: Now seal motor with silicone and use eye protection when putting stator in
[2022-02-20T19:28:21] Happy Giraffe: You don't want the tiny particles in your eyes😂
[2022-02-20T19:28:30] rosheee: Silicon?!
[2022-02-20T19:28:36] rosheee: <voice_message>
[2022-02-20T19:28:59] Happy Giraffe: Make motor waterproof, also helps with keeping ferrofluid alive longer as it doesnt leak out etc I think
[2022-02-20T19:29:14] rosheee: Ah it never had silicon
[2022-02-20T19:29:30] rosheee: <photos/photo_2600@20-02-2022_19-29-30.jpg>

[2022-02-20T19:29:51] rosheee: Hmm i open my motors tomorrow xD
[2022-02-20T19:29:57] rosheee: Damn silicon

[2022-02-20T21:47:39] Artem Bulashev: How many amps load on battery?
[2022-02-20T21:50:58] Paolo ⁭: Idk, kelly haven’t Bluetooth
[2022-02-20T22:13:12] Happy Giraffe: Isnt it optional add-on?
[2022-02-20T22:14:59] Paolo ⁭: Anyway not current information
[2022-02-20T22:16:10] Luis Magalhaes: Program and use forget the data 😂
[2022-02-20T22:22:06] Happy Giraffe: That's not why we bought vescs😡

[2022-02-20T22:27:21] Paolo ⁭: 🥖
[2022-02-20T22:28:45] Luis Magalhaes: True, vesc has a better software
[2022-02-20T22:28:55] sombre_enfant: Did the boyuda was good ? I wonder how the jp 45a controller behave do it give 200A phase
[2022-02-20T22:29:49] Luis Magalhaes: 🛴🔥
[2022-02-20T22:30:13] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2022-02-20T22:30:24] Happy Giraffe: Atleast more parameters to fuck with😂
[2022-02-20T22:30:44] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂
[2022-02-20T22:30:45] Happy Giraffe: Whats your consumption per KM guys?
[2022-02-20T22:31:03] Paolo ⁭: Idk, front motor wasn’t work
[2022-02-20T22:31:21] Luis Magalhaes: Maybe with koxx display theres more information 😂
[2022-02-20T22:32:09] Happy Giraffe: It will be really interesting to try ebike hub motor on vesc vs. scooter motor
[2022-02-20T22:32:14] Paolo ⁭: Just nuc is good option too
[2022-02-20T22:32:51] Paolo ⁭: For ebike is better use a seriously controller like Kelly or sabvoton
[2022-02-20T22:33:03] Luis Magalhaes: True but the time you have to wait for one 😅
[2022-02-20T22:33:04] Paolo ⁭: Scooter motor is little and consumption less
[2022-02-20T22:34:20] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu no videos of the ride? 😁
[2022-02-20T22:35:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: kelly provide currents on serial link (i don't remember if it phase or battery) 😉
[2022-02-20T22:35:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and controller temperature, and voltage
[2022-02-20T22:36:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but far less infos than vesc
[2022-02-20T22:38:07] Luis Magalhaes: Vesc is way better to see all 😂
[2022-02-20T22:38:32] Luis Magalhaes: Really like the software
[2022-02-20T22:38:48] Artem Bulashev: I think because it is SW first
[2022-02-20T22:39:02] Artem Bulashev: And HW second, so much more developed
[2022-02-20T22:39:59] Happy Giraffe: I only use Mxus 3K turbo motor, 60v and 60A will be perfect for it. If I take more the bike frame will crack in half. Thats already 140nm torque😅
[2022-02-20T22:40:24] sombre_enfant: Yyk
[2022-02-20T22:40:42] sombre_enfant: Yuanxi are good aswell
[2022-02-20T22:40:45] Happy Giraffe: Whats the consumption of your setup?😳
[2022-02-20T22:41:01] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-02-20T22:41:06] Artem Bulashev: 30a battery each
[2022-02-20T22:41:14] Happy Giraffe: Power consumption Wh/km
[2022-02-20T22:41:25] Artem Bulashev: Oh don’t know
[2022-02-20T22:41:27] Artem Bulashev: Wait
[2022-02-20T22:44:10] Artem Bulashev: Used to be slower and higher consumption on 52v 5.2 fw
[2022-02-20T22:44:28] Artem Bulashev: Than I updated to 60v and consumption dropped
[2022-02-20T22:44:53] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2607@20-02-2022_22-44-53.jpg>
[2022-02-20T22:45:14] Paolo ⁭: Yea but can’t seen by app
[2022-02-20T22:45:37] Happy Giraffe: Damn, thats nice. I think 48v not really optimal for (my)single motor anyways
[2022-02-20T22:45:49] Paolo ⁭: Next time I will do
[2022-02-20T22:45:55] Paolo ⁭: I have little battery
[2022-02-20T22:45:58] Artem Bulashev: Mine is dual, used to be 52v 14s than 60v 16s
[2022-02-20T22:46:15] Artem Bulashev: Oh yours
[2022-02-20T22:46:20] Happy Giraffe: Thats nice, I had almost double range during summer weathers
[2022-02-20T22:46:23] Artem Bulashev: What is yours ?
[2022-02-20T22:46:36] Happy Giraffe: 13s6p Blade motor
[2022-02-20T22:46:43] Happy Giraffe: 47/135A
[2022-02-20T22:46:45] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2022-02-20T22:47:05] Luis Magalhaes: Little batery on scooter?
[2022-02-20T22:47:31] Artem Bulashev: 1680wh battery should give me 63km going all out 27wh/km
[2022-02-20T22:47:32] Paolo ⁭: 28Ah only fo 300A power 😂
[2022-02-20T22:49:32] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-02-20T22:49:47] Artem Bulashev: Though I know 52v 13ah = 676wh gave me 30km full to dead even though math says it should be 21km - I guess vesc reduces current as your battery gets low and that extends nicely the range
[2022-02-20T22:50:09] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu Just for 400meter 😂
[2022-02-20T22:51:56] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, usually first 50% gives more than second🤔
[2022-02-20T22:52:18] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-02-20T22:52:35] Happy Giraffe: I will do similar tests with ebike and then see which is more efficient, tho bike will be 16s9p/10p
[2022-02-20T22:53:56] Luis Magalhaes: Pedro is doing a 30T 16s8P for my wolf 😂
[2022-02-20T22:54:34] Happy Giraffe: Nkon once welded cells for 2€?
[2022-02-20T22:54:44] Luis Magalhaes: But can use the battery i have in parallel just to have more range 😂
[2022-02-20T22:55:48] Luis Magalhaes: They were cheap when i bought dont remeber the price but i think its a little more
[2022-02-20T22:56:13] Luis Magalhaes: 8P was the max i can fit inside the deck at the time
[2022-02-20T22:56:34] Luis Magalhaes: Now i will use the controllers outside 😅
[2022-02-20T22:58:27] Paolo ⁭: You’re from Portugal?

[2022-02-20T23:08:39] Paolo ⁭: Original wasn’t 28?
[2022-02-20T23:08:42] Luis Magalhaes: Was to get more discharge amps

[2022-02-21T14:38:26] rosheee: i called the swiss federal roads office

[2022-02-21T14:49:35] Happy Giraffe: I will buy 1000w sticker on the QS205 v3 or Mxus 3K turbo lol
[2022-02-21T14:50:00] Happy Giraffe: Preferably metal one that I double component glue to it😂

[2022-02-21T14:51:20] Happy Giraffe: Only legal thing is to pay taxes and die. Luckily in Finland I can use "1000w" motor on bike and pay 70€ insurance to use throttle🌚
[2022-02-21T14:52:01] Happy Giraffe: When exiting central areas the profiles somehow change and its wheelie time😂

[2022-02-21T15:47:15] Unknown: 😎
[2022-02-21T15:48:21] Unknown: Measuring skills came in real handy LoL. BMS is live and all connectors are on. Just need to wire up my lights and tidy up some wires
[2022-02-21T16:58:13] Paolo ⁭: No wrap rip
[2022-02-21T17:00:16] Unknown: LoL. Nah. I have tons of kapton and fish paper. Plenty of protection, overkill protection. BMS on top would be ugly with wrap and I want access to the wires.
[2022-02-21T17:01:31] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-02-21T17:01:37] Unknown: I like being able to see and move the balance wires if needed. I might put a few small piece of heat shrink, like a few small bands. One over the BMS and maybe one at the front and one at the rear
[2022-02-21T17:01:55] Unknown: Ahhh
[2022-02-21T17:02:17] Unknown: Damn bro, tryin to give a seizure 😂
[2022-02-21T17:03:20] Unknown: Cool thing is.. it's nice n tight in the deck so won't be able to shift around. Have 2.5mm thermal pad underneath to cushion the bottom and draw heat away
[2022-02-21T17:04:43] Unknown: Not sure what benefit heat shrink would give other than a factory finish look. I sort of like the DIY look of it being unwrapped. Only have ugly ass blue anyways lol
[2022-02-21T18:58:17] Luis Magalhaes: Wolf motors with more then 10k km
[2022-02-21T18:58:18] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_2629@21-02-2022_18-58-18.jpg>
[2022-02-21T18:58:19] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-02-21T18:59:33] Mirono escooters: Or get clear wrap :)
[2022-02-21T18:59:39] Mirono escooters: I used kapton long too. Works fine
[2022-02-21T19:04:26] Unknown: It's to make it water and moisture proof but mostly it's to hide shitty work. But it looks clean with wrap it helps also a bit for structure fortifying. There are many colors blue red black and clear.
[2022-02-21T19:37:35] Paolo ⁭: Seen still good
[2022-02-21T19:57:23] Luis Magalhaes: Yes looks good, the isolation of the cables is cracked in some places but the rest seems ok
[2022-02-21T19:58:59] sombre_enfant: Where the hall😐
[2022-02-21T20:01:38] Luis Magalhaes: no halls in this😅 im trying to add it
[2022-02-21T20:17:08] Paolo ⁭: 👎👎👎👎
[2022-02-21T20:17:46] Paolo ⁭: Add statorade
[2022-02-21T20:34:31] D J: this will help to do what?
[2022-02-21T20:35:32] D J: Wolf power 💪
[2022-02-21T20:39:03] Paolo ⁭: Heat dissipation, major power supported
[2022-02-21T20:41:24] D J: Good to now. I have my motors now open to change cables that are dried out. if that helps with heat dissipation then maybe I'll take advantage of them being open
[2022-02-21T20:41:36] D J: Thanks 👌
[2022-02-21T20:55:52] Luis Magalhaes: cooling
[2022-02-21T20:57:18] D J: Another thing I have to do 🙂
[2022-02-21T21:01:33] Paolo ⁭: Holes + ferrofluid is top
[2022-02-21T21:08:39] rosheee: no FIRE IN THE HOLE!
[2022-02-21T21:08:49] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-21T21:08:51] Unknown: Have a feeling it might slosh around a bit and leak out of open vent holes. Have you run motors with ferrofluid and cooling holes in the motor covers? I only ask because Grin Tech recommends sealing the motor covers to avoid loss of fluid... So logic tells me holes might leak
[2022-02-21T21:09:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: my ferofluid seems to act nicely. -5/10°C for now. need to test with a big climb
[2022-02-21T21:09:21] Unknown: Nice man. 5ml per motor?
[2022-02-21T21:09:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: less, but my motos are small
[2022-02-21T21:09:58] Unknown: Ahh gotcha
[2022-02-21T21:11:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: magnets gaps are filed, but magnets are verrrry close.
[2022-02-21T21:17:53] Paolo ⁭: holes help more, because hot air haven’t an escape, better air circulation is better solution. But you have a risk of water and other things

[2022-02-22T02:04:39] rosheee: u save me like 3h of traveling
[2022-02-22T02:04:46] rosheee: then i can put it into fusion or AUTOCAD
[2022-02-22T02:04:46] Unknown: Do you have the Vsett deck gasket?? It's the perfect template
[2022-02-22T02:04:51] rosheee: i have no vsett
[2022-02-22T02:04:54] Unknown: That would be amazing
[2022-02-22T02:05:02] rosheee: and the guy who sells vsett here hasn't it in stock
[2022-02-22T02:05:13] Unknown: Oh oh.. ok... Then yea man.. I have it out right now anyways
[2022-02-22T02:05:31] rosheee: when i have the exact measurements i make it tonight or as soon i ahve them
[2022-02-22T02:05:53] Artem Bulashev: 🤝 man if some one could 3d cad trace out that thing once all finalized that would be awesome 😎 may be that is off topic for this group though
[2022-02-22T02:06:17] rosheee: yah ^^ tudor asked me
[2022-02-22T02:06:20] rosheee: and i said i do it
[2022-02-22T02:06:22] Unknown: Gotcha gotcha... I made mine based off the rubber gasket template. I used 19mm (3/4" for American imperial dummies) PVC board, like plywood but PVC
[2022-02-22T02:06:22] rosheee: then measured wrong
[2022-02-22T02:06:46] rosheee: me dont even have vsett but if you could provide me the infos :D
[2022-02-22T02:06:55] rosheee: send u the file and u can put ur name in it ^^
[2022-02-22T02:06:58] Unknown: Of course
[2022-02-22T02:07:04] rosheee: as the original masterblaster
[2022-02-22T02:07:39] Unknown: 😎... I would love to have access to the file is all. Mine is handmade so it has It's flaws... A 3d printed one or CNC machined would be amazing
[2022-02-22T02:11:28] Unknown: Total width 194-195mm Inner width is 170-171mm

[2022-02-22T02:14:18] Paolo ⁭: Common hobby😍
[2022-02-22T02:14:25] Unknown: I made notches for the wires to enter the deck at the top of the spacer since my coolers are mounted outside

[2022-02-22T02:16:08] rosheee: perfect
[2022-02-22T02:16:11] rosheee: should be easy
[2022-02-22T02:16:16] rosheee: thank you very much
[2022-02-22T02:16:19] Unknown: Used to be. Racing drones were my love, unfortunately sold them all except a few. DX9, icharger, lipo's, goggles, the whole deal...sold. Before that I flew 700-800 size RC helicopters, which are enormous.
[2022-02-22T02:17:17] Paolo ⁭: I got freestyle
[2022-02-22T02:17:18] Unknown: You're very welcome. Any questions let me know. I would suggest Tudor to drill the screw holes since those need to be exact placement... But I can provide the measurements for them if you need
[2022-02-22T02:17:32] rosheee: i make the ground design first
[2022-02-22T02:17:46] rosheee: or maybe paolo is superfast and done it by now XD
[2022-02-22T02:17:50] Unknown: These 2 are freestyle, took the cameras off and flew line of sight acro the last few months I was into it
[2022-02-22T02:18:00] Paolo ⁭: DJI?
[2022-02-22T02:18:06] Paolo ⁭: Or old analogic
[2022-02-22T02:18:29] Unknown: Nah.. all custom built from race/acro frames, built from scratch.
[2022-02-22T02:18:41] rosheee: team black sheeep
[2022-02-22T02:18:53] rosheee: crossfire xD
[2022-02-22T02:19:01] Unknown: Haha that was my first. Forget the name of it!
[2022-02-22T02:19:25] Paolo ⁭: And so?😂 DJI system can be installed anywhere
[2022-02-22T02:19:42] Unknown: That one came prebuilt. But from there always built my own from scratch.
[2022-02-22T02:19:58] rosheee: can ddj go 0-200 in 3sec?
[2022-02-22T02:20:10] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-02-22T02:20:18] Paolo ⁭: What is ddj
[2022-02-22T02:20:23] rosheee: dji sry xd
[2022-02-22T02:20:26] rosheee: ddj is pioneer
[2022-02-22T02:20:30] Unknown: True true.. I would use omnibus f4 and f7 gyros
[2022-02-22T02:20:35] Paolo ⁭: DJI is only transmitter system
[2022-02-22T02:20:56] rosheee: i have no idea i thought crossfire is it
[2022-02-22T02:21:03] Paolo ⁭: Ive recycled all damaged f4 from fc to does vesc prototype
[2022-02-22T02:21:28] Paolo ⁭: This is radio transmitter, for control drone. DJI is video transmitter
[2022-02-22T02:22:59] rosheee: u use this 1W things?
[2022-02-22T02:23:05] rosheee: where u can go like 30-50km?
[2022-02-22T02:23:09] rosheee: transmitter

[2022-02-22T02:25:52] Paolo ⁭: Give me f4😍
[2022-02-22T02:26:00] Unknown: All custom built from scratch. No DJI system just F4 gyros boards, custom motors, and 20-30a escs. Blheli and betaflight were my VESC Tool haha
[2022-02-22T02:26:23] Unknown: F7 is now standard from I hear
[2022-02-22T02:26:43] Paolo ⁭: But f4 can be recycled for vesc 😏
[2022-02-22T02:27:00] Unknown: Ohh.. interesting
[2022-02-22T02:27:08] Unknown: Didn't think of that LoL
[2022-02-22T02:27:25] Unknown: I have a few..
[2022-02-22T02:28:16] Unknown: Blheli_32 was 32 bit VESC protocol for drone escs. I'm actually very familiar with VESC because of those. All escs we're VESC based
[2022-02-22T02:28:47] Unknown: And also why I call our controllers "ESCs" 🤣 old habit
[2022-02-22T02:29:53] Unknown: Sorry for off topic blowing up the chat, but yea... Was huge huge into Heli's and drone's. Now I love scooters

[2022-02-22T02:36:31] Artem Bulashev: Came to racing drones from Ultra long range Fpv planes 45+ km
[2022-02-22T02:38:20] Paolo ⁭: Orqa👎👎
[2022-02-22T02:38:26] Paolo ⁭: For that price buy DJI
[2022-02-22T02:38:57] Paolo ⁭: Uhhh esc designed by my friend :)
[2022-02-22T02:38:59] Paolo ⁭: ZEEZ
[2022-02-22T02:40:45] Unknown: I knew we had a lot in common! 😂
[2022-02-22T02:43:39] Artem Bulashev: Zeez are amazing
[2022-02-22T02:44:18] Unknown: Guys.. how would be able to wrap this battery being such an odd shape?? Should I? Wrap the whole thing?
[2022-02-22T02:44:55] Artem Bulashev: Orqa I got used for 300€ 😎😎 because they were scratched, I dipped them in custom print foil and for that price is was great 👍
[2022-02-22T02:45:40] Unknown: Or maybe something like this?
[2022-02-22T02:46:18] Artem Bulashev: Just wrap the whole thing :)and shrink it as much as you can
[2022-02-22T02:46:19] Unknown: Nice man. I'm vaguely familiar with them. Damn, brings me back
[2022-02-22T02:46:41] Artem Bulashev: May be than use exact knife to cut around BMS higher section
[2022-02-22T02:46:49] Unknown: Yea?? LoL I like being able to see my BMS and wires. Is that weird?
[2022-02-22T02:46:57] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2671@22-02-2022_02-46-57.jpg>
[2022-02-22T02:47:10] Artem Bulashev: Or don’t :)
[2022-02-22T02:47:39] Unknown: Hmm.. yea ok. What about the main wires, since they don't come out of the front/back directly, they're sort of laying on top
[2022-02-22T02:49:03] Unknown: @PaoloWu was giving me shit for not having it wrapped and you asked about it as well... So now I'm second guessing myself thinking maybe I should 🤦🏻
[2022-02-22T02:49:42] Unknown: Not sure what to do about the main wires is all... Maybe I'll do the "spot shrink" method LoL
[2022-02-22T02:50:13] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-02-22T02:50:24] Unknown: 🙄
[2022-02-22T02:51:37] rosheee: ah shiiit
[2022-02-22T02:52:29] Unknown: I've seen one too many of those unicycle crashes to be at all interested in them. I don't think an unwrapped battery is on the same stupidity level as that 😭
[2022-02-22T04:32:25] Unknown: Laugh all you want 😂😂 it's functional, not fabulous. At least BMS is secure and main positive/negative plates have another layer of protection. Plus definitely added some rigidity to the pack. Solid like a brick
[2022-02-22T04:32:26] Unknown: <photos/photo_2673@22-02-2022_04-32-26.jpg>
[2022-02-22T04:34:26] Unknown: Does look a little hideous I will admit
[2022-02-22T04:35:20] Artem Bulashev: I’m confused
[2022-02-22T04:35:38] Artem Bulashev: That’s supposed to be single sheet of heat shrink
[2022-02-22T04:35:43] Artem Bulashev: Normally
[2022-02-22T04:35:46] Artem Bulashev: 😅😊
[2022-02-22T04:36:32] Artem Bulashev: Also why didn’t you route the black gnd wires from BMS under shrink wrap to it’s locations next to power wires ?
[2022-02-22T04:37:07] Artem Bulashev: Also why do you need such long power wires? Went your controller power plugs right on top of battery?
[2022-02-22T04:44:56] Unknown: I have a strange fear of ever cutting my wires too short... So I left them long... I know I know. I had the battery in the deck and found that routing them the way I did was best, I still need to fit my uLight module and some wires on top as well, so didn't want to restrict my power wire routes
[2022-02-22T04:46:16] rosheee: U can always shorten BUT NOT LONGER
[2022-02-22T04:46:18] Unknown: From my heli/drone days... I've cut wires too short one too many times and have lived with the regret.. the fear... Power wires are hard soldered to PCB so if end up short, I'm F'd. I can always shorten them if needed, can't add to 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-02-22T04:46:21] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-22T04:47:14] Unknown: I get your point 100x over... It's a mental thing for me. Please excuse my brain 😃
[2022-02-22T04:54:53] Unknown: The negative wires take a funky route to controller negative, especially on the opposite side. Heatshrinking them in place would have been difficult get get perfect
[2022-02-22T04:56:14] Unknown: @artBula your advice and suggestions are always appreciated, you know that, but trust me on this one LoL

[2022-02-22T12:15:42] D J: Now just wait
[2022-02-22T12:16:01] Face de Pin Sucé: spintend ?
[2022-02-22T12:16:27] D J: Yes
[2022-02-22T12:19:06] D J: since I'm going to need help, I already know where to ask 😊 here the guys already have good experience with VESC and I don't
[2022-02-22T12:21:40] Face de Pin Sucé: yeah we have few working everyday
[2022-02-22T13:17:55] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2022-02-22T13:18:12] Happy Giraffe: Btw anyone with single ubox you want to actually bolt it down upside down to actually cool the case
[2022-02-22T13:18:12] Happy Giraffe: Bolting the bottom to the scooter frame doesnt cool anything except maybe the 2w ARM chip😂
[2022-02-22T13:18:12] Happy Giraffe: Remember to open it up and clean solder balls, especially from power board side. You might want to get also spare thermal pads like Thermal Grizzly Minus pad 12x2cm 1mm
[2022-02-22T13:18:12] Happy Giraffe: Opening the vesc for cleaning might compromise the stock pads, mounting it in a box outside so the top part of case gets airflow will be best for cooling
[2022-02-22T13:18:12] Happy Giraffe: Lastly ordering 2x ADC adapters also recommended as they tend to not work sometimes (and gluing the switch to 5v position if you use that as even 0.1mm travel is enough to make it not work)😅
[2022-02-22T13:18:19] Happy Giraffe: Daniel
[2022-02-22T13:19:03] Happy Giraffe: Depending what vesc you ordered but generally same things apply, copy-pasted old comments
[2022-02-22T13:19:45] Luis Magalhaes: Spintend
[2022-02-22T13:20:18] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-22T13:55:51] D J: Ok good idea thermal pads
[2022-02-22T13:57:15] D J: yes I want to apply the spintend in a box outside the scooter to get better cooling
[2022-02-22T13:57:26] Happy Giraffe: It already has but they might perform bad, so might need replacement for Single ubox
[2022-02-22T13:57:30] D J: Exactly 😁
[2022-02-22T13:57:39] Happy Giraffe: You buy Single or Dual?
[2022-02-22T13:57:53] D J: Dual...75/100x2
[2022-02-22T13:58:10] Happy Giraffe: Dual has better cooling so you should be good there
[2022-02-22T13:58:21] Happy Giraffe: Single is designed with ass and brain swapped
[2022-02-22T13:59:16] D J: I only ordered one 😔
[2022-02-22T14:00:19] D J: as this will be important, open and clean these solder balls
[2022-02-22T14:01:09] Happy Giraffe: Then be careful and only connect things when vesc is off and motor not spinning
[2022-02-22T14:01:34] D J: Thanks 👌
[2022-02-22T14:01:57] Happy Giraffe: And never switcy 5v-3.3v mode on adc adapter when vesc turned on, you should be good (you set it once matching your throttle and brake and thats it)
[2022-02-22T14:04:04] D J: I I'm absorbing information. thank you!
[2022-02-22T14:10:59] Happy Giraffe: You welcome👍

[2022-02-22T14:38:16] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-02-22T14:39:01] Luis Magalhaes: I did not broke the adc adaptor, if its to burn something is the ubox 😂
[2022-02-22T14:39:13] Luis Magalhaes: Dont do it 😂
[2022-02-22T15:01:10] D J: 😂😂
[2022-02-22T15:01:28] D J: I hope no
[2022-02-22T15:15:54] Artem Bulashev: This pole actually will show how many active members we have haha

[2022-02-22T17:31:14] Paolo ⁭: Rich man
[2022-02-22T17:32:05] Luis Magalhaes: those ebikes 😍
[2022-02-22T17:37:49] Happy Giraffe: Yes...and their motor tuning
[2022-02-22T17:38:18] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌
[2022-02-22T17:38:39] Luis Magalhaes: would love to get one of those ebikes 😁
[2022-02-22T17:38:41] Happy Giraffe: Pure copper Lov KV motor rewind would be insane, then no more overheating and insane torque
[2022-02-22T17:39:46] Paolo ⁭: If you use low Kv motor at maximum power you will have more consumption than high Kv one
[2022-02-22T17:40:04] Happy Giraffe: Yep, thinner winding
[2022-02-22T17:40:08] Happy Giraffe: https://eleek.com.ua/en/item/frame_lite/
[2022-02-22T17:40:26] Luis Magalhaes: yes but in a ebike i would weelie a lot 🤣🤣
[2022-02-22T17:40:39] Happy Giraffe: Frame I want to buy but seems the shop guys are busy in frontline fighting the war😅
[2022-02-22T17:41:02] Happy Giraffe: So many offroad paths in Finland...I cant wait the enduro bike
[2022-02-22T17:41:52] Luis Magalhaes: Here too
[2022-02-22T17:42:07] Luis Magalhaes: It was just getting out of home and pass the street
[2022-02-22T17:45:13] Paolo ⁭: You have more length of motor copper, major internal resistance
[2022-02-22T17:45:35] Happy Giraffe: Thinner and longer😳

[2022-02-22T18:33:08] Happy Giraffe: ❤️
[2022-02-22T18:33:19] Happy Giraffe: All emojis used now, Artem is happy
[2022-02-22T18:43:14] Artem Bulashev: Correct yeah just like any system working at its limit - not the efficient place to operate
[2022-02-22T18:43:54] Artem Bulashev: Best to have motor that will have your typical speed about 25% bellow it’s max speed
[2022-02-22T18:53:24] rosheee: <photos/photo_2682@22-02-2022_18-53-24.jpg>

[2022-02-22T18:53:53] Artem Bulashev: What?
[2022-02-22T18:54:00] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-22T18:54:18] rosheee: <photos/photo_2683@22-02-2022_18-54-18.jpg>
[2022-02-22T18:56:14] zekoslav mrkva: Nemam pojma jel daleko ali moze in any case
[2022-02-22T18:58:42] rosheee: Vooolim teee jeboteeee
[2022-02-22T18:58:53] rosheee: Slow mode sux
[2022-02-22T19:04:33] zekoslav mrkva: Tooo Legendo, ima nas milion romobilasa
[2022-02-22T19:05:57] rosheee: Yoyo,o Can i use this on vesc? Came with new mainboard I am in train so cant test and dunno what it is exactly
[2022-02-22T19:06:26] rosheee: <photos/photo_2684@22-02-2022_19-06-26.jpg>
[2022-02-22T19:16:48] Unknown: That's a temperature sensor. Should be installed in the motor but as were saying before it's a bit tricky to feed the wires out of the axle hole with the stock wires in place. Definitely doable but probably tedious. That connector will almost definitely need to be removed in order to feed the wires out, unless you can somehow feed the probe in from the outside
[2022-02-22T19:20:20] rosheee: I know what it is xD just ordered 4 and bought new mainboard for pc today..maybe they work xD
[2022-02-22T19:21:18] rosheee: So it should work
[2022-02-22T19:21:34] rosheee: Connect to 5V and temp. I gonna use ot for battery xD
[2022-02-22T19:21:52] rosheee: Then i see how hot she is..and can play nelly - hot in here
[2022-02-22T19:32:00] Artem Bulashev: I think ntc work between signal and gnd not signal and 5v
[2022-02-22T20:01:53] Unknown: 5v and Gnd no polarity
[2022-02-22T20:06:17] Artem Bulashev: Def not :)) one is signal one is other (5v or gnd)
[2022-02-22T20:08:06] Unknown: On the temp sensor?
[2022-02-22T20:08:21] Unknown: It's non polarized
[2022-02-22T20:08:32] Unknown: Without question
[2022-02-22T20:09:01] Unknown: <photos/photo_2685@22-02-2022_20-09-01.jpg>
[2022-02-22T20:09:44] Unknown: Use multimeter to measure resistance... Doesn't matter which probe is on which wire.. only measures resistance
[2022-02-22T20:10:23] Paolo ⁭: Yes, right
[2022-02-22T20:10:26] Unknown: Resistance should be 10k or 100k at 25C depending which type of NTC sensor it is
[2022-02-22T20:11:02] Paolo ⁭: It’s a simple resistor and changing value by temp
[2022-02-22T20:11:11] Unknown: Exactly. No polarity
[2022-02-22T20:28:56] Artem Bulashev: Correct no polarity
[2022-02-22T20:29:08] Artem Bulashev: That’s not what I mean
[2022-02-22T20:29:38] Artem Bulashev: Some controllers / motors run their temp sensors between 5v and signal
[2022-02-22T20:29:55] Artem Bulashev: Not like vesc that needs it on Gnd and signal
[2022-02-22T20:30:11] Artem Bulashev: Polarity it doesn’t have you are correct
[2022-02-22T20:30:20] Unknown: Those are PTC
[2022-02-22T20:30:57] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok
[2022-02-22T20:31:01] Artem Bulashev: Makes sense
[2022-02-22T20:31:07] Unknown: Positive temperature coefficient uses 5v and signal, still no polarity. NTC is negative temperature coefficient and uses Gnd and signal but no polarity.
[2022-02-22T20:31:19] Artem Bulashev: Didn’t know they have other name , should have figured lol
[2022-02-22T20:31:29] Unknown: 🤓
[2022-02-22T20:59:53] rosheee: Gave my to a friend as gift xF havr i buy

[2022-02-23T21:16:16] rosheee: which sc00ter dis is?
[2022-02-23T21:16:38] Luis Magalhaes: A slow blade.. 🙊😂
[2022-02-23T21:17:40] Face de Pin Sucé: OH HELL YEAH
[2022-02-23T21:18:12] Face de Pin Sucé: now we speak
[2022-02-23T21:18:53] Luis Magalhaes: This turn scooters slower not good 😂😂
[2022-02-23T21:19:46] rosheee: ^^ precisione is like insta360
[2022-02-23T21:19:56] rosheee: sry for roasting, but i'm hungry
[2022-02-23T21:20:04] Luis Magalhaes: But Talking serious, i dont know why there isn't a app using phone acelerometor to be more precise
[2022-02-23T21:20:24] Luis Magalhaes: Thats too much 😂
[2022-02-23T21:20:35] rosheee: gps pro is very accurate
[2022-02-23T21:20:52] rosheee: ihope it works better in car
[2022-02-23T21:23:17] Luis Magalhaes: I think the problem is on aceleration, dont know if any app uses the acelerometor to feel the car or scooter moving, or they use only gps with delay
[2022-02-23T21:23:46] Face de Pin Sucé: there are
[2022-02-23T21:24:18] rosheee: or when he is outside city he has flawless gps
[2022-02-23T21:24:18] Face de Pin Sucé: but draggy uses everything and several satellite to get the best accuracy with accelerometer and everything
[2022-02-23T21:25:15] Luis Magalhaes: Ok i know it is more precise but i think it could be done in a phone as well, but need a good app
[2022-02-23T21:25:29] rosheee: Gps pro
[2022-02-23T21:25:33] sombre_enfant: All this mod for that😭
[2022-02-23T21:27:26] Luis Magalhaes: Thats like speed view, dont show you aceleration times
[2022-02-23T21:27:29] Paolo ⁭: there is no way to try it safely, it is full of curves
[2022-02-23T21:28:54] Luis Magalhaes: @roscheeee i used drag racer, it has to have good gps signal or it wont even work, and shows the precision on % but i know it must have diference with a draggy

[2022-02-24T13:35:50] Oliver Eliasson: Thanks
[2022-02-24T15:29:07] Unknown: I would be curious to know why. I know Adaptto Max controllers used it for quite a few years and Nucular has been using it for about 5 years without any problems that are well known. Unlike traditional CC to CV chargers, the user is responsible for programing the charge parameters and using the proper power source, so I wonder if his fear is user based or actual hardware/software based
[2022-02-24T15:31:36] Unknown: I'd be willing to estimate at least half of Nuc users use this function daily. So thousands of users day after day.. probably millions of charge cycles to date.
[2022-02-24T15:36:31] Unknown: Your typical CC to CV Chinese charger, in my opinion, would be more dangerous. @artBula bought a charger from Ali and came to realize it wasn't even going into CV mode which is extremely dangerous and bad for cell health. With converter mode the user can see real time what the power supply is doing, what the battery is doing and how warm the motor/controller is getting during the charge cycle. My motor warmed up to 80F and controller to 65F at 7a with a 54v power supply. Again, the safety of it is completely dependent on the user setting the proper parameters
[2022-02-24T16:59:07] rosheee: or when he is outside cityu found m6 and m5?
[2022-02-24T17:34:08] Artem Bulashev: CC
[2022-02-24T17:34:33] Artem Bulashev: Always 4.3 amps even when battery is full - causes one cell to over charge (BMS saved it
[2022-02-24T17:34:55] Artem Bulashev: Without smart BMS would have never known 🤦‍♂️
[2022-02-24T17:49:27] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-24T18:17:54] Unknown: Yup.. exactly. So I'm not sure why Vedder thinks converter charge mode is dangerous. I have a feeling it is not a danger of the implementation or function but a danger that users will not set it up and use it properly, which can lead to catastrophe
[2022-02-24T18:34:44] Artem Bulashev: Yeah like it charging 40v battery with 72v
[2022-02-24T18:35:20] Artem Bulashev: Though simple algorithm would prevent that from happening too
[2022-02-24T18:36:37] Artem Bulashev: Like 52v that vesc reads can only be 13s-16s (17s 3v would be already bellow 3v)
[2022-02-24T18:55:10] Unknown: I'm going out on a limb here but this is my feeling... Most guys who use Nucular are experienced and knowledgeable, so setting their charge parameters isn't a hazard. Also Nucs are typically used on a very certain type of application (e-bikes and scooters). There are many many people who use VESC, many beginners, for all sorts of different applications from RC to EV so implementing a function such as this might be more confusing and hazardous than it would be helpful
[2022-02-24T19:48:45] Oliver Eliasson: Hey, I’m using spintend ubox and trying to connect lights to fan port, but it is not working. Do i need to activate it somehow

[2022-02-24T19:51:11] Oliver Eliasson: But i didn’t find any so thats good
[2022-02-24T19:51:33] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2022-02-24T19:51:38] Artem Bulashev: Can you show your ubox ?
[2022-02-24T19:51:49] Artem Bulashev: Is yours update version with only 4 screws ?
[2022-02-24T19:51:54] Happy Giraffe: Maybe they are slowly starting to improve, who knows. Mine failed because of those and had to wait 6 weeks
[2022-02-24T20:05:44] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2705@24-02-2022_20-05-44.jpg>
[2022-02-24T20:05:48] Artem Bulashev: Yes he has new one
[2022-02-24T20:06:00] Artem Bulashev: With ports on side and 4 screws only
[2022-02-24T20:06:10] Artem Bulashev: Can’t wait for case to be updated and reduced
[2022-02-24T20:06:28] Artem Bulashev: It can be 20% smaller in surface with right design
[2022-02-24T20:06:57] Oliver Eliasson: <video_file>
[2022-02-24T20:07:50] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2706@24-02-2022_20-07-50.jpg>
[2022-02-24T20:07:58] Artem Bulashev: This is must have
[2022-02-24T20:10:14] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah whould have been great
[2022-02-25T00:29:43] rosheee: Xd connevt light to light port?
[2022-02-25T00:30:18] rosheee: Or i missundersta d something? U want light?
[2022-02-25T00:33:11] Oliver Eliasson: I want light but blinkers on diffrent port. So that i don’t have to have lights on fir blinkers to work but the blikerrelays i bought dident work anyway so i maybe going to use a raspberry pi or something. Saw someone in the group talk about it
[2022-02-25T00:40:09] Artem Bulashev: What you need is blinkers on constant 12v, but lights that you want to be switchable from remote on light output ports
[2022-02-25T00:40:39] Oliver Eliasson: Yes
[2022-02-25T11:27:09] rosheee: ANone know where to get m6 banjo screw and m5 bleeding screw from?
[2022-02-25T11:27:18] rosheee: Reddit was scam
[2022-02-25T16:06:33] Gigolo Joe: Aliexpress maybe?
[2022-02-25T16:38:57] Unknown: What?!
[2022-02-25T16:39:14] Unknown: The jagwire HOPE quick disconnect banjo doesn't work??
[2022-02-25T16:40:52] Unknown: Dude they are super tricky to find. One of the reasons I haven't pulled the trigger on the Maguras yet. Thinking my newly installed variable Regen may even be sufficient with little need for super strong mechanical brakes. Going to try the variable Regen on thumb throttle (left handed kart trigger throttle is on the way👍)
[2022-02-25T16:43:50] Unknown: Have a feeling my Nutt brakes with the variable Regen will be more than sufficient without the need for the Maguras... but we'll see. It's always fun to be part of the cool crowd with sharp looking Magura brakes 😂
[2022-02-25T16:48:42] Oliver Eliasson: Which brakes have variable regen?
[2022-02-25T16:50:10] Unknown: It will be a separate lever
[2022-02-25T16:50:38] Unknown: Some guys have modified their levers using a hall sensor and magnet to get variable Regen on any brake lever
[2022-02-25T16:51:37] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah saw something like that thought you meant there was a hydraulic brake with that feature from the factory. Would have been great
[2022-02-25T16:52:40] Happy Giraffe: You can also use second throttle on left hand for variable regen
[2022-02-25T16:53:30] Happy Giraffe: But on vesc you have to choose between regen and simple cutoff mode, cant have both at the same time sadly
[2022-02-25T16:54:05] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-02-25T16:55:01] Unknown: Yup, I'll be using a thumb throttle on the left for now but have the left handed trigger on the way which will be nice. Eventually would love the dual action Curve throttle.
[2022-02-25T16:55:56] Oliver Eliasson: Curve throttle is like rion right?
[2022-02-25T16:56:52] Unknown: I believe on Nuc you can have both by assigning the brk port to variable and manually assigning other can port to brk for switching type. However, I'm not sure what would happen if you used both brakes at the same time. Controller may have a siezure
[2022-02-25T16:56:56] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah thats why brake levers with variable regen would be perfect
[2022-02-25T16:57:38] Unknown: Yea Rion curve throttle. Similar to the boosted rev scroll wheel throttle with throttle and brake built into the same scrolling wheel
[2022-02-25T16:57:45] Happy Giraffe: Maybe best solution is to diy weak variable regen for levers as a motor cutoff and then use throttle for actual ebrake
[2022-02-25T16:57:49] Unknown: Absolutely would be
[2022-02-25T17:00:08] Oliver Eliasson: I will have that, will start thinking about how to make a diffrent housing for the remote to the spintend it has a wheel for brake and throttle. Could maybe 3d new enclosure and even cnc new wheel in aluminium if i find a place and can design it
[2022-02-25T17:00:37] Unknown: Yup that would be nice option for sure
[2022-02-25T18:49:04] Paolo ⁭: Sucé ✅

[2022-02-25T19:06:21] Face de Pin Sucé: you didn't open it yet ?
[2022-02-25T19:06:58] Paolo ⁭: I will not open more motors😂
[2022-02-25T19:07:09] Paolo ⁭: I fucked much motor lol
[2022-02-25T19:08:37] Gigolo Joe: Y no Chinese can make good stuff, it all depends on quality control
[2022-02-25T19:10:34] rosheee: inverto pervaw0r
[2022-02-25T19:11:03] rosheee: i don't know where to buy for exact ly m8 pro and m7 pro
[2022-02-25T19:12:21] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse alieexpress screws can be good
[2022-02-25T19:12:31] Mirono escooters: Ordered some monorim axles
[2022-02-25T19:35:32] Face de Pin Sucé: wtf, how do you fuck a motor by removing 6 screws
[2022-02-25T19:38:41] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-02-25T19:40:22] Paolo ⁭: Factory can customize motors for me
[2022-02-25T19:41:33] Face de Pin Sucé: wut
[2022-02-25T19:41:53] Face de Pin Sucé: I try to understand how do you fuck a motor when you open it x)
[2022-02-25T19:42:52] Paolo ⁭: When extract stator I’ve damaged magnets
[2022-02-25T19:43:20] Paolo ⁭: I prefer let factory do it directly
[2022-02-25T19:45:33] Face de Pin Sucé: but WTF x)

[2022-02-25T21:00:48] Face de Pin Sucé: haha it never happened before
[2022-02-25T21:23:06] Artem Bulashev: Guys
[2022-02-25T21:23:13] Artem Bulashev: Oil in the motor
[2022-02-25T21:23:16] Artem Bulashev: Before 120c
[2022-02-25T21:23:48] Artem Bulashev: After adding 75c
[2022-02-25T21:23:57] Artem Bulashev: And motor cooling down is ALOT faster
[2022-02-25T21:24:12] Artem Bulashev: 40cc was added
[2022-02-25T21:24:19] Artem Bulashev: 0.04 L / 2.7 table spoons / 40 ml
[2022-02-25T21:24:35] Paolo ⁭: Suce*
[2022-02-25T21:31:26] Unknown: Wow really? What kind of oil? Any reason you chose oil over ferrofluid?
[2022-02-25T21:35:28] Unknown: I imagine the motor and simmerings have to be sealed 100% so it doesn't leak out. How messy does it make the internals of the motor? I'm intrigued but have a hard time understanding "oil in an electric motor" lol
[2022-02-25T22:23:59] Artem Bulashev: 40mm will just seat above magnets on the bottom and cool as it spins transferring heat from coins and magnets to other surfaces like side wall rim
[2022-02-25T22:24:41] Artem Bulashev: Some oil is inert and not conductive and doesn’t delaminate glued teeth
[2022-02-25T22:34:39] Unknown: Interesting man. Was that your motor? Did you say it was running at 120C prior to the oil? Isn't that quite high temps?
[2022-02-25T22:35:01] Artem Bulashev: Not mine
[2022-02-25T22:35:08] Artem Bulashev: 120 on windings yes
[2022-02-25T22:35:23] Unknown: Ahh gotcha. Good good lol
[2022-02-25T22:35:29] Artem Bulashev: That is where side wall is warm
[2022-02-25T22:35:33] Artem Bulashev: Not even hot
[2022-02-25T22:35:34] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2022-02-25T22:35:44] Artem Bulashev: For those that don’t have temp sensor inside
[2022-02-25T22:36:13] Unknown: Hmm.. so with my sensor being right near my windings, what would you say I should set the temp cutoff at?
[2022-02-25T22:39:28] Unknown: By the way, before my ferrofluid I was around 150F (65C) max at temp sensor... But my sensors are tucked into the windings as I showed you a while ago. I was thinking that was hot but from what you're saying, that's not even really hot at all as "winding temp"... Correct?
[2022-02-25T22:40:36] Unknown: <photos/photo_2709@25-02-2022_22-40-36.jpg>
[2022-02-25T22:40:37] Unknown: <photos/photo_2710@25-02-2022_22-40-37.jpg>
[2022-02-25T22:41:30] Artem Bulashev: 65c is very cold for motor winding
[2022-02-25T22:41:59] Artem Bulashev: Motor winding 80 is hottish 100 is hot 120 ok time to stop
[2022-02-25T22:43:22] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I reviewed my understanding of hot winding as well
[2022-02-25T22:43:42] Artem Bulashev: I would now set as 100c start and 115c stop
[2022-02-25T23:19:24] Unknown: Excellent. Thank you man. I'll adjust my temp settings, that opens up a whole new realm of usable power range. So basically winding temp is quite different than "overall motor" temp. With that, I assume the temperature threshold setting depend where the actual temperature probe is located in each particular motor
[2022-02-25T23:20:03] Gigolo Joe: Told y'all
[2022-02-25T23:20:49] Paolo ⁭: What the fuck motor hot like that ?
[2022-02-25T23:20:59] Artem Bulashev: Yes so 85-100c is absolutely normal
[2022-02-25T23:21:16] Gigolo Joe: Send it. If it dies ut dies
[2022-02-25T23:21:38] Gigolo Joe: It*
[2022-02-25T23:21:39] Artem Bulashev: That’s the thing for windings 100c is hot but not limit - 120 is upper safe limit
[2022-02-25T23:22:04] Gigolo Joe: Do it Don't be pussy
[2022-02-25T23:22:24] Gigolo Joe: I burned mine
[2022-02-25T23:22:25] Artem Bulashev: Magnets at that time will only get to 80c if you keep it there at 120 for extended time - without ferrofluid
[2022-02-25T23:22:31] Paolo ⁭: Which motor is?
[2022-02-25T23:22:37] Artem Bulashev: Any
[2022-02-25T23:22:40] Unknown: Nothing will die 💪
[2022-02-25T23:22:51] Gigolo Joe: All of them
[2022-02-25T23:23:01] Paolo ⁭: I want to know how you got 120°C lol
[2022-02-25T23:23:09] Artem Bulashev: Was not me
[2022-02-25T23:23:17] Gigolo Joe: 7.2kW
[2022-02-25T23:23:25] Artem Bulashev: On my 650w nominal it would not be hard lol
[2022-02-25T23:23:27] Paolo ⁭: And not any
[2022-02-25T23:23:28] Gigolo Joe: For non stop
[2022-02-25T23:23:38] Paolo ⁭: Depends by insulation material
[2022-02-25T23:23:42] Artem Bulashev: 100c winding temp? Any
[2022-02-25T23:23:42] Gigolo Joe: 1.0kW nominal
[2022-02-25T23:23:53] Paolo ⁭: Xiaomi motor use plastic as insulation
[2022-02-25T23:24:12] Paolo ⁭: mine with fiberglass
[2022-02-25T23:24:24] Artem Bulashev: What isolation ? Limit is set by emle quality
[2022-02-25T23:24:29] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2022-02-25T23:24:31] Gigolo Joe: Xiaomi can take up to 3.3 max nonstop
[2022-02-25T23:24:40] Artem Bulashev: 3.3?
[2022-02-25T23:24:46] Artem Bulashev: Kw?
[2022-02-25T23:24:52] Gigolo Joe: So I'd day 2.3 is ok for them
[2022-02-25T23:25:05] Artem Bulashev: Kw is not relavent for motor heat
[2022-02-25T23:25:11] Artem Bulashev: Only Amps are
[2022-02-25T23:25:15] Gigolo Joe: kW
[2022-02-25T23:25:28] Artem Bulashev: Because you can have 100a at 33v or 300a at 11v
[2022-02-25T23:25:29] Gigolo Joe: Do i look i bitch
[2022-02-25T23:25:37] Unknown: Exactly
[2022-02-25T23:25:46] Gigolo Joe: Amps are for hoes
[2022-02-25T23:25:57] Unknown: 🤦🏻
[2022-02-25T23:25:59] Gigolo Joe: 60v minimum
[2022-02-25T23:26:07] Artem Bulashev: Not when you want to know heatlosses
[2022-02-25T23:26:21] Paolo ⁭: Open the motor and you will see. The material insulate stator by winding
[2022-02-25T23:27:04] Gigolo Joe: Bla bla bla Winding got 2hot4me
[2022-02-25T23:27:07] Artem Bulashev: Stock temp will have windings higher than 100c I almost guarantee that :)
[2022-02-25T23:27:39] Face de Pin Sucé: WTF
[2022-02-25T23:27:56] Artem Bulashev: It’s abs - 100c no problem
[2022-02-25T23:28:01] Gigolo Joe: Damb ur awake
[2022-02-25T23:28:03] Unknown: ... yea...
[2022-02-25T23:28:17] Unknown: Lol
[2022-02-25T23:28:24] Face de Pin Sucé: is it a Xiaomi guy trying to tell us something ?
[2022-02-25T23:28:47] Artem Bulashev: Cool off man
[2022-02-25T23:28:54] Face de Pin Sucé: haha you open motors ? 😏😁
[2022-02-25T23:29:06] Gigolo Joe: U can go 300A for instance It don't. Mean a shit Do it for 29 minutes straight
[2022-02-25T23:29:19] Artem Bulashev: Amps * time
[2022-02-25T23:29:23] Artem Bulashev: = heat
[2022-02-25T23:30:05] Gigolo Joe: Artem blya bratish...
[2022-02-25T23:30:06] Artem Bulashev: But 1000w = 10a and 100v will generate ALMOST 10 times less heat than 1000w = 100a and 10v
[2022-02-25T23:30:40] Gigolo Joe: 100a...try 120a with 100a field weakening for 20 minutes
[2022-02-25T23:30:49] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t matter
[2022-02-25T23:30:55] Artem Bulashev: Point is it is not watts
[2022-02-25T23:31:00] Artem Bulashev: It is amps that cause heat
[2022-02-25T23:31:09] Gigolo Joe: Nuh
[2022-02-25T23:31:20] Gigolo Joe: It's time
[2022-02-25T23:31:26] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2022-02-25T23:31:34] Gigolo Joe: U can do 500 amps for 2 seconds
[2022-02-25T23:31:44] Gigolo Joe: Or 200 amps
[2022-02-25T23:31:48] Artem Bulashev: As watts are result of volts and amps (volts barely have effect on heat - it does tiny bit, but we can neglect it)
[2022-02-25T23:31:54] Gigolo Joe: For 10 minutes
[2022-02-25T23:31:58] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-02-25T23:32:08] Artem Bulashev: No question there
[2022-02-25T23:32:08] Paolo ⁭: I can see all by hole😁
[2022-02-25T23:32:29] Artem Bulashev: I thought you said amps are for hoes?
[2022-02-25T23:32:33] Artem Bulashev: 🤣👌

[2022-02-25T23:35:19] Face de Pin Sucé: i could engrave 600W on my motors x)
[2022-02-25T23:35:27] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t matter
[2022-02-25T23:35:32] Face de Pin Sucé: I came in Austria to do bouldering in Silvretta
[2022-02-25T23:35:33] Artem Bulashev: They check on goggle right away
[2022-02-25T23:35:49] Gigolo Joe: Austria... damn i sad i have not flew there 2weeks ago
[2022-02-25T23:36:06] Face de Pin Sucé: it's expensive, 800€ the 2 75mm without shipping
[2022-02-25T23:36:17] Artem Bulashev: 😶‍🌫️
[2022-02-25T23:36:21] Paolo ⁭: From Italy, 500W limit xd….
[2022-02-25T23:36:30] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2022-02-25T23:36:43] Paolo ⁭: 400€ each is good price
[2022-02-25T23:37:16] Face de Pin Sucé: if he wants, let me know ;)
[2022-02-25T23:37:30] Paolo ⁭: Including vaccum rim?
[2022-02-25T23:38:31] Mirono escooters: Watercool it
[2022-02-25T23:38:41] Mirono escooters: Oil cool rather
[2022-02-25T23:39:32] Face de Pin Sucé: no, Weped motor are sold without rims
[2022-02-25T23:39:43] Face de Pin Sucé: he needs to use the rims he already has
[2022-02-25T23:41:04] Unknown: Does anyone have an idea what class insulation our hub motors use? Or are they all different depending on manufacturer?
[2022-02-25T23:41:04] Unknown: <photos/photo_2714@25-02-2022_23-41-04.jpg>
[2022-02-25T23:42:57] Unknown: Insulation class determines allowable temp change from ambient... 🤷🏻‍♂️. So Xiaomi with plastic insulation probably class A- lol
[2022-02-25T23:43:04] Face de Pin Sucé: all different
[2022-02-25T23:43:28] Unknown: 🤔 hmm
[2022-02-25T23:44:46] Artem Bulashev: Vsett uses glass fiber and PTFE
[2022-02-25T23:45:24] Artem Bulashev: Both are perfectly good for 200c easy
[2022-02-25T23:45:47] Artem Bulashev: So no, isolation is not the weak point
[2022-02-25T23:46:48] Unknown: Interesting. What is? Laminations?
[2022-02-25T23:47:17] Artem Bulashev: Enamel rating is harder to tell - minimum that Cheepeat china uses is 120c rated
[2022-02-25T23:48:05] Unknown: Ahh.. I see. So if enamel burns, phases short and burn?
[2022-02-25T23:48:19] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-02-25T23:48:27] Unknown: Got it 👍
[2022-02-25T23:48:29] Face de Pin Sucé: what is enamel ?
[2022-02-25T23:48:39] Unknown: Coating on the copper windings
[2022-02-25T23:48:52] Artem Bulashev: Typical ok quality is 150-155c rated. Best one can be as high as 200c rated
[2022-02-25T23:49:12] Artem Bulashev: Lack that covers winding copper wire in motors to isolate it
[2022-02-25T23:49:53] Face de Pin Sucé: aaaah okay, didn't it has this name
[2022-02-25T23:50:13] Face de Pin Sucé: well, I've seen enamel burning, then cooling down and motor working again x)
[2022-02-25T23:50:26] Face de Pin Sucé: 2 weeks ago when we were at trackday
[2022-02-25T23:50:34] Artem Bulashev: It can get dark
[2022-02-25T23:50:40] Artem Bulashev: Burned
[2022-02-25T23:50:52] Face de Pin Sucé: A friend came with rear motor not working and a looooot of smoke coming from the holes x)
[2022-02-25T23:51:06] Face de Pin Sucé: he made it spin in air
[2022-02-25T23:51:13] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-02-25T23:51:14] Artem Bulashev: But to short it has to burn all the way through and at short completely with other wire that also burned though completely
[2022-02-25T23:51:22] Face de Pin Sucé: and then, it started to work perfectly when enamel cooled down x)
[2022-02-25T23:51:39] Artem Bulashev: When it cools winding shrinks
[2022-02-25T23:52:20] Artem Bulashev: And some what liquid state enamel can cover the burned place. But it is not good should rewind motor :)
[2022-02-25T23:52:26] Artem Bulashev: Can kill controller
[2022-02-25T23:54:01] Mirono escooters: If the motor shorts out. Will vesc go too?
[2022-02-25T23:54:14] Face de Pin Sucé: <files/SibKarting12022022036.MTS>
[2022-02-25T23:54:25] Face de Pin Sucé: he's waiting for his motors to die before changing these
[2022-02-25T23:54:51] Face de Pin Sucé: It depends on your luck, I've seen two spintend burnt because of short phases
[2022-02-25T23:55:11] Face de Pin Sucé: and I've seen recently a spintend working great after a great phase short x)
[2022-02-25T23:55:25] Face de Pin Sucé: 85Kmh full speed then full electric brake
[2022-02-25T23:55:37] Face de Pin Sucé: bullets shorted because too hot
[2022-02-25T23:55:47] Face de Pin Sucé: and spintend is okay
[2022-02-26T00:42:19] Happy Giraffe: Also motor windings copper quality matters, one melts at 140°c and one survives or never gets to that point because of pure quality having less resistance😳
[2022-02-26T00:42:55] Happy Giraffe: Those cheapest china motors have propably more other materials on the winding than Cu lol
[2022-02-26T01:29:35] Artem Bulashev: Well l don’t think any one is using cheepest Chinese motors here
[2022-02-26T01:30:19] Happy Giraffe: Interesting is how much different motors change the copper quality🤔
[2022-02-26T01:30:33] Artem Bulashev: On conductivity not much
[2022-02-26T01:30:48] Artem Bulashev: OCC copper is used in sound wires
[2022-02-26T01:31:02] Artem Bulashev: Because high frequency travels on surface
[2022-02-26T01:31:30] Artem Bulashev: And you want copper to be pulled in specific way to creat ultra smooth surface
[2022-02-26T01:31:45] Artem Bulashev: Like a diamond with no immperfections
[2022-02-26T01:31:51] Artem Bulashev: For power it doesn’t matter
[2022-02-26T01:31:52] Happy Giraffe: What about melting point then?
[2022-02-26T01:32:12] Artem Bulashev: It travels through out crossection
[2022-02-26T01:32:35] Artem Bulashev: Copper has it all same. Unless it is not copper but ab alloy
[2022-02-26T01:32:38] Happy Giraffe: On the video the polish guy said their rewind copper takes 280c instead of stock QSmotors 140c
[2022-02-26T01:32:43] Artem Bulashev: Alloy is could be more expensive actually
[2022-02-26T01:33:11] Artem Bulashev: Copper doesn’t mix well
[2022-02-26T01:33:24] Artem Bulashev: Silver plated Copper exists
[2022-02-26T01:33:39] Artem Bulashev: Again high frequency applications
[2022-02-26T01:34:06] Artem Bulashev: That’s enamel temp rating
[2022-02-26T01:34:10] Artem Bulashev: Not copper
[2022-02-26T01:34:13] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-02-26T01:34:22] Artem Bulashev: 140c copper melting point haha
[2022-02-26T01:34:36] Artem Bulashev: It is over 1000c
[2022-02-26T01:34:48] Artem Bulashev: 1085c goggle says
[2022-02-26T01:35:02] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, bit above water boiling. But anyway it was weird subtitled video.
[2022-02-26T01:35:25] Artem Bulashev: Marketing / wrong choice of words
[2022-02-26T01:35:41] Artem Bulashev: He should have said enamel on copper melts
[2022-02-26T01:35:48] Happy Giraffe: So then they also change more materials around windings🤔
[2022-02-26T01:35:57] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-02-26T01:35:59] Artem Bulashev: What
[2022-02-26T01:36:12] Artem Bulashev: You mean thickness of enamel ?
[2022-02-26T01:36:22] Artem Bulashev: It can be different sure
[2022-02-26T01:36:45] Happy Giraffe: Or some other mod, he claimed copper winding can be 200°c and no issues👀
[2022-02-26T01:36:56] Artem Bulashev: Try its why winding wires when sold usually state diameter of wire and diameter with enamel
[2022-02-26T01:37:08] Happy Giraffe: Regular issues 140°c , their motor 280°c limit
[2022-02-26T01:37:14] Artem Bulashev: Enamel can be
[2022-02-26T01:37:23] Artem Bulashev: Copper can be 900 and it won’t melt
[2022-02-26T01:37:39] Artem Bulashev: Even aluminum melting point is over 660c
[2022-02-26T01:38:12] Artem Bulashev: He just didn’t say correctly what that temp is of - he meant winding, not copper
[2022-02-26T01:38:22] Happy Giraffe: Yep, obviously not copper but something it is connected to. Im just figuring out what exactly
[2022-02-26T01:38:24] Artem Bulashev: Winding contains copper wire and enamel covering it
[2022-02-26T01:38:36] Happy Giraffe: This must have been it
[2022-02-26T01:38:59] Happy Giraffe: Katso QS205 V3 - Tuned by BearEbike- Zdradzamy sekrety 30 000W YouTubessa https://youtu.be/zzhucASLiUs
[2022-02-26T01:39:36] Happy Giraffe: I was just wondering if resistance played bigger part on better quality copper
[2022-02-26T01:39:45] Artem Bulashev: Well hall sensor wires need to be rated above 200c as well if they are close as ambient will be 150c or so
[2022-02-26T01:40:06] Artem Bulashev: Copper is copper
[2022-02-26T01:40:20] Artem Bulashev: All motors use give or take same copper grade
[2022-02-26T01:40:29] Artem Bulashev: Difference is neglegiable
[2022-02-26T01:40:36] Artem Bulashev: But
[2022-02-26T01:40:42] Happy Giraffe: Then he made some fairy tales🌚
[2022-02-26T01:40:45] Artem Bulashev: Copper diameter consistency can be shit
[2022-02-26T01:40:58] Artem Bulashev: Than you have 0.5mm wire and in one place it will be 0.3
[2022-02-26T01:41:02] Artem Bulashev: That place gets hot
[2022-02-26T01:41:05] Artem Bulashev: And burns out
[2022-02-26T01:41:32] Happy Giraffe: And by burning its enamel melting?
[2022-02-26T01:42:02] Artem Bulashev: Yes smaller diameter will cause higher hit that it is designed for and burn out
[2022-02-26T01:42:07] Paolo ⁭: Giraffe stop with that ebike please
[2022-02-26T01:42:16] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-26T01:44:52] Happy Giraffe: Ebike world is a bit weird as I still cant find any real differences between QS205v3 and Mxus 3K turbo other than QS having 5mm wider magnet and wider axle

[2022-02-26T12:48:24] Happy Giraffe: Poles in info tab need to be count in pairs
[2022-02-26T12:48:31] Happy Giraffe: So 15
[2022-02-26T12:48:55] Oliver Eliasson: Thanks
[2022-02-26T12:49:51] Happy Giraffe: You can later check with logs gps vs speedometer
[2022-02-26T12:50:19] Oliver Eliasson: Now it is 55 so seams right

[2022-02-26T13:53:31] Artem Bulashev: Incorrect settings of speed
[2022-02-26T13:54:29] Artem Bulashev: You are right that remote needs Pole pairs I think
[2022-02-26T13:54:40] Artem Bulashev: Seems right
[2022-02-26T13:54:58] Artem Bulashev: Change wheel diameter to 210mm
[2022-02-26T13:55:52] Artem Bulashev: You radius from hub to ground is reduced when you step on scooter
[2022-02-26T13:56:17] Artem Bulashev: Keep pressure 50PSI
[2022-02-26T13:58:25] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-02-26T13:58:35] Mirono escooters: How you do that
[2022-02-26T13:58:49] Paolo ⁭: Idk , wiring is correct , I’m still check
[2022-02-26T13:59:01] Paolo ⁭: But firework is normal for me😂😂
[2022-02-26T13:59:28] Artem Bulashev: Those motors are very low KV
[2022-02-26T13:59:51] Artem Bulashev: At 52v batter you real speed will be 48kmh give or take on flat without wind
[2022-02-26T14:00:13] Artem Bulashev: Torque is insane though for 40mm magnets motor
[2022-02-26T14:01:35] Artem Bulashev: Thanks to 40x10mm X 3mm! Magnets (thick boys wish strong field)
[2022-02-26T14:04:02] Artem Bulashev: With 60v I get 55kmh top speed. Acceleration 0-51 is super fast, last 4kmh gains up abit slower. Perfect for my use case of sub 25kg city commuter
[2022-02-26T14:05:54] Artem Bulashev: 4sec 0-42kmh is really good considering it is only 80a phase and 27a battery. Ferrofluid would allow to go 110a phase before getting to 85c
[2022-02-26T14:09:10] Unknown: Sorry to butt in.. I was wondering if anyone has tried to get the xiaomi mi m365 dashboard to communicate with the flipsky 75100 ? It seems possible.
[2022-02-26T14:10:26] Mirono escooters: With a lot of programming
[2022-02-26T14:10:39] Mirono escooters: You can put vesc firmware on Xiaomi controller :) And then Dash works So part is done
[2022-02-26T14:12:13] Unknown: Ahh ok.. ill look into that. Have you seen it done yet? I might take it on as a project if noone has yet.
[2022-02-26T14:12:40] Mirono escooters: Yesh
[2022-02-26T15:44:34] Gigolo Joe: Y tho
[2022-02-26T15:47:23] Mirono escooters: Y not?
[2022-02-26T15:47:33] Mirono escooters: When u put 75100 in Xiaomi it's understandable u wanna use thé stock cheap dash
[2022-02-26T16:24:49] Unknown: It would make the install neat. The 75100 dash isn't very nice. I think a lot of people would want to use the 75100 with a xiaomi if the dash interface was available. Plenty of 75100 controllers in xiaomi scooters already but none working with the screen. The 75100 is cheap and programmable sine wave controller. There is method to my madness
[2022-02-26T16:35:25] Unknown: @roscheeee Did the jagwire HOPE quick disconnect work on the Maguras to switch the line???
[2022-02-26T16:36:25] Unknown: I like the way you think man 👍 I'm full of madness as well but there is usually a method behind it 😂
[2022-02-26T17:02:08] Unknown: 😂👍
[2022-02-26T17:09:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with stock wiring, it impossible. xiaomi dashboard use half-duplex uart... not compatible with vesc interfaces (full duplex only)
[2022-02-26T17:36:20] Face de Pin Sucé: you are amazing man
[2022-02-26T18:17:46] Gigolo Joe: The vesc dash is indeed crap... that's why u buy Bluetooth module and use your phone as dashboard
[2022-02-26T18:18:01] Mirono escooters: Don't wanna connect always
[2022-02-26T20:17:35] rosheee: i dont know 😆i still need the M6 and M6 screws..they are not inside the kit
[2022-02-26T20:20:03] rosheee: so i am at the same point like before
[2022-02-26T20:23:33] Happy Giraffe: Magura MT8 dual piston only🌚
[2022-02-26T20:23:49] rosheee: what?
[2022-02-26T20:24:10] Happy Giraffe: Isnt that what you mod now?
[2022-02-26T20:24:20] rosheee: MT7 front MT8 rear
[2022-02-26T20:24:29] Happy Giraffe: 👍
[2022-02-26T20:24:36] rosheee: thought it is better to split them because mt7 rear is overpowered
[2022-02-26T20:24:43] Happy Giraffe: I think I buy another MT5e for rear
[2022-02-26T20:24:57] rosheee: i still have 1x mt8 pro brand new for sale

[2022-02-26T20:27:37] rosheee: u want pic :D?
[2022-02-26T20:27:43] Unknown: I can't believe that... Even the picture of the kit shows them
[2022-02-26T20:27:55] Unknown: I believe you but feel like you got ripped off.

[2022-02-26T20:31:22] Unknown: So it looks like HFA701 Hope kit should come with 2 m6 banjos... I don't see the M6 banjo screw tho but those aren't hard to find. You should have gotten the banjos bud
[2022-02-26T20:31:25] rosheee: THE SCREW XD
[2022-02-26T20:31:48] Unknown: I think the M6 banjo screw shouldn't be too hard to find
[2022-02-26T20:31:53] rosheee: banjo is no prob but u need a screw on top :D
[2022-02-26T20:32:10] rosheee: and the m5 screw for the other side?
[2022-02-26T20:32:14] Unknown: I said fuck it on the Maguras and setup my variable Regen last night. No need for mechanical brakes 🤣
[2022-02-26T20:32:39] Unknown: Yes, M6 banjo screw and then any m5x10mm screw to plug old brake line hole

[2022-02-26T20:39:46] rosheee: can't order from switzerland
[2022-02-26T20:39:56] rosheee: damn son..so sad now...
[2022-02-26T20:40:31] rosheee: XD
[2022-02-26T20:40:45] rosheee: $38.98 delivery March 3 - 7. Details btchpls
[2022-02-26T20:44:23] Luis Magalhaes: Mr burner 🔥
[2022-02-26T20:44:56] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu your killing it 😜
[2022-02-26T20:49:15] D J: I have the same. need to install
[2022-02-26T20:49:29] rosheee: what happened`?
[2022-02-26T20:50:21] Happy Giraffe: Solid brake, on scooter its sadly too close to ground so dirt and shit will grind away organic pads, I will order metallics later tonight
[2022-02-26T20:52:02] D J: because of that I bought 2 different types of pads 😂 with time I'll give my feedback
[2022-02-26T20:53:36] Happy Giraffe: +10 IQ, Stock magura pads are mediocre at best for scooter use. Last less than 500km if riding on bad weather
[2022-02-26T20:55:40] D J: are you using VESC with brake regeneration?
[2022-02-26T20:57:37] Happy Giraffe: Yes but on my other xiaomi lever, so actually I'm not using MT5e lever sensor at all
[2022-02-26T21:39:31] Unknown: I'm sad for you. That's bullshit. Did you get the banjo's with the jagwire kit at least? Or no banjos even?
[2022-02-26T21:39:53] rosheee: yes 😆but it is reddit again
[2022-02-26T21:40:06] rosheee: doesn't matter :D i go to a bikeshop on monday ^^
[2022-02-26T21:40:21] rosheee: ask them for m6 banjo + everything
[2022-02-26T21:40:32] Unknown: Well at least you got those, that's the hardest part to find
[2022-02-26T21:40:34] rosheee: and send all jagwire stuff back
[2022-02-26T21:40:45] rosheee: nah not rly ^^' bikeshop :D
[2022-02-26T21:40:50] Unknown: Yea hopefully... I didn't even think about that, a bike shop! Brilliant idea
[2022-02-26T21:41:14] Unknown: Hah.. why didn't I think of that. You so smartttt
[2022-02-26T21:41:17] rosheee: i was just to lazy XD
[2022-02-26T21:41:42] Unknown: Got them brains son. Hoot hoot
[2022-02-26T21:41:57] Unknown: They'll definitely have
[2022-02-26T21:42:00] rosheee: update on monday ^^
[2022-02-26T21:42:09] Unknown: 👍👍
[2022-02-26T21:42:44] rosheee: XD with ferrofluid i go 86kmh gps lol
[2022-02-26T21:43:05] rosheee: the motors feels better lol and without that FW boo st
[2022-02-26T21:45:56] Unknown: Sweet. I'm convinced ferrofluid not only allows more power from reduced heat but also acts as some sort of lube in the air gap
[2022-02-26T21:46:24] Unknown: My motors had slightly higher ERPM on auto set-up after ferrofluid
[2022-02-26T21:46:39] rosheee: absolute they feel like better performance like more *wrooompf* like less "lag"+
[2022-02-26T21:46:50] rosheee: they feel more better build now harddick massiv ^^'
[2022-02-26T21:47:01] Unknown: Maybe it enhances the magnetic field? More magnetism, higher point before saturation
[2022-02-26T21:47:17] Unknown: Ya baby
[2022-02-26T21:47:29] rosheee: i redo the start test yah but rly..the motors feel sooo much better holycow
[2022-02-26T21:47:57] rosheee: sadly i can't use it for the 3000W
[2022-02-26T21:48:07] Unknown: I had the same experience... Massively hard 🤣
[2022-02-26T21:48:17] rosheee: maybe use more ^^?
[2022-02-26T21:48:23] Unknown: No but seriously, motors felt smoother and stronger
[2022-02-26T21:48:28] rosheee: word
[2022-02-26T21:49:16] Unknown: I have 6ml front and 6.5ml rear with zero added resistance.. not sure what the limit would be on 50mm magnet hub motor before resistance occurs. Not sure if I want to open the motors back up for another .5ml lol
[2022-02-26T21:50:08] Unknown: I feel like I could've easily gone 7ml with no bad effects but not sure how much benefit that would add since air gap is already full
[2022-02-26T21:50:16] rosheee: i leave it until motor burns or something happens
[2022-02-26T21:50:27] rosheee: word i think for the moment it is perfect
[2022-02-26T21:51:03] rosheee: but go an do 30km test tomorrow morning
[2022-02-26T21:53:36] Unknown: Same here. Like Goldie locks porage, just right
[2022-02-26T21:54:53] Unknown: <animation>
[2022-02-26T22:17:02] Happy Giraffe: This guys dictionary better than Oxford professors combined
[2022-02-26T22:39:52] rosheee: xD
[2022-02-26T22:40:17] Mirono escooters: Aaa
[2022-02-26T22:49:45] rosheee: @Happy_Giraffe XD
[2022-02-26T22:50:10] rosheee: <photos/photo_2721@26-02-2022_22-50-10.jpg>
[2022-02-26T22:58:33] Paolo ⁭: Motor max temps depends also by magnet
[2022-02-26T23:00:12] Paolo ⁭: They are different magnet grade, that can support more or less heat and max torque . For example existing magnet that support max 80°C and over this temp motor goes to loose efficiency
[2022-02-26T23:19:26] Oliver Eliasson: <video_file>
[2022-02-26T23:40:34] Oliver Eliasson: Could someone assist me in setting up correct settings in vesc tool?
[2022-02-26T23:55:10] rosheee: ^____^ rather something else than me
[2022-02-26T23:56:05] rosheee: <photos/photo_2722@26-02-2022_23-56-05.jpg>
[2022-02-26T23:56:26] Happy Giraffe: This was actually my plan but realized theres no way to make this legal here
[2022-02-26T23:56:49] Paolo ⁭: This is of jppl 😂
[2022-02-26T23:59:03] rosheee: LEEGALIZE IT
[2022-02-27T00:01:34] Happy Giraffe: Hard here in the land of byrocrates, can't even have theft insurance on escooters
[2022-02-27T00:01:49] rosheee: not? we have it in home insurance XD
[2022-02-27T00:02:03] rosheee: like when ppl steal your laptop or dildo
[2022-02-27T00:02:09] Happy Giraffe: I have home insurance but impossible to use scooter on that lol
[2022-02-27T00:02:20] rosheee: why not?
[2022-02-27T00:02:39] Luis Magalhaes: No but looks very similar 😂😂
[2022-02-27T00:02:43] Happy Giraffe: They tell me it's not a bicycle and not 30kmh moped
[2022-02-27T00:02:45] Oliver Eliasson: Home insurance don’t cover in sweden either
[2022-02-27T00:02:47] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-27T00:02:50] rosheee: we call it we call it theft outside XD
[2022-02-27T00:03:19] Oliver Eliasson: Well if you have legal scooter it covers
[2022-02-27T00:03:24] Happy Giraffe: Will see about when I go to Finland if self built ebike is covered or not
[2022-02-27T00:03:26] rosheee: in swe?
[2022-02-27T00:03:56] rosheee: when u finally go back 2 FIN? omg i can visit DK this summer XD!!!! THEN I SEE HAPPY OMFG AND MAKE TOUR D'ALLEMAGNE MUAHHAHA
[2022-02-27T00:03:59] Happy Giraffe: Here in DK not even 20kmh is theft insured not even when locked
[2022-02-27T00:04:12] Happy Giraffe: In June-July
[2022-02-27T00:04:31] rosheee: omfg ...then i have to hurry up
[2022-02-27T00:04:39] Oliver Eliasson: Yes, but legal is max 250watt and 20km/h
[2022-02-27T00:04:59] rosheee: but they only know when they found it ^^
[2022-02-27T00:05:32] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, better tell the thief to give you the motor and he can keep rest of scooter😂
[2022-02-27T00:05:39] rosheee: XD
[2022-02-27T00:05:40] Oliver Eliasson: If legal it’s classified as bike
[2022-02-27T00:06:08] rosheee: ❤️❤️ sleep well sisters and brothers and fathers ❤️❤️ keepers of the baguette ❤️❤️
[2022-02-27T00:06:14] Oliver Eliasson: They know from the model and pretty sure you have to show some proof of purchase
[2022-02-27T00:06:45] Oliver Eliasson: So even xiaomi pro 2 is illegal
[2022-02-27T00:06:53] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-27T00:07:00] rosheee: we have SWISS EDITION the legalized version
[2022-02-27T00:07:11] rosheee: ofc. but that isn't a problem. I tell them scooter burned so i had to change parts now it has vesc and this and that in it and 20S20P ^^
[2022-02-27T00:07:28] Happy Giraffe: Solution = "1000w" ebike with throttle and pay 70€/700sek in year insurance
[2022-02-27T00:07:33] Oliver Eliasson: We have Nordic edition😅 but not for pro only normal
[2022-02-27T00:07:45] rosheee: nordic edition :D? rly? h0000t
[2022-02-27T00:07:58] Oliver Eliasson: 250watt limit on ebike in sweden also
[2022-02-27T00:08:04] rosheee: so i go sleepysleep ❤️ spam cont. tomorrow and about how to setup vesc u use with vsett 9?
[2022-02-27T00:08:16] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, hood calls it "slower than walkin"
[2022-02-27T00:08:17] rosheee: best is when connected with laptop ^^' i do first setup with laptop BUT @Happy_Giraffe is the best when u need for setup with mobile Oliver
[2022-02-27T00:08:27] rosheee: XD$
[2022-02-27T00:08:28] Oliver Eliasson: And 25km/h with pedalassist
[2022-02-27T00:08:48] Oliver Eliasson: Alredy done need to tweek amps etc
[2022-02-27T00:08:55] Happy Giraffe: You have 25kmh throttle with insurance? (1000w)
[2022-02-27T00:09:02] rosheee: ah ^^ then also happy my tweaks are 2 peaks
[2022-02-27T00:09:18] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_2723@27-02-2022_00-09-18.jpg>
[2022-02-27T00:09:26] Happy Giraffe: Oh boy
[2022-02-27T00:09:32] Luis Magalhaes: Jppl 👀
[2022-02-27T00:09:34] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-02-27T00:09:38] Oliver Eliasson: No, ebike 250w no thorrle only pedal assist. 25km/h max
[2022-02-27T00:09:51] rosheee: 3000W motor
[2022-02-27T00:10:18] Happy Giraffe: Luckily in Finland you can pay 50-70€ in year to have 750w more legal watts and throttle😅
[2022-02-27T00:10:24] Luis Magalhaes: Blade motor i think
[2022-02-27T00:10:42] Happy Giraffe: My plan to slap 3000w motor and buy 1000w ali sticker and glue it on
[2022-02-27T00:11:09] Happy Giraffe: Then vesc profiles 30kmh vs unlimited
[2022-02-27T00:11:33] Oliver Eliasson: You could register as moped up to 1000w but then you need blinkers mirrors etc. and difficult to get approved
[2022-02-27T00:12:02] Happy Giraffe: Made so damn hard there
[2022-02-27T00:12:18] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah
[2022-02-27T00:12:45] Happy Giraffe: Sleeper scooters are the way then
[2022-02-27T00:13:01] Oliver Eliasson: There is a suggestion to change the law to 25km/h but no watt limit
[2022-02-27T00:13:12] Oliver Eliasson: Yep
[2022-02-27T00:13:53] Happy Giraffe: In Finland you see the 14yo kids riding 1000w 48v big seated scooters😂
[2022-02-27T00:14:01] Happy Giraffe: 25kmh tho
[2022-02-27T00:14:05] rosheee: I use 170a max / 135A max per motor / then tedone hallsensor setting, as wrll as changed and tweaked other settings to motor needs and for my feeling good times Also natural throttle with +15%
[2022-02-27T00:14:52] rosheee: Changed PID to my needs
[2022-02-27T02:40:38] Artem Bulashev: Lovely

[2022-02-27T05:21:33] Unknown: @artBula you have been invaluable to me. Thank you for all of you guidance and help along the way. Will be posting results once weather allows me to ride
[2022-02-27T06:30:57] Unknown: There will be some work involved then..I noticed the half duplex on the xiaomi dash from pics of it attached to a nano. But I haven't even looked at the 75100 yet. Got 2 on order. Thanks for the advice
[2022-02-27T12:37:33] Oliver Eliasson: When charging my vsett 9 orgininal battery it only displays 55.7 volts on vesc. Shouldn’t it be 58.8? 14s battery
[2022-02-27T12:47:26] rosheee: Whixh version u have
[2022-02-27T12:47:37] rosheee: V3sc version
[2022-02-27T12:48:36] Oliver Eliasson: Spintend ubox
[2022-02-27T12:48:51] Oliver Eliasson: 5.3 firmware maybe?
[2022-02-27T12:49:31] rosheee: Original spintend
[2022-02-27T12:50:26] Artem Bulashev: Compare with multimeter
[2022-02-27T12:50:31] Artem Bulashev: And recalibrate
[2022-02-27T12:53:56] Oliver Eliasson: Dont have multimeter
[2022-02-27T12:54:09] Oliver Eliasson: Will have to buy maybe
[2022-02-27T12:54:47] Artem Bulashev: Oh absolutely have to :)
[2022-02-27T12:56:06] Oliver Eliasson: Quality differs?
[2022-02-27T12:56:57] Oliver Eliasson: https://www.kjell.com/se/produkter/el-verktyg/matinstrument/multimetrar/uni-t-ut123c-multimeter-p40727
[2022-02-27T12:57:08] Oliver Eliasson: Whould this work?
[2022-02-27T13:10:53] Martin Kaktits: lube in the air gap? Makes no sense
[2022-02-27T13:13:43] Mirono escooters: Used for long. Good
[2022-02-27T16:46:42] rosheee: Btw Adam i think the NUTT brake has M6 banjo xD could be
[2022-02-27T16:55:06] Unknown: No way!! Haha. That would be too funny if it does
[2022-02-27T16:56:48] Unknown: Well, you're right. However, I do believe it adds some degree of magnetism to the overall magnet field and increases the saturation point maybe slight, maybe more than we realize. Motor simply feels stronger with ferrofluid for some reason or another. And my ERPMs we're slightly higher during auto set-up... So there's something happening
[2022-02-27T17:03:44] Martin Kaktits: interesrting. Now i want some ff too, but damn its expensive
[2022-02-27T17:04:39] rosheee: Anyone can check xD? Pls
[2022-02-27T17:17:52] Unknown: Considering what it is and how much you need, it really shouldn't be too expensive
[2022-02-27T17:19:07] Martin Kaktits: yes, but all good stuff i can find ships from Canada or US or smth and sells much more than just 5ml, so it kinda is. And I dont have local friends to share the expense with
[2022-02-27T17:19:45] Martin Kaktits: I DO have some FF, but only the cheap stuff from Ali that afaik, has low evaporation temp
[2022-02-27T17:19:47] Unknown: Gotcha. Maybe EU seller has? Ask some guys on here because most of them are in EU
[2022-02-27T17:19:58] Unknown: I wouldn't use it honestly
[2022-02-27T17:20:37] Martin Kaktits: Or maybe someone knows a hack to make the cheap stuff better? Mix it with additional mineral oil or smth 😅🤷‍♀
[2022-02-27T17:22:33] Unknown: LoL.. maybe? Sort of doubt it tho. It's the solids in the oil that can be conductive in the cheap stuff. That would be bad bad news. Real deal ferrofluid (statorade) is non-conductive for obvious reasons
[2022-02-27T17:23:31] Unknown: Some thought it was conductive but we determined it was absolutely not. Also the Grin Tech website states that it is no conductive and should never be
[2022-02-27T17:24:07] Martin Kaktits: Oh conductivity is fine on this. I had a physics guy test it with good equipment and it was good insulator
[2022-02-27T17:24:24] Unknown: Hmm.. so what would the other issue with it be?
[2022-02-27T17:24:42] Martin Kaktits: evaporation, flash point (burns)
[2022-02-27T17:25:18] Unknown: Interesting... Honestly I'm not sure what the evaporation temp is on statorade
[2022-02-27T17:26:23] Artem Bulashev: Flash point would be very high
[2022-02-27T17:26:57] Artem Bulashev: Evaporation not sure… as it is not closed environment so no high pressure that would increase evaporation Point
[2022-02-27T17:29:59] Martin Kaktits: Maybe i could experiment with it - put some in boiling water (100c and see if it evaporstes significantly and flames up) 🧐
[2022-02-27T17:32:07] Artem Bulashev: Won’t
[2022-02-27T17:32:13] Artem Bulashev: Also that’s not how it’s done
[2022-02-27T17:32:42] Artem Bulashev: You put it in a glass and heat up on accurate stove thingy in a lab :)
[2022-02-27T17:33:00] Artem Bulashev: Water will dilute it likely or effect it in some way
[2022-02-27T17:33:10] Artem Bulashev: I’m sure that info should be avaible
[2022-02-27T17:42:02] Martin Kaktits: not IN water - but on a pot thats in water
[2022-02-27T17:42:17] Martin Kaktits: water bath, since I dont have nice tools :D
[2022-02-27T17:43:04] Martin Kaktits: Its a method to melt chocholate and do some other things in the kitchen, as the boiling water ensures the temperature doesnt exceed 100C
[2022-02-27T17:52:04] Martin Kaktits: I cant find it at the moment. I *think* i read before for this particular FF that i have the flash point was ~80-90C.. soo, kinda low-ish. But I guess motors shouldnt get that hot in the first place anyway 🤷‍♀
[2022-02-27T17:56:19] Oliver Eliasson: So i messured the charger and got 56.3V It should be 58.8 right? 14s
[2022-02-27T18:03:05] Unknown: We were discussing the other day that winding temp can be 100c or higher (especially deep in the windings in the stator teeth) but the ferrofluid is located on the outside of the stator at the magnet faces/gaps, so that particular area should probably never exceed 90c in a normally operating motor.

[2022-02-27T18:08:48] Unknown: Yep
[2022-02-27T18:08:59] rosheee: Nutt has m5 ^^'
[2022-02-27T18:23:05] Artem Bulashev: I see sure yes
[2022-02-27T18:23:18] Artem Bulashev: But I don’t think anything will happen to it at 100c
[2022-02-27T18:23:55] Artem Bulashev: Though your winding also should not get to 100c if you are using ferrofluid as that heat transmits to Magnets almost directly
[2022-02-27T18:24:23] Artem Bulashev: I would limit start 80c and end 90-95c max for motor with ferrofluid
[2022-02-27T18:25:02] Artem Bulashev: Magnets don’t like above 85 but no permanent damage until above 100c even for low temp magnets
[2022-02-27T18:25:15] Artem Bulashev: (I don’t think those are used in motors though)
[2022-02-27T18:26:03] Artem Bulashev: Imagine using neodymium curved motors with 0.5mm or bellow Airgap
[2022-02-27T18:26:07] Artem Bulashev: 🥰🥰

[2022-02-27T19:41:49] Unknown: Who? What? Huh? Formula m6?
[2022-02-27T20:10:08] rosheee: Formula has m6
[2022-02-27T21:53:46] Unknown: Formula.. what brand/model caliper is that?
[2022-02-27T21:54:30] rosheee: fixing some stuff right now. get back 2 ya soon
[2022-02-27T21:54:42] Unknown: 👍👍
[2022-02-27T22:02:26] Happy Giraffe: 30€ for ferrofluid at EU stores is not that crazy expensive afterall, you need so little
[2022-02-27T22:03:07] Paolo ⁭: Yes in usa cost 25$ and not include vat
[2022-02-27T22:11:57] rosheee: 30ml then :D?
[2022-02-27T22:23:25] Happy Giraffe: In Finland company charges like 80€ for ferrofluiding😂
[2022-02-27T23:20:40] rosheee: anyone has shimano saint? :D
[2022-02-27T23:21:33] Artem Bulashev: I have m7120
[2022-02-27T23:21:42] rosheee: does it has M6 banjo xD?

[2022-02-27T23:24:18] Artem Bulashev: Long?
[2022-02-27T23:24:26] Artem Bulashev: 4 piston you mean?
[2022-02-27T23:24:34] rosheee: yep that's what i get from internet nope the banjo bolt/screw
[2022-02-27T23:24:46] Artem Bulashev: Ok no idea

[2022-02-27T23:26:02] Artem Bulashev: Yeah they are lovely smooth and not sudden bite
[2022-02-27T23:26:14] Artem Bulashev: I want to swap for magura in future
[2022-02-27T23:26:17] Artem Bulashev: Just to try :)
[2022-02-27T23:26:25] Artem Bulashev: For summer season
[2022-02-27T23:26:40] rosheee: 😃 never tried @ MTB
[2022-02-27T23:26:48] Artem Bulashev: This is Trial Bike
[2022-02-27T23:27:19] Artem Bulashev: I never did MTB, only did Street before

[2022-02-27T23:35:29] rosheee: or this..lol https://www.probikeshop.ch/de/ch/bremszugset-hope/118261.html
[2022-02-27T23:42:14] rosheee: or just sell the magura shizzl and buy shimano XD and can do it right from scratch
[2022-02-27T23:42:16] D J: Do you have link to buy?

[2022-02-27T23:52:05] D J: Thanks 👌
[2022-02-27T23:52:31] Happy Giraffe: You welcome👍
[2022-02-27T23:53:05] rosheee: @Happy_Giraffe u want 2xMT7 PRO +3x MT8 PRO xD?
[2022-02-27T23:53:26] Happy Giraffe: How much for MT7?🌚
[2022-02-27T23:53:45] Happy Giraffe: 80€?😁
[2022-02-27T23:53:49] rosheee: XD
[2022-02-27T23:54:14] rosheee: first have to find other brake ffs
[2022-02-27T23:54:40] Happy Giraffe: I still don't understand what exactly is your problem with them
[2022-02-27T23:54:43] sombre_enfant: Nutt ?
[2022-02-27T23:55:57] rosheee: i can't use 10x3 tires because of it
[2022-02-27T23:56:21] rosheee: 😆and i can't find the real deal here which fits for the change from inside to outside hose
[2022-02-27T23:56:57] Happy Giraffe: So Magura designed them in a way that doesnt allow swapping sides?
[2022-02-27T23:57:26] rosheee: it does but i can't find the right fitting parts ^^' they didn't designed it for it but it is possible
[2022-02-28T00:04:31] rosheee: Solution xD
[2022-02-28T00:05:31] sombre_enfant: Mr Wu know for sure
[2022-02-28T00:05:57] rosheee: ^^
[2022-02-28T00:07:14] rosheee: Solution bleeding lol epic Fucking genius
[2022-02-28T00:08:11] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-02-28T00:08:40] sombre_enfant: U bleed with seatdrop kit💀
[2022-02-28T00:08:55] sombre_enfant: Saddle*
[2022-02-28T00:10:51] rosheee: Whut?
[2022-02-28T00:11:27] rosheee: <photos/photo_2742@28-02-2022_00-11-27.jpg>
[2022-02-28T00:11:54] Artem Bulashev: Damm I’m so getting it
[2022-02-28T00:11:55] Happy Giraffe: Only if they did two identical holes with same thread...
[2022-02-28T00:14:54] rosheee: M6 bleeding is now hydraulic hose M5 is now bleeding
[2022-02-28T00:16:56] Happy Giraffe: I cant believe they didnt take it into account when designing the brake caliper, would have been so easy
[2022-02-28T00:17:14] rosheee: I told them..ffs! Mascarpones!
[2022-02-28T00:19:26] rosheee: Should be easy to selfmade a m6 banjo screw if tools are given?
[2022-02-28T00:19:31] Happy Giraffe: "Magura brakes allow for easy swapping of the hydraulic line side, this is to give our customers the flexibility for many different use cases" Reality = "we have two similar looking holes, lets put different thread so nobody maniac enough can swap it"
[2022-02-28T00:20:09] rosheee: U wrote first part, right xD?
[2022-02-28T00:20:20] rosheee: Yah m6 for bleed and m5 for hose ..original
[2022-02-28T00:22:13] rosheee: Hi, I sincerely apologize for the late response! There are no differences in width (all MT saddles are approx. 41mm wide). There is only one difference in the respect that the 4 piston pliers remain wide "longer". Best regards, John Unfortunately, we do not have a kit for this and unfortunately cannot recommend such a conversion. We'd love to hear your feedback at this point, but the brake isn't designed to be rebuilt in this form.
[2022-02-28T00:23:13] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2022-02-28T00:23:53] Happy Giraffe: So TLDR of this is I cant change the hose side on caliper?
[2022-02-28T00:28:04] rosheee: yes
[2022-02-28T00:28:36] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-02-28T00:29:23] Unknown: @roscheeee just use variable Regen and forget the Maguras 🤣 Tried my variable Regen out for the first time today and it is amazing. Literally used my Nutt brakes like 4 times during the 15 minute ride. Thumb throttle is slightly akward but have the left handed kart trigger throttle on the way which will be much nicer
[2022-02-28T00:29:24] rosheee: the blue ones needed..
[2022-02-28T00:30:25] rosheee: damn...i fear that..what if 100% charged and i have to go max brake @ 50mph?
[2022-02-28T00:30:40] rosheee: <sticker>

[2022-02-28T00:31:00] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-02-28T00:31:24] rosheee: they are the original ones for swap the hydraulic hose u need different ^^'
[2022-02-28T00:31:27] Unknown: Well, I mean you do need mechanical brakes of some sort lol.
[2022-02-28T00:32:02] Unknown: I was all board for Maguras but now with variable Regen my Nutt brakes are way more than enough
[2022-02-28T00:32:21] Artem Bulashev: Variable regen is my love
[2022-02-28T00:32:23] rosheee: yes and argh 😆i need front + rear light and idk how to get so far ^^
[2022-02-28T00:32:29] Artem Bulashev: I almost stopped using mechanical
[2022-02-28T00:32:29] Unknown: OMG bro... Amazing
[2022-02-28T00:32:51] Unknown: Left handed trigger will be nice until curve throttle is available
[2022-02-28T00:32:54] Happy Giraffe: Codenamed, Brake pad save
[2022-02-28T00:33:15] rosheee: no explosions? argh 😆feeear...and more cable 😆
[2022-02-28T00:34:03] Artem Bulashev: True as well
[2022-02-28T00:34:05] Artem Bulashev: Also!!
[2022-02-28T00:34:14] Artem Bulashev: Diskvreak gets super hot super fast
[2022-02-28T00:34:23] Artem Bulashev: And that transfers a lot of heat to the rim !
[2022-02-28T00:34:40] Unknown: Nahh man... A decent controller will imkt Regen at full charge. My Nuc will apply Regen up to the max voltage I have set... So doing 50 on full charge and slam the Regen, battery will only go to 84v max, so I'll still get some ebrake action
[2022-02-28T00:34:49] Artem Bulashev: I saw my rear motor get 22c hotter when I removed variable regen brake
[2022-02-28T00:34:54] Unknown: Never even thought about that
[2022-02-28T00:34:55] Artem Bulashev: And used mechanical only
[2022-02-28T00:35:01] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I was shocked
[2022-02-28T00:35:27] Artem Bulashev: I burned my self touch disk break after 10min ride in city, without regen
[2022-02-28T00:35:30] Unknown: So.. less motor heat with Regen you mean? Bc rotor isn't cooking the hub?
[2022-02-28T00:36:01] Artem Bulashev: Regen said to creat heat too
[2022-02-28T00:36:08] Artem Bulashev: But that was my observation
[2022-02-28T00:36:19] Artem Bulashev: Controller gets hotter sure but not an issue for me
[2022-02-28T00:37:00] Artem Bulashev: I think motor regen heats up equally the motor as throttle of same phase amps
[2022-02-28T00:37:26] Unknown: Gotcha, does make sense. Same here, my 12F per motor external mounted isn't worried about getting warm
[2022-02-28T00:37:43] Artem Bulashev: Lol for sure
[2022-02-28T00:39:19] rosheee: but then switch to nutt brakes xD?
[2022-02-28T00:39:52] Happy Giraffe: Get some weak proportional signal then maybe
[2022-02-28T00:40:29] Happy Giraffe: A signal that gives only a little voltage but never a lot
[2022-02-28T00:40:29] rosheee: i can use the g30D brake lever 0-3.3V like throttle ^^'
[2022-02-28T00:40:32] Unknown: They actually work really well with ceramic pads
[2022-02-28T00:41:19] sombre_enfant: Works with 3mm disc too😳
[2022-02-28T00:41:36] Happy Giraffe: Cant wait to use 203mm discs on bike🌚
[2022-02-28T00:41:49] sombre_enfant: <sticker>
[2022-02-28T00:43:48] rosheee: hmm...phuu...sell all maguras buy nutt ^^' or shimano where it is ffs possible then something for ebrake..or use ebrake lever..and yah..finally go 10x3 tires + ebrake + maybe get used to how the heck i connect front + rearlight ^^' lol

[2022-02-28T01:08:23] rosheee: replacing thermalpads for ubox = 0.5-2mm?anyone changed? ^^' last question of the day then prepare masterplan for tomorrow
[2022-02-28T01:15:18] Artem Bulashev: @Happy_Giraffe he did and improvement was huge
[2022-02-28T01:15:36] rosheee: true dat but he has single box maybe used different ones ah i have to open myself ^^'
[2022-02-28T01:15:47] Artem Bulashev: I see you have dual right
[2022-02-28T01:15:55] rosheee: yes
[2022-02-28T01:15:56] Artem Bulashev: I didn’t replace sorry 🤷‍♂️

[2022-02-28T01:21:22] rosheee: yah i found but what if it doesn't fit xD? looks easy to do ^^' hope he can..otherwise bike shop ffs or just widen the banjo of the m5 to m6 idk
[2022-02-28T01:25:04] Oliver Eliasson: Anyone know where I can find curve throttle that’s not the 200$ rion one? Found boosted rev but out of stock
[2022-02-28T01:25:23] rosheee: link? ^^
[2022-02-28T01:26:05] Oliver Eliasson: https://miniwheels.eu/products/rion-curve something like this
[2022-02-28T01:26:19] Paolo ⁭: Spintend remote controller 😂
[2022-02-28T01:27:20] Oliver Eliasson: I know using now but would be nice with something more permanent, will see how hard it will be to make a new case for remote
[2022-02-28T01:35:11] Artem Bulashev: That was the idea
[2022-02-28T01:36:34] Artem Bulashev: To redesign Spintend remote into assembly that would have scroll wheel located same as this rion throttle and would have display located above handle bar and buttons in between or next to display where finger can reach them easily
[2022-02-28T01:37:07] Artem Bulashev: But Damm that needs time

[2022-02-28T04:47:51] Unknown: You are not alone in your search lol. I've scoured everywhere. Waiting for alien rides to have curve dual action throttle in stock, they said a few more months. Curve makes throttle only and throttle/ebrake versions so be careful if buying

[2022-02-28T06:32:16] Unknown: Why why why are there no other dual action throttles!?! I don't get it. Are they that hard to produce?
[2022-02-28T06:58:01] rosheee: SPINTEND UBOX 75V V2 Thermal Pads 1x 2mm x 1.1cm x 9.6cm 1x 0.5mm x 2.4cm x 9.6cm
[2022-02-28T07:25:39] rosheee: Maybe use 1.5mm instead of 2mm..hmm..or better 2mm..hmm

[2022-02-28T18:44:20] Paolo ⁭: When factory asked me what current I’m at using, he think I’m crazy hahaha, using 30A rated motor at 350 phase
[2022-02-28T18:47:01] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-02-28T18:47:34] Luis Magalhaes: Im hoping my motor can handle the kelly 😂
[2022-02-28T18:47:38] Happy Giraffe: Ratings are stupid anyway
[2022-02-28T18:48:25] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu what about that 120kmh no video? 😜
[2022-02-28T18:49:50] Paolo ⁭: I can send you next time, but promise me don’t share it, because do these speed on public road
[2022-02-28T18:50:05] Paolo ⁭: Yea we have similar motor

[2022-02-28T18:52:09] Luis Magalhaes: What cables you pass on yours?
[2022-02-28T18:52:21] Paolo ⁭: Which?
[2022-02-28T18:52:32] Paolo ⁭: That new is 6mm2
[2022-02-28T18:55:47] Luis Magalhaes: You change cables in the old ones dont you?
[2022-02-28T20:56:55] Oliver Eliasson: <video_file>
[2022-02-28T20:58:11] Paolo ⁭: only on external side, internal 15cm of original cable. you cannot fit bigger cable.
[2022-02-28T21:01:46] Luis Magalhaes: Hum
[2022-02-28T21:02:51] Luis Magalhaes: It has to pass 😂
[2022-02-28T21:04:05] Luis Magalhaes: Original hole with 4mm2
[2022-02-28T21:04:17] Luis Magalhaes: Its more then the original ones
[2022-02-28T21:04:49] Paolo ⁭: You drilled axel
[2022-02-28T21:06:20] Luis Magalhaes: Yes opened the hole to 10mm it was 8.5mm inside
[2022-02-28T21:06:58] Paolo ⁭: And which cable fit?
[2022-02-28T21:08:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yellow cable is a switch
[2022-02-28T21:09:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Connect than check again and it will yellow now
[2022-02-28T21:09:07] Luis Magalhaes: A friend of mine says he can pass some silicone cables on 10mm hole 😂 will see
[2022-02-28T21:11:06] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_2755@28-02-2022_21-11-06.jpg>
[2022-02-28T21:11:56] Paolo ⁭: Burned motor?
[2022-02-28T21:12:49] Luis Magalhaes: No it was changing cable, the black part is the high temperature silicon 😂
[2022-02-28T21:14:47] sombre_enfant: Looks sketchy ngl
[2022-02-28T21:23:14] D J: <photos/photo_2756@28-02-2022_21-23-14.jpg>
[2022-02-28T21:24:31] Paolo ⁭: Bad job to drill axel
[2022-02-28T21:25:22] Happy Giraffe: One trick is to use strong electric tape etc and cut wires in an angle to create a cone shape. Then you cal pull the tape and wires come with it
[2022-02-28T21:27:36] D J: No tape on the wires...only heatshring
[2022-02-28T21:28:12] Luis Magalhaes: Yes the manufactor dont drill it 😂
[2022-02-28T21:28:17] Happy Giraffe: But to wrap electric tape (something thin and strong with good adhesive) and create a cone from it to help pull phase wires in the hole
[2022-02-28T21:28:44] Paolo ⁭: I asked them and they says this is really unsafe
[2022-02-28T21:28:55] Luis Magalhaes: Did not take a picture befor the drill but you can see it has a big open and the hit has a wall inside
[2022-02-28T21:29:01] D J: 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-02-28T21:29:46] Luis Magalhaes: Can you check the outside diameter of the two ?
[2022-02-28T21:30:28] Luis Magalhaes: I doubt its larger 😂
[2022-02-28T21:30:48] D J: Was easy with WD-40...4mm is the ideal size for the original hole. Luis likes wide holes 😁
[2022-02-28T21:31:35] D J: But it's a good idea
[2022-02-28T21:31:56] Happy Giraffe: Luis better have something xxl to push there if he drills
[2022-02-28T21:32:55] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-02-28T21:33:33] Luis Magalhaes: When i try to pass them i bring good or bad news 😂
[2022-02-28T21:34:08] sombre_enfant: Not Wu approved ?
[2022-02-28T21:34:50] Paolo ⁭: Not sucé …

[2022-02-28T21:41:55] Artem Bulashev: Silicon is bad choice
[2022-02-28T21:42:18] Paolo ⁭: Looks 10awg
[2022-02-28T21:42:19] Artem Bulashev: It can be cut easier, a lot easier than pvc isolated one
[2022-02-28T21:42:38] Artem Bulashev: Also isolation of silicon once is about 2-3 times thicker
[2022-02-28T21:43:21] Artem Bulashev: If you don’t have Any sharp edges and 90 degree sharp turns than sure, but keep that in mind
[2022-02-28T21:43:38] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_2758@28-02-2022_21-43-38.jpg>
[2022-02-28T21:44:26] Paolo ⁭: the section of the conductor is not measured in this way
[2022-02-28T21:44:40] Paolo ⁭: You can have same conduct section with half size
[2022-02-28T21:45:16] Paolo ⁭: For example 6mmq for motor is half size of 9AWG silicon wire
[2022-02-28T21:45:50] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i know, but its what i can get now 😅
[2022-02-28T21:47:07] Happy Giraffe: Can you reinforce it with external heat shrink + spring thingy next to where cable comes out?
[2022-02-28T21:47:13] Oliver Eliasson: Connect how?
[2022-02-28T21:47:33] Oliver Eliasson: To black or red wire?
[2022-02-28T21:49:41] Luis Magalhaes: Yes thats what i want to do

[2022-03-01T01:27:07] Unknown: Haha. I'm sure. They "cannot recommend" such usefulness 🤣
[2022-03-01T01:27:54] rosheee: magura was like "Hey, cool thing, we wish you a lot of fun with the brakes! However, please be aware of the following: we expressly cannot recommend the use of third-party parts in combination with our brakes. We have not tested these parts and therefore cannot guarantee the safety and functionality of the brake system. This also invalidates warranty and guarantee claims. "
[2022-03-01T01:29:06] Unknown: Incredibly stupid of them to "not allow" or even make a kit to change line sides. Like, what do they care?? Wouldn't it be smart and appeal to a much larger customer base to be able to fit any application?!? That's a huge turn off for me, especially at this point trying to figure out how to customize their stuff
[2022-03-01T01:29:17] Artem Bulashev: Btw what is that? I didn’t have before
[2022-03-01T01:29:23] Artem Bulashev: I get error message if I try to trigger it
[2022-03-01T01:29:44] Unknown: So why don't they make OEM parts to switch sides?? Lol
[2022-03-01T01:29:58] rosheee: yah they are the only baguettez who use M5 ..cmon wtf shows how stuck they are..i mean cmon JUST USE M6 BOTH SIDES
[2022-03-01T01:29:59] Paolo ⁭: what is?
[2022-03-01T01:30:05] Unknown: I don't have that option on my app.... Maybe a new version of the app?

[2022-03-01T01:30:39] rosheee: that is the question they don't answer..i even called the HQ in germany and was like "YO BRATANS?! GERMAN ENGINEERING WHERE?"
[2022-03-01T01:31:05] Unknown: Haha seriously. It's a really dumb move (or lack of move) on their part
[2022-03-01T01:31:19] Unknown: They force people to viod warranty and make custom setup
[2022-03-01T01:31:37] Unknown: And go thru huge headaches to find proper pieces
[2022-03-01T01:31:43] rosheee: yah warranty void even if u use different pads or NOT MAGURA DISCS lol..
[2022-03-01T01:32:31] Unknown: Oh geez.. for real?
[2022-03-01T01:33:17] rosheee: oh yes XD
[2022-03-01T01:33:18] Unknown: It's BMS app. Artem has "emergency" option but I have the same BMS/app (different version BMS) and no such option

[2022-03-01T01:34:40] rosheee: yah ^^' i think i gonna until they gonna whip my ass here ^^' or build a "hatebase"
[2022-03-01T01:35:07] rosheee: "listen 2 the customer" HE BUYS
[2022-03-01T01:36:08] Artem Bulashev: I didn’t have it before may be there is an update to your app?
[2022-03-01T01:36:10] rosheee: ^^' or maybe use real carbon instead of plastic
[2022-03-01T01:36:20] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t seem to do anything at the Moment
[2022-03-01T01:39:10] Unknown: I just checked for updates and nothing available
[2022-03-01T01:39:58] Unknown: Maybe if I redownload it there will be a new version? I'll try

[2022-03-01T02:46:12] Artem Bulashev: Less heat capacity
[2022-03-01T02:47:12] Artem Bulashev: At BEST it will do 100a each = 200a total So basically equal to Ubox dual at best in terms of amps, and I don’t think it will get there due to over heating
[2022-03-01T02:47:35] Artem Bulashev: Also it is larger
[2022-03-01T02:47:55] Artem Bulashev: And it is 12s only
[2022-03-01T02:48:27] Artem Bulashev: While same price as Ubox dual 100v 22s version
[2022-03-01T02:49:01] Artem Bulashev: And without added futures like 3v 12v, brake light and remote and so horn and so on
[2022-03-01T02:49:32] Artem Bulashev: Not competitive :)

[2022-03-01T15:07:41] Face de Pin Sucé: too much power, already broke one (motor goes out x) and the new one is already bent
[2022-03-01T15:08:42] Paolo ⁭: Fit WEPED motor?
[2022-03-01T15:08:48] Face de Pin Sucé: not much - Dualtron Spider - Dualtron 2 (not ready) - SPW Léger - Weped GTS (not ready) - Dualtron Thunder (not ready)
[2022-03-01T15:08:55] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂

[2022-03-01T15:22:03] Unknown: So true

[2022-03-01T15:23:56] Unknown: Was from Amazon USA. Not sure if it would benefit any EU guys. They're called lizard skins shock protectors/covers
[2022-03-01T16:24:25] Artem Bulashev: Can you do 0- 60 with screen recording of vesc app ? Configured correctly I don’t trust gps, I experimented a lot and non were accurate
[2022-03-01T16:25:38] Artem Bulashev: Live data from the rear wheel is best way to measure from my experience- much faster update rate and spot on accurate
[2022-03-01T16:26:55] Paolo ⁭: Gps is always more accurate than dash . And I don’t use vesc more actually
[2022-03-01T17:24:52] Artem Bulashev: Why?
[2022-03-01T17:25:02] Artem Bulashev: It can not be if dash is set corrrctly
[2022-03-01T17:25:21] Artem Bulashev: Gps can be more accurate only in direct line and constant speed
[2022-03-01T17:26:33] Paolo ⁭: True
[2022-03-01T17:26:44] Artem Bulashev: Phone Gps speed is terribly unrealizable due to slow refresh rates location along the line can only be estimated by +/- 40m at 60kmh
[2022-03-01T17:26:59] Artem Bulashev: At constant speed it uses predictive algorithms
[2022-03-01T17:27:58] Paolo ⁭: That’s not phone gps
[2022-03-01T17:28:04] rosheee: @Mirono_escooters still in for the gayest?
[2022-03-01T17:28:11] Artem Bulashev: Vesc gets data from wheel diameter and rpm. It is physical data from onboard sensors. It can not be less accurate than even high speed gps modules
[2022-03-01T17:28:26] Artem Bulashev: Unless I don’t know something

[2022-03-01T17:32:14] Face de Pin Sucé: if only I had time for that

[2022-03-01T17:34:17] Paolo ⁭: You should be have 100% accurate parameter set , and also have good tire pressure , and also gps need because too much people share fake data. Put tire size bigger and rock
[2022-03-01T17:37:23] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-01T17:37:37] Luis Magalhaes: Noo people always share true data, and are always the best 😂😂
[2022-03-01T17:38:01] rosheee: Fake tire is worser than the 'my dick so big i can 24/7 all year long lie'
[2022-03-01T17:38:12] Paolo ⁭: They how fuck want me believe a 50 with xiaomi with stock battery
[2022-03-01T17:38:14] Artem Bulashev: Yeah if settings are correct and double checked by going at maximum speed for few minutes constantly - gps should show exactly same km/h
[2022-03-01T17:38:22] Artem Bulashev: That’s easy check
[2022-03-01T17:38:36] Luis Magalhaes: In a cliff 😂
[2022-03-01T17:38:57] Happy Giraffe: My gps shows 55kmh and vesc tool 54.6kmh. Accurate enough🌚
[2022-03-01T17:39:10] Happy Giraffe: Never more than 1 kmh apart from each other
[2022-03-01T17:39:11] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2022-03-01T17:39:14] Luis Magalhaes: He was using draggy should be +- acurate i think
[2022-03-01T17:39:25] Artem Bulashev: Draggy is not bad yeah
[2022-03-01T17:39:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Dragy is best
[2022-03-01T17:39:58] Paolo ⁭: And also I haven’t speed record on my controllers
[2022-03-01T17:40:04] Artem Bulashev: Wonder how much variance / delay it has vs vesc measurements for example (after vesc is confirmed to show correct speed at 60kmh for example)
[2022-03-01T17:40:48] Artem Bulashev: RaceLodgic had additional external gps diversity to get even more accurate results
[2022-03-01T17:41:20] Artem Bulashev: I’m sure there are even better more expensive devices, but yeah those two are most common best at the price
[2022-03-01T17:41:29] Mirono escooters: Gayest what? Scooter?
[2022-03-01T17:41:39] Mirono escooters: Fuck this is hard to beat

[2022-03-01T22:54:08] rosheee: ah u can tell them to fuck off by law.
[2022-03-01T23:41:18] rosheee: anyone tested EBS Bearings? thery should beat the shit out of all other manufacturers
[2022-03-01T23:42:45] Mirono escooters: Y?
[2022-03-01T23:43:01] rosheee: ^^' my motor bearings are br0ken
[2022-03-01T23:43:10] rosheee: EOL
[2022-03-01T23:44:16] Mirono escooters: I Mean y beat shit
[2022-03-01T23:44:30] Paolo ⁭: Buy WEPED motor and not broke
[2022-03-01T23:44:35] Paolo ⁭: It have gigant bearing😂
[2022-03-01T23:44:51] rosheee: ^^' motors have ca.15'000km
[2022-03-01T23:45:01] rosheee: snow, salt, sun, water, shit, piss..
[2022-03-01T23:45:22] rosheee: regarding a benchmark with 3 competitors.. they beat them by thermal, life, and and and ^^'
[2022-03-01T23:45:33] rosheee: maybe overboostet german engineering X japanese prec.
[2022-03-01T23:45:47] Mirono escooters: Or marketing
[2022-03-01T23:46:01] rosheee: word but also 3 dif. institutes tested the bearings ^^ (marketing)
[2022-03-01T23:48:00] rosheee: EBS SS 6202 ZZ
[2022-03-01T23:48:30] Paolo ⁭: Buy skf
[2022-03-01T23:48:37] rosheee: yah all say that u tested them ever?=
[2022-03-01T23:50:12] Paolo ⁭: I change always in single motor scooter
[2022-03-01T23:50:25] rosheee: so u only used SKF so far ^^?
[2022-03-01T23:50:45] Paolo ⁭: Not many choices. Ali bearing very shit
[2022-03-01T23:50:51] rosheee: never ali
[2022-03-01T23:50:57] rosheee: quality stuff :D
[2022-03-01T23:53:04] rosheee: omg..WHY
[2022-03-01T23:54:20] rosheee: laminated is better than this? cuz of dirt
[2022-03-02T00:17:57] Unknown: One thing I noticed about my SKF bearings is that they have A LOT of rolling resistance due to the amazing double seals. I know once the grease warms up they loosen but still a lot of resistance
[2022-03-02T00:18:34] Paolo ⁭: Skf are two type, one is with high resistance and one less
[2022-03-02T00:18:40] Unknown: They are smooth as hell and sealed really well, but damn rolling resistance is noticable
[2022-03-02T00:18:44] Paolo ⁭: That depends by you what need
[2022-03-02T00:19:03] rosheee: ok the EBS also have steel doublesided
[2022-03-02T00:19:26] Unknown: Ahh.. I got the super sealed high resistance ones... Actually put my stock bearings back in my rear motor and ERPM is much higher in auto set-up
[2022-03-02T00:19:37] rosheee: hmm
[2022-03-02T00:19:59] Unknown: Want to put the stock bearings back in my front motor but don't want to waste more ferrofluid 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-03-02T00:19:59] rosheee: i had ORTECH ceramic bearings a year ago ^^'
[2022-03-02T00:20:07] Paolo ⁭: Major resistance mean major protection by water and other things
[2022-03-02T00:20:11] rosheee: fuck ferrofluid XD
[2022-03-02T00:20:22] rosheee: damn..have to reebuy
[2022-03-02T00:20:33] Paolo ⁭: Also available full metallic, rubber etc…
[2022-03-02T00:20:40] Unknown: Absolutely for sure... But I also have really good oil seals which seal the axel really well
[2022-03-02T00:21:00] rosheee: but what is better? luminated like SKF or steel?
[2022-03-02T00:21:12] Unknown: I have plenty extra to redo the front motor but still kills me to waste it lol
[2022-03-02T00:21:13] Paolo ⁭: I use 2 Rs
[2022-03-02T00:21:20] Unknown: Me too
[2022-03-02T00:21:53] rosheee: i just ask myself why the guy says they should fit my needs when he also sells skf n other stuff ^^'
[2022-03-02T00:22:07] Unknown: <photos/photo_2780@02-03-2022_00-22-07.jpg>

[2022-03-02T00:22:22] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-03-02T00:22:24] Unknown: 2rsh... Heavy seals
[2022-03-02T00:22:59] Unknown: I think I should have gotten the 2rs, not 2rsh
[2022-03-02T00:24:55] Artem Bulashev: Why would replacing bearing cause you to loose ferrofluid off it should be scattered around magnets?
[2022-03-02T00:25:12] Unknown: Stock Vsett wheel bearings are surprisingly good. May put them back in front. ERPM on rear with stock bearing is 495 and front with SKF 2rsh is 464
[2022-03-02T00:25:53] Unknown: Oh shit... Don't need to remove stator. Good point man.. only motor covers.. I dunno why was thinking of removing stator
[2022-03-02T00:27:13] Unknown: Thanks for straightening my brain out. You're absolutely right
[2022-03-02T00:27:29] rosheee: thx ^^' ❤️
[2022-03-02T00:27:38] Unknown: Another thing about bearing resistance....
[2022-03-02T00:28:37] Paolo ⁭: I think I loose already 100% of my ferrofluid lol
[2022-03-02T00:28:43] Paolo ⁭: I have motor with holes

[2022-03-02T00:37:33] rosheee: so why i need bearings..
[2022-03-02T00:37:48] Paolo ⁭: All due to flipsky fireworks
[2022-03-02T00:37:51] Paolo ⁭: Resend video pls

[2022-03-02T00:43:21] rosheee: XD u repaired it?
[2022-03-02T00:43:37] Paolo ⁭: No because damaged also pcb
[2022-03-02T00:44:58] rosheee: our group should build a vesc 2gether ^^' 100V 250-300A cont. 500A peak ^^'
[2022-03-02T00:49:03] Oliver Eliasson: We should try to design the ultimate scooter, or a couple for different use
[2022-03-02T00:54:48] rosheee: paolo get them for best italian price ^^ i bet
[2022-03-02T00:58:03] Paolo ⁭: 300A phase?
[2022-03-02T01:00:26] rosheee: battery for you
[2022-03-02T01:01:29] Paolo ⁭: Not have motore can support that current as battery
[2022-03-02T01:09:46] rosheee: the stock vsett bearings run sooo hot...jesus
[2022-03-02T01:20:42] Unknown: Hot??
[2022-03-02T01:21:00] rosheee: yep ^^' when i touch it it is hot and the hotter the louder
[2022-03-02T01:21:23] rosheee: dis
[2022-03-02T01:21:54] rosheee: had same with g30 bearings when go retard 50kmh or more all time
[2022-03-02T01:22:25] Unknown: Wow.. I never realized one bearing can actually get that much hotter than another. I would actually think the SKF 2rsh would get hotter due to the higher resistance
[2022-03-02T01:22:25] rosheee: g30 motor was hot as well ^^' it looked fried inside a friend said
[2022-03-02T01:22:45] rosheee: true dat, dat is why ZZ should be better ^^'
[2022-03-02T01:23:02] Unknown: But ZZ has no rubber seals
[2022-03-02T01:23:05] rosheee: true dat
[2022-03-02T01:23:07] rosheee: but better heat 😆
[2022-03-02T01:23:15] rosheee: then u need the right grease inside and and and
[2022-03-02T01:23:16] Unknown: For sure. Least resistance of all
[2022-03-02T01:23:24] Unknown: Yup for sure
[2022-03-02T01:23:28] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-02T01:23:42] rosheee: so i still dunno what the ceramic ones would be nice
[2022-03-02T01:23:45] rosheee: BUT FUCKING 100$
[2022-03-02T01:23:47] Unknown: I have the SKF 2rsh in front and stock Vsett in rear...
[2022-03-02T01:23:55] Unknown: Holy shit I know!!! I looked into them
[2022-03-02T01:24:23] rosheee: ok i go with the 2rsh front rear and see howmany km they go
[2022-03-02T01:24:27] Unknown: So deciding whether to put stock Vsett bearings in front or put SKF in rear... I want both motors the same
[2022-03-02T01:24:45] rosheee: word but rear has def. more work 2 do
[2022-03-02T01:24:54] rosheee: so better skf rear
[2022-03-02T01:24:54] Unknown: Those bad boys will go forever. Italian made masterpiece... But high rolling resistance
[2022-03-02T01:25:07] rosheee: 6202-2RSH - Rillenkugellager, 8.06kN, 28000min-1, SKF
[2022-03-02T01:26:06] Unknown: Not sure what those numbers mean... Is that good or bad? LoL
[2022-03-02T01:26:32] rosheee: max 28k rpm
[2022-03-02T01:26:57] rosheee: Static load rating of 3.75 kN and dynamic load rating of 8.06 kN to support heavy-duty applications
[2022-03-02T01:27:10] Unknown: Just took my SKF out of old covers.. have them in my hand now with stock Vsett bearings in my hand also... SKF are tight tight with resistance and Vsett bearings are smooth but very little resistance
[2022-03-02T01:27:20] Unknown: Ahh.. gotcha
[2022-03-02T01:27:50] Unknown: I wonder how much difference that extra resistance makes while riding
[2022-03-02T01:28:01] Unknown: That's the question
[2022-03-02T01:28:20] Unknown: Once grease and rubber seals warm up, there might not be much resistance at all... But maybe
[2022-03-02T01:29:42] Unknown: Clearly can see rear motor free spins much easier than front in the air.. also ERPM in auto set-up is different between the 2 bearing types... Real life riding, how much difference does it make?! Anyone have input on that?
[2022-03-02T01:30:55] rosheee: i check inet for infos
[2022-03-02T01:31:47] Unknown: <photos/photo_2782@02-03-2022_01-31-47.jpg>

[2022-03-02T01:32:05] rosheee: that nice little thing god damned
[2022-03-02T01:32:13] Unknown: 464 ERPM on front SKF bearings and 487 ERPM on rear Vsett bearings
[2022-03-02T01:32:39] Unknown: 🥰 it's my love
[2022-03-02T01:33:09] rosheee: oh shit
[2022-03-02T01:33:23] rosheee: idk how warm the 2rs are when max b00st riding
[2022-03-02T01:33:45] rosheee: but at 240 F * they ^^' don't lkke it
[2022-03-02T01:34:44] rosheee: ZZ = 450° F
[2022-03-02T01:34:46] Unknown: But that's in the air unloaded with cold bearings...Once bearing grease and rubber seals warm, how much difference... I know SKF is definitely better quality no question but also don't want to make my battery/controllers work harder and have less speed/acceleration because of the bearings lol. That's silly
[2022-03-02T01:35:15] Unknown: Yup, no rubber to affect, all metal
[2022-03-02T01:35:54] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-02T01:35:56] rosheee: 2RU <—
[2022-03-02T01:36:06] rosheee: it's a mix out of 2RS and ZZ
[2022-03-02T01:36:16] rosheee: Type 2RU - Molded rubber seal, non- contact. This type of seal is Buna-N bonded to a steel insert. The seal is fixed into a groove in the outer ring. This type of seal can be removed but care must be used not to bend or cut the seal lip. Max operating temperature is 240° F. This type of seal has a very thin lip adjacent to the inner ring but does not make contact. It provides better protection than type ZZ or ZZS, but without the increase in torque exhibited by type 2RS. Certain lubricants and chemicals react with rubber. The code for a single seal is RU.
[2022-03-02T01:36:29] rosheee: https://www.astbearings.com/bearing-closures.html
[2022-03-02T01:37:39] Unknown: Oh very nice! Good find man
[2022-03-02T01:38:10] Unknown: @PaoloWu @artBula any input on this bearing resistance thing?
[2022-03-02T01:38:18] Unknown: I'm truly curious now
[2022-03-02T01:39:36] Unknown: Those 2RU look promising. Also Vsett motors have oil seals (simmerings) which keep most moisture and dirt out of the bearings and motor itself... So 2rsh is definitely not needed. @roscheeee upgraded oil seals for Vsett motors make a huge difference for sealing it.. sec.
[2022-03-02T01:40:04] rosheee: hmm ^^' ...maybe..when i added ferrofluid 😆something some small seal ^^' maybe got lost

[2022-03-02T01:40:36] rosheee: these are the ones inside alrdy, right?
[2022-03-02T01:40:39] Unknown: These have metal springs and make a really good seal
[2022-03-02T01:40:53] Unknown: Yes but better ones with metal springs and better seals
[2022-03-02T01:40:57] rosheee: ahh
[2022-03-02T01:40:58] rosheee: ❤️❤️
[2022-03-02T01:41:00] Unknown: The stock ones are... Okay
[2022-03-02T01:41:30] rosheee: so these are the right ones? 2x 15x25x5 and 2x 20x28x6
[2022-03-02T01:41:35] Unknown: Oil seals also known as "simmerings"
[2022-03-02T01:41:54] rosheee: yah ^^'
[2022-03-02T01:41:54] Unknown: Exactly

[2022-03-02T01:46:41] Unknown: Yea I do... Never even saw those reddish ones
[2022-03-02T01:47:25] Unknown: Maybe better than black? My bearings have zero rust on them, stock bearings and seals did... So I know the black seals work well for sure, better than stock for sure
[2022-03-02T01:49:11] rosheee: i just used it sock
[2022-03-02T01:49:23] rosheee: stock also no rust..even drove whole winter with them

[2022-03-02T01:56:00] rosheee: when you calculate the size of bearing with max 13 000 r/min with the rpm u do on max speed
[2022-03-02T01:58:35] Unknown: For real?? Wow... Those are the ones I use.. just took them out after about 400 miles and they're in perfect shape, still have quite a bit of resistance
[2022-03-02T01:58:59] Unknown: 13000 revolutions per minute... That seems awfully low
[2022-03-02T01:59:06] rosheee: when u ride how many % u go max speed?
[2022-03-02T01:59:28] Unknown: A lot LoL
[2022-03-02T01:59:44] Unknown: Well, above 35-40 mph very often
[2022-03-02T02:00:30] rosheee: maybe the hax is -> the "simmenring" and then the ZZ BEARINGS = ❤️
[2022-03-02T02:01:27] Unknown: But if Vsett ERPM (motor revolutions, not tire) is 460-490 say... That's well well under the rated 13000 of the SKFs.. right?
[2022-03-02T02:01:41] Unknown: Because ERPM is at bearing.. not wheel/tire rpm
[2022-03-02T02:02:03] rosheee: ERPM XD?
[2022-03-02T02:02:10] Unknown: <photos/photo_2789@02-03-2022_02-02-10.jpg>
[2022-03-02T02:02:18] rosheee: that is 25k
[2022-03-02T02:02:36] rosheee: hmm but i talk about the rpm of the tire
[2022-03-02T02:02:46] rosheee: which (in test) is for the 10+ like 2500
[2022-03-02T02:03:03] Unknown: But bearing/motor rpm is different than motor rpm since different diameters
[2022-03-02T02:03:09] rosheee: yes
[2022-03-02T02:03:13] rosheee: the bearing is 1.1"
[2022-03-02T02:03:19] rosheee: inside 0.8" something
[2022-03-02T02:03:27] Unknown: Following..
[2022-03-02T02:03:28] rosheee: take that and calculate it up to tire
[2022-03-02T02:03:34] rosheee: ^^' or is that bullshit xD?
[2022-03-02T02:03:42] Unknown: I have no idea 😂😂😂
[2022-03-02T02:03:47] rosheee: makes sense to me
[2022-03-02T02:03:51] Unknown: So bearing is spinning 10x faster than tire?
[2022-03-02T02:03:55] Unknown: It does...
[2022-03-02T02:04:18] Unknown: 10" vs 1"
[2022-03-02T02:04:38] rosheee: yres
[2022-03-02T02:04:39] rosheee: omg
[2022-03-02T02:04:42] rosheee: if not i am dumb
[2022-03-02T02:04:44] rosheee: was never got @ math
[2022-03-02T02:05:25] rosheee: second
[2022-03-02T02:05:26] rosheee: ^^
[2022-03-02T02:05:32] rosheee: nah
[2022-03-02T02:05:49] rosheee: omg 4th degree stuff
[2022-03-02T02:07:14] rosheee: https://engineering.mit.edu/engage/ask-an-engineer/does-the-outside-edge-of-a-ceiling-fan-blade-move-faster-than-the-inside-edge/
[2022-03-02T02:07:16] rosheee: ^^
[2022-03-02T02:10:31] Unknown: Soooo... According to that, the 1" bearing would be spinning 10x slower than the 10" tire
[2022-03-02T02:10:35] Unknown: LoL... Right?
[2022-03-02T02:11:56] rosheee: So the simple answer is yes, even though they’re rotating together, the outside edge of a ceiling fan blade moves faster than its inside edge.
[2022-03-02T02:12:01] Unknown: I don't fuckin know... Vsett bearings going back in front motor to match rear. If they fail, I have SKFs as backups 🤣
[2022-03-02T02:12:13] Unknown: Exactly... Outside edge is tire and inside edge is bearing
[2022-03-02T02:12:29] rosheee: yas
[2022-03-02T02:12:31] Unknown: So bearing is slower and tire is faster..
[2022-03-02T02:12:50] Unknown: 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-03-02T02:13:35] rosheee: noxD
[2022-03-02T02:13:43] Unknown: I have bearing puller so changing them out takes me just a few minutes... Going to experiment with Vsett bearings and see how far they go. Maybe if I have 200 to burn I'll go for ceramics
[2022-03-02T02:13:51] Unknown: 😂 no?

[2022-03-02T02:38:11] rosheee: what is it now
[2022-03-02T02:46:56] rosheee: wtf
[2022-03-02T09:51:40] Oliver Eliasson: How many would be intersted in a curve throttle like the rion one?
[2022-03-02T11:26:59] rosheee: How to use that?
[2022-03-02T11:27:41] rosheee: U roll the throttle with thumb and then it spinns back to zero if u let kt go?
[2022-03-02T11:28:06] Oliver Eliasson: Yes
[2022-03-02T11:28:19] Oliver Eliasson: And roll other way to use regen brake
[2022-03-02T11:31:02] Mirono escooters: How do you all remove bearings?
[2022-03-02T11:31:06] rosheee: So when u just toll like 5% back u grt brake?
[2022-03-02T11:31:33] rosheee: What is the correct way for Ball Bearing removal and Installation?? - YouTube https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HpbmKnzYSa0
[2022-03-02T11:31:39] rosheee: @Mirono_escooters
[2022-03-02T11:31:48] Mirono escooters: Ty
[2022-03-02T11:47:05] Oliver Eliasson: Its variable regen so 5% you get very little ebrake and roll more you get more ebrake
[2022-03-02T11:47:20] Oliver Eliasson: Can set the strength in vesc tool
[2022-03-02T12:56:54] Happy Giraffe: They have same rpm but as tire is bigger its spinning faster as radius is bigger?😳

[2022-03-02T19:37:57] Unknown: Wow that's beautiful. One stop shop
[2022-03-02T19:41:50] Unknown: 👍. Just ordered some new 2rs timken bearings. After putting the Vsett bearings back in last night, motor has a small clicking sound even after readjusting the motor covers a few times. It's very minor but new bearings are easy enough to throw in so why not. I think the inner race of the stock bearings might be ever so slightly loose. After looking into the 2rsh SKFs, those heavy duty seals just aren't needed and create drag on the system. I didn't realize that when I bought them. Live n learn, no biggie
[2022-03-02T19:46:35] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌 awesome
[2022-03-02T19:46:40] Artem Bulashev: Let me know
[2022-03-02T19:47:14] Artem Bulashev: Will have to update vsett guild pdf and group pinned messages
[2022-03-02T20:20:41] Happy Giraffe: Damnnnn
[2022-03-02T20:20:45] Happy Giraffe: RS on fire
[2022-03-02T20:33:51] Unknown: Yup... Just realizing this now. 2rsh = too much rolling resistance and heavy seals simply not needed with good simmerings
[2022-03-02T20:53:38] Paolo ⁭: Buy ZZ
[2022-03-02T20:54:10] Paolo ⁭: https://www.tme.eu/it/details/skf6003-2z/cuscinetti-a-rulli/skf/6003-2z-skf/?brutto=1&currency=EUR&gclid=CjwKCAiAyPyQBhB6EiwAFUuaks7id6vGOCtKJlbNRuSn0ly0akq-4VM9u0zRQLIQUB5swsZMmK7ijBoCGk4QAvD_BwE
[2022-03-02T21:07:47] Artem Bulashev: Why? What is zz?
[2022-03-02T21:09:22] Paolo ⁭: 2Z *
[2022-03-02T21:10:09] Paolo ⁭: I use it for more than year, have much less resistance
[2022-03-02T21:11:12] Artem Bulashev: What is the difference between zz and 2rs
[2022-03-02T21:11:23] Mirono escooters: @lBabacar im starting to clean frame for flashy rose
[2022-03-02T21:11:40] rosheee: sry bicycle mechanix guys in switzerland are dumb as fuck
[2022-03-02T21:11:57] Artem Bulashev: There must be some manual o those
[2022-03-02T21:12:16] rosheee: I FASK THAT DUDE "U HAVE M6 BANJO N SHIT?" "HAS SHIMANO M6 FOR HOSE?" the answer..omfg "SHIMANO HAS SHIMANO NOT M6" "WE D'NT HAVE M6"
[2022-03-02T21:12:22] rosheee: anyway
[2022-03-02T21:13:39] Paolo ⁭: 2rs the best for protect by water , 2Z less resistance but protection grade is lower
[2022-03-02T21:13:58] rosheee: ZZ is open not laminated isolated
[2022-03-02T21:14:15] rosheee: more torque needed and less spead...more heat
[2022-03-02T21:14:35] Martin Kaktits: oh cmon, the resistanve from 2rs is miniscule compared to everything else
[2022-03-02T21:14:37] rosheee: ZZ 0 torque + more speed + less heat..and higher temp
[2022-03-02T21:15:24] rosheee: i've send link where u can read everything
[2022-03-02T21:15:25] rosheee: ❤️
[2022-03-02T21:15:56] Mirono escooters: These guys want Optimal everywhere
[2022-03-02T21:18:19] rosheee: yes
[2022-03-02T21:18:31] rosheee: researched 3h yesterday
[2022-03-02T21:18:37] rosheee: and found the right shizzl for me now
[2022-03-02T21:23:20] Unknown: ZZ have only metal seals, not rubber. 2rs I think is a happy medium for protection and speed/resistance. 2rsh is unnecessary. ZZ has very little if any rolling resistance, less heat (no rubber seals to degrade) and faster rpm rating
[2022-03-02T21:24:07] Unknown: What you go with?? I got 2rs today.. that will be fine for me
[2022-03-02T21:24:09] rosheee: maybe the hax is -> the "simmenring" and then the ZZ BEARINGS = ❤️
[2022-03-02T21:24:32] Unknown: The simmerings help tremendously.. so ZZ almostly definitely fine
[2022-03-02T21:24:33] rosheee: order simmenring and then go for ceramic bearing
[2022-03-02T21:25:18] rosheee: i am back in 1-2h
[2022-03-02T21:25:21] Unknown: I looked at the ceramics today... The hybrid steel housing ceramic balls are nice. Still expensive. I got 4 2rs good quality bearings for 30 bucks. Timken brand. Not amazing but good
[2022-03-02T21:25:22] rosheee: have to finish brakeshizzl
[2022-03-02T21:25:54] rosheee: i pay for 4 bearings 100CHF = 100eur BUT i get warranty
[2022-03-02T21:26:46] Unknown: Lucky guy.. who uses warranty on bearings? LoL 😂
[2022-03-02T21:48:47] Martin Kaktits: lose weight, start starvation diet 🤣
[2022-03-02T21:51:14] rosheee: True swisslaw
[2022-03-02T21:53:17] Unknown: I tend to agree that 2rs is the sweet spot unless you're drag racing. 2rsh on the other hand, has tons of resistance. Learning new things all the time
[2022-03-02T21:53:22] Unknown: 😯
[2022-03-02T22:08:29] Mirono escooters: 100€???
[2022-03-02T22:11:40] Paolo ⁭: Cost 5€ more or less
[2022-03-02T22:59:54] rosheee: Mhm
[2022-03-02T23:02:01] rosheee: If u get them with same specs, lub, bearing and materials please Happy there are also dif. Models of the 2rs and rsh with dif. Lubes and and..from 4euro to 120 euro per bearing.
[2022-03-02T23:02:57] Mirono escooters: 120??
[2022-03-02T23:03:03] Mirono escooters: Per??

[2022-03-03T01:47:24] Unknown: VESC... Use variable Regen with separate brake lever
[2022-03-03T01:47:35] Unknown: On what scoot? Vsett??
[2022-03-03T01:47:50] Unknown: Don't sell Vsett... Can be a monster

[2022-03-03T01:51:47] rosheee: i maybe gonna try it
[2022-03-03T01:51:55] rosheee: or i just use the 10x2.5 tires
[2022-03-03T01:51:55] rosheee: OR
[2022-03-03T01:51:58] Unknown: All the brake power you need 90% of the time
[2022-03-03T01:51:59] rosheee: i order shimano brake XD
[2022-03-03T01:52:10] Unknown: CST tires are niceee

[2022-03-03T01:53:18] Unknown: I just ordered 2 more PMT 10x3 because my front PMT was giant wobble off blansce
[2022-03-03T01:53:18] rosheee: i can't use them with that brake
[2022-03-03T01:53:22] rosheee: damn

[2022-03-03T01:54:03] rosheee: now mounted 10x3 and dick so hard
[2022-03-03T01:54:08] Unknown: What the hell
[2022-03-03T01:54:26] rosheee: why else should i do the mod when 10x3 would fit with hydro hose inside?
[2022-03-03T01:54:43] rosheee: i wanna see the lambo guy @ vsett chat when he has 2 brake
[2022-03-03T01:55:04] Unknown: Yea true.. but didn't you move line to outside??
[2022-03-03T01:55:13] rosheee: YES XD
[2022-03-03T01:55:16] rosheee: AND NOW IT DOESN'T BRAKE
[2022-03-03T01:55:18] Unknown: I can't follow you EU guys 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2022-03-03T01:55:23] rosheee: i bleeeded like a fucking idiot
[2022-03-03T01:55:31] rosheee: here
[2022-03-03T01:55:32] Unknown: Whattt
[2022-03-03T01:56:17] Unknown: So after you switched the lines, you have no brake power??
[2022-03-03T01:56:18] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-03-03T01:56:22] rosheee: Hete
[2022-03-03T01:56:50] Unknown: That's craziness.. shouldn't be
[2022-03-03T01:57:01] Unknown: Did you seal the old M5 port good???
[2022-03-03T01:57:08] Unknown: Copper washer with M5 screw?
[2022-03-03T01:57:12] rosheee: XD yes
[2022-03-03T01:57:17] Unknown: Hmmm
[2022-03-03T01:57:20] rosheee: Nothing comes out
[2022-03-03T01:57:26] Unknown: So wierd
[2022-03-03T01:57:34] Unknown: Shouldn't be that man
[2022-03-03T01:57:38] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-03T01:57:54] Unknown: That's fucked
[2022-03-03T01:58:49] Unknown: Air getting in somewhere maybe?? I don't understand how that happens. Many have switched brake line sides with success...
[2022-03-03T01:59:04] Unknown: I dunno.. maybe Magura was right after all 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-03-03T02:00:07] Unknown: Without being there it's hard to troubleshoot... Seems like air is getting in the lines somewhere. When you re-bleed, do you have/see air bubbles??
[2022-03-03T02:03:39] rosheee: nothing
[2022-03-03T02:03:40] rosheee: 0
[2022-03-03T02:03:55] rosheee: i bleeded like 10min with 2 when u 1st time do it
[2022-03-03T02:04:00] rosheee: then another 10min fastbleed
[2022-03-03T02:04:02] rosheee: nothing

[2022-03-03T02:14:58] rosheee: shimano XTR has it outside
[2022-03-03T02:15:05] Unknown: I don't either man
[2022-03-03T02:15:11] rosheee: is XTR nice?
[2022-03-03T02:15:33] rosheee: https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/xtr-m9000/BR-M9000.html
[2022-03-03T02:15:43] Unknown: Then you still need separate ebrake right? With Xtr?
[2022-03-03T02:15:51] rosheee: nah
[2022-03-03T02:15:51] rosheee: https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/xtr-m9000/BR-M9020.html
[2022-03-03T02:16:31] Unknown: So no Regen at all? Only mechanical?
[2022-03-03T02:16:39] rosheee: yes
[2022-03-03T02:17:37] Unknown: <animation>
[2022-03-03T02:17:47] Unknown: Use ebrake on separate lever too
[2022-03-03T02:18:11] Unknown: VESC can use variable Regen, it's a beautiful thing
[2022-03-03T02:18:22] rosheee: i order ebrake lever now
[2022-03-03T02:19:17] Unknown: Any hall sensor based throttle lever will do. I'm using Kart thumb throttle but have left handed trigger throttle on the way for regen
[2022-03-03T02:19:21] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>

[2022-03-03T02:22:17] rosheee: xD?
[2022-03-03T02:22:53] Unknown: There is air getting in somewhere
[2022-03-03T02:24:38] Unknown: If no brake fuild coming out, then air leak is likely up top at the lever
[2022-03-03T03:19:09] rosheee: on 5 levers XD
[2022-03-03T03:19:11] rosheee: now on 4
[2022-03-03T03:21:22] Unknown: It's the line to lever connection via olive that's important
[2022-03-03T07:58:21] Oliver Eliasson: Chatting with spintend now and they seam interested in creating a curve throttle

[2022-03-03T16:14:40] Happy Giraffe: BAC controllers also have police mode on startup
[2022-03-03T16:14:43] Happy Giraffe: https://www.cycmotor.com/x1-pro-gen-2
[2022-03-03T16:14:52] Happy Giraffe: Looks juicy for 250nm😅
[2022-03-03T16:29:14] Unknown: Those ASI BAC** controllers are beasts. I believe they're 72v max (16s), they're large which is not usually an issue on ebike and I've heard that programming them can be a royal pain. I actually think they come pre-programmed for a particular motor and switching the settings requires contacting manufacturer. I'm pretty sure that's the deal but I could be off. I would look into that if you're thinking about one
[2022-03-03T16:31:03] Happy Giraffe: Hmm they have a phone app and all now
[2022-03-03T16:40:35] Stan: Thank you
[2022-03-03T16:42:05] Unknown: Oh good good. I would hope so. I just remember reading something on endless sphere where someone mentioned what a pain it was to make parameter adjustments and having to contact/wait for ASI to unlock their controller or something. That may have changed since
[2022-03-03T16:48:05] Happy Giraffe: But theres some shady stuff like no warranty when using with other motors etc. so I gotta study a bit to choose Vesc vs BAC
[2022-03-03T17:29:48] Unknown: Yes ASI is an odd company from everything I've read and heard about them. They're usually meant to be paired with a specific motor... Like, I don't even know if you could pair an ASI BAC with say a scooter hub motor that isn't on their "list" of pre-programmed motors... But again, my knowledge is limited but that's what I've taken away from what I've read about them
[2022-03-03T17:31:12] Paolo ⁭: Some Rion are with bac
[2022-03-03T17:32:18] Stan: How is Nucular compared to bac ?
[2022-03-03T17:37:55] Unknown: Interesting... Like I said, I'm not positive but I remember hearing some odd things. I'm sure where there's a will, there's a way
[2022-03-03T17:38:32] Mirono escooters: Wish i could have it on camera
[2022-03-03T17:38:54] Mirono escooters: Shit too flashy
[2022-03-03T17:39:07] Paolo ⁭: Never tried nuc, is a war for get it. Ask to Adam , he have 2 nuc 12f
[2022-03-03T17:39:16] Mirono escooters: Also 69 members. nice Sorry back on subject
[2022-03-03T17:50:28] Artem Bulashev: What a pleasure :)
[2022-03-03T17:50:47] Artem Bulashev: Just pumped up Phase current from 85 to 95a on both wheels
[2022-03-03T17:51:08] Artem Bulashev: Before on 5.2 could not have imagine to be able to do it
[2022-03-03T17:51:23] Artem Bulashev: But on 5.3 it works super smooth
[2022-03-03T17:52:24] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2022-03-03T17:53:38] Artem Bulashev: For summer will add ferro and set 100a phase both and 35a battery for both 👌
[2022-03-03T17:53:54] Artem Bulashev: Hope those 650w motors will not over heat it at 16s - stator is tiny
[2022-03-03T17:55:39] Unknown: 🥰 awesome man... Those phase amps have a tremendous impact on power delivery. Glad it's working out good so far man
[2022-03-03T17:55:49] Artem Bulashev: That’s basically 1400w nominal - 2100w max continues, same performance as 10+ stock
[2022-03-03T18:01:51] Unknown: That's impressive man. The higher voltage was key. Just have to manage the heat now, statorade is our friend 👍. But yea, 650w motors performing like 1400w is something else
[2022-03-03T18:01:53] Happy Giraffe: So this means I won't be able to program the shit?😂
[2022-03-03T18:02:44] Unknown: That's what I'm talking about! LoL
[2022-03-03T18:03:28] Unknown: They usually come pre-programmed for a specific motor. I'm sureeee there are ways around it but worth the hassle? I tend to think not
[2022-03-03T18:03:29] rosheee: <photos/photo_2812@03-03-2022_18-03-29.jpg>

[2022-03-03T18:05:32] Mirono escooters: That's thé point i am afraid
[2022-03-03T18:05:51] Mirono escooters: Imagine being such a shitty manufacturer to lock your shit so People would buy specific motors
[2022-03-03T18:05:57] Mirono escooters: Never supporting that
[2022-03-03T18:06:04] Mirono escooters: Same with Apple chargers for example...
[2022-03-03T18:06:35] Unknown: Exactly man. I knew I wasn't going crazy
[2022-03-03T18:07:07] Happy Giraffe: Damn, I will avoid it like plague then
[2022-03-03T18:08:16] Unknown: That's why I never look into them much. I read a few things like that and stopped my research immediately lol
[2022-03-03T18:09:15] Happy Giraffe: Such insanity for any manufacturer to use those
[2022-03-03T18:10:24] Happy Giraffe: Not sure if Vesc will ever get pedal torque sensor 0-1.5v support
[2022-03-03T18:11:00] Unknown: So I use these Higo L1019 connectors for my phase/hall/temp sensor on my Vsett 10 motors. I'm re-wiring another new motor right now and just realized the stock phase wires are 3.0mm² and the Higo L1019 phase wires are 4.0mm² I know Paolo, nothing like your 7awg heavy cables on 70mm magnet motors, but plenty sufficient for these motors. Stock phase wires, 12awg. Higo phase wires 11awg. By the way, connectors have never even got warm during a ride

[2022-03-03T18:12:57] Unknown: At the risk of sounding like a dummy, what is sucé
[2022-03-03T18:13:25] Mirono escooters: Problably suce approved
[2022-03-03T18:13:25] Happy Giraffe: Edgy way of communication
[2022-03-03T18:13:26] Mirono escooters: Thé guy
[2022-03-03T18:13:50] Unknown: Haha.. got it 🤣
[2022-03-03T18:14:28] Unknown: The context it's been used in I sort of figured
[2022-03-03T18:15:03] Unknown: I guess my point was... The Higo phase wires are better than the stock phase wires haha
[2022-03-03T18:15:18] Mirono escooters: I just direct solder xd
[2022-03-03T18:15:21] Mirono escooters: Or 8mm banana
[2022-03-03T18:15:44] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2022-03-03T18:16:09] Unknown: I like being able to free the motor from the scoot for maintenance. Plus, that one wire includes the phase, halls and temp sensor wires, so it's super clean single wire for all
[2022-03-03T18:17:19] Unknown: <photos/photo_2817@03-03-2022_18-17-19.jpg>

[2022-03-03T18:18:14] Unknown: 🤷🏻‍♂️ I just like it. For any larger motor, 60mm-70mm, I would not use it. 50mm Vsett 10 motors, is sufficient
[2022-03-03T18:18:45] Unknown: Better than this junk
[2022-03-03T18:18:46] Unknown: <photos/photo_2820@03-03-2022_18-18-46.jpg>
[2022-03-03T18:19:48] Unknown: I hard wire the Higo direct to inside of the motor. And it fits in stock axle hole... Support for temp sensor in same wire is a big plus as well
[2022-03-03T18:20:08] Unknown: Re-wire the phases, halls and add the temp sensor...

[2022-03-03T18:26:21] Happy Giraffe: XT150 is great haha, overkill for most setups except French and Italians
[2022-03-03T18:26:52] Unknown: Thanks anyways Vsett. I appreciate the effort but I use my own wires 🤣
[2022-03-03T18:31:03] Mirono escooters: Xt90 is more then enough
[2022-03-03T18:31:09] sombre_enfant: On xiaomi ptdrr aproved
[2022-03-03T18:31:21] Unknown: Xt90 not good for high voltage
[2022-03-03T18:31:47] Mirono escooters: 20s?
[2022-03-03T18:31:50] Unknown: I use as150 for my 20s battery. Xt90 probably would have handled the amps but they don't like high voltage
[2022-03-03T18:31:51] Mirono escooters: Yes ofcourse

[2022-03-03T18:32:46] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣 isn’t it easier to just solder wires together ?
[2022-03-03T18:32:59] sombre_enfant: 1.4 controller 🤨😐😕

[2022-03-03T18:35:23] Mirono escooters: Ssht
[2022-03-03T18:35:29] sombre_enfant: Wu approved dont worry
[2022-03-03T18:35:37] Mirono escooters: It was proof of concept on ded controller
[2022-03-03T18:45:02] Happy Giraffe: So it goes fast and then burns?

[2022-03-03T19:05:11] sombre_enfant: Hmm need shigura and its Sucé+
[2022-03-03T19:08:02] Artem Bulashev: You got holes in your tire 😄
[2022-03-03T19:09:19] Paolo ⁭: I think it's to see the life of the tires
[2022-03-03T19:09:27] Paolo ⁭: I’m not too expert of tires hahaha
[2022-03-03T19:09:50] Unknown: That makes sense since there is tread to keep track of wear
[2022-03-03T19:10:16] Paolo ⁭: slick tires have no tread so I think it's only way
[2022-03-03T19:10:20] Happy Giraffe: Life is over when tire explodes at 100kmh
[2022-03-03T19:10:27] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-03T19:10:44] Paolo ⁭: That tires got also over 120kmh xd
[2022-03-03T19:11:57] Artem Bulashev: True actually, tires need to be made to withstand specific speed
[2022-03-03T19:12:15] Artem Bulashev: I think any can do 60kmh
[2022-03-03T19:12:26] Mirono escooters: Xuancheng 🌚
[2022-03-03T19:12:39] Artem Bulashev: But 100kmh is exponentially higher centrifugal forces
[2022-03-03T19:13:54] Paolo ⁭: Buy dualtron city and fit Michelin tires xd
[2022-03-03T19:14:42] Happy Giraffe: Child stroller tire🌚

[2022-03-03T19:47:18] rosheee: XD the wire were fuked
[2022-03-03T19:51:56] rosheee: It was the brake hose
[2022-03-03T19:52:04] rosheee: Now got new one

[2022-03-03T20:06:56] Unknown: That's the CST tubeless I threw on there today... My front PMT had a wobble so was wondering if it was the rim or the tire 🤣
[2022-03-03T20:07:14] Unknown: One sec man.. I'll measure
[2022-03-03T20:08:43] Unknown: CST has a very wide side wall opening, so when put on Vsett rim, it turns into an egg shape, doesn't stay flat since it's being squeezed. My tires are PMT 10x3, this was just a test tire lol. Actually the CST tires on Vsett rims ride really nice.. but they do look akward as hell

[2022-03-03T20:19:46] sombre_enfant: I hate that, wonder how they do it tho
[2022-03-03T20:22:24] Unknown: I cut it off lol. No idea what stuff is but it will not melt
[2022-03-03T20:22:48] Unknown: Nice n clean
[2022-03-03T20:22:48] Unknown: <photos/photo_2835@03-03-2022_20-22-48.jpg>
[2022-03-03T20:24:37] Unknown: On my other motor there was actually 2 copper phase wire strands (on one of the phase wires) that were not connected at that "blob".. they were probably still making contact due to the heatshrink holding everything together but still. When I resolder my new wires, I use more solder than that to make sure all the strands are connected
[2022-03-03T20:26:48] Unknown: I only cut a tiny tiny bit of the actual phase wire off when removing that blob, so no I'll effects on the phases
[2022-03-03T20:26:48] Unknown: <photos/photo_2837@03-03-2022_20-26-48.jpg>
[2022-03-03T20:27:58] Unknown: But yea, that shit will never ever melt with a solder iron. Maybe it's kryptonite mixed with Stark adamantium
[2022-03-03T20:37:05] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_2838@03-03-2022_20-37-05.jpg>
[2022-03-03T20:37:13] Paolo ⁭: You need measure with that part
[2022-03-03T20:37:51] Unknown: It's the same on these calipers... But I will just for you 😉. Just the picture looks off
[2022-03-03T20:39:05] Unknown: 7.5... same
[2022-03-03T20:39:58] Paolo ⁭: This is only a suggestion for use caliper😂
[2022-03-03T20:45:47] sombre_enfant: Bro is the mitutoyo conqueror
[2022-03-03T20:48:50] Oliver Eliasson: @artBula will this fit vsett 9 motors?
[2022-03-03T20:49:32] Artem Bulashev: Don’t remember the opening size
[2022-03-03T20:49:34] Artem Bulashev: Wait
[2022-03-03T20:50:36] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2840@03-03-2022_20-50-36.jpg>
[2022-03-03T20:51:16] Artem Bulashev: I think 7.5 would fit
[2022-03-03T20:51:22] Artem Bulashev: Without metal shield for sure
[2022-03-03T20:51:48] Artem Bulashev: Opening is 8mm I think
[2022-03-03T20:52:01] Artem Bulashev: Abit more may be
[2022-03-03T20:54:50] Unknown: 👍👍
[2022-03-03T20:56:23] Unknown: I'm just messing with you.. if someone doesn't know how to use a caliper, they should be smacked very hard in the head 🤣... Pretty self explanatory. I use the narrow tip part for measuring smaller things, I didn't want the thin points to pinch the cable and give an inaccurate reading 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-03-03T20:57:42] Unknown: It's actually fun ripping all the wires out of a motor lol. Just don't cut new wires too short 😜
[2022-03-03T20:57:43] Unknown: <photos/photo_2842@03-03-2022_20-57-43.jpg>
[2022-03-03T21:01:10] Unknown: @artbula this is the male end on controller side. For phases I put xt150 bullets and then soldered in a 6 pin Higo/julet to the L1019 signal wires. Then matching 6 pin Higo/julet out from controller.

[2022-03-03T21:01:55] Artem Bulashev: You are correct actually and the way you used it correct
[2022-03-03T21:02:39] Artem Bulashev: You used thick section on softer materials like wire isolation to get more accurate measurement without pinching as you said
[2022-03-03T21:02:56] Unknown: Exactly 😉
[2022-03-03T21:03:18] Unknown: If you go this wiring route you'll want to make a diagram since the wire colors can get a little confusing
[2022-03-03T21:04:55] Unknown: Since L1019 and Higo 6 pin have different color wires that need to mate to eachother... I tried keeping mine as consistent as possible... Yellow to brown, blue to orange and red to violet. All places have the same color scheme when they don't match exactly
[2022-03-03T21:05:42] Unknown: L1019 has all matching colors to hall board and phases on the motor side 👍
[2022-03-03T21:06:32] Unknown: And then you can use white or grey for temp sensor. There will be 1 wire unused. I eliminated the grey since my controllers use white temp sensor wire color
[2022-03-03T21:06:39] Paolo ⁭: Gg
[2022-03-03T21:06:50] Paolo ⁭: Sucé approved
[2022-03-03T21:07:12] Unknown: Okay okay... Easy there buddy boy 😝
[2022-03-03T21:07:26] Unknown: You're not using the tip either 😉
[2022-03-03T21:08:02] Unknown: Just kidding... I definitely would not use this L1019 connector on a 60-70mm magnet motor... No way.
[2022-03-03T21:08:28] Unknown: My 50mm 1400w motor... Totally fine
[2022-03-03T21:09:43] Paolo ⁭: That connector is used major for 500w motor
[2022-03-03T21:09:46] Unknown: After a hard ride connectors aren't even warm, cool to the touch... Plus they're on the outside so air cooled LoL. Plus they're 1awg larger than stock and connector is approved for 20s
[2022-03-03T21:09:49] Unknown: No
[2022-03-03T21:10:04] Unknown: Grin Tech uses them for basically all of their ebike motors
[2022-03-03T21:10:10] Unknown: 1500w-2000w
[2022-03-03T21:10:20] Unknown: I think even 3000w
[2022-03-03T21:11:31] Unknown: I've done tons of research on this connector before I decided to use it. Zero bottleneck on Vsett motors
[2022-03-03T21:13:59] Unknown: Larger phase wires on Vsett motor wouldn't gain you anything. Very low phase resistance on motor set-up, cool connectors after hard ride, larger than stock... Grin Tech phase runner controllers use this connector to match with their motors up to at least 2000w
[2022-03-03T21:14:17] Artem Bulashev: That was very surprising to me. Still not sure how they can survive it. Careful with new battery settings it can change
[2022-03-03T21:15:36] Unknown: For sure. Will keep a close eye on them. Confident they'll be just fine. If not, I'll rip them back apart and re-wire with something larger
[2022-03-03T21:15:42] Artem Bulashev: My phase wires may get warm btw with new Ferrofluid setting in summer so will be upgrading I guess
[2022-03-03T21:16:30] Unknown: You have stock Vsett 9 phase wires?
[2022-03-03T21:16:55] Unknown: I wonder what size each phase wire is on 650w motor
[2022-03-03T21:22:27] Paolo ⁭: How much mm plug
[2022-03-03T21:23:17] Oliver Eliasson: Do you think the connector Adam uses will work for vsett 9 motor with ferrofluid and 35a?
[2022-03-03T21:30:12] rosheee: 35A xD?
[2022-03-03T21:31:27] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-03T21:33:14] Artem Bulashev: I guess those are made to be fitted for scooters up to 130a phase and 35a battery if they are standard for 2000w scooters they can handle adams current set up which is higher than 30a battery and 100a by a lot Adam what phase and battery limit settings you have with them being barely warm?
[2022-03-03T21:34:00] Paolo ⁭: Blade motor can handle 70A battery current at 18s xd
[2022-03-03T21:34:18] rosheee: vsett so far 71A battery 16S
[2022-03-03T21:34:25] rosheee: and 250A phase so far
[2022-03-03T21:34:42] rosheee: <sticker>

[2022-03-03T21:36:08] Artem Bulashev: In phase amps and battery amps on front and rear ?
[2022-03-03T21:36:17] rosheee: send u later
[2022-03-03T21:36:21] Artem Bulashev: Ok thanks
[2022-03-03T21:36:23] rosheee: maybe it is together 250 xD
[2022-03-03T21:36:25] Artem Bulashev: Very interesting
[2022-03-03T21:36:31] Artem Bulashev: That’s likely
[2022-03-03T21:36:39] Artem Bulashev: Is motor warm?
[2022-03-03T21:36:41] rosheee: no
[2022-03-03T21:36:41] Artem Bulashev: Hot?
[2022-03-03T21:36:45] rosheee: 35 degrees
[2022-03-03T21:36:54] Artem Bulashev: Than you have like 125a phase and 35a battery
[2022-03-03T21:36:58] rosheee: but hit 10.2kw
[2022-03-03T21:36:59] rosheee: no XD
[2022-03-03T21:37:00] Artem Bulashev: No wonder
[2022-03-03T21:37:00] rosheee: LOL
[2022-03-03T21:37:02] rosheee: 2x 71A
[2022-03-03T21:37:09] Artem Bulashev: No :))
[2022-03-03T21:37:09] rosheee: 150A together
[2022-03-03T21:37:11] Paolo ⁭: Cover temp
[2022-03-03T21:37:14] rosheee: DUDE YES IT IS
[2022-03-03T21:37:17] Paolo ⁭: Impossible stator temp
[2022-03-03T21:37:24] rosheee: cover
[2022-03-03T21:37:32] Paolo ⁭: Now is right
[2022-03-03T21:37:41] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-03-03T21:37:43] Artem Bulashev: That’s together
[2022-03-03T21:37:43] Paolo ⁭: Because at such current it’s impossible 35degrees hahaha
[2022-03-03T21:37:47] rosheee: i yes
[2022-03-03T21:37:54] rosheee: and 150A battery together
[2022-03-03T21:38:07] Artem Bulashev: Buttery sure
[2022-03-03T21:38:15] Artem Bulashev: Battery current doesn’t effect much
[2022-03-03T21:38:25] Artem Bulashev: Phase current heats motor mainly
[2022-03-03T21:38:27] rosheee: with 60A bms it does and 50A cont.
[2022-03-03T21:38:30] Artem Bulashev: And 125 is low
[2022-03-03T21:38:31] sombre_enfant: Check your bt controller
[2022-03-03T21:38:38] rosheee: ?
[2022-03-03T21:38:48] sombre_enfant: I mean bms mbd
[2022-03-03T21:38:49] Unknown: So far had a quick 15-20min ride on 20s... 55a battery per motor (110a batt total) and 110 phase on front and 136 phase on rear.
[2022-03-03T21:39:00] Paolo ⁭: In normal ride battery current effect more
[2022-03-03T21:39:07] Artem Bulashev: You have 60a BMS and you say you hit 150a battery? 😄😄
[2022-03-03T21:39:18] Paolo ⁭: When you’re full speed you have a one continuos current
[2022-03-03T21:39:19] Artem Bulashev: In high speed ride
[2022-03-03T21:39:22] Unknown: Front and rear. Speed mode 3

[2022-03-03T21:39:45] Paolo ⁭: Only 130A?😢
[2022-03-03T21:39:53] Mirono escooters: Only..
[2022-03-03T21:40:00] Paolo ⁭: Set least 200A you have 12F brooo
[2022-03-03T21:40:01] Unknown: But.... 20s battery was at storage 3.6v per cell.. was a quick test ride
[2022-03-03T21:40:12] Paolo ⁭: You goes 150A with micro mosfet lol
[2022-03-03T21:40:15] Unknown: I will once I charge the battery and can actually ride!! Lol
[2022-03-03T21:40:28] rosheee: yers
[2022-03-03T21:40:40] Unknown: Roads are wet with snow and salt/sand. Winter time here
[2022-03-03T21:40:43] rosheee: i send so many vesc stuff here
[2022-03-03T21:40:55] rosheee: .csv's..
[2022-03-03T21:41:04] Artem Bulashev: Man
[2022-03-03T21:41:07] Stan: Add 2 tyres and you won’t slip 😂
[2022-03-03T21:41:07] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-03T21:41:19] sombre_enfant: Trust bro
[2022-03-03T21:41:22] Artem Bulashev: You can’t push 10kw into motor on its original voltage
[2022-03-03T21:41:30] rosheee: i push 10kw together
[2022-03-03T21:41:31] Artem Bulashev: With 35c temp on motor
[2022-03-03T21:41:32] rosheee: so 5kw each
[2022-03-03T21:41:39] rosheee: afte r20min ride motor outside was 35 degrees
[2022-03-03T21:41:44] rosheee: i make pic next time
[2022-03-03T21:41:47] Unknown: Seriously... I'm not about to crash my new setup on salty sandy roads 🤣
[2022-03-03T21:41:50] rosheee: yah wow check teh msofet temps xD
[2022-03-03T21:42:01] Stan: <sticker>
[2022-03-03T21:42:02] Unknown: 🤔🤔
[2022-03-03T21:42:12] Artem Bulashev: 5100w /64v = 80a battery
[2022-03-03T21:42:15] Artem Bulashev: Sure
[2022-03-03T21:42:23] Artem Bulashev: Phase amps is what I’m interested in more
[2022-03-03T21:42:29] rosheee: V1 ?
[2022-03-03T21:42:36] rosheee: v1 current in?
[2022-03-03T21:42:53] Artem Bulashev: What is your setting for phase amps ?
[2022-03-03T21:42:59] rosheee: 170A each
[2022-03-03T21:43:13] Artem Bulashev: You can’t have front 170a phase
[2022-03-03T21:43:20] Artem Bulashev: That is impossible to use
[2022-03-03T21:43:23] rosheee: i set that on vesc
[2022-03-03T21:43:41] sombre_enfant: U got trust issue, let the man live
[2022-03-03T21:43:53] rosheee: <photos/photo_2852@03-03-2022_21-43-53.jpg>
[2022-03-03T21:43:56] rosheee: 😆i jsut say what i set
[2022-03-03T21:44:14] rosheee: vesc A = 135 A motor + 170A max current vesc B same
[2022-03-03T21:45:16] Artem Bulashev: Ohh
[2022-03-03T21:45:17] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2022-03-03T21:45:22] Artem Bulashev: So 170a is absolute?
[2022-03-03T21:45:26] rosheee: yes per vesc
[2022-03-03T21:45:30] Artem Bulashev: Phase current is 135
[2022-03-03T21:45:34] rosheee: yes
[2022-03-03T21:45:35] Artem Bulashev: Finally
[2022-03-03T21:45:37] rosheee: yah xD
[2022-03-03T21:45:41] rosheee: can't set higher
[2022-03-03T21:45:42] rosheee: ffs
[2022-03-03T21:45:49] Artem Bulashev: That’s why motor is 35c
[2022-03-03T21:45:55] rosheee: yah wow XD
[2022-03-03T21:45:57] rosheee: why i need more?
[2022-03-03T21:46:04] rosheee: spinning tires
[2022-03-03T21:46:09] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-03-03T21:46:12] rosheee: 70kmh uphill
[2022-03-03T21:46:17] rosheee: so easypeasy xD
[2022-03-03T21:46:19] Artem Bulashev: That’s why I said you can’t have 170a phase on front
[2022-03-03T21:46:21] Artem Bulashev: ;-)
[2022-03-03T21:46:26] Artem Bulashev: Impossible to control
[2022-03-03T21:46:32] rosheee: true
[2022-03-03T21:46:36] rosheee: even with 135A
[2022-03-03T21:46:37] Artem Bulashev: 135 I can imagine
[2022-03-03T21:46:45] rosheee: at 40kmh u have grip
[2022-03-03T21:46:46] Artem Bulashev: 11 inch or 10 inch?
[2022-03-03T21:46:50] sombre_enfant: But sucé master done it on his weped
[2022-03-03T21:46:53] rosheee: 10inch xD 10x2.5 XD
[2022-03-03T21:47:03] rosheee: shiiiiii
[2022-03-03T21:47:16] Artem Bulashev: Ok yeah 👌👌 now we are all clear 😘
[2022-03-03T21:47:20] Artem Bulashev: 135a 80a
[2022-03-03T21:47:25] Artem Bulashev: Those are sweet
[2022-03-03T21:47:26] rosheee: what 80A?
[2022-03-03T21:47:40] Artem Bulashev: Battery amp limit settings it seems
[2022-03-03T21:47:45] Artem Bulashev: May be abit higher?
[2022-03-03T21:47:52] rosheee: over 80 per channel
[2022-03-03T21:48:04] rosheee: <photos/photo_2853@03-03-2022_21-48-04.jpg>
[2022-03-03T21:48:12] Artem Bulashev: It can go over
[2022-03-03T21:48:15] Artem Bulashev: In log
[2022-03-03T21:48:17] rosheee: <photos/photo_2854@03-03-2022_21-48-17.jpg>
[2022-03-03T21:48:24] Artem Bulashev: But what is your setting in vesc tool?
[2022-03-03T21:48:30] rosheee: 71A max battery
[2022-03-03T21:48:35] rosheee: per channel
[2022-03-03T21:48:41] rosheee: vesc A = 71A vesc b = 71A
[2022-03-03T21:48:45] Artem Bulashev: Ok that’s what I mean
[2022-03-03T21:48:54] Artem Bulashev: So setting is 135a phase and 71a battery
[2022-03-03T21:48:55] rosheee: 175A together peak
[2022-03-03T21:48:57] rosheee: yes
[2022-03-03T21:49:18] Artem Bulashev: But in reality current on battery spikes above it by a lot
[2022-03-03T21:49:51] rosheee: ^^' batttery ..yah the battery
[2022-03-03T21:50:01] rosheee: it gets so hot that it shuts down sometimes
[2022-03-03T21:50:06] rosheee: 3 times so far
[2022-03-03T21:50:13] rosheee: that's why these settings
[2022-03-03T21:50:17] Artem Bulashev: Wow from 71a limit almost to 90a
[2022-03-03T21:50:44] rosheee: mosfet temp is best
[2022-03-03T21:50:48] Artem Bulashev: Ufff be careful, it may end up like this on charger than
[2022-03-03T21:50:51] sombre_enfant: Poor daly bms
[2022-03-03T21:51:17] rosheee: yah that is why 71A + 135A
[2022-03-03T21:51:19] rosheee: <photos/photo_2855@03-03-2022_21-51-19.jpg>
[2022-03-03T21:51:58] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2022-03-03T21:52:17] rosheee: i let it cool down ^^ and outside
[2022-03-03T21:52:25] rosheee: but yah ^^' poor battery
[2022-03-03T21:52:35] rosheee: but still living since over 10k km
[2022-03-03T21:53:12] Artem Bulashev: No no problem is not that, but chemistry. It degradates and IR gets higher and higher. Than one day it may over heat during change and 👌
[2022-03-03T21:53:31] rosheee: shii
[2022-03-03T21:53:45] rosheee: degradATES?
[2022-03-03T21:53:46] Artem Bulashev: ✅ just be carful during charge cycle and check IR once a month if you ride that hard on it
[2022-03-03T21:54:06] Unknown: <photos/photo_2856@03-03-2022_21-54-06.jpg>

[2022-03-03T21:54:13] Artem Bulashev: degradates
[2022-03-03T21:54:20] Artem Bulashev: Become not so good
[2022-03-03T21:54:22] Unknown: I think the extra heat from my vesc melted my tube lol
[2022-03-03T21:54:45] sombre_enfant: I once overcharged a 13s to 60v did it degraded it ?
[2022-03-03T21:54:48] Unknown: Pushing max 130amps phase current to these stock 1000w motors
[2022-03-03T21:54:55] Artem Bulashev: lol
[2022-03-03T21:55:22] Artem Bulashev: 54.6 -> 60v = 60/13= 4.615
[2022-03-03T21:55:25] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-03-03T21:55:29] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-03-03T21:55:34] Artem Bulashev: 4.35 is hot
[2022-03-03T21:55:40] sombre_enfant: It was just a little hot
[2022-03-03T21:55:42] Artem Bulashev: 4.5 danger of explosion
[2022-03-03T21:55:51] Artem Bulashev: For li ion
[2022-03-03T21:55:54] sombre_enfant: Then it get to 55
[2022-03-03T21:56:07] sombre_enfant: In 2-3 buisness day
[2022-03-03T21:56:34] Artem Bulashev: Example
[2022-03-03T21:56:38] Artem Bulashev: Real life
[2022-03-03T21:57:52] Artem Bulashev: Cells charged to 4.05v li ion = 800 cycles 4.20v li ion = 500 cycles 4.35v li ion = 250 cycles Before they loose 20% capacity
[2022-03-03T21:58:05] Artem Bulashev: That’s 35e Samsung
[2022-03-03T21:59:13] Artem Bulashev: So one time 4.61 😄😄 you lucky it didn’t explode, but I think it should still work ok (since it was 1 time) and was not too long (temp didn’t get too high)
[2022-03-03T21:59:23] Happy Giraffe: Sadly outside temp tells nothing about inside
[2022-03-03T22:00:22] sombre_enfant: I didnt used it since that time, didnt Discharged it im kinda scared and lazy to hook it on something
[2022-03-03T22:00:45] Artem Bulashev: This is very nice result for 1400w motor without ferrofluid at 135a 71a Adam you can def go for 150a 70a 😄😄👌
[2022-03-03T22:01:15] Artem Bulashev: Well just use it with 2 sensor temp monitor
[2022-03-03T22:01:58] Artem Bulashev: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mMNlBeM
[2022-03-03T22:04:33] Mirono escooters: Sssht ok fair point
[2022-03-03T22:04:39] Mirono escooters: Got drv errors when doing it
[2022-03-03T22:05:33] Artem Bulashev: Adam some time ago I estimated vsett stock controller to punch phase amps to about equal of 170a phase current. If your Nuks allow, could you try set it to 170a phase and 35a battery rear and something on front (Watch your connectors 🙃) Wonder what settings would be close in feel to stock vsett controller
[2022-03-03T22:31:14] Unknown: So there are a few factors at play here. First and foremost is FOC Sinewave with Nucs and modulated with Vsett stock. So definitely more punch/phase amps on acceleration with identical settings (if we were able to measure exactly.. which we can't lol). I can sort of make up for that difference with Nuc setting "current change speed" to make acceleration feel more like "infineon controller" type and punch harder off the line. I still haven't brought that setting up very high at all.. yet. That setting alone can make a huge difference in "punch". When I was riding last season, I had MTPA on since it was newly implemented in Nucs and nobody really knew it was making non-IPM motors feel sluggish. I've since turned off MTPA and have noticed there is definitely more acceleration. Also, as you know stock is 16s and I'm now 20s, so amps are not apples to apples comparatively.. need to use watts as a closer comparison measure. The other day on my test ride, I was at 72v resting (just a few volts above 16s fully charged) and had 55a batt on each motor with 110F/136R phase and it was without question much more acceleration than stock, leaning back I also wheelied front tire off the ground. Also at around 35mph, it was pulling like stock would at 20mph, so tons of top speed left in the tank, even at the low batt voltage. To be honest, I'm not sure the hell this thing is going to do a fully charged battery at 60a per motor and 120/160 phase... I'm as curious as you lol.
[2022-03-03T22:33:05] Unknown: I'm also using torque mode, throttle controlling phase amps. If I switched to speed mode (infineon type throttle) or even speed+torque mode (like Kelly).. I can affect how power is delivered... So there's that variable as well and I'm currently using the "slowest" throttle mode.. but the smoothest
[2022-03-03T22:33:47] Unknown: I would need a stock Vsett next to me to race to know for sure 😜
[2022-03-03T22:49:19] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣 man fuck me, that is a beast motors and beast frame on a beast controllers 😂😂 I think 120/160a phase and 60a/60a battery will be about as fast as rion from the 0-70 😄😄 Please make sure your speed reading is correct by going 60kmh stable and comparing vesc speed to gps speed your phone will show. Once done please please record your screen (wheel speed sensor data, not gps) 0-max speed that your ass can dare for 😁😁😁
[2022-03-03T22:50:18] Paolo ⁭: Talk in kmh 😂
[2022-03-03T23:10:20] Unknown: Haha, yea man it's going to be a wild ride for sure. Put tons of work into it so hopefully it does everything I'm expecting it to lol. I'll be sure calibrate the wheel circumference (how speed is measured on Nuc) against a gps unit. I know the controller takes screenshots but not sure if it can record the screen.. I can always use a recorder to show the display while riding, maybe duct tape my phone to my forehead 🤣. I haven't logged to sd card yet but I know they have an extensive logging capability. Either way, will show results lol. I'm dying for the weather to break so I can justify charging and finally take a real ride
[2022-03-03T23:11:01] Unknown: If I knew mph to kmh in my head I would lol. My imperial brain is train in such horrible ways haha
[2022-03-03T23:13:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Man, I don't like Rion, but, trust me, it's not with those settings that you'll be able to catch one on 0-70 x)
[2022-03-03T23:23:57] Paolo ⁭: Right, those settings are ridicule confronting with theirs
[2022-03-03T23:24:11] Paolo ⁭: Are crazy current in the fact crazy battery drop voltage
[2022-03-03T23:25:33] Unknown: Do we know what cells rion uses?
[2022-03-03T23:26:43] Paolo ⁭: Molicel p42a
[2022-03-03T23:26:56] Paolo ⁭: 6 to 8P configurations
[2022-03-03T23:28:58] Unknown: So 25ah and 32ah... Lots of amps but not lasting power, range must suck
[2022-03-03T23:30:24] Unknown: Maybe 15-25 km/wh lol... Awesome power for about 5-10 miles then sagging to shit
[2022-03-03T23:30:45] Paolo ⁭: Yes but anyway with that current you cannot got like a rion
[2022-03-03T23:31:01] Unknown: But I will sag much less and ride 4x as long
[2022-03-03T23:31:46] Paolo ⁭: You have more range , but acceleration cannot be faster
[2022-03-03T23:31:49] Unknown: And go pretty close to Rion... I'll have 70mph at least. Probably 80mph with field weakening which is much better on Nuc than vesc
[2022-03-03T23:31:54] Unknown: 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-03-03T23:31:58] Luis Magalhaes: are you thinking of going battle a rion in range ? lolol
[2022-03-03T23:32:10] Luis Magalhaes: thats easy 🤣
[2022-03-03T23:32:19] Paolo ⁭: Rion in range can goes 5/7km max lol
[2022-03-03T23:32:32] Unknown: I'm saying they have awesome power but for very limited range/time. I have tons of lasting power
[2022-03-03T23:32:39] Unknown: 🤣🤣
[2022-03-03T23:32:52] Luis Magalhaes: full speed 🤣
[2022-03-03T23:33:30] Luis Magalhaes: Estimated range: 45-50 miles per charge

[2022-03-03T23:33:50] Luis Magalhaes: thrust
[2022-03-03T23:34:51] Luis Magalhaes: 88.2V (fully charged) lithium battery 30ah / 84V 35ah 21700 moliecell P42 high-capacity cells with Cooper welded plates
[2022-03-03T23:35:03] Unknown: I'll be just happy with the power I have. I'm not trying to compete or beat anyone/thing. But will be very interesting to see what 10+ motors are capable of
[2022-03-03T23:35:48] Luis Magalhaes: always good to know what it can do
[2022-03-03T23:35:50] Unknown: Yes, for money you can buy anything. Mine is custom built by myself
[2022-03-03T23:36:17] Unknown: Anyone can buy a 7k box, open it and say look what I have
[2022-03-03T23:36:44] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-03-03T23:37:10] Luis Magalhaes: in that order of ideas you should make your frame and motors too
[2022-03-03T23:37:21] Luis Magalhaes: some people dont have the skills
[2022-03-03T23:37:23] Unknown: If it's faster, that's great. But all it takes is deep pockets to get that. Not many have done what I've done to their Vsett, so it's one of a kind
[2022-03-03T23:37:34] Luis Magalhaes: and some like doing diy 😁
[2022-03-03T23:37:41] Unknown: Absolutely
[2022-03-03T23:38:02] Luis Magalhaes: its a diferent pleasure to ride a modified one 🤣
[2022-03-03T23:38:05] Luis Magalhaes: i love it
[2022-03-03T23:38:18] Unknown: You're absolutely right man. That was my point exactly
[2022-03-03T23:40:13] Luis Magalhaes: 😁 keep posting your project is very interesting
[2022-03-03T23:40:39] rosheee: lul

[2022-03-04T05:04:44] Unknown: New stator re-wired with temp sensor just like the other 2. Hopefully this new stator fixes the damn wobble in the front. I think the axel may have bent because the rim only feels straight and true but PMT and CST tires have bad wobble on front. If not I have the old "bent" rear magnet side housing that was not anywhere as bad as the front is acting now. Plus the new PMT tires arriving on Monday. Plus a new split rim side. Plus new bearings arriving tomorrow... I'm determined to get this front wobble free like the rear. Between all the parts I have I'm sure I'll be able to find a combo that's wobble free or at least much better than it is now. That pothole did a number on both of my rims apparently. Damn air shocks and big ass pothole. Back to oil springs shocks for this guy

[2022-03-04T10:16:57] Oliver Eliasson: Hey, talked to spintend about some futures that could be added. How many are interested in a PANIC button. If pressed it would reprogram vesc to your legal limit (sweden) of 125w/motor and 20km/h top speed. So if you would get stopped by cops they could not tell. Also not reversible through button, you have to reprogram with phone or computer so that the cops can accidentally activate full power again. This could be done if many are interested in the feature
[2022-03-04T11:01:24] Cass: nice one, thanks for info
[2022-03-04T12:05:50] Artem Bulashev: Adding temp into front motor? You already had it in rear right?
[2022-03-04T12:07:20] Artem Bulashev: Keep in mind that legal limit is different in different countries. Many have no power limit, only speed limit. Many have 500/600w limit. Some have 20kmh some 25kmh - so those need to be configurable
[2022-03-04T12:10:08] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah i messeged them and ask if it would be possible to set those perimeter’s yourself so you can make it fit in your country. Also asked if it would work on diffrent vesc not only ubox

[2022-03-04T16:03:47] D J: I'm thinking of soldering xt150 on the motor wires what do you think?
[2022-03-04T16:05:02] Oliver Eliasson: You checked all sides? Did you find any because i didn’t on my unit
[2022-03-04T16:05:54] Paolo ⁭: Using a bigger connector with little cable is worse and cause heat
[2022-03-04T16:06:27] Paolo ⁭: Buy 4.5mm amass connector and is very sucé
[2022-03-04T16:07:18] D J: I haven't opened it yet. just arrived today but as someone here said it was convenient to open and check. I'm just afraid of losing the warranty soon
[2022-03-04T16:09:17] D J: Ok. thanks for alerting
[2022-03-04T16:09:43] D J: 👌 I will do
[2022-03-04T16:10:18] Artem Bulashev: What ? 😅😅
[2022-03-04T16:11:55] Happy Giraffe: Less resistance in total is better no?🌚
[2022-03-04T16:12:28] Paolo ⁭: If you put 12awg in 8mm connector you will have more heat than 4mm
[2022-03-04T16:13:04] Paolo ⁭: Because wire don’t touch directly all connector, and tin is not a good conductor and make heat
[2022-03-04T16:13:41] Artem Bulashev: Heat equals to resistance of the conducting system
[2022-03-04T16:14:12] Artem Bulashev: It makes sense but you can always flat the wire against connector even if it is 8mm
[2022-03-04T16:15:19] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_2864@04-03-2022_16-15-19.jpg>
[2022-03-04T16:15:22] Artem Bulashev: Chances of having more wire - to connector contact are higher in big connector + it’s lower resistance will offset higher resistance at wire contact
[2022-03-04T16:15:25] Paolo ⁭: Best connector of ever😏
[2022-03-04T16:15:35] Artem Bulashev: Small and works well yeah 🤙

[2022-03-04T16:20:48] Luis Magalhaes: Your controller has bolts?

[2022-03-04T16:25:40] Happy Giraffe: If you solder end of cable in a way that spreads the wire to sides then its actually more surface area

[2022-03-04T16:50:49] Happy Giraffe: So mix match designs coming?
[2022-03-04T16:53:29] Artem Bulashev: Yeah getting vsett clamp and vsett type controllers, minimotors finally decided to catch up
[2022-03-04T16:53:31] Artem Bulashev: lol
[2022-03-04T16:55:34] Paolo ⁭: Vsett type controller?
[2022-03-04T16:58:41] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I suspect it will be same tech
[2022-03-04T16:58:50] Artem Bulashev: Sine wave modulated square wave controller
[2022-03-04T16:59:01] Artem Bulashev: Fake sine wave
[2022-03-04T16:59:49] Artem Bulashev: Best of both worlds, only misses efficiency (more is colder than squarewave, but not as cold as foc / proper sine wave)
[2022-03-04T17:00:07] Artem Bulashev: But regardless, more choices, more competition
[2022-03-04T17:04:26] Oliver Eliasson: @artBula is the vsett 9+ motor the same as 9? 48v vs 52v. Is it just different markings?
[2022-03-04T17:21:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeaaahhhh
[2022-03-04T17:22:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: useless, can't take so much current for long Time
[2022-03-04T17:24:36] D J: which ones are the best in your opinion? the ones that come in spintend?
[2022-03-04T18:49:37] Unknown: Yes temp sensor in both motors, rear and front. Few reasons. Nucular reads both sensors but displays the highest of the 2 temps. If rear sensor fails, I have front as backup until I can fix the rear sensor. Can't use charge mode without a valid temp sensor for safety reasons. Also, if the front motor is running abnormally hot for some odd reason, I will catch it because that higher temp will be displayed and used as reference for low power mode if temp exceeds max setting. So dual sensors as "failsafe" from 1 failing sensor and from front motor overheating due to abnormal something lol
[2022-03-04T18:57:04] Unknown: Timken 2rs bearings arrived. Very very nice quality and MUCH less rolling resistance than the 2rsh SKFs. Zero play at all on the inner race. Vsett bearings do have some play on the inner race. These were not super expensive and quality seems extremely good
[2022-03-04T19:19:08] Happy Giraffe: Isn't it the c4/c3 that says how much play is there?
[2022-03-04T19:26:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: keep xt90s
[2022-03-04T19:26:50] Unknown: the C3 refers to the outer diameter. bearings marked with "C3" have a slightly smaller outer diameter to allow for thermal expansion, without cracking the housing if the bearing gets super hot and expands. Usually for press fit bearings in a very hot application. i use the C3 6202 because that side cover fits tight, so it just makes changing the bearings easier, still plenty tight where it isn't to spin the bearing in the housing. the 6004 size motor cover is pretty loose fit, so using a C3 on that side would be an even looser fit. so for vsett motors I found best to use 6202 2rs C3 and 6004 2rs
[2022-03-04T19:33:11] Unknown: The 2rs/ZZ/2rsh is the type of seals used. There should never be any play on the inner race. When inner race wiggles, that usually a sign of a cheap or used bearing.
[2022-03-04T19:33:25] D J: I was talking about the motors wires...battery I will keep xt90s
[2022-03-04T19:34:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: since spintend output in 12s, I don't see why going to lower AWG.
[2022-03-04T19:35:44] D J: ??
[2022-03-04T19:37:31] D J: I asked because I don't know which plugs are on the motor cables! I didn't mention changing the cables but the plugs
[2022-03-04T19:38:17] Artem Bulashev: Yes they are same
[2022-03-04T19:38:24] Artem Bulashev: You can open and see though
[2022-03-04T19:38:59] Artem Bulashev: May be something changed as vsett update parts often for better designs
[2022-03-04T19:48:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: orignal are 4mm bullets. you can go a little higher to reduce resistance, but it depends how much phase current you want.
[2022-03-04T19:48:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sorry. I misunderstood but XT150 are not usually made for phase wires
[2022-03-04T20:14:04] Paolo ⁭: Right
[2022-03-04T20:25:26] D J: ok thanks my friend
[2022-03-04T20:34:08] Luis Magalhaes: >200A peak is good 😂
[2022-03-04T20:38:21] Artem Bulashev: What’s the difference ? Too much you mean ?
[2022-03-04T20:42:24] Happy Giraffe: So TLDR, C3 is just tiny bit looser to install?
[2022-03-04T20:43:13] Unknown: Exactly

[2022-03-04T20:45:05] Happy Giraffe: Yeah😅 I think I stay with regulars and ask probably some BearEbike guru for custom seals etc. so I never gotta change the bearing😅

[2022-03-06T01:50:19] rosheee: Wtf
[2022-03-06T01:50:44] Unknown: It's so close can't be safe tho
[2022-03-06T01:50:49] rosheee: It is
[2022-03-06T01:50:53] rosheee: More than 5mm
[2022-03-06T01:51:00] Unknown: About a flat tire
[2022-03-06T01:51:06] rosheee: Before i couldnt even fot brakr
[2022-03-06T01:51:13] rosheee: What flat?
[2022-03-06T01:52:16] Unknown: A flat tire wouldn't it catch on the banjo?
[2022-03-06T01:52:41] rosheee: Flat is no option
[2022-03-06T01:52:48] rosheee: If flat i take uber
[2022-03-06T01:52:49] Unknown: Maguras fit on the 10+ like that as well but most guys don't leave it like that because it's just too close
[2022-03-06T01:53:15] Unknown: I mean if you're riding and you get a flat tire it will catch on the banjo because it's so close and you'll rip your brakes apart
[2022-03-06T01:59:45] rosheee: But it is g30
[2022-03-06T01:59:59] rosheee: Omg..i take it inline
[2022-03-06T02:04:07] Unknown: Maybe g30 has more room inside. 10+ has room but it's super close
[2022-03-06T02:04:13] rosheee: No
[2022-03-06T02:04:19] rosheee: Before it didnt fit
[2022-03-06T02:04:33] Unknown: Why is that?
[2022-03-06T02:05:07] Unknown: Magic? LoL
[2022-03-06T02:05:23] rosheee: That is why i did this jagwire crap
[2022-03-06T02:05:30] rosheee: Idk why it fits now
[2022-03-06T02:05:44] rosheee: 1cm space
[2022-03-06T02:06:20] Unknown: Hopefully it doesn't hit while riding That's close man
[2022-03-06T02:06:49] Unknown: The tires do flex, even on the top side while riding
[2022-03-06T02:15:17] rosheee: See when 17S is here
[2022-03-06T02:15:23] rosheee: With mt8 not
[2022-03-06T02:15:56] rosheee: Mt7 is to tight
[2022-03-06T02:17:18] Paolo ⁭: 0.2€
[2022-03-06T02:17:30] rosheee: Not even
[2022-03-06T02:18:00] Paolo ⁭: Adam which value is more fucked?
[2022-03-06T02:18:17] Paolo ⁭: 0.15?
[2022-03-06T02:18:31] Unknown: BMS isn't calibrated until full charge/discharge cycle
[2022-03-06T02:19:00] Unknown: And I'm sure there is some internal resistance differences between the BMS and controllers
[2022-03-06T02:19:34] Unknown: Actually... No...
[2022-03-06T02:20:28] Unknown: BMS display is correct, I checked with multimeter. Nuc voltage is slightly higher, not sure why... Internal capacitors internal resistance... Not sure
[2022-03-06T02:21:38] Unknown: BMS calibrates capacity after first full charge/discharge cycle, not voltage
[2022-03-06T02:21:55] rosheee: +10cm
[2022-03-06T02:23:30] Paolo ⁭: Dick?
[2022-03-06T02:23:41] rosheee: Oh yas
[2022-03-06T02:36:10] Unknown: <animation>
[2022-03-06T05:24:43] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-06T12:13:54] Happy Giraffe: My front tire is like 2mm away from brake hose😂
[2022-03-06T12:15:00] Happy Giraffe: Saddest thing is nobody of the brake caliper manufacturers gives dimension info
[2022-03-06T12:22:58] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-03-06T12:28:00] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2022-03-06T12:34:11] Happy Giraffe: That's a wide tyre😳
[2022-03-06T12:39:06] Paolo ⁭: crooked wheel
[2022-03-06T13:03:19] Unknown: Wheel or rim?
[2022-03-06T13:03:21] sombre_enfant: The wheel aint true but still sucé
[2022-03-06T13:04:01] Unknown: Just had to buy another set of PMTs cuz 1 was wout of whack pretty bad. Luckily wasn't the rim Beast motor and tire tho man holy moly
[2022-03-06T13:04:17] Mirono escooters: Seems like axle?
[2022-03-06T13:04:55] sombre_enfant: If u look closely at low rev its the rim the hub dont seems to moove
[2022-03-06T13:19:50] sombre_enfant: Theres a french shop who sells 10+ rim for 15€ dw
[2022-03-06T13:20:26] Face de Pin Sucé: It wasn't tightened well x)
[2022-03-06T13:20:29] Face de Pin Sucé: now it's better
[2022-03-06T13:21:13] Paolo ⁭: Very sucé
[2022-03-06T13:57:21] Stan: Hi guys im looking for 10x4.5 inch tyres for my friend do you have some recommendations for tyre and inner tube. I usually ride on road about 70% of the time and some off-road around 30% of the time
[2022-03-06T14:04:41] Face de Pin Sucé: 10x4.5 ?
[2022-03-06T14:04:48] Stan: Yes
[2022-03-06T14:05:09] Face de Pin Sucé: do you have a picture ?
[2022-03-06T14:05:52] Stan: One sec let me see, right now it’s tuvot
[2022-03-06T14:10:49] Stan: <photos/photo_2874@06-03-2022_14-10-49.jpg>
[2022-03-06T14:10:49] Stan: <photos/photo_2875@06-03-2022_14-10-49.jpg>
[2022-03-06T14:10:49] Stan: He has this currently and he is wandering if for his riding style there is something better ?
[2022-03-06T14:42:23] Unknown: So apparently being able to tune an ASI BAC controller is like a huge plus 🤣
[2022-03-06T14:42:52] Unknown: Tuned to particular motor BEFORE shipping out by the way. What the hell?
[2022-03-06T14:43:27] Unknown: Who would want a controller that you can't tune or adjust? I don't get it
[2022-03-06T15:01:19] sombre_enfant: Pirate Motor cooler 😭😭😭😂
[2022-03-06T15:01:37] Stan: Yes this is actually pirates scooter that my friend bought
[2022-03-06T15:02:13] sombre_enfant: Bruh
[2022-03-06T15:02:25] sombre_enfant: Polish guy are trippin
[2022-03-06T15:02:36] Unknown: I was looking at those pirate coolers for my 10+... Are they any good? Like, do they help at all?
[2022-03-06T15:03:14] Stan: I’ll tell you one thing I was on my xiaomi my friend on this beast and we drained both batteries motors weren’t even warm to the touch I told him to use statorade but he is fine with that
[2022-03-06T15:04:15] Unknown: Wow no way. He said he would design one for 10+ motor but I never heard back from him to give him exact dimensions
[2022-03-06T15:04:25] Unknown: I would really like 2 of them for my 10+
[2022-03-06T15:04:36] Stan: If u want anything let me know I have direct contact with him
[2022-03-06T15:05:27] Unknown: I would absolutely love love 2 motor coolers for Vsett 10+ motors. Front/rear are identical and can get dimensions of needed. Definitely willing to pay whatever for them plus shipping
[2022-03-06T15:05:32] Unknown: I would really appreciate that
[2022-03-06T15:05:43] Stan: Let me ask
[2022-03-06T15:06:08] Unknown: Awesome bro. Thank you!
[2022-03-06T15:06:44] sombre_enfant: They do nothing actually dont waste your money
[2022-03-06T15:06:47] Mirono escooters: 3d print them 🥴😅
[2022-03-06T15:07:05] Mirono escooters: Aha nvm we talking about them
[2022-03-06T15:07:17] Mirono escooters: Thé design should work. But he did it dumb
[2022-03-06T15:07:32] Mirono escooters: There is no Gap where air can pass behind thé Fins..
[2022-03-06T15:07:39] Mirono escooters: So air is just trapped..
[2022-03-06T15:07:46] Stan: Why you say that out of curiosity he’s apparently a engineer if I’m not mistaken
[2022-03-06T15:07:51] Mirono escooters: So use a washer between thé Fins and ur fine
[2022-03-06T15:08:03] Mirono escooters: Even engineers make mistake
[2022-03-06T15:08:29] Unknown: I don't have a 3d printer or I would create and print myself
[2022-03-06T15:08:31] Mirono escooters: If u know how Fins work/ studied climato thing it isnt done smart
[2022-03-06T15:08:39] Mirono escooters: Find someone locally . It isn't much work to print
[2022-03-06T15:09:14] Stan: Pirate is cheap he gives a lot to the community
[2022-03-06T15:09:50] Unknown: I have no idea what to tell them to print tho lol. I don't have any design.
[2022-03-06T15:10:19] sombre_enfant: U need to design it right first, print it is never a prob
[2022-03-06T15:11:19] Mirono escooters: Thingiverse
[2022-03-06T15:11:24] Unknown: What design program to use? I really don't know much about 3d printing at all. Honestly wouldn't know where to start unless I started researching that rabbit hole haha
[2022-03-06T15:11:27] Mirono escooters: Im too lazy
[2022-03-06T15:11:34] Mirono escooters: Just use 6 washers
[2022-03-06T15:11:45] Mirono escooters: Tinkercad is ez
[2022-03-06T15:12:34] Unknown: Ok cool. Thanks. I know thingsverse, I'll take a look there and check out tinkercad
[2022-03-06T15:14:00] Stan: Any ideas ?
[2022-03-06T15:15:27] Happy Giraffe: Lmaooooo
[2022-03-06T15:15:45] Paolo ⁭: Shinko of weped
[2022-03-06T15:15:58] Stan: Ok thanks Paolo
[2022-03-06T15:16:46] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-06T15:17:32] sombre_enfant: Just dont
[2022-03-06T15:17:58] Unknown: Don't what?
[2022-03-06T15:18:30] sombre_enfant: Print that shi
[2022-03-06T15:19:51] Happy Giraffe: Dont help
[2022-03-06T15:20:17] Stan: Anyone tested the numbers to say they don’t work I’m actually curious what difference it makes
[2022-03-06T15:21:08] sombre_enfant: You have it check by yourself u will see it does nothing
[2022-03-06T15:21:17] Happy Giraffe: No accurate tests possible with those and pirate refused to try
[2022-03-06T15:21:39] Happy Giraffe: Also design is retarded
[2022-03-06T15:22:55] Stan: My mate tried it with and with out on the front motor and he said the motor shell to the touch is much cooler
[2022-03-06T15:23:49] Stan: But it’s very likely the design is not efficient
[2022-03-06T15:24:19] sombre_enfant: He created a problem and sold a solution
[2022-03-06T15:25:59] Happy Giraffe: Also the side cover temperature tells nothing about whats going inside sadly
[2022-03-06T15:26:33] Artem Bulashev: Yeah exactly I had the same thoughts it has to be with the air fins so the air should be able to pass through otherwise it is gonna give high resistance and less efficient result
[2022-03-06T15:26:34] Paolo ⁭: Sad true
[2022-03-06T15:26:35] Happy Giraffe: AB testing cant be done after waiting 10 minutes, would need to cool motor down to complete ambient temperature first
[2022-03-06T15:26:51] Mirono escooters: He did make a YouTube video and measured but it was innacurate
[2022-03-06T15:27:03] Mirono escooters: Thanks for confirm so im not stupid
[2022-03-06T15:27:03] Artem Bulashev: I guess it also can work as a heat capacity Radiator
[2022-03-06T15:27:07] sombre_enfant: Oil help way much, and 60mm motor with chinese 45A controller shouldnt heat alot
[2022-03-06T15:27:12] Mirono escooters: It's just a bit of pma
[2022-03-06T15:27:13] Mirono escooters: Pla
[2022-03-06T15:27:22] Unknown: Using ferrofluid, we would want to cool the outside of the hub just on the opposite side of the magnets.
[2022-03-06T15:27:36] Paolo ⁭: What?
[2022-03-06T15:27:37] Unknown: Having some sort of radial heatsink there would be ideal
[2022-03-06T15:27:43] Mirono escooters: Just use ferrofluid and u can push 2400w xd. (Idk why but u *can*
[2022-03-06T15:27:50] Artem Bulashev: Sure, but it acts like a fence on the radiator instead of a flat surface of the sidewall
[2022-03-06T15:27:53] Paolo ⁭: 60mm and dtx controller and stay very cool
[2022-03-06T15:28:06] Artem Bulashev: I don’t think you will need it
[2022-03-06T15:28:10] Artem Bulashev: Not with ferrofluid
[2022-03-06T15:29:10] sombre_enfant: Its on a laotie es19 with the random 45A controller not even JP and 60mm motor it cant heat a lot, and oil is the most efficient way if u need to get less temp
[2022-03-06T15:29:27] Unknown: Something like this but obviously with much larger hole and much smaller fins lol. For the outside of the hub on the non-rotir side
[2022-03-06T15:29:43] Unknown: I don't think so either.. just entertaining some options
[2022-03-06T15:29:58] Stan: Soon will have vesc 💪🏿🙃
[2022-03-06T15:30:35] sombre_enfant: Do it wobble ? What the top speed actually ? Everybody say ti30 is better
[2022-03-06T15:30:59] Happy Giraffe: Sure I can also test Printed first and when inside is 30°c warmer starting delta then try without and its always more warm😂
[2022-03-06T15:31:20] Mirono escooters: He did AWD. And that's innacurate Front gets more air and we can talk about load and blabla
[2022-03-06T15:31:22] Unknown: Then there's this idea lol.
[2022-03-06T15:31:35] Mirono escooters: On e-bike hubs People usually glue fins
[2022-03-06T15:32:00] Unknown: Yup, the grin Tech motor coolers to be used along side statorade for e-bikes
[2022-03-06T15:32:01] Paolo ⁭: JP are ship motor, and if I’m wrong it’s 50mm
[2022-03-06T15:32:02] Happy Giraffe: Pirate is just a guy who talks lot of shit in the end
[2022-03-06T15:32:14] Unknown: I wish they made a set to fit scooter motors
[2022-03-06T15:32:20] Happy Giraffe: Like the Flipsky vesc scooter videos but he never got it working for long time
[2022-03-06T15:32:30] sombre_enfant: But their hub got spoke not direct rim
[2022-03-06T15:32:35] Stan: So my friend was getting but if wobble at 35 before I tightened his bolts not he can’t do 60 when gripping hard to the handle bars he ordered new suspension it will have some work done too most likely and it will be a solid rock but out of the box he got what he paid honestly wobble was real
[2022-03-06T15:32:37] sombre_enfant: No
[2022-03-06T15:32:43] Unknown: Same idea tho
[2022-03-06T15:33:04] Stan: Ti30 better out of the box for sure but performance is a bit worst
[2022-03-06T15:33:12] sombre_enfant: But dont work same way and not efficient that way
[2022-03-06T15:33:35] Unknown: Like these.. for the same place that Vsett 9 motor had his
[2022-03-06T15:33:45] sombre_enfant: Yeah but if it got 100kph possible but cant go 35kph because it will fall....
[2022-03-06T15:33:50] Paolo ⁭: Opened ?
[2022-03-06T15:33:57] Mirono escooters: It's a good design don't get me wrong just with washers so ai can pass under
[2022-03-06T15:34:05] sombre_enfant: Seen pic
[2022-03-06T15:34:13] Mirono escooters: Ill try to see if i can make a thermal render to show
[2022-03-06T15:34:24] Stan: It has washers and long plastic cylinders
[2022-03-06T15:34:42] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_2881@06-03-2022_15-34-42.jpg>
[2022-03-06T15:34:43] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_2882@06-03-2022_15-34-43.jpg>
[2022-03-06T15:34:45] Happy Giraffe: Those small holes just block everything sadly
[2022-03-06T15:34:46] Unknown: Something like this
[2022-03-06T15:34:47] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-03-06T15:35:02] Stan: Ti30 no problem es19 needs mods to be stable
[2022-03-06T15:35:21] Paolo ⁭: If you have 3d file I can ask for producing with alluminium
[2022-03-06T15:35:35] Unknown: I see what your saying.. so the air can flow behind/under the color, not just around it
[2022-03-06T15:35:43] Stan: Same I can do that too if u wish 😉
[2022-03-06T15:35:48] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-03-06T15:36:15] Mirono escooters: Or this is also a option..
[2022-03-06T15:36:17] Mirono escooters: 🥴🥴
[2022-03-06T15:36:20] Paolo ⁭: It’s easy for design, but I continue seem useless🤷‍♂️
[2022-03-06T15:36:22] Unknown: Let me see if I can get dimensions. Pirate sent me a blank template to fill in my dimensions I just have to look back and find it
[2022-03-06T15:36:33] Unknown: For real? Hmm 🤔
[2022-03-06T15:36:47] Unknown: I feel like it would help but that's just a feeling lol
[2022-03-06T15:37:02] sombre_enfant: Do it look alike 50mm??? Also dont look like es19one
[2022-03-06T15:37:20] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_2885@06-03-2022_15-37-20.jpg>
[2022-03-06T15:37:36] Stan: What scooter was this one ?
[2022-03-06T15:37:41] Unknown: <animation>
[2022-03-06T15:37:44] sombre_enfant: U tried the ti30 too to compare if it got no wobble and 80kph its a real deal
[2022-03-06T15:38:21] Paolo ⁭: Laotie , I don’t know exactly model
[2022-03-06T15:38:50] sombre_enfant: On es18 it was hm 2800w so 60mm aint no way they put 50mm for a bigger scoot, the lite model are on 45mm same one i had on my max
[2022-03-06T15:39:20] Stan: I have few buddy’s who have they modded there ti30 a bit because they didn’t feel comfortable at 80+ they felt a bit unstable hence the need for modds
[2022-03-06T15:39:50] Stan: Es19 main issue for wobble is the front swing arm design with the bouncy mf shocks
[2022-03-06T15:41:00] Paolo ⁭: That one identical to boyueda
[2022-03-06T15:41:08] Stan: Ti30
[2022-03-06T15:41:13] Unknown: Hmm.. 10x4.5 tire indeed. Is this thing fast? Good quality?
[2022-03-06T15:41:47] Unknown: The stem looks weak 🤦🏻
[2022-03-06T15:41:50] Stan: Well battery is pretty amazing for the price motors are beast and I explained the suspension issue above
[2022-03-06T15:41:59] Stan: It needs to be reinforced
[2022-03-06T15:42:01] Unknown: Gotcha gotcha
[2022-03-06T15:42:20] Mirono escooters: Laotie is sick
[2022-03-06T15:42:40] Mirono escooters: Ti30 is my facorite
[2022-03-06T15:42:45] Unknown: 21700 38ah... Do we know what cells used?
[2022-03-06T15:42:59] Paolo ⁭: Revived Tesla cells
[2022-03-06T15:43:04] Stan: Yes TI30 is the best out of the box laotie scooter
[2022-03-06T15:43:11] Stan: Really ? 😳 can’t tell if ur joking
[2022-03-06T15:43:25] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2022-03-06T15:43:32] Unknown: Oh not bad.. ti30 looks beast but also quite bulky and boxy
[2022-03-06T15:43:47] Paolo ⁭: Yep, China have gigafactory for recycle Tesla cells, it’s the same used in monorim pack
[2022-03-06T15:44:16] Stan: I herd ti30 main issue is creeping near folding area otherwise yh beast for the buck
[2022-03-06T15:44:34] Unknown: I have a buddy who built 20s battery for Vsett using Tesla model 3 cells. Are they any good? Is it an issue that they're used and recycled?
[2022-03-06T15:45:08] Mirono escooters: They work fine
[2022-03-06T15:45:15] Unknown: Wow.. that's a pretty minor complaint. Sounds very powerful no doubt. Plus 38ah battery out of the box is up there
[2022-03-06T15:45:16] Paolo ⁭: All Tesla cells you see in market are revived, that factory will remove old top and bottom plate and weld a new one
[2022-03-06T15:45:21] Mirono escooters: I tested many and all had promised ah and thé A draw was fine
[2022-03-06T15:45:29] Happy Giraffe: Most useless shit ever😂
[2022-03-06T15:45:41] Paolo ⁭: But they have various grade, based in remaining capacity and IR
[2022-03-06T15:45:58] Stan: U add 250 bucks with vesc controllers and u have a literal beast
[2022-03-06T15:46:22] Mirono escooters: Yea bang for buck
[2022-03-06T15:46:39] Stan: Capacity is really that’s size it has been measured numerous times
[2022-03-06T15:46:41] Mirono escooters: Modded Xiaomi still better cant convince me otherwise
[2022-03-06T15:46:43] Unknown: Awesome. Good to know for the future 👍. Probably will only ever use new Samsung or LG for anything I build but good info. Tesla cells made at Panasonic factory correct?
[2022-03-06T15:46:54] Mirono escooters: Panasonic yep
[2022-03-06T15:47:00] Unknown: 👍
[2022-03-06T15:47:13] Mirono escooters: I mostly use 50e anyways. Not worth thé hassle of testing but it was a Fun try
[2022-03-06T15:47:25] Unknown: That front end is just monsterous looking on ti30. Never rode a scoot with fork shocks
[2022-03-06T15:47:28] Stan: Why not 40t?
[2022-03-06T15:47:36] Mirono escooters: Lower capacity
[2022-03-06T15:47:40] Mirono escooters: And expensiver
[2022-03-06T15:47:41] Paolo ⁭: Tested with what?
[2022-03-06T15:47:50] Mirono escooters: Battery Discharger
[2022-03-06T15:47:59] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-03-06T15:47:59] Unknown: 👍. Very nice. The Samsung 48X I used are still to be tested, damn winter time here
[2022-03-06T15:48:03] Mirono escooters: From torch (brand) modded
[2022-03-06T15:48:34] Stan: I personally think front forks on a scooter is the best on the market combined with dual rear shock swing arm best combo in my opinion hence why the biggest vsett and wolf warrior gt are my favorite
[2022-03-06T15:49:45] Unknown: Can't get more even than this. This was after a short 30 min charge at 7a and short 15 min ride. Discharging extremely evenly. Sag is yet to be seen since was only a test ride at storage voltage
[2022-03-06T15:50:10] Unknown: Gotcha gotcha. Are the fork shocks usually adjustable?
[2022-03-06T15:50:39] Unknown: Or do they really not need to be adjusted?
[2022-03-06T15:50:49] Stan: My friend bought a Nami similarly with the ES19 he was getting wobble at 55kmph on such a expensive scooter set up wasn’t ideal but still for the price that’s crazy
[2022-03-06T15:51:27] Unknown: Yea huh. Even with the damper?
[2022-03-06T15:51:59] Unknown: Damper on my Vsett makes it extremely stable and safe feeling at speeds
[2022-03-06T15:51:59] Happy Giraffe: Actually really cheap at nkon, and for the capacity it might be exactly same real world mileage
[2022-03-06T15:52:06] Stan: He didn’t have one but he said he will buy one I’ll ask him how it is later with it
[2022-03-06T15:52:37] Happy Giraffe: 65kmh and no wobble in xiaomi, something really fucked with the nami
[2022-03-06T15:52:46] Stan: Not I don’t think they are adjustable
[2022-03-06T15:52:54] Unknown: They can make a huge difference. I'm a big fan of steering damper on any scoot that can go over 40mph (I don't know equivalent KMH 🤦🏻)
[2022-03-06T15:53:10] Unknown: Yea, probably don't need to be
[2022-03-06T15:53:24] Stan: Well es19 has dampener my friend cranked it up to max and still wobbled 😂
[2022-03-06T15:53:34] sombre_enfant: X1, 6
[2022-03-06T15:53:55] Happy Giraffe: Time to check that tires are not egg shaped and all steering is aligned
[2022-03-06T15:54:00] Unknown: That's a little bit concerning. If damper was off it would be easier to troubleshoot why it's wobbly
[2022-03-06T15:54:31] Stan: Yh it’s main issue are the crazy rebound on the suspensions and the week stem
[2022-03-06T16:55:25] Artem Bulashev: Lol, I don’t think it will over heat even with 155a phase and 65a battery
[2022-03-06T17:26:18] Unknown: That's the goal my man. I guess I just need to test it out once the weather breaks. Now that most of the work is done, I'm bored so I'm dreaming up other things to do to it haha
[2022-03-06T18:50:24] Stan: What is the best 16s single and/or dual vesc on the market?
[2022-03-06T18:50:42] Mirono escooters: Im flipsky gang but..
[2022-03-06T18:50:52] Mirono escooters: Single id go flipsky 75100
[2022-03-06T18:51:41] Stan: Interesting ok and dual ?
[2022-03-06T18:52:17] Mirono escooters: 2 75100 🤭😅
[2022-03-06T18:52:24] Mirono escooters: Nah then problably ubox
[2022-03-06T18:52:34] Stan: Yh alright 😂
[2022-03-06T18:53:34] Unknown: My bet would be on uBox.
[2022-03-06T18:54:25] Stan: Yeah I thought too maybe there is some secret brand Paolo knows that’s better ?
[2022-03-06T18:54:52] Mirono escooters: Always thé most expensive for him
[2022-03-06T18:54:59] Mirono escooters: Or Hes Kelly gang no
[2022-03-06T18:55:00] Mirono escooters: W
[2022-03-06T18:59:51] Unknown: Kelly and sabvoton seem very promising but they're typically on the larger side and no dual, 2 separate units needed for dual motor. Space can become a problem quickly. uBox dual is quite compact for the punch it gives
[2022-03-06T19:00:14] Stan: Awesome thanks
[2022-03-06T19:11:21] rosheee: They c Gabe me xD 4piston are 2-3mm longer
[2022-03-06T19:11:56] rosheee: Bicycle manuf. Are kinda retard..idk
[2022-03-06T19:12:12] rosheee: U ask for.dimensions..u directly ask..u.dont get it
[2022-03-06T19:12:20] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-06T19:12:34] rosheee: U ask for m5 or m6 hole...they answer shimano hole, avid hole..asshole
[2022-03-06T19:12:42] rosheee: It isnt m6 it is shimano
[2022-03-06T19:12:53] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-06T19:13:20] rosheee: U want mt7 and mt8 dimensions?
[2022-03-06T19:17:29] Happy Giraffe: I stay with mt5 I think, but share for others
[2022-03-06T19:20:14] rosheee: Ok
[2022-03-06T19:20:48] rosheee: Mt8 fits with 10x3.0 rear at g30 lol Mt7 doesnt xD maybe bend.monorim more
[2022-03-06T19:21:18] Happy Giraffe: New types of motors for bike thru axles, they dont stress dropouts anymore🌚
[2022-03-06T19:21:33] Happy Giraffe: Only issue is this shit is 1000-2000w only🙈
[2022-03-06T19:22:08] Happy Giraffe: 40mm magnet max...
[2022-03-06T19:25:21] Unknown: Yup that's like the design on that grin Tech motor link I sent a while back. I forget the name exactly but takes the stress off dropouts.
[2022-03-06T19:28:46] Happy Giraffe: Grin motor was done for front
[2022-03-06T19:29:10] Happy Giraffe: I emailed them asking for 2000-3000w option for rear wheel. Let's see. Some of the motors use 20mm magnets which are ultra gay
[2022-03-06T19:40:28] Unknown: LoL. Yes that would be an absolute waste of time and money
[2022-03-06T19:44:11] Happy Giraffe: I rather weld blade motor into alu rim😂

[2022-03-07T16:23:48] Mirono escooters: Why do they look so Tiny?
[2022-03-07T16:23:58] rosheee: because 4 piston
[2022-03-07T16:43:56] Happy Giraffe: One pad for each piston, there's also the combined longer one but its worse
[2022-03-07T16:46:20] Mirono escooters: Logical. Thanks

[2022-03-07T16:56:15] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2022-03-07T16:56:38] Happy Giraffe: Stock mt5 pad is one double wide pad
[2022-03-07T16:56:50] rosheee: ah ^^' never had that
[2022-03-07T16:57:13] Happy Giraffe: It's much worse, idk why they even put it there in the first place
[2022-03-07T16:57:48] rosheee: do a fast bleed before add them
[2022-03-07T16:58:13] Happy Giraffe: Why?😳
[2022-03-07T16:58:33] rosheee: fast bleed = only on brake lever
[2022-03-07T16:58:34] Happy Giraffe: Haven't needed that before, just pushing pads back and done
[2022-03-07T16:58:40] rosheee: or do that
[2022-03-07T16:58:51] rosheee: ^^' i generated 2much heat then
[2022-03-07T21:29:24] rosheee: AND?
[2022-03-07T22:57:24] Happy Giraffe: Now going to swap them

[2022-03-07T23:23:32] Happy Giraffe: Not even using it, mostly ebrake
[2022-03-07T23:26:10] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-03-07T23:36:36] Happy Giraffe: Now I brake new pads in, some freewheel 70kmh stops. Disc comes hot af😂
[2022-03-08T00:01:01] Happy Giraffe: Even single piston mechanical now locks rear wheel🌚
[2022-03-08T00:08:53] Unknown: Artem made a good point not too long ago, that I never would have thought of. Using aggressive pads heat your rotors more. Sintered metal semi-metallic much more than say ceramic or organic. Rotors are directly connected to the motor hub. Blazing hot rotors can raise motor temps 🤔. Interesting concept but true when you think about it
[2022-03-08T00:10:52] Paolo ⁭: Ive compared in downhill my disc with wolf disc . Wolf was black and super hot, mine no black and still can touch
[2022-03-08T00:22:35] Happy Giraffe: The thermal transfer from small contact area with uneven metal surfaces is minimal
[2022-03-08T00:22:55] Happy Giraffe: Disc can be 200c and the motor cover maybe heats +3c
[2022-03-08T00:26:31] Martin Kaktits: Here is what I dont understand: agressive pads heat up the disc more? But why - its all about transfering kinetic energy of the vehicle into heat (into brake pads and rotor), so the only way the rotor can get hotter is if there is more energy pumped into them. Or same energy, but quicker, but that also means quicker stopping and thats no longer fair comparison.
[2022-03-08T00:27:14] Paolo ⁭: Add thermal paste between disc and cover😂😂
[2022-03-08T00:27:20] Mirono escooters: When u Brake slower and less aggressive theres more time for heat to go away in radiation and to the air
[2022-03-08T00:27:42] Martin Kaktits: ye, but thats comparing different braking styles, not different pads
[2022-03-08T00:27:50] Mirono escooters: Pads help
[2022-03-08T00:28:01] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-08T00:28:15] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-03-08T00:29:26] Happy Giraffe: Also I think that semi metal pad loses like 10x less material than organic🤔
[2022-03-08T00:29:33] Unknown: Friction
[2022-03-08T00:29:44] Mirono escooters: Ehn? Rlly 😲
[2022-03-08T00:29:54] Martin Kaktits: what a great explenation :D
[2022-03-08T00:29:56] Mirono escooters: My organic went for 500km fine and had half left
[2022-03-08T00:30:06] Mirono escooters: I have better one Science
[2022-03-08T00:30:09] Martin Kaktits: ablative cooling? 🧐
[2022-03-08T00:30:09] Happy Giraffe: Kinetic energy -> friction = stopped scooter
[2022-03-08T00:30:19] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-03-08T00:30:20] Happy Giraffe: 500km is nothing
[2022-03-08T00:30:21] Martin Kaktits: well ofc, I mentioned that
[2022-03-08T00:30:33] Mirono escooters: Cant metal brakes just take up more heat
[2022-03-08T00:30:39] Happy Giraffe: But where lies the difference is interesting
[2022-03-08T00:30:45] Mirono escooters: I Mean. No way organic have same heat capacity
[2022-03-08T00:31:29] Unknown: I believe the transfer of heat from rotor to hub is minimal, just an interesting concept.. I was, oh shit yea, never thought about that. And sometimes we're talked about 500-700F rotors, so even a small amount of heat transfer can make a difference in the internal heat of the motor
[2022-03-08T00:31:31] Happy Giraffe: Organics heated my disc ton aswell
[2022-03-08T00:32:12] Happy Giraffe: So in the end I think its similar as E is still = mc2
[2022-03-08T00:32:20] Happy Giraffe: Just more brutal power (faster stop)
[2022-03-08T00:32:45] Unknown: Just because one pad is heating more and has more friction doesn't make it more powerful (harder bite)
[2022-03-08T00:32:50] Martin Kaktits: whoa whoa, calm down, we not talking about nuclear levels of energy here xD
[2022-03-08T00:32:56] Martin Kaktits: idk what you been driving
[2022-03-08T00:33:04] Unknown: Sounded like you were for a second 😂

[2022-03-08T00:34:17] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-08T00:34:21] Martin Kaktits: I do think that it doesnt really matter what pads you use, just how much kinetic energy and how quickly you stop
[2022-03-08T00:34:29] rosheee: Which one?
[2022-03-08T00:34:32] rosheee: Get the shimano
[2022-03-08T00:34:34] rosheee: Shigura
[2022-03-08T00:34:35] Happy Giraffe: Basic one
[2022-03-08T00:34:39] Happy Giraffe: Mdr
[2022-03-08T00:34:49] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-08T00:34:56] rosheee: Get shimano
[2022-03-08T00:35:09] Happy Giraffe: For ebike I will get thickest 220mm🌚
[2022-03-08T00:35:15] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-08T00:35:29] rosheee: But get shimano
[2022-03-08T00:35:38] rosheee: How long u ride ur thang?
[2022-03-08T00:35:57] Happy Giraffe: You mean how many KM with old pads or disc?
[2022-03-08T00:36:12] rosheee: When u go ebike,?
[2022-03-08T00:36:40] Happy Giraffe: August maybe, the war might slow me down a bit as I planned to buy frame from Ukraine
[2022-03-08T00:46:33] Unknown: 43ah Vsett 10+ will probably bring me 160km per charge if I ride moderately. Which I probably won't. But still lots of time for things to heat up and stayed heated up. Have to be careful with heat and all things heat related at the motor side
[2022-03-08T00:46:55] Paolo ⁭: When you do some test?
[2022-03-08T00:47:41] Unknown: I did a short test yesterday. Only charged to 70% and rode on wet sandy roads for a few miles...
[2022-03-08T00:48:08] Paolo ⁭: Gopro video?
[2022-03-08T00:48:56] Unknown: New battery is doing great so far. 55a battery 150a phase on rear and 55a batt and 125a phase on front... Around 8kw on 3.75v per cell.

[2022-03-08T00:50:18] Paolo ⁭: 7865 from both or each?
[2022-03-08T00:50:28] Unknown: 110a battery and saw around 6-7v sag max.. from 76v to 69v. Normal riding around saw around 1-3v sag average
[2022-03-08T00:50:35] rosheee: U can do 10.8kw
[2022-03-08T00:50:37] Unknown: Was both combined

[2022-03-08T00:52:32] Unknown: 👍. At full or near full charge I expect the sag will be much more stable... 3.75v per cell resting is on the lower end
[2022-03-08T00:53:01] Paolo ⁭: Your is 20s9p?
[2022-03-08T00:53:28] Unknown: Still.. 110a 6v-7v sag isn't too shabby. Plus cells are brand new, never been fully charged or discharged, so they need to come to life with a few cycles
[2022-03-08T00:53:33] Unknown: Yup
[2022-03-08T00:54:43] rosheee: I stay 16S daily 17S fun on g30
[2022-03-08T00:54:44] Unknown: Battery temp never rose above ambient. So I certainly wasn't using it to full ability
[2022-03-08T00:55:05] Paolo ⁭: 30s
[2022-03-08T00:55:14] Unknown: Basically, these numbers don't mean a whole lot.. yet
[2022-03-08T00:56:02] Happy Giraffe: I will see if spintend does 100v improved single ubox, then might go 20s🌚
[2022-03-08T00:57:02] Happy Giraffe: Usually custom bike frames are large in lenght wise so why not😂 I want 80kmh
[2022-03-08T01:11:02] rosheee: I stay
[2022-03-08T01:11:18] rosheee: 85kmh with 16S are enough uphill
[2022-03-08T01:11:46] rosheee: But i go 16S7P 35Ah internal
[2022-03-08T01:12:15] Unknown: Not... Sucé...?
[2022-03-08T01:12:22] Unknown: 🤣🤣
[2022-03-08T01:12:51] rosheee: if police fucks me with that speed i am rly fucked
[2022-03-08T01:13:24] rosheee: and if i crash with even 40-50kmh only LED helmet i am fuckedf
[2022-03-08T01:13:46] rosheee: for racetrack i wanna build some bigass scooter...but racetrack ^^'
[2022-03-08T01:13:58] rosheee: XD CAR OR SCOOTER
[2022-03-08T01:14:27] rosheee: this or scooter xD?
[2022-03-08T01:14:45] rosheee: it isn't the fastest but omg ^^'
[2022-03-08T01:15:24] rosheee: when i told me guys that i like scooter more than car
[2022-03-08T01:15:30] rosheee: they XD ...omg lol
[2022-03-08T01:15:33] Unknown: Seriously... My 10+ was lifting the front wheel off the ground if weight shifted rearwards. Front tire chirping cruising at 30mph then to full throttle... I think this may be the power limit for Vsett 10+ lol. Monster Weped is more stable. I'm not sure if I want more than 10kw on Vsett lol. Plenty fast for me. Tip speed will never be reached unless I get really good gear
[2022-03-08T01:15:53] Unknown: Lol. I know that track
[2022-03-08T01:16:01] rosheee: ok which one xD?

[2022-03-08T17:22:07] rosheee: They stopped trading lol +250%
[2022-03-08T17:22:33] Unknown: F nickel. Only copper
[2022-03-08T17:22:37] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-08T17:22:39] Unknown: Nickel sucks
[2022-03-08T17:22:45] rosheee: Just saying lol
[2022-03-08T17:22:55] Unknown: Too expensive and low current/high resistance
[2022-03-08T17:23:03] rosheee: Yah now it is xD
[2022-03-08T17:23:32] Unknown: I have over $150 in nickel I bought and didn't end up using 🙄 Copper cost me 20 bucks lol

[2022-03-08T18:10:54] Paolo ⁭: Ops don’t fit
[2022-03-08T18:11:11] Stan: Which deck is this going to fit in
[2022-03-08T18:15:25] Luis Magalhaes: Big deck spacer 😂
[2022-03-08T18:22:29] Paolo ⁭: As always blade
[2022-03-08T18:28:29] Oliver Eliasson: Whats speed regulator?
[2022-03-08T18:28:46] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-08T18:29:29] Paolo ⁭: “Gears” I think
[2022-03-08T18:29:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you press something and it keeps the same speed. you can release your throttle.
[2022-03-08T18:32:46] rosheee: Hmm i need....sometimes ^^..but idk how with vesc
[2022-03-08T18:34:47] Oliver Eliasson: I use sometimes
[2022-03-08T18:35:02] sombre_enfant: Cruise controll then
[2022-03-08T18:35:09] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah
[2022-03-08T18:35:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2022-03-08T18:39:23] Luis Magalhaes: Cruise Control
[2022-03-08T18:41:17] Luis Magalhaes: In late 😂
[2022-03-08T18:42:45] Happy Giraffe: Stable amp output on cruise will be amazing on an ebike🤔 Set really low current and pedal easy on longest gear
[2022-03-08T18:43:33] Happy Giraffe: Grin told me they wont release higher wattage motor for rear through axle than 2000w...
[2022-03-08T18:43:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it must not be stable amps, but stable speed. like cars ... once engaged, it keeps the same speed
[2022-03-08T18:43:48] Happy Giraffe: But it could also be set for amps?
[2022-03-08T18:44:04] Happy Giraffe: Like a faster on/off cruise but for power
[2022-03-08T19:11:33] Artem Bulashev: What is that cell?
[2022-03-08T19:12:06] Artem Bulashev: Yeah problem of amp throttle
[2022-03-08T19:12:14] Artem Bulashev: Cruise gains speed
[2022-03-08T19:14:10] Paolo ⁭: <files/murata_vtc5d-2.pdf>

[2022-03-08T19:18:24] Artem Bulashev: Oh vtc5
[2022-03-08T19:18:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sadly yes
[2022-03-08T19:18:40] Paolo ⁭: Vtc5d
[2022-03-08T19:19:17] Artem Bulashev: Why this sell?
[2022-03-08T19:19:24] Artem Bulashev: Need that many amps ?
[2022-03-08T19:19:53] Artem Bulashev: From 8p that can be 200a
[2022-03-08T19:20:41] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2901@08-03-2022_19-20-41.jpg>
[2022-03-08T19:21:21] Artem Bulashev: 8-9wh before it hits 3v depending on load 15a-2a
[2022-03-08T19:21:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So cc or tempomat
[2022-03-08T19:21:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Surly not
[2022-03-08T19:24:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not sure understand. think it like a car ... - go at your desired speed - double press button 1 to engage cruise control - single press button 1 or 2 to increase/decrease speed - double press button 1, or big throttle push or brake to disengage
[2022-03-08T19:24:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cc Cruise controll shortening
[2022-03-08T19:25:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can have all these in xiaogen
[2022-03-08T19:25:24] Paolo ⁭: Can support 35A
[2022-03-08T19:25:31] Paolo ⁭: I need powerful configuration
[2022-03-08T19:26:01] Paolo ⁭: 280 *
[2022-03-08T19:26:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: At Higher speeds i dont like it all , better be me controlling stuff
[2022-03-08T19:26:43] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌yeah it can really do 30a but sag is MASSIVE
[2022-03-08T19:27:14] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2902@08-03-2022_19-27-14.jpg>
[2022-03-08T19:27:21] Paolo ⁭: I still don’t know why you don’t read full code 😂
[2022-03-08T19:27:26] Paolo ⁭: That’s not vtc5
[2022-03-08T19:27:34] Paolo ⁭: It’s vtc5d 😆😂
[2022-03-08T19:27:38] Paolo ⁭: Not the same
[2022-03-08T19:27:58] Artem Bulashev: Intersting that at 15a 35e can deliver same Wh as vtc5, just at lower voltage but for longer time
[2022-03-08T19:28:06] Paolo ⁭: You confounding also vtc6 with vtc6a lol
[2022-03-08T19:28:10] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know what the difference is will see
[2022-03-08T19:28:27] Artem Bulashev: Will see what I can find on 5d
[2022-03-08T19:29:39] Paolo ⁭: 35 vs 25A
[2022-03-08T19:29:40] Paolo ⁭: Xd
[2022-03-08T19:30:55] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2022-03-08T19:31:11] Artem Bulashev: Vtc5d is rated higher and has a bit higher capacity
[2022-03-08T19:32:33] Artem Bulashev: Would be Intersting to get it tested. If you have few extra cells of those I can ask the guy who keeps that website with tests to test those - so that they can be compared to others
[2022-03-08T19:34:51] Paolo ⁭: I can compare it with molicel that you love😂
[2022-03-08T19:35:54] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_2903@08-03-2022_19-35-54.jpg>
[2022-03-08T19:36:46] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 2a-15a delivered 14-13wh
[2022-03-08T19:37:01] Paolo ⁭: In capacity molicel will be sure win
[2022-03-08T19:37:16] Artem Bulashev: It is best 20a discharge cells
[2022-03-08T19:37:17] Paolo ⁭: Discharge also but only a bit
[2022-03-08T19:37:38] Artem Bulashev: 15a discharge Samsung 50g and 48x win
[2022-03-08T19:37:50] Artem Bulashev: But for 25/30/35a don’t know
[2022-03-08T19:38:02] Artem Bulashev: Never studied that close
[2022-03-08T19:38:28] Paolo ⁭: I don’t need capacity
[2022-03-08T19:38:41] Paolo ⁭: Normally max 10km and not run more
[2022-03-08T19:40:31] rosheee: Samsung 50g i can recommend xD
[2022-03-08T19:42:06] rosheee: Omg vesc is so iq300 Thought 135A have to be beefier, but now finally i saw what volt cut does
[2022-03-08T19:42:12] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-08T19:44:21] rosheee: If vdroop wouldn't be so hard it should boost more, not? 64V -> 47V What if it only drops like 3V?
[2022-03-08T19:44:30] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-08T19:46:02] Artem Bulashev: Short story is so: Battery volts * battery amp limit = input power available (watts)
[2022-03-08T19:46:13] rosheee: Oh yes
[2022-03-08T19:46:39] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-08T19:46:50] Artem Bulashev: The less input power available, the lower in RPM range will phase amps get limited and start reducing
[2022-03-08T19:47:09] Artem Bulashev: So when battery gets low voltage your phase amps get reduced at lower speed
[2022-03-08T19:47:44] Artem Bulashev: Phase amps * motor volts (depend on speed or RPM) = output motor power (watts)
[2022-03-08T19:48:16] Artem Bulashev: Input power avaible can not be less than output motor power (vesc keeps output lower or equal by reducing phase amps when needed)
[2022-03-08T19:48:42] rosheee: XD when thr battery gone that hot that it shuted down i had 41V volt cut..at 16S xD ohlol
[2022-03-08T19:49:16] Artem Bulashev: Oh wow - that fire 🔥
[2022-03-08T19:49:27] Artem Bulashev: 2.56v
[2022-03-08T19:49:38] Artem Bulashev: Normally vesc prevents you from over discharge
[2022-03-08T19:49:44] Artem Bulashev: Nicely and softly
[2022-03-08T19:50:01] rosheee: True
[2022-03-08T19:50:10] rosheee: Flipsky just cutted throttle lol
[2022-03-08T19:50:36] rosheee: So then i need new battery ^^
[2022-03-08T19:50:54] Artem Bulashev: No no
[2022-03-08T19:51:01] rosheee: ?
[2022-03-08T19:51:03] Artem Bulashev: 2.56 is still not dead
[2022-03-08T19:51:05] Artem Bulashev: For li ion
[2022-03-08T19:51:13] Artem Bulashev: It’s bellow 0%
[2022-03-08T19:51:15] Artem Bulashev: But
[2022-03-08T19:51:21] rosheee: What is safe?
[2022-03-08T19:51:23] Artem Bulashev: Won’t kill it completely
[2022-03-08T19:51:26] rosheee: 47 ^^'?
[2022-03-08T19:51:37] Artem Bulashev: For escooter 3v = 48v
[2022-03-08T19:51:40] Artem Bulashev: 16s
[2022-03-08T19:51:43] rosheee: Phuu
[2022-03-08T19:51:48] rosheee: So 47 is ok
[2022-03-08T19:51:50] Artem Bulashev: For cells normally 2.8v is safe
[2022-03-08T19:52:04] rosheee: So 45 ^^
[2022-03-08T19:52:09] Artem Bulashev: But it would help long life if you didn’t go bellow 3v
[2022-03-08T19:52:29] rosheee: What id long life ^^'?
[2022-03-08T19:52:33] rosheee: 1 year? 2?
[2022-03-08T19:52:37] Artem Bulashev: Cycles
[2022-03-08T19:53:11] Artem Bulashev: Healthiest is to keep it between 20% and 85% at all times
[2022-03-08T19:53:33] Artem Bulashev: That can double normal life cycle
[2022-03-08T19:54:37] Happy Giraffe: His first problem he uses multiple times the rated power of cells😂
[2022-03-08T19:54:42] Artem Bulashev: Some li ion chemistry expectancy is 350-400 cycles, others can be 2000 cycles - 48x for example rated 2000 cycles before it only holds 80% of charge (that is if you charger only up to 4.15v ->3v)
[2022-03-08T20:35:15] Gigolo Joe: *edited* Hey, Flipsky Vesc 75100, how do i recompile the software? Need a 5.3 version without any limits - no temperature limit, no amp limit Any advice?

[2022-03-09T06:49:47] Face de Pin Sucé: 7212
[2022-03-09T06:50:05] Face de Pin Sucé: only because of cooling

[2022-03-09T09:46:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Hello guys, I'm planning a group buy of Molicel P42A. If someone wants some, it's 4€/cell
[2022-03-09T09:56:24] Oliver Eliasson: How long do i have to decide?
[2022-03-09T09:59:19] Face de Pin Sucé: I'll tell you later, I'll ask to my friends
[2022-03-09T09:59:59] Face de Pin Sucé: how much time do you need ? x) and where country are you ?
[2022-03-09T10:00:22] Oliver Eliasson: Is it in eu and how much would shipping to sweden be?
[2022-03-09T10:00:49] Oliver Eliasson: Depends on when i pay
[2022-03-09T10:01:11] Face de Pin Sucé: We are in France, I'll ask for shipping to sweden
[2022-03-09T10:01:39] Oliver Eliasson: 4€ is with tax, vat etc right?
[2022-03-09T10:08:58] Paolo ⁭: But how can be powerful if can goes max 120A phase ?
[2022-03-09T10:09:43] Paolo ⁭: Freewheel useless bro
[2022-03-09T10:46:42] Face de Pin Sucé: thats battery current
[2022-03-09T10:47:32] Face de Pin Sucé: not really, it demonstrates the possibility, of course it will never reach this because it would need too much power and motor would burn, but freewheel shows how it works
[2022-03-09T10:47:38] Face de Pin Sucé: especially on Field Weakening

[2022-03-09T12:11:38] Artem Bulashev: Well to balance it you need to enable balancing
[2022-03-09T12:12:00] Unknown: Yes it is enabled, but batt is fully charged and then it disables idk why
[2022-03-09T12:12:58] Unknown: Tried to put max cell voltage at 4.2 so the cells would stop charging, but the entire batt stops charging then so that did'nt work out
[2022-03-09T12:13:33] Artem Bulashev: 😅
[2022-03-09T12:13:49] Artem Bulashev: What BMS is that?
[2022-03-09T12:14:02] Paolo ⁭: Daly shit
[2022-03-09T12:15:03] Artem Bulashev: Strange
[2022-03-09T12:15:47] Artem Bulashev: My JKBms turns off charging if any one cell goes about OV Limit 4.225v I set
[2022-03-09T12:16:54] Artem Bulashev: But balancing turns on above 3.5v and if delta is 0.1v or larger
[2022-03-09T12:18:23] Artem Bulashev: Balancing shuts down only if BMS goes into SC protection or voltage drops bellow 3.5v
[2022-03-09T12:48:59] D J: That's a good price 👌
[2022-03-09T13:10:10] Artem Bulashev: 40T 4€ 50g 5€ 48x 4.9€ 35e 3.6Euro Incl eu VAT, New
[2022-03-09T13:11:06] Artem Bulashev: P42a don’t have at the moment, it was 4-4.15€
[2022-03-09T13:39:42] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-03-09T14:15:35] Happy Giraffe: Crystalyte telling me 30mm magnet and stator has same performance than 40mm...did they change the laws of physics in the meantime?
[2022-03-09T14:31:39] Mirono escooters: Maybe kv compenates?
[2022-03-09T14:32:08] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-03-09T14:32:13] Artem Bulashev: Length is not all
[2022-03-09T14:32:20] Artem Bulashev: It is volume
[2022-03-09T14:32:35] Artem Bulashev: That determines the strength
[2022-03-09T14:33:06] Artem Bulashev: May be they have 30 instead of 40mm but 2.5mm instead of 2mm thick
[2022-03-09T14:33:15] Artem Bulashev: That would MOATLY compensate
[2022-03-09T14:33:19] Artem Bulashev: In theory
[2022-03-09T14:35:15] Happy Giraffe: But then its still different charasteristics as thinner wind handles less amps
[2022-03-09T14:35:46] Happy Giraffe: I think it's same magnet just less wide🤔 but I will ask them
[2022-03-09T14:35:59] Happy Giraffe: Btw its belgian company😂
[2022-03-09T14:36:10] Artem Bulashev: Higher KV = less rounds = more space for thicker wire
[2022-03-09T14:37:19] Happy Giraffe: But less starting torque and if combined with 30mm magnet🌚
[2022-03-09T14:43:44] Happy Giraffe: Problem is the companies provide such small info its hard to choose best and most cost effective motor for my purpose
[2022-03-09T14:52:58] Happy Giraffe: Fuck it, I go to the 50% cheaper Mxus 3k Turbo with 45mm magnets and swappable stator thats only 100€ if I want to change KV later

[2022-03-10T12:02:48] Artem Bulashev: Vesc shut of every time with OV Ptotection
[2022-03-10T12:02:51] Artem Bulashev: No damage
[2022-03-10T12:02:55] Artem Bulashev: No smoke
[2022-03-10T12:03:08] Artem Bulashev: So
[2022-03-10T12:03:12] rosheee: Rly?
[2022-03-10T12:03:15] rosheee: Easypeasy
[2022-03-10T12:03:21] Artem Bulashev: Even if you use 17s you should be safe without regen
[2022-03-10T12:03:22] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-10T12:03:32] rosheee: Yah US guy use 18S with it
[2022-03-10T12:03:39] Artem Bulashev: If anything Ubox seem to have very good OV protection
[2022-03-10T12:03:44] rosheee: I hope xD
[2022-03-10T12:03:51] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-03-10T12:03:59] Artem Bulashev: Well
[2022-03-10T12:04:04] Artem Bulashev: Manual says 80v max
[2022-03-10T12:04:07] rosheee: ^^ they told me i shouldnt do it
[2022-03-10T12:04:08] rosheee: Yep
[2022-03-10T12:04:14] rosheee: But FW says 72V max
[2022-03-10T12:04:16] Artem Bulashev: And
[2022-03-10T12:04:28] Artem Bulashev: When you charge battery it stops at 4.15v
[2022-03-10T12:04:39] Artem Bulashev: 74.7v
[2022-03-10T12:04:48] Artem Bulashev: No regen = never higher
[2022-03-10T12:04:58] Artem Bulashev: Didn’t know
[2022-03-10T12:05:00] rosheee: ^___^
[2022-03-10T12:05:01] rosheee: With smart bms omfg

[2022-03-10T12:25:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: same for me, Spintend Ubox Dual : 2*130A phase / 2*45A battery. all good
[2022-03-10T12:26:25] rosheee: 2x135A phase 2x71A battery no prob
[2022-03-10T12:27:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: VESC overvoltage protection seems very good, very reactive. Never seen trouble on this side.
[2022-03-10T12:33:43] Face de Pin Sucé: no prob except heat 😭
[2022-03-10T12:34:38] Paolo ⁭: Sucé
[2022-03-10T12:34:57] Face de Pin Sucé: ya me gusta
[2022-03-10T12:35:20] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌 agree yeah
[2022-03-10T12:35:42] Artem Bulashev: Ubox? Doesn’t over heat stock ? I though this would be above its thermal capacity
[2022-03-10T12:37:03] Artem Bulashev: Exactly that seems to high for ubox size without added heat solution
[2022-03-10T12:41:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for me, not at all (35°C max), each start is a burn 🤣🤣 , but I limit my max speed to 45/50 km/h. and lower battery currents (2*45)... also, the spintend is compressed on the escooter frame on 3 sides.
[2022-03-10T12:43:22] Face de Pin Sucé: that's mainly because of your max speed
[2022-03-10T12:44:22] Paolo ⁭: I’ve got 250A in ubox single and gigant fire work
[2022-03-10T12:50:55] rosheee: Nope
[2022-03-10T12:51:40] rosheee: Max 70 degrees when i go massiv uphill
[2022-03-10T12:51:48] rosheee: But the real test is this weekend
[2022-03-10T12:52:14] rosheee: 17S6P 2x90A battery
[2022-03-10T12:52:23] Paolo ⁭: Poor vsett motor
[2022-03-10T12:52:35] rosheee: We will see
[2022-03-10T12:52:39] rosheee: No vdroop tjis time
[2022-03-10T12:52:51] rosheee: No mercy volt cutoff at 42V
[2022-03-10T12:53:00] rosheee: After 1000km
[2022-03-10T12:53:16] rosheee: It has to be better than 16S5P woth 50G cells and 60A bms
[2022-03-10T12:53:21] Paolo ⁭: You goes 7218 or 7230 in your weped
[2022-03-10T12:54:42] Face de Pin Sucé: none x)
[2022-03-10T12:55:10] Artem Bulashev: I believe your battery limit does barely kick in than I think usually around 40a battery kicks in at around 35kmh on 10inch rpm
[2022-03-10T12:55:30] Paolo ⁭: Custom vesc right?
[2022-03-10T12:55:35] Face de Pin Sucé: yay
[2022-03-10T12:55:54] Paolo ⁭: Julien the engineer
[2022-03-10T13:02:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: how is your vesc development going ?
[2022-03-10T13:03:43] Paolo ⁭: I send you image in dm
[2022-03-10T13:25:24] D J: 2 weeks +- and I'll have my VESC ready...I'm looking forward to it 🙂 the case to apply the VESC outside the deck needs to arrive and it's ready to test
[2022-03-10T15:34:17] Happy Giraffe: Propably for single motor the Spintend 100v single ubox if they release it soon. I asked them to improve thermal performance and design it for 150-200A or so😂 We will see
[2022-03-10T15:34:50] Happy Giraffe: Also we can buy Paolo vesc😜
[2022-03-10T16:02:56] Artem Bulashev: 150a phase 60a battery without cooling issue would be sweet spot (never above 70c even in summer in slight hills)
[2022-03-10T16:03:44] Happy Giraffe: Almost what single ubox can do I think with direct airflow🤔
[2022-03-10T16:06:20] Artem Bulashev: Direct airflow is extra cooling.
[2022-03-10T16:06:26] Happy Giraffe: Exactly
[2022-03-10T16:06:47] Artem Bulashev: If it could do it passively
[2022-03-10T16:06:48] Happy Giraffe: But this way new vesc wouldnt be needed if the design didnt suck this bad😂
[2022-03-10T16:06:57] Artem Bulashev: Would be sweet spot I think
[2022-03-10T16:07:01] Artem Bulashev: Even less battery amps
[2022-03-10T16:07:23] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, single overheats even with 100A sustained
[2022-03-10T16:07:45] Artem Bulashev: 100a phase and how many battery?
[2022-03-10T16:07:51] Happy Giraffe: I hope they do 200A version so there is some headroom
[2022-03-10T16:07:55] Happy Giraffe: 50/100A
[2022-03-10T16:08:12] Artem Bulashev: Even after you put better heat pads?
[2022-03-10T16:08:16] Happy Giraffe: And also 40/100A overheats aswell if sustained
[2022-03-10T16:08:39] Happy Giraffe: Now its cold outside and theres traffic lights to cool down vesc
[2022-03-10T16:08:58] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-03-10T16:09:02] Happy Giraffe: Will see soon how a longer summer ride does it
[2022-03-10T16:09:13] Artem Bulashev: Yeah will see
[2022-03-10T16:09:21] Artem Bulashev: Dual can’t be that much better
[2022-03-10T16:09:33] Artem Bulashev: I think your factory pads were just not well placed
[2022-03-10T16:09:37] Artem Bulashev: Will see
[2022-03-10T16:10:12] Artem Bulashev: People with dual run 125/40 rear 90/35 front inside closed deck and temps never above 68c
[2022-03-10T16:10:14] Happy Giraffe: It is I think
[2022-03-10T16:10:15] Artem Bulashev: In summer
[2022-03-10T16:10:44] Happy Giraffe: I will do 40/125A in summer and see
[2022-03-10T16:10:54] Artem Bulashev: Must be mosfets
[2022-03-10T16:11:00] Happy Giraffe: Of course many variables on this but to give rough estimates
[2022-03-10T16:11:14] Artem Bulashev: Sure
[2022-03-10T16:12:48] Happy Giraffe: But anyways never hurts to have power headroom for longest hills etc
[2022-03-10T16:18:38] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-03-10T16:20:02] Artem Bulashev: I’m just wondering how much would you gain from having - beef up power traces with solder and copper wire - better fets with lower IR and higher heat transmission surface
[2022-03-10T16:20:35] Artem Bulashev: I think you could get 30% gain before getting to same temp
[2022-03-10T16:29:28] Luis Magalhaes: 👀
[2022-03-10T16:31:37] Happy Giraffe: And more optimal case design, single vesc is cooling the 2w Arm chip instead of mosfets😅😂

[2022-03-10T23:34:05] Mirono escooters: *if* phase wires short when riding. Will vesc die?
[2022-03-11T00:06:41] Unknown: I would like to think these is some sort of protection from this... Motor will definitely cog out and likely send you flying over the bars. I had phase accidentally shorted while powered on with Nuc and nothing bad happened at all... But I wasn't riding/wheels spinning. Curious about this myself just for knowledge sake...
[2022-03-11T00:33:11] Happy Giraffe: Why would they short?
[2022-03-11T00:33:53] Happy Giraffe: Last time I checked you didnt sell phase wires so all good💀

[2022-03-11T00:58:47] Paolo ⁭: You are crazy to use this connector with such power
[2022-03-11T00:59:12] Paolo ⁭: Mt60 max 60 as peak
[2022-03-11T00:59:21] Paolo ⁭: And 30 continuos
[2022-03-11T00:59:25] Unknown: I know... it's my fault. I ran it at 48V with much less amps. Then I upgraded to 72v with a lot more amps and overlooked replacing the connector
[2022-03-11T00:59:37] Unknown: Paid dearly.. now I have to spend $200 on a new controller.
[2022-03-11T00:59:52] Unknown: It ran okay for a couple months though.... LOL
[2022-03-11T01:00:42] Paolo ⁭: Maybe can easy replaced
[2022-03-11T01:01:24] Unknown: I know.. i know.. my fault. I'm putting lugs directly on the phase wires this time.

[2022-03-11T16:37:39] Artem Bulashev: Over 300€ unless it will go for mass production
[2022-03-11T17:08:47] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_2943@11-03-2022_17-08-47.jpg>
[2022-03-11T17:08:47] Happy Giraffe: 30mm magnet is wider in diameter to compensate against 40/45mm torque they (Crystalyte) say.. It has 5-7% less efficiency across the curve and 10% less start up torque🌚
[2022-03-11T17:09:37] Happy Giraffe: I call bs, magnet width somehow can't be compensated
[2022-03-11T17:16:13] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-11T17:41:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yep
[2022-03-11T17:41:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, smartdisplay
[2022-03-11T17:42:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: designed for multi controllers including vesc
[2022-03-11T17:45:46] Artem Bulashev: Still think that over 300 is unrealistic price point unfortunately, 200€ would be already likely above 75% of people would pay for display/side computer with extra functions, hopefully I’m wrong
[2022-03-11T17:53:28] Unknown: I think if the capabilities are such that one single display can be used/reused with many controller types... It would be more feasible to pay such money. For instance, if current setup is scooter with VESC and down the road you build scooter with Kelly, being able to repurpose the display would be huge. The display will last a long time and if it's multi-controller compatible, I would definitely be more inclined to invest in one. I believe Koxx said only software changes would be needed to change smartdisplay controller compatibility
[2022-03-11T18:57:53] Artem Bulashev: Fair point, long term investment needs to be parts of marketing for sure
[2022-03-11T18:58:35] Artem Bulashev: I was just looking from perspective that vesc screens avaible now are like 40-120€ at very most (Davega)
[2022-03-11T19:15:48] Unknown: I mean, I think you're right. A lot of people wouldn't be able to justify buying a display that costs twice as much as their controller, probably more than that in some cases. So the customer base will definitely be smaller at that higher price point. Probably more of the "serious DIY" crowd than the "hobbyist/experimental" crowd. Was just offering my perspective on it and how I would perceive the purchase. It isn't a piece of hardware that will really ever "wear out" and only possibly broken in a crash or similar
[2022-03-11T19:23:58] Artem Bulashev: Savers seems also expensive for many but it was justified as Boards have often 4 vesc or 2 dual

[2022-03-11T21:39:57] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2022-03-11T21:40:20] Happy Giraffe: 10,000km on that one
[2022-03-11T21:44:11] Mirono escooters: Belgium for W
[2022-03-11T21:57:46] Artem Bulashev: Guys get that
[2022-03-11T21:58:05] Artem Bulashev: Vsett8+ controller was just tested on +4s
[2022-03-11T21:58:11] Artem Bulashev: And no issue 🤣🤣
[2022-03-11T21:58:33] Artem Bulashev: 48v 13s uped to 63.6v 17s
[2022-03-11T21:58:44] Artem Bulashev: Without mods
[2022-03-11T21:58:58] Artem Bulashev: 30% power gain in watts
[2022-03-11T21:59:02] Artem Bulashev: Or range
[2022-03-11T21:59:08] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁
[2022-03-11T21:59:33] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 😂
[2022-03-11T21:59:41] Artem Bulashev: I think I may sell ubox lol
[2022-03-11T21:59:44] Artem Bulashev: 😆😆😆
[2022-03-11T22:00:11] Mirono escooters: Poor thing
[2022-03-11T22:00:22] Artem Bulashev: Kidding
[2022-03-11T22:00:35] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂
[2022-03-11T22:00:37] Artem Bulashev: But it is very attractive alternative 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
[2022-03-11T22:01:01] Luis Magalhaes: Push the ubox to 17s 😜
[2022-03-11T22:01:47] Oliver Eliasson: Can ubox 75v handle 17s?
[2022-03-11T22:02:21] Artem Bulashev: Yes without regen
[2022-03-11T22:02:26] Artem Bulashev: For sure
[2022-03-11T22:02:42] Oliver Eliasson: But i want regen? Then no?
[2022-03-11T22:02:50] Artem Bulashev: High risk
[2022-03-11T22:02:56] Artem Bulashev: Some people use it
[2022-03-11T22:03:09] Artem Bulashev: Also ubox has good OV protection
[2022-03-11T22:03:47] Oliver Eliasson: Okey, so could use and maybe set regen braking at lower?
[2022-03-11T22:04:39] Artem Bulashev: Just have to try and control
[2022-03-11T22:04:45] Artem Bulashev: At first
[2022-03-11T22:04:58] Artem Bulashev: You only risk it at very full battery
[2022-03-11T22:05:10] Artem Bulashev: Have regen on separate brake
[2022-03-11T22:05:21] Artem Bulashev: And use mechanical for first 3km
[2022-03-11T22:05:23] Artem Bulashev: 👍👍
[2022-03-11T22:05:28] Oliver Eliasson: So doing 17s and only charging to 80-90% would eork?
[2022-03-11T22:05:52] Oliver Eliasson: Then i get longer life also
[2022-03-11T22:19:06] Artem Bulashev: Same 72v 20s battery but he has over 42ah batter vs Nami 28ah-35ah. So less voltage sag = more long term power 🤝😅 Motors on 10+ 1400w at 16s battery voltage, but at 20s it would have nominal 1750w !!! (Damm) Weight vsett10+ 36kg +7kg extra of battery = 43kg vs 47kg Nami burn e = 10% lighter (that’s ALOT actually) May beat Nami!!! My money are on 8.2sec 0-80kmh
[2022-03-11T22:19:25] Artem Bulashev: Sure but what’s the point than?
[2022-03-11T22:20:17] Artem Bulashev: You charge up to 80% that = to full charge 16s
[2022-03-11T22:20:40] Artem Bulashev: And same range you will get
[2022-03-11T22:20:47] Artem Bulashev: But takes more space
[2022-03-11T22:21:16] Oliver Eliasson: Longer life of cells and when i need that extra range i could charge to 100% and use mechanical in the beginning
[2022-03-11T22:21:30] Oliver Eliasson: Would it fit without spacer?
[2022-03-11T22:26:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: right, software and few jumpers (documented) to switch from a controller to another.
[2022-03-11T22:30:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i would really like to reduce the cost, but it way too early for that. small batches costs A LOT to produce. if it works and i can go with a much larger batch (x1000), it will greatly reduce the price (by 2 may be).
[2022-03-11T22:30:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for example, the case.
[2022-03-11T22:31:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1-1000 pieces, for good quality, not a lot of choices. sls/mlf prints. 25/35€ per case 😭
[2022-03-11T22:32:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for larger productions, you can go to plastic injection. but molds cost a lot (10/30000 € i heard). 😭😭 then each case cost less than 1€
[2022-03-11T23:33:35] Artem Bulashev: Well I would have carefully review what can be done without spacer and play with it.
[2022-03-11T23:35:07] Artem Bulashev: With spacer yes my battery lay out is 2 P short (used for smart BMS, but you could get more narrow basic BMS and than add one more P) But that build layout is no joke hard to get right
[2022-03-11T23:36:36] Artem Bulashev: Technically capacity is 6.25% gain only
[2022-03-11T23:36:43] Artem Bulashev: Over 16s
[2022-03-11T23:37:14] Artem Bulashev: Acceleration is already 4 sec to 42kmh
[2022-03-11T23:37:28] Artem Bulashev: It’s crazy fast for this frame
[2022-03-11T23:37:45] Unknown: How do you measure??
[2022-03-11T23:37:58] Unknown: I'll be wanting to measure my acceleration speeds but honestly have no idea how.
[2022-03-11T23:39:03] Artem Bulashev: Yeah Spintend told me that they use bcc for prototypes and than injection mold only on final product
[2022-03-11T23:39:11] Artem Bulashev: Vesc log
[2022-03-11T23:40:10] Unknown: Hmm. I don't have such amenities LoL. Maybe I do and I just don't know it. Will have to see what I can log and what I cannot
[2022-03-11T23:42:05] Artem Bulashev: It is more accurate than gps as I have it configured exactly + tested on gps constant 50kmh + tested distance by driving on track 4 times 400m 👌👌 and it was with few m after 1600m
[2022-03-11T23:43:06] Artem Bulashev: Well vesc has BT to phone with very good high refresh rate telematics - so I could also just record screen and it would be same as log
[2022-03-11T23:43:16] Artem Bulashev: May be you can do similar
[2022-03-11T23:43:24] Unknown: Very nice. I don't believe I have such feature
[2022-03-11T23:43:29] Happy Giraffe: And connection is damn reliable, like 5 meters easy
[2022-03-11T23:43:51] Unknown: No BT... Maybe dragy? I wonder how much that setup is
[2022-03-11T23:45:16] Unknown: These are all logging parameters
[2022-03-11T23:45:18] Unknown: More for power information, not time or distance related measures
[2022-03-12T00:59:09] Stan: Quick test on my friends new ES19 awaiting must have mods … 🥵
[2022-03-12T01:38:46] rosheee: ducati flipskygang lol

[2022-03-12T01:39:50] rosheee: looks like crapperia xD
[2022-03-12T01:42:13] rosheee: for what does "wh" counts?
[2022-03-12T01:43:34] Artem Bulashev: How do you off load logs?
[2022-03-12T01:44:04] Artem Bulashev: Yeah angled teeth
[2022-03-12T01:44:05] Unknown: Logs to microSD in display and from there... I'm really not sure. I'll have to test it out
[2022-03-12T01:44:51] Unknown: That's actually a really good question lol. I'm not sure how or where it offloads the info to
[2022-03-12T01:45:47] Unknown: Never used the logger feature. Have a feeling I've seen some sort of interface where users have uploaded their logs for troubleshooting
[2022-03-12T01:47:11] Unknown: Logs are CSV files...??
[2022-03-12T01:49:04] Unknown: Soooo. Excel spreadsheet? Lol I wonder if there is software interface to translate into graphs. I honestly don't know much about this...
[2022-03-12T01:52:11] Unknown: Maybe is just good for troubleshooting. I'm not really sure. Would actually be interested to log voltage drop vs amps pulled for new battery. I forgot I could do that.
[2022-03-12T01:57:46] rosheee: log from what? i find it !!
[2022-03-12T01:58:48] Unknown: Log from Nucular. It saves to microSD card in display and saves as CSV file. I have no clue how this works... How to "see" the logged information other than a 500000 page excel spreadsheet
[2022-03-12T01:58:57] rosheee: ok wait
[2022-03-12T01:59:28] Unknown: <files/NCLOG4.CSV>
[2022-03-12T01:59:51] Unknown: <files/NClog1.csv>
[2022-03-12T02:00:20] Unknown: Like what do I do with these files lol? Is there a software to upload them to? Or only visible in excel?
[2022-03-12T02:00:37] Unknown: Those are not my logs, just ones uploaded to the Nucular chat
[2022-03-12T02:01:07] Unknown: With certain parameters "on". You can select which parameters to log, it is not all parameters by default
[2022-03-12T02:01:54] rosheee: OH THEY RELEASE NEW REVISION OF THEIR ESCS
[2022-03-12T02:02:12] Unknown: LoL saw your post on Nuc chat. Thank you man

[2022-03-12T02:03:05] rosheee: Xd U CAN OPEN IN VESC TOOL lol
[2022-03-12T02:03:10] Unknown: Yea they're designing new updated controllers but... The war... Poor guys
[2022-03-12T02:03:11] rosheee: i test
[2022-03-12T02:03:15] Unknown: For real???
[2022-03-12T02:03:17] rosheee: wait
[2022-03-12T02:03:20] Unknown: Ok

[2022-03-12T02:04:31] Unknown: Ok, that's good to know
[2022-03-12T02:04:54] Unknown: I feel like I've seen graphs but could be wrong
[2022-03-12T02:05:33] rosheee: maybe with a csv view toool
[2022-03-12T02:05:34] rosheee: hold on
[2022-03-12T02:06:03] rosheee: <photos/photo_2951@12-03-2022_02-06-03.jpg>
[2022-03-12T02:06:16] Unknown: Let me just say, they're very "serious" guys on Nuc chat LoL. Very helpful but too damn serious sometimes 🤣
[2022-03-12T02:06:27] rosheee: that's the only chart i get
[2022-03-12T02:06:32] rosheee: i can convert that into grafix
[2022-03-12T02:06:52] Unknown: Can you scroll thru the pages?
[2022-03-12T02:06:57] rosheee: wait
[2022-03-12T02:07:19] rosheee: omg

[2022-03-12T02:09:34] rosheee: so what u see?
[2022-03-12T02:09:35] Unknown: What do I open it with? Grafix?
[2022-03-12T02:09:44] Unknown: Just an excel spreadsheet
[2022-03-12T02:09:46] rosheee: ah i have to convert it
[2022-03-12T02:09:54] rosheee: into grafix 😆
[2022-03-12T02:09:56] rosheee: on pc
[2022-03-12T02:10:22] Unknown: Gotcha. I have PC too 👍
[2022-03-12T02:10:32] rosheee: 😆i have no excel on my laptop
[2022-03-12T02:10:38] rosheee: https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=convert+excel+to+graph+chart&view=detail&mid=4B541E1B3DA349C97B444B541E1B3DA349C97B44&FORM=VIRE
[2022-03-12T02:10:53] Unknown: On phone now... But can open PC to test
[2022-03-12T02:11:12] rosheee: i could if i get up to pc room but have to work in basement atm
[2022-03-12T02:12:01] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-12T02:12:09] Unknown: No worries man. No rush
[2022-03-12T02:12:27] Unknown: Ok, so excel can convert spreadsheet to chart
[2022-03-12T02:12:30] rosheee: u can do it as well when u follow the video i posted :D
[2022-03-12T02:12:32] rosheee: yes 😆
[2022-03-12T02:12:34] rosheee: u never used excel?
[2022-03-12T02:12:38] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-12T02:12:42] Unknown: Lil bit in college 😂
[2022-03-12T02:12:53] rosheee: so u don't work with pcs :D ?
[2022-03-12T02:13:05] Unknown: That helps a lot. Gives me something to go off of 👍👍👍
[2022-03-12T02:13:51] Unknown: Well, usually when I need to figure something out, I can do whatever I need to do. But current knowledge doesn't include excel spreadsheet to chart info haha
[2022-03-12T02:14:03] Unknown: But that makes perfect sense
[2022-03-12T02:14:11] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-12T02:14:12] Unknown: Thanks bro 👍
[2022-03-12T02:14:18] rosheee: send pics when done
[2022-03-12T02:14:30] rosheee: but it is pretty easy
[2022-03-12T02:14:44] rosheee: to get out a graph
[2022-03-12T02:14:56] Unknown: I'll log my next ride and see what I come up with. Really interested in real time voltage sag vs amps pulled to get an idea what my battery is doing
[2022-03-12T02:16:19] rosheee: me2
[2022-03-12T02:16:21] rosheee: send then pls
[2022-03-12T02:17:50] Unknown: dragy 10Hz GPS Based Performance Meter https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077KKPMTB/ref=cm_sw_r_awdo_3GWNJCR1HER06G2RQGMH
[2022-03-12T02:17:50] Unknown: Is this dragy a decent unit??
[2022-03-12T02:17:59] Unknown: Absolutely
[2022-03-12T02:19:28] Unknown: Unless I have Rion or NAMI to race head to head (which I don't) Id really like to know my 0-60mph performance
[2022-03-12T02:20:51] rosheee: Me2 then soon
[2022-03-12T02:21:09] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-12T02:21:32] rosheee: Even the isolation tape had to warm
[2022-03-12T02:21:49] Unknown: 10+ is an absolute monster. Still haven't fully charge 20s battery or got controller settings dialed in... Just a few short test rides at half charge. Damn winter
[2022-03-12T02:22:13] rosheee: Dude xD
[2022-03-12T02:22:29] Unknown: But bro... Bro... I can tell you serious power right now
[2022-03-12T02:23:11] rosheee: This is with 16S + instant volt cut at 47V and 16S + spinning front and rear wheel
[2022-03-12T02:23:17] Unknown: Vsett motors may be capable of more than 5.5kw each on 20s
[2022-03-12T02:23:18] rosheee: With 10+ motors
[2022-03-12T02:23:44] rosheee: XD looks so slow omg
[2022-03-12T02:24:22] rosheee: The max i had with 2x vsett10+ motors + voltcut at 47V is 10.x kw
[2022-03-12T02:24:27] rosheee: 16S
[2022-03-12T02:24:32] Unknown: Haha. I saw that video. Beast. On 16s. Takes off like a rocket.
[2022-03-12T02:24:37] Unknown: Ferrofluid??
[2022-03-12T02:24:42] rosheee: Yup
[2022-03-12T02:24:51] Unknown: Ok good 👍
[2022-03-12T02:24:57] Unknown: Same here but 20s
[2022-03-12T02:25:02] rosheee: But the volt sag from 100%-> 47V ...worst
[2022-03-12T02:25:28] rosheee: With 17S when UPS work it out to deliver i think i can go 6-7kw each motor
[2022-03-12T02:25:42] rosheee: But i try out the max until motor burns
[2022-03-12T02:26:09] rosheee: Even 500W g30 motor we had 8KW xD
[2022-03-12T02:26:12] rosheee: For short time
[2022-03-12T02:28:26] Unknown: I had 76v charge at 110a battery (55a each) sag was around 6-7v max to 70-69v. 8kw. Copper helps tremendously. At full charge I expect over 10kw total
[2022-03-12T02:30:06] Unknown: I'll be pushing mine as well. Motor temp sensors will cut power when motor temp is reached. By the way, 55a (135a phase rear 110a phase front) motors never went above 105F 🤣
[2022-03-12T02:30:51] Unknown: So, plentyyy of ways to go. Motors staying cool with those settings and 6ml Statorade
[2022-03-12T02:32:13] rosheee: WAY
[2022-03-12T02:32:16] rosheee: Way 2 go
[2022-03-12T02:32:18] Unknown: Yup
[2022-03-12T02:32:27] Unknown: Lots of ways to go
[2022-03-12T02:32:38] Unknown: Especially on full charged battery

[2022-03-12T02:32:45] rosheee: Motors cool
[2022-03-12T02:33:04] Unknown: That's insane for 50mm magnet motors
[2022-03-12T02:33:14] rosheee: 50mm?
[2022-03-12T02:33:23] rosheee: Ah xD rly
[2022-03-12T02:33:25] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-12T02:33:44] Unknown: 50mm wide magnets. Not "Sucé" you know
[2022-03-12T02:33:45] rosheee: Outside temp max 35 degrees after 40min ride
[2022-03-12T02:33:54] rosheee: Last 4km uphill
[2022-03-12T02:34:04] rosheee: Full throttle
[2022-03-12T02:34:21] Unknown: Yup, Vsett 10 motors proving to be some real beasts
[2022-03-12T02:34:23] rosheee: Vsett say on the LE i can push 8kw each no prob
[2022-03-12T02:34:42] rosheee: So i try 10-12kw
[2022-03-12T02:34:52] Unknown: Battery again?
[2022-03-12T02:35:03] rosheee: There i use 17S6P 120A bms
[2022-03-12T02:35:12] rosheee: Not 16S5P 60A bms
[2022-03-12T02:35:14] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-12T02:35:26] Unknown: By battery is capable of 150a safe, BMS is 150a continuous and 300a burst
[2022-03-12T02:35:31] rosheee: But no ferrofluid
[2022-03-12T02:35:38] rosheee: Lol xD
[2022-03-12T02:35:47] rosheee: U ha e 9P
[2022-03-12T02:35:54] Unknown: And controllers are 150a batt 250a phase.. each
[2022-03-12T02:35:58] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-12T02:35:59] Unknown: Yup
[2022-03-12T02:36:06] rosheee: But u ha e space and openair cooling
[2022-03-12T02:36:17] Unknown: So my motors are my limiting factor
[2022-03-12T02:36:19] rosheee: <photos/photo_2953@12-03-2022_02-36-19.jpg>
[2022-03-12T02:36:24] rosheee: I have dis space xD
[2022-03-12T02:36:51] Unknown: Yes, controllers outside n air cooled, plus way big for application. They never get above ambient.
[2022-03-12T02:36:57] rosheee: But what i can tell u
[2022-03-12T02:37:08] rosheee: After 7.5k km at 135A max
[2022-03-12T02:37:15] rosheee: Before ferrofluid
[2022-03-12T02:37:40] rosheee: Motors looked pervert good inside..even @PaoloWu cant do the 0.05$
[2022-03-12T02:38:00] Unknown: That's unreal.
[2022-03-12T02:38:08] rosheee: Like new
[2022-03-12T02:38:36] Unknown: Like I said, beast motors for their size. Ferrofluid makes them even more beast.. or sucé lol
[2022-03-12T02:38:50] Unknown: Damn
[2022-03-12T02:38:56] rosheee: Yep and it is prooved that ferrofluid makes motors more potent
[2022-03-12T02:39:27] Unknown: I feel like that is true. Maybe increased magnetic field and increases amp saturation point
[2022-03-12T02:39:37] Unknown: ... 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-03-12T02:40:04] rosheee: Wait
[2022-03-12T02:40:18] Unknown: Saturation point is when more amps (batt or phase) don't provide more power basically
[2022-03-12T02:41:26] rosheee: @PurpleAmI found a pdf with more infos
[2022-03-12T02:41:38] rosheee: Hmm it does
[2022-03-12T02:41:57] rosheee: When i use 2x40A i have less everything
[2022-03-12T02:42:11] rosheee: On battery
[2022-03-12T02:42:16] rosheee: <sticker>

[2022-03-12T02:45:52] rosheee: Hmm
[2022-03-12T02:46:08] Unknown: Woah, that's a serious article. Will give it a read
[2022-03-12T02:46:21] rosheee: So should we find the perfect vdroop x boost value?
[2022-03-12T02:46:35] rosheee: Then i have to use 2x25A battery lol
[2022-03-12T02:46:42] rosheee: Or maybe even less
[2022-03-12T02:46:48] rosheee: 2x20A xD
[2022-03-12T02:46:52] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-12T02:47:25] rosheee: 5.3v
[2022-03-12T02:47:30] Martin Kaktits: I havent fully read the PDF's myself tho 😅 but there is something to it.
[2022-03-12T02:47:53] Martin Kaktits: like, more than placebo
[2022-03-12T02:48:13] Unknown: Well, it's about the battery config and cells used. Each cell has it's own characteristics for voltage drop at a certain discharge rate... My Samsung 48x cells are basically optimized for 10-17a discharge per cell with minimal voltage drop and maximum WH
[2022-03-12T02:48:41] rosheee: my 50G give 10A each cont. ^^'
[2022-03-12T02:48:52] rosheee: but they also deliver 175A 😆
[2022-03-12T02:48:58] Unknown: That's where Artem is master of figuring out which cell is perfect for each application
[2022-03-12T02:49:05] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-12T02:49:32] rosheee: yah new molicel with 4800mAh and 20A for 17S6P and 120A bms ^^
[2022-03-12T02:49:39] Unknown: Which is why I chose 48x... Maximum WH at 10-15a discharge and minimum voltage sag
[2022-03-12T02:49:58] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-03-12T02:50:12] Unknown: Not to mention 3000 cycle life 🤓
[2022-03-12T02:50:18] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-12T02:50:25] rosheee: i wonder how many my samsung 50g deliver
[2022-03-12T02:50:29] Unknown: So battery will out live me haha
[2022-03-12T02:50:41] Unknown: Ask Artem. He knows for sure
[2022-03-12T02:50:42] rosheee: xD
[2022-03-12T02:52:00] rosheee: rly? @artBula 1 year old samsung 50G 16S5P with 60A BMS always pushed ma retard until 12AWG runned that hot that it melted the heatshrink + isolation tape has over 7.5k km still delivers 67v max how long will it survive' take out peak 170-180A
[2022-03-12T02:53:59] rosheee: @artBula should i use 10 or 8 AWG to prevent melting?
[2022-03-12T02:59:01] rosheee: so 😆the vesc looks also very new

[2022-03-12T03:21:10] Unknown: That is so ridiculous. Who would ever ?!?
[2022-03-12T03:21:33] Unknown: Is that even for real?
[2022-03-12T03:21:39] Paolo ⁭: Idk
[2022-03-12T03:21:46] Paolo ⁭: I want know who made this
[2022-03-12T03:21:50] Unknown: I can't believe it is real
[2022-03-12T03:21:57] rosheee: looks ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:22:04] Unknown: 🤣🤣 so funny
[2022-03-12T03:22:10] rosheee: more gay than my g30's
[2022-03-12T03:22:15] Unknown: They should be slapped multiple times
[2022-03-12T03:22:46] rosheee: @PaoloWu price for it?
[2022-03-12T03:22:50] Unknown: I guess plenty of ground clearance
[2022-03-12T03:23:15] Unknown: That is seriously so funny to look at, I can't even take it
[2022-03-12T03:24:03] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:24:38] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_2958@12-03-2022_03-24-38.jpg>
[2022-03-12T03:25:07] rosheee: XD the speaker says more than the scooter
[2022-03-12T03:25:21] Unknown: People can't be serious right now
[2022-03-12T03:25:34] Unknown: Not sure about that 😂😸
[2022-03-12T03:25:57] Paolo ⁭: That’s mine shit
[2022-03-12T03:26:33] Unknown: I'm literally laughing out loud.. that is some serious horrendousness

[2022-03-12T03:26:53] Unknown: Controllers??
[2022-03-12T03:27:03] Unknown: Sabvoton? Kelly?
[2022-03-12T03:27:17] Paolo ⁭: Sabvoton
[2022-03-12T03:27:29] Paolo ⁭: Giant like vsett battery
[2022-03-12T03:27:33] Unknown: Beautiful. You're liking them?
[2022-03-12T03:27:59] Paolo ⁭: Power yes, size and weight no😂
[2022-03-12T03:28:06] Unknown: If my Nucs fail for some reason and I have to ever replace, Sabvoton is where I'm headed
[2022-03-12T03:28:15] Artem Bulashev: 2000 technically as most companies write it down to 80%, while 48x say 3000 down to 70%
[2022-03-12T03:28:23] Paolo ⁭: Running 120A continuos /350 phase and don’t exceed 27°C lol
[2022-03-12T03:28:24] Unknown: Hah, I see that. But... Air cooled
[2022-03-12T03:28:41] Artem Bulashev: I think official around 500 before 80%
[2022-03-12T03:28:58] Unknown: I believe that. Same here on my Nuc 12F's. Never exceed ambient mounted external
[2022-03-12T03:29:12] Unknown: 👌
[2022-03-12T03:29:29] Paolo ⁭: Finally no fireworks 😂
[2022-03-12T03:29:31] Unknown: But @roscheeee not official
[2022-03-12T03:29:34] Paolo ⁭: But I will install vesc
[2022-03-12T03:29:42] Unknown: Yea?? Which?
[2022-03-12T03:30:12] Unknown: ....Don't say Flipsky
[2022-03-12T03:30:46] Artem Bulashev: Using 1.6A/0.33C charge current with 242.5mA/0.05C cut-off and 4.85A/1C discharge with 2.5V cut-off after 1000 cycles the capacity should be ≥3880mAh (80% of std capacity).
[2022-03-12T03:31:14] Unknown: Under normal conditions
[2022-03-12T03:31:30] Unknown: @roscheeee = not normal conditions 🤣
[2022-03-12T03:31:35] rosheee: why
[2022-03-12T03:31:38] rosheee: using 8A charger
[2022-03-12T03:31:51] Paolo ⁭: Custom 300A phase
[2022-03-12T03:31:52] Unknown: Discharge? P?
[2022-03-12T03:31:59] rosheee: discharge?
[2022-03-12T03:32:05] Unknown: Oh right right.. 🥰
[2022-03-12T03:32:08] rosheee: ah for 16S5P i use fancy 3A
[2022-03-12T03:32:08] Unknown: Amps
[2022-03-12T03:32:09] Artem Bulashev: Charger
[2022-03-12T03:32:12] Paolo ⁭: 12F , then should be similar to nuc 12f
[2022-03-12T03:32:15] rosheee: for 17S i use 8A
[2022-03-12T03:32:24] rosheee: because the port can't do more ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:32:27] Paolo ⁭: Just better dissipation :)
[2022-03-12T03:32:39] Unknown: 👹 monster
[2022-03-12T03:32:51] Artem Bulashev: That’s per cell in P You have 5p of 50g right?
[2022-03-12T03:33:09] Unknown: 5p and 175a batt discharge??
[2022-03-12T03:33:36] rosheee: yes
[2022-03-12T03:33:52] Unknown: Or 71a X2 .... 142a discharge
[2022-03-12T03:33:58] rosheee: yes but
[2022-03-12T03:34:08] Artem Bulashev: Than 8a is normal charge for 1000 cycles
[2022-03-12T03:34:12] rosheee: <photos/photo_2960@12-03-2022_03-34-12.jpg>
[2022-03-12T03:34:15] Artem Bulashev: 1.6a per cell
[2022-03-12T03:34:23] rosheee: ah but i use 40T with 8A
[2022-03-12T03:34:26] rosheee: 50G with 3A ^^
[2022-03-12T03:34:40] Artem Bulashev: 5p?
[2022-03-12T03:34:50] Artem Bulashev: That’s easy for them
[2022-03-12T03:35:24] Artem Bulashev: They are rated 0.33c = 8a from 25ah battery
[2022-03-12T03:35:31] Paolo ⁭: When I need charge battery with 30A
[2022-03-12T03:35:32] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>

[2022-03-12T03:36:52] Unknown: 🙅‍♂
[2022-03-12T03:37:00] Artem Bulashev: Discharge kills it
[2022-03-12T03:37:00] Paolo ⁭: This is the limit of my house electrical capabilities ahhaha
[2022-03-12T03:37:04] Paolo ⁭: Max 3kw
[2022-03-12T03:37:12] Unknown: Exactly
[2022-03-12T03:37:16] Artem Bulashev: Will be lucky to get 400 cycles
[2022-03-12T03:37:27] Artem Bulashev: Before 75% capacity hold max
[2022-03-12T03:37:35] Unknown: That was my point... Not charging, but discharge
[2022-03-12T03:37:51] Artem Bulashev: But spikes don’t kill it that much of temp doesn’t rise
[2022-03-12T03:37:57] Artem Bulashev: Not the case clearly
[2022-03-12T03:38:19] Unknown: About V drop? Under massive load?
[2022-03-12T03:38:33] Unknown: Temp sure... But Voltage sag
[2022-03-12T03:39:00] Artem Bulashev: Voltage sag is proportional
[2022-03-12T03:39:32] Unknown: I know VESC protects LVC.. but still.. that much strain over time..
[2022-03-12T03:39:41] Artem Bulashev: Both come from IR and amps = watt lost as heat
[2022-03-12T03:40:42] Unknown: 🤔 so because LVC is protected, only concerned with cell temp?
[2022-03-12T03:40:52] Artem Bulashev: Usually 10% voltage drop is absolute most you want to have
[2022-03-12T03:41:17] Artem Bulashev: LVC?
[2022-03-12T03:41:20] Unknown: Hmm.. good to know..
[2022-03-12T03:41:34] Unknown: Low voltage cutoff. Won't allow cells to sag too low before protection
[2022-03-12T03:42:17] Artem Bulashev: If it sag to that level bellow 3v, you are really fucked 😄😄
[2022-03-12T03:42:28] Artem Bulashev: It should not sag that much
[2022-03-12T03:42:29] Unknown: LoL. This is true
[2022-03-12T03:42:36] rosheee: ofc it will
[2022-03-12T03:42:37] Artem Bulashev: From full
[2022-03-12T03:42:38] Unknown: Of course
[2022-03-12T03:42:47] rosheee: i changed to 46V ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:43:03] rosheee: before 41V ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:43:11] rosheee: but the real question is
[2022-03-12T03:43:17] rosheee: should i change the AWG CABLES?
[2022-03-12T03:43:20] rosheee: because they run hot
[2022-03-12T03:43:26] Artem Bulashev: Full 4.15-10= 3.75v that’s a ready a lot of strain means
[2022-03-12T03:43:27] rosheee: and melt the shrink
[2022-03-12T03:43:41] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-12T03:43:45] rosheee: this
[2022-03-12T03:43:49] rosheee: awg12 now
[2022-03-12T03:43:53] rosheee: so to awg 10 or 8?
[2022-03-12T03:43:54] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:44:06] Artem Bulashev: You may be missing 30% of right power there
[2022-03-12T03:44:07] rosheee: awg10 on vesc look good
[2022-03-12T03:44:14] rosheee: XD 30%?
[2022-03-12T03:44:16] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-12T03:44:18] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-03-12T03:44:25] rosheee: AWG10?
[2022-03-12T03:44:42] Artem Bulashev: How many amps?
[2022-03-12T03:44:54] rosheee: heatshrink melts at 135-145C
[2022-03-12T03:44:58] rosheee: so cables run that temp
[2022-03-12T03:45:04] rosheee: idk ^^' still same
[2022-03-12T03:45:08] Artem Bulashev: 😭
[2022-03-12T03:45:08] rosheee: maybe 2x 60 then

[2022-03-12T03:46:24] Artem Bulashev: If you push 150a
[2022-03-12T03:46:37] rosheee: with 17S i wanna go 2x90A for testing ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:46:43] rosheee: then i go down to 2x 70A
[2022-03-12T03:46:50] rosheee: ok 7AWG ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:46:58] Artem Bulashev: Ok dual 7awg

[2022-03-12T03:47:14] rosheee: 120A bms has AWG10
[2022-03-12T03:47:28] Artem Bulashev: Dual 10 awg
[2022-03-12T03:47:32] Artem Bulashev: ?

[2022-03-12T03:47:56] rosheee: awg6 has bms
[2022-03-12T03:48:04] Artem Bulashev: There we go
[2022-03-12T03:48:25] Artem Bulashev: 6awg single for 120a is good
[2022-03-12T03:48:50] Artem Bulashev: For 190 need dual 7awg ideally at least
[2022-03-12T03:48:54] rosheee: 60A bms has awg10 ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:49:07] Artem Bulashev: That’s ok
[2022-03-12T03:49:34] rosheee: and also awg6 for connector which is qs8
[2022-03-12T03:49:40] rosheee: the17s
[2022-03-12T03:49:48] Artem Bulashev: Battery degrade fast at temp above 70c
[2022-03-12T03:49:53] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-12T03:50:00] rosheee: but not in volt?
[2022-03-12T03:50:09] Artem Bulashev: Good for 150a
[2022-03-12T03:50:27] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-03-12T03:51:04] Artem Bulashev: Ideal pack doesn’t go above 40-45c max
[2022-03-12T03:51:10] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-12T03:51:17] rosheee: good i have smart bms on new one
[2022-03-12T03:51:26] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2022-03-12T03:51:28] rosheee: so 16S5P -> awg 10
[2022-03-12T03:51:39] rosheee: sry awg 6
[2022-03-12T03:51:42] rosheee: or 7
[2022-03-12T03:53:56] Artem Bulashev: It depend on load 120a 6 awg single or dual 9 awg min 190a dual 7awg
[2022-03-12T03:54:14] rosheee: ok ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:54:21] rosheee: damn
[2022-03-12T03:54:35] rosheee: better take awg 4-6 for future
[2022-03-12T03:54:49] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t matter if it is 10s10p or 20s4p. Wire needs to be correct for current it will carry
[2022-03-12T03:55:38] Artem Bulashev: Cells need to be up to the task as well as inter-series connections of course
[2022-03-12T03:56:48] rosheee: true ^^'
[2022-03-12T03:56:54] rosheee: forgive me
[2022-03-12T03:58:56] rosheee: but i've done something for safety ^^ bike steering now :D
[2022-03-12T03:59:19] rosheee: it's 1/3 longer
[2022-03-12T04:00:46] rosheee: g30 had 46cm steering ^^
[2022-03-12T04:01:27] rosheee: but now i need good throttle ^^'
[2022-03-12T04:09:13] Unknown: https://e-bikestuff.com/en/12-throttles I use these and like them a lot. They make right and left handed trigger throttles and thumb throttles
[2022-03-12T04:09:36] rosheee: are they direct?
[2022-03-12T04:09:38] Unknown: Left handed trigger throttle should be here soon for variable Regen to replace thumb throttle
[2022-03-12T04:09:51] Unknown: From Poland.. yes direct
[2022-03-12T04:09:58] rosheee: i mean when u push
[2022-03-12T04:10:05] rosheee: the one i got now has like 1cm deadzone ^^'
[2022-03-12T04:10:17] rosheee: the one before had like 1%
[2022-03-12T04:10:26] Unknown: Well, that depends on controller settings throttle v min and v max
[2022-03-12T04:10:54] Unknown: VESC has such settings I assume?
[2022-03-12T04:10:59] rosheee: i have set it
[2022-03-12T04:11:09] rosheee: maybe have to do with laptop
[2022-03-12T04:11:13] rosheee: because app sucks for mobile ^^'
[2022-03-12T04:11:17] Unknown: Throttle v min and v max plus throttle curve
[2022-03-12T04:11:37] Unknown: Should be able to set any throttle the way you desire it to be
[2022-03-12T04:11:50] rosheee: yeh i set it
[2022-03-12T04:12:02] rosheee: but ^^' yah maybe ..i try with laptop now
[2022-03-12T04:12:17] Unknown: So v min and v max will set endpoints, adjusting can decrease deadzone
[2022-03-12T04:12:46] Unknown: Type of throttle it is really shouldn't matter
[2022-03-12T04:13:07] rosheee: maYBE laptop works better than mobile app
[2022-03-12T04:13:20] rosheee: have to push like 0.5-1cm until something happens
[2022-03-12T04:29:13] rosheee: still
[2022-03-12T04:29:17] rosheee: -_-

[2022-03-12T12:17:54] Mirono escooters: Ive used 40t for a customers e-bike. Had to use copper for his power demands 😂
[2022-03-12T12:18:00] Mirono escooters: Best idea
[2022-03-12T12:18:16] Happy Giraffe: Should have no voltage sag under 50-60A load and deliver high capacity
[2022-03-12T12:18:34] Mirono escooters: Yea, théy got powa
[2022-03-12T12:18:45] Mirono escooters: I Like 50e for their capacity but u need a lot to stop sag
[2022-03-12T12:19:16] Happy Giraffe: And if I rewind motor later and put Turbonators etc it will be handy🌚 then can use Kelly for 6000w+😂
[2022-03-12T12:19:32] Happy Giraffe: 50E is similar sag to 35E I heard
[2022-03-12T12:19:42] Mirono escooters: Me going with flipsky 75100 on my e-bike 😏
[2022-03-12T12:20:06] Mirono escooters: That sound about right

[2022-03-12T12:42:51] Happy Giraffe: I rather hang a Lidl plastic bag with cells than pay 2x+ for 25% capacity😂
[2022-03-12T12:43:22] rosheee: xD?
[2022-03-12T12:43:46] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, usually not worth it
[2022-03-12T12:44:01] rosheee: yah for 6 euro per cell ^^'
[2022-03-12T12:44:14] Happy Giraffe: I could buy another battery to swap lol

[2022-03-12T12:45:52] Happy Giraffe: Compared to Xiaomi deck especially😂
[2022-03-12T13:03:21] Artem Bulashev: 75100 is pretty reliable I think, compare price to ubox single and decide 👌
[2022-03-12T13:06:59] Mirono escooters: Hehe finally someone
[2022-03-12T13:17:49] Oliver Eliasson: Ubox single is 220$ and then shipping and VAT. 75100 is 100$ VAT icluded from banggod
[2022-03-12T13:19:42] Mirono escooters: Yeap. Flipsky gang

[2022-03-12T14:13:02] Artem Bulashev: Typical price for good quality like 50g new 21700 is 5€
[2022-03-12T14:14:06] Artem Bulashev: Or just abit bellow
[2022-03-12T15:17:44] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if 40T vs Molicel P42A is worth it
[2022-03-12T15:18:04] sombre_enfant: 40t less €
[2022-03-12T15:18:05] Happy Giraffe: Which cell chemistry had longer life?
[2022-03-12T15:18:36] Happy Giraffe: 40T reclaimed is 3.2€😅

[2022-03-12T15:20:13] Happy Giraffe: Some cells get like 2000 cycles while Samsung chemistry does 400-600
[2022-03-12T15:20:37] sombre_enfant: Samsung are strong dw
[2022-03-12T15:21:02] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, especially at my lower amp pull. But still I plan to keep battery for 5 years
[2022-03-12T15:21:38] sombre_enfant: Then do big PP so u charge it less often
[2022-03-12T15:22:20] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, and if I get a bms with active balance so I can only charge to 95%
[2022-03-12T15:23:41] Happy Giraffe: Tbh I would go for 100A Daly basic bms as I see so many people have balance problems with their smartass bmses
[2022-03-12T15:24:17] Artem Bulashev: I can get you new at 4€

[2022-03-12T15:29:32] Artem Bulashev: What?
[2022-03-12T15:29:56] Artem Bulashev: Nkon has terrible prices for new cells usually
[2022-03-12T15:30:14] Mirono escooters: But always big stock and Europa. So that's nice
[2022-03-12T15:30:18] Mirono escooters: Not much competetion
[2022-03-12T15:31:18] Artem Bulashev: 🤷‍♂️ rarely there is a cell that suppliers don’t have at a lot better price lucky for me 😄
[2022-03-12T15:32:09] Artem Bulashev: 50s 50g P42a 40t 48x, 30T and 35E , MJ1 , 30Q, 20R , and BAK 18650cl Is what my suppliers keep stock normally
[2022-03-12T15:34:05] Happy Giraffe: Sombre has Suce methods for tax avoidance😂
[2022-03-12T15:35:56] Artem Bulashev: Ok unless price for new os 3.60€ (because tax is around 20%) it would not make sense still - I don’t think nkon ever had 3.6€ price for any 21700 of good brand model
[2022-03-12T15:36:25] Artem Bulashev: 40t 3.6€ with tax on nkon?
[2022-03-12T15:38:22] sombre_enfant: Shipped to a country without tax

[2022-03-12T19:37:39] Mirono escooters: Somone in Europa has a daly 16s to sell?
[2022-03-12T19:37:56] rosheee: Yes
[2022-03-12T19:38:04] rosheee: With 16S5P
[2022-03-12T19:38:05] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-12T19:57:31] Unknown: Check out JK BMS with active balancer. Multiple models with active balancing and you can set the S count, you don't need a specific "16S" type. I love mine and works really well. I have the 150a continuous discharge version but the smaller discharge versions are pretty damn small. Excellent build quality and working perfectly so far. If I was building another battery, I would absolutely use another JK
[2022-03-12T19:57:58] Mirono escooters: Problem is i need bms qukcn and customer wants daly
[2022-03-12T19:58:21] sombre_enfant: Bruh

[2022-03-12T20:19:11] Luis Magalhaes: Just do it
[2022-03-12T20:19:26] Luis Magalhaes: Or single in the rear for the weelie
[2022-03-12T20:19:28] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-03-12T20:22:26] Paolo ⁭: But I have no method hahah , no space in rear
[2022-03-12T20:29:42] Mirono escooters: I know myself good

[2022-03-13T02:40:04] rosheee: 240?
[2022-03-13T02:40:08] Happy Giraffe: Try 248 next and then compare against gps

[2022-03-13T02:47:28] Artem Bulashev: Try stand on scooter and hold the steering. Ask some some one to measure form hub center to floor
[2022-03-13T02:47:32] Artem Bulashev: *2
[2022-03-13T02:47:41] rosheee: yah
[2022-03-13T02:47:43] Artem Bulashev: That should be your accurate diameter.
[2022-03-13T02:47:50] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-13T02:47:56] Unknown: This circumference calculator is what I use but measuring actual tire and then deducting a few mm for tire compression should also work
[2022-03-13T02:48:09] Unknown: Again.... You're not alone 🤣😂
[2022-03-13T02:48:11] Artem Bulashev: Centrifugal forces may increase it abit so may have to set 2-4mm above that value
[2022-03-13T02:48:34] Unknown: Oh dang.. you so smart. Forgot about that factor.
[2022-03-13T02:48:41] Unknown: 🤦🏻

[2022-03-13T02:51:29] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-13T02:51:41] Artem Bulashev: They have same angular speed but distance traveled is larger the further away you are from the rotational center
[2022-03-13T02:51:42] Unknown: Wheel RPM vs bearing RPM
[2022-03-13T02:51:56] Artem Bulashev: Rpm is same
[2022-03-13T02:51:58] rosheee: now let them talk
[2022-03-13T02:52:05] Unknown: Trying to figure out proper bearing seal type based off bearing RPM
[2022-03-13T02:52:15] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-13T02:52:21] Artem Bulashev: Unless
[2022-03-13T02:52:26] Artem Bulashev: Bearing is slipping
[2022-03-13T02:52:47] rosheee: same rpm
[2022-03-13T02:52:49] Artem Bulashev: Heathy one should not have that much drag to do that
[2022-03-13T02:52:57] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-03-13T02:53:00] rosheee: he is right

[2022-03-13T02:53:23] Artem Bulashev: Merci
[2022-03-13T02:53:31] rosheee: i was drunk then and calulated the bearing -> outside tire then multiplicated
[2022-03-13T02:53:33] rosheee: get complicated
[2022-03-13T02:53:36] rosheee: then failorated
[2022-03-13T02:53:39] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-13T02:53:46] Artem Bulashev: Haha shit happens
[2022-03-13T02:53:52] Unknown: Hmm... So our bearing RPM is same as wheel RPM??
[2022-03-13T02:54:07] rosheee: yas
[2022-03-13T02:54:12] Unknown: Sorry my brain need things broken down... And yea, Saturday night.. little drink
[2022-03-13T02:54:19] rosheee: take a pen
[2022-03-13T02:54:34] Unknown: Yas Queen?
[2022-03-13T02:54:36] rosheee: and make a line from bearing .-> outside tire
[2022-03-13T02:54:38] rosheee: then u see xD
[2022-03-13T02:54:42] rosheee: the line stays
[2022-03-13T02:54:44] Artem Bulashev: Yeah don’t confuse angular speed with basically circumference per RPM
[2022-03-13T02:54:45] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-13T02:55:54] rosheee: so i gonna bleed the brake again then change the diameter @ vesc to 24.638 and go for a ride
[2022-03-13T02:56:08] rosheee: i take 1cm away
[2022-03-13T02:56:11] rosheee: so 23,638
[2022-03-13T02:56:22] rosheee: then i go for a ride
[2022-03-13T02:56:26] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-13T02:57:23] Artem Bulashev: 2 inch wheel spinning at 10rpm will have same rpm (rotation speed) as 10 inch wheel at 10 rpm. But 10 inch wheel will drive alot faster (cover more distance at the same time period)
[2022-03-13T02:57:49] Artem Bulashev: 👌👌
[2022-03-13T02:57:53] rosheee: and about the 50S should i take the 4800mAh molicel?
[2022-03-13T02:58:01] rosheee: i need the more range
[2022-03-13T02:58:11] rosheee: and 120A
[2022-03-13T02:58:18] rosheee: 6P
[2022-03-13T02:58:23] Artem Bulashev: How many amps you will be setting in battery limit
[2022-03-13T02:58:24] rosheee: may 7P fits
[2022-03-13T02:58:28] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-03-13T02:58:38] rosheee: with the 5P 50G i set 2x 65A now
[2022-03-13T02:59:02] Artem Bulashev: So you will have lower amps? 60*2?
[2022-03-13T02:59:10] rosheee: so here we see amps of 1 vesc
[2022-03-13T02:59:19] rosheee: <photos/photo_2971@13-03-2022_02-59-19.jpg>
[2022-03-13T02:59:21] rosheee: so we go over 80A
[2022-03-13T02:59:44] Artem Bulashev: Normal spikes
[2022-03-13T02:59:48] Artem Bulashev: Setting 65
[2022-03-13T02:59:49] rosheee: so for 2 we have this
[2022-03-13T02:59:50] rosheee: <photos/photo_2972@13-03-2022_02-59-50.jpg>
[2022-03-13T02:59:57] rosheee: yah but this is for 1
[2022-03-13T02:59:59] rosheee: *2
[2022-03-13T03:00:05] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-03-13T03:00:13] rosheee: with 60A bms lol
[2022-03-13T03:00:25] Artem Bulashev: If that is maximum than you have 120a target setting total
[2022-03-13T03:00:27] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-03-13T03:00:33] Artem Bulashev: 20amps per cell
[2022-03-13T03:00:36] rosheee: the bms has 120A
[2022-03-13T03:00:45] rosheee: i gonna try 2x90A for testing
[2022-03-13T03:00:45] Happy Giraffe: 50E cell😂😂😂😂
[2022-03-13T03:00:53] rosheee: 50G I USE NOW
[2022-03-13T03:00:55] rosheee: with 5P
[2022-03-13T03:01:00] rosheee: 10A
[2022-03-13T03:01:00] Happy Giraffe: Same crap😂
[2022-03-13T03:01:25] rosheee: that fucking voltage drop
[2022-03-13T03:01:32] rosheee: like floppy dick
[2022-03-13T03:01:39] rosheee: u wanna the fog
[2022-03-13T03:01:41] rosheee: but then
[2022-03-13T03:01:44] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-13T03:01:47] Happy Giraffe: Buy 40T atleast...they are super cheap atm
[2022-03-13T03:01:54] rosheee: the 17S has 40T
[2022-03-13T03:01:58] rosheee: 6X

[2022-03-13T03:02:23] Unknown: Yeahhhh. Proper high discharge cells and copper clad 🤌🤌
[2022-03-13T03:02:31] rosheee: the new one has copper x nickel
[2022-03-13T03:02:38] rosheee: BUT IT IS LOST
[2022-03-13T03:02:58] rosheee: <photos/photo_2973@13-03-2022_03-02-58.jpg>
[2022-03-13T03:03:04] Unknown: Nickel is so inferior for high discharge. Any copper helps tremendously
[2022-03-13T03:03:12] rosheee: <photos/photo_2974@13-03-2022_03-03-12.jpg>

[2022-03-13T03:03:23] Unknown: Nice man
[2022-03-13T03:03:30] rosheee: but THE FUCKERIA UPS
[2022-03-13T03:03:33] Happy Giraffe: I might have to do copper aswell😳 especially if I go full retard later on with rewound motor
[2022-03-13T03:03:53] rosheee: <photos/photo_2975@13-03-2022_03-03-53.jpg>
[2022-03-13T03:03:54] Unknown: Yup. Future proof
[2022-03-13T03:04:17] Unknown: 🙄
[2022-03-13T03:04:30] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-13T03:04:41] Happy Giraffe: 8p 40T would be lovely😍 compared to 6p 35E
[2022-03-13T03:05:21] Unknown: We must remember, it's not only current carrying capacity of the series material used but voltage sag and heat is a huge factor as well. Copper will have less sag than nickel even if Nickel is adequate for amps pulled
[2022-03-13T03:05:25] Unknown: Less resistance
[2022-03-13T03:05:54] rosheee: <photos/photo_2976@13-03-2022_03-05-54.jpg>
[2022-03-13T03:05:54] Unknown: Also copper acts as a heatsink to the cells where Nickel acts as an insulator
[2022-03-13T03:05:58] Happy Giraffe: Copper = bling bling
[2022-03-13T03:06:05] rosheee: cheaper than nickel
[2022-03-13T03:06:27] Unknown: Always. Would never build a battery using Nickel only knowing what I know now and seeing results of new battery
[2022-03-13T03:06:33] Happy Giraffe: Yes, I like efficient setups
[2022-03-13T03:06:36] rosheee: <photos/photo_2977@13-03-2022_03-06-36.jpg>

[2022-03-13T03:06:58] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-13T03:07:27] Unknown: Nickel is still 75x more expensive than copper
[2022-03-13T03:07:32] Unknown: 🤣🤣
[2022-03-13T03:07:40] rosheee: when my dad told me that
[2022-03-13T03:07:49] rosheee: "they stopped trading @ wallstreet "
[2022-03-13T03:08:01] rosheee: so i go down
[2022-03-13T03:08:04] rosheee: to the fapcave
[2022-03-13T03:08:04] Unknown: Literally have $150 worth of nickel sitting in my basement that I didn't use. Copper used cost me 20 bucks
[2022-03-13T03:09:21] Happy Giraffe: I never thought nickel would be this crazy expensive but it ofc has different properties
[2022-03-13T03:09:45] Unknown: Copper vs Nickel resistance is similar to connector types.
[2022-03-13T03:10:04] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-13T03:10:14] Unknown: Pure Nickel is insanely expensive. Pure copper is not
[2022-03-13T03:10:15] rosheee: russia is the #1 nickel blaster b0ss
[2022-03-13T03:10:22] rosheee: the biggest of the D'S

[2022-03-13T03:10:35] Unknown: Soooo... Copper for the win LoL
[2022-03-13T03:10:36] Paolo ⁭: Old price
[2022-03-13T03:10:37] Artem Bulashev: 50g in 6p could do okey. 50s would be about 15% more wh at 15-20a current
[2022-03-13T03:10:44] Paolo ⁭: Actual price
[2022-03-13T03:10:45] Artem Bulashev: 50g at 5p no shit
[2022-03-13T03:10:46] Paolo ⁭: Suce
[2022-03-13T03:10:46] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-13T03:10:51] Artem Bulashev: Will be bad

[2022-03-13T03:11:27] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-03-13T03:11:28] rosheee: ya now u know who "put-in"
[2022-03-13T03:11:34] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-13T03:11:37] Unknown: Nickel sucks shit. Why use when copper is obviously better in all aspects. Also thinner copper needed, so forms to positive cell tips much easier
[2022-03-13T03:11:41] Paolo ⁭: But I have big reserve of copper xd
[2022-03-13T03:12:19] Unknown: .2 nickel=.8 copper. Copper has 4X current carrying capacity and over 4X less resistance

[2022-03-13T03:12:54] Unknown: Impressed 🤌
[2022-03-13T03:13:57] Unknown: Malectrics V4 or K-Weld can easily weld .15 copper with nickel tabs. So, why not use it?
[2022-03-13T03:14:22] Unknown: In my opinion, Nickel is a thing of the past.
[2022-03-13T03:14:43] Happy Giraffe: Whats .15 in non footballfield burger units?
[2022-03-13T03:14:49] Unknown: Only used because it welds easily
[2022-03-13T03:15:04] rosheee: So what shpuld i set?
[2022-03-13T03:15:08] Unknown: .15mm, thickness
[2022-03-13T03:15:28] rosheee: This?
[2022-03-13T03:15:47] Unknown: I used .1 copper with .1 nickel plated steel tabs as welding aids. Malectrics V4 at 30ms. No heat to cells at all
[2022-03-13T03:15:52] Happy Giraffe: Oh, you actually meant mm my bad. What thickness would you do for 100A max pack?
[2022-03-13T03:16:06] Unknown: What P?
[2022-03-13T03:16:14] Happy Giraffe: Like 16s8p 40T
[2022-03-13T03:16:25] Unknown: .1 copper absolutely more than enough
[2022-03-13T03:16:28] Unknown: Sec...

[2022-03-13T03:17:02] rosheee: I go for testride
[2022-03-13T03:17:03] Unknown: Look at same size Nickel vs copper ampacity and resistance
[2022-03-13T03:17:19] Unknown: Difference is amazing
[2022-03-13T03:17:58] Unknown: Lucky bastard. Snowing here with 3 inches on the ground and about 20F ambient 🙄🙄🙄
[2022-03-13T03:18:04] Unknown: Wish I could go for ride
[2022-03-13T03:18:18] Happy Giraffe: 😳
[2022-03-13T03:18:31] Unknown: Yup... Believe it
[2022-03-13T03:18:49] Happy Giraffe: Thats why my ebike will have studded 29"tires for winter😉
[2022-03-13T03:18:57] Unknown: Nickel is used because it's easy to weld. End of story
[2022-03-13T03:19:06] Unknown: 🥰🥰
[2022-03-13T03:19:30] Unknown: It's easy to weld because it has sooo much resistance, which we do not want
[2022-03-13T03:19:57] Happy Giraffe: Counter productive I see
[2022-03-13T03:20:27] rosheee: Omg
[2022-03-13T03:20:36] Happy Giraffe: Heats fast for easy welding...heats fast...oh fuck...
[2022-03-13T03:20:37] rosheee: When u press full throttle in the basement
[2022-03-13T03:20:44] rosheee: <photos/photo_2983@13-03-2022_03-20-44.jpg>
[2022-03-13T03:21:14] Unknown: 10mm x .1 copper is 15a continuous and 16.8mohm resistance. 10mm x .1 nickel is 4.1a continuous and 69.8 mohm resistance
[2022-03-13T03:21:24] Unknown: Exactly man
[2022-03-13T03:21:56] Happy Giraffe: How didnt people think of this lol
[2022-03-13T03:22:14] Unknown: They have. Which is why Nickel is becoming obsolete
[2022-03-13T03:22:43] Happy Giraffe: Only for jewellery then I guess
[2022-03-13T03:23:07] Unknown: And copper is so so so much cheaper. And readily available. And... When you buy nickel, you pray it's pure. Copper is rated and is sold as pure or as an alloy which is clearly noted
[2022-03-13T03:23:55] Unknown: So the decision is a no brainer in my opinion. Even if building a low amp draw battery, voltage sag and heat generated will be much lower
[2022-03-13T03:24:49] Happy Giraffe: Low amp batts are smaller and usually in similar loads aswell🤔
[2022-03-13T03:24:57] Unknown: It is literally a no-brainer. Unless buying a mass produced china battery where you get what they give you, I would always use copper over Nickel
[2022-03-13T03:25:11] Unknown: This is very true. Even more reason
[2022-03-13T03:25:28] Happy Giraffe: I defo do the battery from copper now
[2022-03-13T03:25:53] Unknown: Use nickel or Nickel plated steel tabs for welding aids like this...
[2022-03-13T03:26:20] Happy Giraffe: Then need a better connector than xt90 I guess for later but thats a story for another day. Could use an awg 8 cable
[2022-03-13T03:27:00] Happy Giraffe: Like this?

[2022-03-13T03:27:12] Unknown: Yup, exactly
[2022-03-13T03:27:27] Happy Giraffe: This looks so sick😁
[2022-03-13T03:27:49] Unknown: Infinite slot helps. Using nickel plated steel tabs helps even more because she'll is super resistive, more than pure nickel
[2022-03-13T03:29:03] Unknown: Infinite slot is using 2 pieces with a welding probe on each separate piece, welding heat goes down into cell tip better rather than shooting/travelling across one solid piece of metal
[2022-03-13T03:30:15] rosheee: So i ho testing
[2022-03-13T03:30:21] Unknown: I used nickel plated steel tabs. Still protected from oxidation due to the nickel plating and steel allows welder to use much less energy/heat to cells
[2022-03-13T03:30:55] Happy Giraffe: I see, cell->copper->nickel plated steel cut in half separation
[2022-03-13T03:31:29] Unknown: Exactly. Low weld temps needed to achieve consistent and solid welds from copper to cell tips
[2022-03-13T03:31:47] Unknown: I literally was ripping the copper trying to pry it from the cell tips
[2022-03-13T03:32:00] Paolo ⁭: I have bad experiences with steel 🤮
[2022-03-13T03:32:07] Happy Giraffe: I could even get my copper plates laser cutted😳
[2022-03-13T03:32:17] Unknown: It's not steel man. It's nickel plated
[2022-03-13T03:32:17] Happy Giraffe: Gonna be super sexy
[2022-03-13T03:32:41] Unknown: It's steel but plated with nickel. You got sold some junk, steel only
[2022-03-13T03:33:15] Paolo ⁭: I know, but as the same when have a little humidity it will become shit
[2022-03-13T03:33:15] Happy Giraffe: Because without nickel copper eats steel?
[2022-03-13T03:33:18] Unknown: I saw your picture of rusted ass steel. Nickel plated steel will not corrode like that
[2022-03-13T03:33:26] Unknown: Not nickel plated

[2022-03-13T03:33:51] Unknown: That's junk and used as primary series connections
[2022-03-13T03:34:06] Unknown: Proper nickel plated steel will not corrode
[2022-03-13T03:35:00] Happy Giraffe: Paolo after getting cell rusted
[2022-03-13T03:35:13] Unknown: All metal should always be protected from elements anyways. Proper nickel plated steel "tabs" will not corrode
[2022-03-13T03:35:45] Unknown: Main material used is copper. The Nickel plated steel is only used as tiny tabs to aid welding
[2022-03-13T03:36:50] Unknown: You got sold some bunk steel and it corroded. That series connection probably has a 2a current carrying capacity at most. Not to be confused with proper nickel plated material
[2022-03-13T03:37:06] Paolo ⁭: Those are nickel plated
[2022-03-13T03:37:11] Happy Giraffe: Thanks for all the info! I go catch some Zs
[2022-03-13T03:37:14] Unknown: Says who?
[2022-03-13T03:37:25] Unknown: AliExpress seller? 😂
[2022-03-13T03:37:43] Unknown: Nickel doesn't corrode or oxidize like that
[2022-03-13T03:38:11] Unknown: Even nickel plated
[2022-03-13T03:38:24] Paolo ⁭: you only have a few microns of nickel, the rest is all iron
[2022-03-13T03:39:08] Unknown: That's all that's needed to protect top layer. Plus, all metal connections should always be protected from elements with kapton/fish paper.
[2022-03-13T03:39:19] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-03-13T03:39:23] Unknown: So even if it was pure steel, it would never see elements
[2022-03-13T03:39:56] Unknown: Guys are nickel plating their copper at home DIY in same fashion.
[2022-03-13T03:42:21] Unknown: With this type of protection, how will "steel" ever see elements to corrode?

[2022-03-13T03:43:49] Unknown: Never. Won't happen. Plus steel tabs are nickel plated. Thickness of nickel doesn't matter. They're protected. Nickel plating doesn't wear away over time
[2022-03-13T03:46:23] Unknown: Using steel only (probably not even plated) as main series connections (bad in and of itself) and not having the metal protected can lead what your picture shows. Using properly plated steel and only as "welding tabs" and then protecting from elements with insulation, that will not happen
[2022-03-13T03:46:37] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-03-13T03:46:42] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3003@13-03-2022_03-46-42.jpg>
[2022-03-13T03:47:01] Unknown: LoL. Not even the same comparison man
[2022-03-13T03:47:19] Unknown: You have heaps of steel
[2022-03-13T03:47:38] Paolo ⁭: That’s nickel plated
[2022-03-13T03:48:27] Paolo ⁭: Anyway I prefer pure nickel xd
[2022-03-13T03:48:35] Unknown: How protected from elements? I highly doubt my tiny little plated tabs that are protected with layers and layers of insulation will ever see this
[2022-03-13T03:49:02] Unknown: I get that. Just saying plated steel is a better welding aid for copper than pure nickel
[2022-03-13T03:49:17] Unknown: Due to it's insanely high resistance
[2022-03-13T03:49:49] Paolo ⁭: And insanely sparks lol
[2022-03-13T03:49:58] Unknown: And if it's protected with insulation, elements will not be able to corrode
[2022-03-13T03:50:48] Unknown: With steel yup. PROPERLY nickel plated steel I barely had any spark at all on over 3000 welds
[2022-03-13T03:52:17] Paolo ⁭: My methods work better than all😪 solder paste (for smd use) and then spot weld
[2022-03-13T03:52:31] Unknown: When you buy "pure nickel" and are given some bullshit steel, it's usually not plated, or plated properly. When you buy "nickel plated steel" it is usually plated properly. Something tells me you wouldn't have build that battery with plated steel and were sold some bunk metal they were advertising as pure nickel
[2022-03-13T03:52:37] Paolo ⁭: Directly on copper and need very low current
[2022-03-13T03:53:46] Unknown: Resistance soldering. Works well for sure
[2022-03-13T03:54:36] Unknown: So that's not really a good measure to go by
[2022-03-13T03:54:52] Unknown: Who knows what the hell metal/alloy that was
[2022-03-13T03:56:19] Paolo ⁭: That plated not pure nickel
[2022-03-13T04:02:06] Paolo ⁭: Also, is easy to know if is plated or only steel. If you can solder with tin , then its plated. Pure iron don’t stick with tin
[2022-03-13T04:02:36] Paolo ⁭: For know if is pure nickel or not it’s easy
[2022-03-13T04:04:34] Paolo ⁭: The problem isn’t the battery pack, you should see your battery box how is sealed, and if you drive when it rains outside
[2022-03-13T04:04:46] Unknown: Yea it's easy to know it's it's pure or not, salt water test.. I soldered easily to my 'plated' material, so definitely plated. I don't think any type of nickel plated material will corrode or oxidize as your pictures show it has.
[2022-03-13T04:04:56] Unknown: That's exactly right...
[2022-03-13T04:05:35] Unknown: What I'm saying is any series connections (or welding tabs) should be protected from elements anyways. So even if pure steel, should never be exposed to moisturize or even oxygen
[2022-03-13T04:06:19] Unknown: Should completely sealed with insulation
[2022-03-13T04:07:29] Unknown: My finished battery is wrapped fully with layers and layers of kapton tape and fish paper, which seal off the metals themselves from any outside elements
[2022-03-13T04:08:06] Unknown: Series connections should never see or feel outside elements
[2022-03-13T04:08:50] Unknown: .... Which is why I'm confused. Riding in the rain.... Actual battery connections should still never get moist or wet
[2022-03-13T04:09:23] Unknown: If they do, you didn't insulate your battery enough
[2022-03-13T04:10:14] Unknown: My finished battery is 1000% sealed to outside elements, as should every battery be
[2022-03-13T04:32:23] Paolo ⁭: 👎

[2022-03-13T21:46:04] Paolo ⁭: Sync power 2600
[2022-03-13T22:21:56] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-13T22:31:20] Oliver Eliasson: What a can those handle? Or the battery, its 6p right?
[2022-03-13T23:42:16] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-03-13T23:42:34] Artem Bulashev: DynoVolt 2600mah
[2022-03-13T23:42:44] Mirono escooters: Oef that ssmzll
[2022-03-13T23:43:00] Artem Bulashev: That’s in smallest battery
[2022-03-13T23:43:05] Artem Bulashev: Cheapest
[2022-03-13T23:43:19] Artem Bulashev: Mid range and high range are lg mh1 and lg mj1
[2022-03-13T23:43:36] Mirono escooters: Aha oki
[2022-03-13T23:43:44] Artem Bulashev: Those Dynovolts are f great
[2022-03-13T23:44:06] Artem Bulashev: They 5p = 13ah handles 40amps and only get a bit warm, that’s 3C.
[2022-03-13T23:44:51] Paolo ⁭: It’s the same, they have one only manufacturer in China
[2022-03-13T23:45:27] Paolo ⁭: Kaabo vsett blade in their standard pack import cells all from this factory
[2022-03-13T23:46:11] Artem Bulashev: Ok markings were DynoVolt that’s why
[2022-03-13T23:46:17] Artem Bulashev: Thanks for info
[2022-03-13T23:46:26] Artem Bulashev: Don’t know about other brands
[2022-03-13T23:47:09] Paolo ⁭: Yes I’m confused with pack manufacturer name
[2022-03-13T23:53:43] Artem Bulashev: Btw
[2022-03-13T23:53:57] Artem Bulashev: BAK has their own manufacturing
[2022-03-13T23:55:43] Paolo ⁭: Yes but isn’t used in escooter as default pack
[2022-03-13T23:58:48] Artem Bulashev: Apollo also uses DynaVolt that’s the only other scooter I know, but would make sense that Zero uses same as vsett 👌 any way, good cells for up to 3.5C max. Low capacity though
[2022-03-14T00:43:03] Oliver Eliasson: But that means that vsett 8 could handle 40a battery? What can vsett 8 motor handle? 25-30?
[2022-03-14T00:50:28] Artem Bulashev: With stock controllers they are maxed out
[2022-03-14T00:50:40] Artem Bulashev: They get hot on long rides in summer already
[2022-03-14T00:51:03] Artem Bulashev: Well rather warm. I would not advise pushing more amps into them.
[2022-03-14T00:51:14] Oliver Eliasson: Okey, so flipsky 75100 would not give any more power?
[2022-03-14T00:51:21] Artem Bulashev: It would
[2022-03-14T00:51:24] Artem Bulashev: It is foc
[2022-03-14T00:51:31] Artem Bulashev: It drives motor more efficient
[2022-03-14T00:51:50] Artem Bulashev: So you can push 30amps battery and may be 90a phase
[2022-03-14T00:52:06] Artem Bulashev: I think it is is about same as vsett9 motor wise
[2022-03-14T00:52:23] Artem Bulashev: So similar limits as I told you for vsett 9 motor
[2022-03-14T00:54:10] Oliver Eliasson: Okey, haven’t tested vsett 9 with only one motor and foc. Would you feel a big increase in performance or barely noticeable?
[2022-03-14T01:14:25] Artem Bulashev: Have not tested one wheel
[2022-03-14T01:16:03] Artem Bulashev: I explained before how Battery and Phase current relate. So you would only extend up until what speed you have full phase current (full acceleration ) than battery limit would kick in and phase current would start to be reduced as RPM increases
[2022-03-14T01:16:40] Artem Bulashev: It’s not same as normal controllers work (they don’t control / measure phase current)

[2022-03-14T01:18:07] Unknown: Haha 😆. They helped me understand the relationship quite a bit
[2022-03-14T01:18:28] Oliver Eliasson: How do i calculate speed/rpm/volts etc? Or is it diffrent for diffrent motors?
[2022-03-14T01:31:26] Paolo ⁭: Motors normally are classified by Kv but not any productor declare those data
[2022-03-14T01:34:20] Artem Bulashev: Kv is basically RPM per 1 volt on motor 0 rpm spinning = 0v Than as you drive faster voltage that motor has increases aim accordance to Kv (it is a fixed ratio basically)
[2022-03-14T01:36:25] Artem Bulashev: Speed is deduced from rpm speed * wheel circumference
[2022-03-14T01:37:12] Artem Bulashev: At maximum RPM (In the air) motor voltage will be nearly equal to battery voltage level
[2022-03-14T01:38:28] Artem Bulashev: Under loads phase amps are pushing motor to get as close as possible to that max rpm that it has free spinning in the air.
[2022-03-14T01:39:01] Artem Bulashev: Thats why to gain max speed most effective way is to increase battery voltage and not how many amps you push into motor
[2022-03-14T01:40:40] Unknown: So in the simplest terms possible (and not necessarily an accurate measure, just generally) voltage equals speed and amps equals acceleration...?
[2022-03-14T01:41:32] Unknown: Amps push the motor (acceleration) until highest voltage is achieved (top speed) ..?
[2022-03-14T01:46:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeah sort of with additional aspects but in essence yes
[2022-03-14T01:46:54] Paolo ⁭: Not really, that depends very much by motor . When you have a high Kv motor with higher amps you will have more effect than higher voltage
[2022-03-14T01:47:30] Artem Bulashev: Didn’t understand you there
[2022-03-14T01:47:46] Artem Bulashev: Can you re phrase ?
[2022-03-14T01:48:04] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-03-14T01:49:22] Paolo ⁭: If you have a 50Kv motor, and controller is 30A , if you increase battery voltage you will have a little higher speed, with a 80A controller then more current, you will have much more speed
[2022-03-14T01:50:14] Artem Bulashev: On road?
[2022-03-14T01:50:26] Luis Magalhaes: No torque no fun in high kv😂
[2022-03-14T01:50:28] Artem Bulashev: In the air speed will be almost same (may be abit faster
[2022-03-14T01:50:35] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-03-14T01:50:43] Artem Bulashev: So I was correct than
[2022-03-14T01:50:57] Artem Bulashev: Max rpm in the air is voltage
[2022-03-14T01:51:11] Artem Bulashev: And at max rpm you motor voltage will be almost equal to battery voltage
[2022-03-14T01:51:31] Artem Bulashev: On road amps push motor as close as possible to max rpm
[2022-03-14T01:52:32] Artem Bulashev: If - air max speed 50kmh - on road with 30a you get 48kmh Than increasing to 80a will not do anything, they mostly won’t even be used because of motor saturation - you can’t push speed of the motor on road above freewheeling speed in the air by amps
[2022-03-14T01:54:18] Artem Bulashev: But if on road you get only 30km with 30amps than sure increasing to 80amps would allow you to get much closer to max rpm speed of 50kmh
[2022-03-14T02:01:17] Happy Giraffe: Ferrofluid?
[2022-03-14T02:03:02] Happy Giraffe: With backwind its better😂
[2022-03-14T02:03:55] Happy Giraffe: Scooter is least aerodynamic vehicle, car is way more aerodynamic than us and bikes
[2022-03-14T02:04:55] Paolo ⁭: Use it in hyperloop tunnel
[2022-03-14T02:05:03] Paolo ⁭: No aerodynamic 😂
[2022-03-14T02:06:37] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-14T02:11:38] Artem Bulashev: Sure with such will be able to get a lot better results
[2022-03-14T02:12:14] Happy Giraffe: Why doesnt he put ferrofluid and then flipsky? Then could add some amps🤔
[2022-03-14T02:59:30] Unknown: I think every motor can benefit from ferrofluid. Wether it's "needed" or not, more amps can be used or lower temps can be sustained (longer motor life). Either way is a win win, no?
[2022-03-14T03:00:43] Paolo ⁭: Oil > ferrofluid
[2022-03-14T03:02:03] Happy Giraffe: Motor reaches steady state quite slowly so ferrofluid definitely should go in every motor to dissipate heat more in my opinion. I will definitely use it
[2022-03-14T03:02:59] Happy Giraffe: On winter tho not a problem as 15 minute stop makes motor mass all 0°c so nothing will make it hot after that😅
[2022-03-14T03:05:17] Unknown: Could. But oil is messy as hell. Ferrofluid only sticks to magnets and is easily wiped off
[2022-03-14T03:05:42] Unknown: Why use oil when there's ferrofluid?
[2022-03-14T03:08:21] Paolo ⁭: Cost less, better power distribution
[2022-03-14T03:27:15] Artem Bulashev: Messy, drops every where and shit inside
[2022-03-14T03:28:41] Artem Bulashev: Agree
[2022-03-14T03:48:36] Unknown: With the motors and controllers you're using and posting, something tells me "cost" isn't your priority on a $50 bottle of ferrofluid 🤣🤣
[2022-03-14T05:49:31] Oliver Eliasson: Im planning on putting ferrofluid and tempsensor in my motor but this was for a friend with a broken vsett 8. Thats why i only want to change the controller, less work.
[2022-03-14T09:11:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Snaps easy in overforce when there is lot washers also material of those is not too Strong
[2022-03-14T09:17:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All Chinese scoots are like this , some reduces power till its hot ,coz they didn't heard about heat bridging ,also all is some lowest quality alloy box what keeps heat ,sooo
[2022-03-14T09:17:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Probably yes, but would remove box still
[2022-03-14T09:18:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you know. Vsett bms limit?
[2022-03-14T09:23:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends on what you like as fun ,low speed torque or high speed
[2022-03-14T09:24:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also you can play with curve
[2022-03-14T09:28:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ferrofluid if you can bridge heat , than problems starts again like They paint engine's while they should not, powder paint even worse Oil cools because its much more ,and its also resistance, but you need 0w0
[2022-03-14T09:31:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also for oil you need sealed engine , ferrofluid will stay in gaps ,but Time to time if goes 🤔deeper so you need to re add after some time
[2022-03-14T09:31:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you pre overfill doesnt help
[2022-03-14T09:32:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Deeper means they suck back under the magnet thanks to spin, probably thats not gapless as fixed
[2022-03-14T11:19:48] Artem Bulashev: Some people claim there was change from change only to full BMS with 60a nominal
[2022-03-14T11:50:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe you have any idea of inokim oxo bms discharge max?
[2022-03-14T11:58:35] Artem Bulashev: No sorry
[2022-03-14T11:58:51] Artem Bulashev: Only that they use same Chinese cells manufacturer
[2022-03-14T12:05:00] Oliver Eliasson: Can you connect two 75100 together or is it better to use a dual? Is there a dual at the same price as 2 75100? 200€
[2022-03-14T12:05:30] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2022-03-14T12:06:35] Oliver Eliasson: You use can?
[2022-03-14T12:50:20] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-14T14:43:24] Luis Magalhaes: Or you can put high amps 😂
[2022-03-14T14:44:31] Paolo ⁭: Ive a scooter with high torque motor. 35kmh max 60v full charge 😂 50mm magnet 30A controller
[2022-03-14T14:46:55] Artem Bulashev: Wow
[2022-03-14T14:47:05] Artem Bulashev: 35kmh on road? Or air?
[2022-03-14T14:47:17] Artem Bulashev: That’s very low Kv
[2022-03-14T14:47:19] Paolo ⁭: air
[2022-03-14T14:47:26] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-03-14T14:47:31] Artem Bulashev: Traktor
[2022-03-14T14:47:41] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2022-03-14T14:47:51] Paolo ⁭: For who not happy about torque
[2022-03-14T14:48:00] Paolo ⁭: It’s for single motor
[2022-03-14T14:48:14] Paolo ⁭: Blade 10 no torque in single
[2022-03-14T14:48:17] Luis Magalhaes: Dam 😂 thats 2seconda scary
[2022-03-14T14:48:30] Luis Magalhaes: Dam low
[2022-03-14T14:49:15] Luis Magalhaes: So wheelie machine? 😂
[2022-03-14T14:50:39] Paolo ⁭: Lol
[2022-03-14T14:50:50] Paolo ⁭: I need try with 20s 50A that motor 😂
[2022-03-14T14:51:27] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-03-14T15:34:05] Happy Giraffe: With 140A there is🌚
[2022-03-14T15:34:31] Happy Giraffe: Low kv will burn easy be careful😅
[2022-03-14T15:34:56] Happy Giraffe: In denmark there is no hill I cant go above 35kmh with one blade motor
[2022-03-14T15:37:11] Paolo ⁭: Yes but I mean with stock blade controller (60v 30A)
[2022-03-14T15:37:27] Happy Giraffe: Sure
[2022-03-14T15:38:04] Paolo ⁭: You have more efficiency
[2022-03-14T15:38:07] Paolo ⁭: Anyway useless in Italy
[2022-03-14T15:38:09] Happy Giraffe: High kv should be used with high current anyways. I think the motor can take 160-180A peak
[2022-03-14T15:38:10] Paolo ⁭: Max 20kmh
[2022-03-14T15:38:27] Paolo ⁭: Then better get power as bigger toruqe
[2022-03-14T15:39:12] Happy Giraffe: Lov kv isnt worth it because acceleration lasts 4 seconds🤔 then the motor has higher resistance and less efficiency at high cruising speed
[2022-03-14T15:39:34] Happy Giraffe: But sure for 20kmh better have lowest kv with 35kmh maxspeed
[2022-03-14T15:40:15] Happy Giraffe: I will experiment with the ebike motor, will get 7kv and then 9-10kv to see how they handle
[2022-03-14T16:09:10] rosheee: @Star_Delta_Master can do 100m sheeliewheelie
[2022-03-14T16:34:17] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-03-14T16:35:38] Luis Magalhaes: 💪, i can do 10m if face on floor 😂😂😂
[2022-03-14T16:36:36] Luis Magalhaes: Its a small wheel when you go up are almost passing the equilibrium point 😂
[2022-03-14T17:02:46] Artem Bulashev: All motors have efficiency range in the middle
[2022-03-14T17:02:59] Artem Bulashev: Kv just define where that middle is
[2022-03-14T17:04:32] Happy Giraffe: I think its more like in the 80%
[2022-03-14T17:04:42] Happy Giraffe: Based on simulations on Grin
[2022-03-14T17:04:49] Artem Bulashev: That’s why you want to have motor that has top speed enough for you and 25% than you typical speed range. For example for me typical 30-45kmh. So for me 57kmh motor (under load) is perfect from balance perspective (torque / speed / efficiency)
[2022-03-14T17:05:04] Artem Bulashev: ? Can you elaborate ?
[2022-03-14T17:05:23] Happy Giraffe: I shared the motor simulations here in pictures, I can try to find them
[2022-03-14T17:05:39] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_2944@11-03-2022_17-08-47.jpg>
[2022-03-14T17:06:12] Happy Giraffe: But motor efficiency and power efficiency (wh/km) is different things
[2022-03-14T17:06:46] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3016@14-03-2022_17-06-46.jpg>
[2022-03-14T17:07:06] Happy Giraffe: When motor is most efficient the air resistance is multiple times already so have to find happy medium
[2022-03-14T17:07:20] Artem Bulashev: Peak efficiency 45-55kmh when top speed is 65kmh
[2022-03-14T17:07:32] Happy Giraffe: Yep
[2022-03-14T17:07:34] Artem Bulashev: Intersting
[2022-03-14T17:07:48] Artem Bulashev: I would guess it would be lower in rpm range
[2022-03-14T17:08:04] Happy Giraffe: But air resistance at 45kmh is multiple compared to 25kmh
[2022-03-14T17:08:39] Happy Giraffe: So motor efficiency =/= battery usage efficiency
[2022-03-14T17:09:18] Happy Giraffe: Im trying to understand flux and magnet resistance next but will need some time
[2022-03-14T17:09:44] Artem Bulashev: So than most efficiency rpm is around -20% from max speed
[2022-03-14T17:09:47] Happy Giraffe: Btw, have you measured your average wh/km?
[2022-03-14T17:09:54] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-03-14T17:09:54] Happy Giraffe: Yes for motor
[2022-03-14T17:10:04] Artem Bulashev: Motor efficiency I should have said
[2022-03-14T17:10:49] Happy Giraffe: Also when climbing hills its better to use this 80% rpm I think if I understood correctly
[2022-03-14T17:11:10] Happy Giraffe: Less time and least heat for motor
[2022-03-14T17:11:12] Artem Bulashev: I was not too far off when said max speed of the motor should be 25% above your typical max speed
[2022-03-14T17:11:23] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-14T17:11:45] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, 80% is like 0.75 so its spot on😂
[2022-03-14T17:12:02] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2022-03-14T17:12:21] Happy Giraffe: Did you measure your consumption
[2022-03-14T17:12:34] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_3017@14-03-2022_17-12-34.jpg>
[2022-03-14T17:12:38] Artem Bulashev: Yes vesc does
[2022-03-14T17:12:42] Happy Giraffe: Im averaging 25wh/km
[2022-03-14T17:12:53] Artem Bulashev: But it all depends on settings you used
[2022-03-14T17:13:00] Happy Giraffe: Last 100km ridng
[2022-03-14T17:13:06] Artem Bulashev: Moment
[2022-03-14T17:13:14] Happy Giraffe: Yes ofcourse, but just for fun rough comparison
[2022-03-14T17:13:29] Happy Giraffe: Also I rarely have to push full throttle either
[2022-03-14T17:14:52] Artem Bulashev: Only shows me this
[2022-03-14T17:14:54] Happy Giraffe: The average speed is off because there were many stops during the 4.5hr ride
[2022-03-14T17:14:58] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3018@14-03-2022_17-14-58.jpg>
[2022-03-14T17:15:24] Happy Giraffe: That's good tho
[2022-03-14T17:15:32] Artem Bulashev: Dual motor
[2022-03-14T17:15:38] Happy Giraffe: Have all info you need
[2022-03-14T17:15:45] Artem Bulashev: Almost yeah
[2022-03-14T17:16:02] Artem Bulashev: That how it should past trips
[2022-03-14T17:16:09] Artem Bulashev: Actually it shows a lot more
[2022-03-14T17:16:28] Happy Giraffe: Will be interesting to compare efficiency during summer
[2022-03-14T17:16:30] Oliver Eliasson: <photos/photo_3019@14-03-2022_17-16-30.jpg>
[2022-03-14T17:17:36] Happy Giraffe: Haha, need longer trip to make it more accurate
[2022-03-14T17:17:40] Artem Bulashev: That seems too short to measure wh
[2022-03-14T17:17:46] Oliver Eliasson: Mine low? Okey
[2022-03-14T17:17:49] Happy Giraffe: Seems like a long downhill
[2022-03-14T17:17:55] Oliver Eliasson: Was long uphill
[2022-03-14T17:17:58] Oliver Eliasson: So strange
[2022-03-14T17:18:01] Happy Giraffe: Hmmm
[2022-03-14T17:18:04] Oliver Eliasson: Or can chexk
[2022-03-14T17:19:44] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t seem right
[2022-03-14T17:19:53] Artem Bulashev: Specially considering you are 14s
[2022-03-14T17:20:01] Artem Bulashev: And I’m 16s
[2022-03-14T17:20:05] Oliver Eliasson: Will try to work next weekend ant that should be 10km maybe
[2022-03-14T17:20:07] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah
[2022-03-14T17:20:14] Oliver Eliasson: But im going slower
[2022-03-14T17:20:25] Artem Bulashev: I was going all out
[2022-03-14T17:20:28] Artem Bulashev: 😂😅
[2022-03-14T17:20:31] Oliver Eliasson: But im also 92kg right now
[2022-03-14T17:20:36] Happy Giraffe: Im usually cruising steady 40kmh
[2022-03-14T17:20:38] Artem Bulashev: I’m 70kg
[2022-03-14T17:20:46] Artem Bulashev: Let’s do it !
[2022-03-14T17:20:53] Artem Bulashev: Find long flat
[2022-03-14T17:20:58] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah i took it slow was slippery outside, and wet roads
[2022-03-14T17:21:22] Happy Giraffe: Mine is city center to city outer riding mostly
[2022-03-14T17:21:31] Happy Giraffe: Delivering food from restaurants😂
[2022-03-14T17:21:35] Oliver Eliasson: I can messure on applewatch at same time, think it traks elevation
[2022-03-14T17:21:44] Artem Bulashev: Go 40kmh stable and enable logging with your nose 👃
[2022-03-14T17:21:50] Artem Bulashev: Don’t take hands off haha
[2022-03-14T17:22:05] Oliver Eliasson: What do you mean logging?
[2022-03-14T17:22:07] Oliver Eliasson: In vesc?
[2022-03-14T17:22:33] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-14T17:22:39] Happy Giraffe: You can also calculate the ah used and total distance done
[2022-03-14T17:22:54] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3020@14-03-2022_17-22-54.jpg>
[2022-03-14T17:22:58] Happy Giraffe: But long ride makes it most accurate
[2022-03-14T17:23:11] Oliver Eliasson: Dont have that phone, its my girlfriends. I have apple
[2022-03-14T17:23:19] Artem Bulashev: Try but need consistancy between all of us
[2022-03-14T17:23:39] Happy Giraffe: Vdrop and other small deviation comes meaningless in long logs
[2022-03-14T17:23:57] Oliver Eliasson: Will track entire ride matbe

[2022-03-14T17:24:43] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-14T17:26:27] Happy Giraffe: @PaoloWu Efficiency of Blade motor 50/140A 13s in city riding 40kmh cruising. I have a food delivery bag also so my air resistance is even worse. 80% throttle used for acceleration.
[2022-03-14T17:27:07] Oliver Eliasson: What could the battery in duarton mini handle?
[2022-03-14T17:27:36] Oliver Eliasson: Thinking upgrading to flipsky 75100
[2022-03-14T17:28:12] Artem Bulashev: True but how hard you accelerate and how high your settings are
[2022-03-14T17:28:41] Artem Bulashev: More fair comparing between all of us would be what number we get when driveling on flat 40kmh
[2022-03-14T17:28:45] Happy Giraffe: If you want to chill with coffee: https://youtu.be/dxJe_gygRGU
[2022-03-14T17:29:04] Artem Bulashev: May be just screen record vesc during that 40kmh driving
[2022-03-14T17:29:32] Happy Giraffe: Wind and other things are mostly effecting it, small wind against vs little tailwind is 2x consumption almost I think
[2022-03-14T17:30:08] Artem Bulashev: True, than will have to wait for windless day :))
[2022-03-14T17:30:30] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, it's bit hard haha
[2022-03-14T17:30:32] Artem Bulashev: Or drive one way and than other way
[2022-03-14T17:30:51] Artem Bulashev: Than sum and divide by 2
[2022-03-14T17:30:53] Happy Giraffe: But if you guys do longer 20km rides and record many of them it will become more and more accurate
[2022-03-14T17:31:01] Happy Giraffe: Yeah
[2022-03-14T17:31:32] Happy Giraffe: If its bad weather with spinning wind I get 28wh/km and normal is 25.5wh/km about
[2022-03-14T17:32:28] Artem Bulashev: In Vienna there is at least 30km wind almost every second day :)))
[2022-03-14T17:32:54] Artem Bulashev: Today was nice 12kmh wind only
[2022-03-14T17:33:03] Happy Giraffe: Haha, we had a storm also in Denmark. I went out on that day lol
[2022-03-14T17:35:33] Happy Giraffe: Interesting will be ebike vs scooter efficiency, high rpm vs bigger tire
[2022-03-14T17:40:17] Artem Bulashev: Larger wheel less torque higher speed, less rpm needed to go desired speed
[2022-03-14T17:45:57] Happy Giraffe: Yes, but the motors are bigger aswell. 23 magnet pairs usually, also their kv is roughly 1/3 - 1/4 of the scooters
[2022-03-14T17:47:31] Happy Giraffe: Will be interesting, most ebike guys are not nerds so not that much data available
[2022-03-14T18:21:17] Mirono escooters: I bought that untested spintend vesc from that dude. Let's see how it works out
[2022-03-14T18:21:17] Mirono escooters: No cables/connectors so that's always fun
[2022-03-14T18:59:40] Happy Giraffe: He didnt answer who he got it from
[2022-03-14T19:00:05] Happy Giraffe: I think it might be a guy who I know who burned it😅
[2022-03-14T19:42:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Shenzen closed their factories ... covid 😭😭
[2022-03-14T19:43:57] Mirono escooters: Wich?
[2022-03-14T19:44:39] Artem Bulashev: Oh shit, all??
[2022-03-14T19:45:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_3028@14-03-2022_19-45-23.jpg>
[2022-03-14T19:46:25] Mirono escooters: We are 2 years later. Corona got less deathly and we have Vaccines. And still lockdowns for a rise in cases ._.
[2022-03-14T19:48:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very strict rules in china 😢
[2022-03-14T19:48:49] Mirono escooters: At this point id start believing thé crazy ppl saying that they wanna destroy their economy on purpose
[2022-03-14T19:48:59] Mirono escooters: So tired of this shit.
[2022-03-14T19:51:55] Mirono escooters: Maybe dumb question maybe not How much does bms dissapates in heat? Of Batt power
[2022-03-14T19:51:57] Mirono escooters: Prob neglitible
[2022-03-14T19:52:00] Mirono escooters: 0.01%?
[2022-03-14T19:52:52] Artem Bulashev: Full BMS is a source of heat
[2022-03-14T19:53:00] Artem Bulashev: Fets heat up
[2022-03-14T19:53:09] Artem Bulashev: Charge and discharge fets
[2022-03-14T19:53:26] Artem Bulashev: Specially closer to max draw
[2022-03-14T19:53:37] Artem Bulashev: Also traces heat up
[2022-03-14T19:55:14] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3029@14-03-2022_19-55-14.jpg>
[2022-03-14T19:55:56] Artem Bulashev: JKBms even uses tiny copper rods to increase current capacity of traces = reduce them heating up
[2022-03-14T19:56:08] Mirono escooters: Thats nice
[2022-03-14T19:56:16] Mirono escooters: But how muc do we lose in heat?
[2022-03-14T19:58:44] Mirono escooters: And esc? How much is it efficiënt? I thought i read 80%?
[2022-03-14T20:04:47] Artem Bulashev: Not sure
[2022-03-14T20:04:50] Artem Bulashev: Moment
[2022-03-14T20:15:51] Artem Bulashev: Well no efficiency stated
[2022-03-14T20:16:12] Mirono escooters: Teslas are like 96% wich is cool
[2022-03-14T20:16:13] Artem Bulashev: But it should be very basic power side - input - fets - output
[2022-03-14T20:16:26] Artem Bulashev: So effiency should be equal to mosfet efficiency
[2022-03-14T20:16:34] Artem Bulashev: Around 98%
[2022-03-14T20:16:35] Mirono escooters: That's very logical
[2022-03-14T20:16:38] Mirono escooters: And cool
[2022-03-14T20:16:44] Artem Bulashev: Temp cut of is 100c
[2022-03-14T20:16:47] Artem Bulashev: Standard
[2022-03-14T20:16:48] Mirono escooters: Way more then i thought
[2022-03-14T20:16:58] Artem Bulashev: Reset (release) 80c
[2022-03-14T20:17:19] Mirono escooters: So if you do 2000w you generate 20w of heat?
[2022-03-14T20:17:23] Artem Bulashev: But I think that is basically something very wrong needs to happen for that take place
[2022-03-14T20:18:10] Mirono escooters: Idk from where i got my 80%. Maybe old article
[2022-03-14T20:19:17] Artem Bulashev: 60v 100a = 6000w = 60w of heat in theory if fets are 98% efficient (may be more I don’t know
[2022-03-14T20:20:35] Mirono escooters: But heat is A and not v tho
[2022-03-14T20:20:39] Mirono escooters: So calculating in W isn't cotrecto
[2022-03-14T20:21:07] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-03-14T20:21:12] Mirono escooters: This is where i lack physics. And my teacher is dead or atleast seems so. Ill ask him when he's back
[2022-03-14T20:22:23] Artem Bulashev: Right
[2022-03-14T20:22:31] Artem Bulashev: Square of Amps * resistance of fet
[2022-03-14T20:23:11] Artem Bulashev: More fets in parallel less system resistance
[2022-03-14T20:24:24] Mirono escooters: That's why we use multiple smol instead of 1 big
[2022-03-14T20:24:37] Mirono escooters: That's thé amount of heat in W?
[2022-03-14T20:26:21] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-14T20:28:51] Mirono escooters: And how efficiënt is a motor?
[2022-03-14T20:28:56] Mirono escooters: Maybe that's from where my 80% was
[2022-03-14T20:32:23] Artem Bulashev: Bushless outrunner typically is 50-80% efficient
[2022-03-14T20:32:50] Artem Bulashev: Here you can see actually
[2022-03-14T20:33:20] Mirono escooters: That's a big deviatiob
[2022-03-14T20:33:26] Artem Bulashev: No no
[2022-03-14T20:33:35] Artem Bulashev: It depends on rpm
[2022-03-14T20:33:39] Artem Bulashev: Not on motor
[2022-03-14T20:34:04] Happy Giraffe: Both😎
[2022-03-14T20:34:27] Happy Giraffe: Crystalyte motor max efficiency 82%, Chinese Mxus 88%
[2022-03-14T20:34:30] Artem Bulashev: Typically all modern brushless outrunners we use in scooters have peak efficiency of 80% at around 80% of RPM range.
[2022-03-14T20:34:53] Artem Bulashev: Best motors ever I think have 94%
[2022-03-14T20:35:02] Artem Bulashev: But you won’t find such.
[2022-03-14T20:35:20] Happy Giraffe: But yeah, one should not still buy motor based on efficiency. It doesnt mean that much in real world afterall
[2022-03-14T20:35:36] Happy Giraffe: Anything 80% and above is good
[2022-03-14T20:36:00] Artem Bulashev: https://www.masinaelectrica.com/130kw-motor-high-rpm-version-2018-in-construction/
[2022-03-14T20:36:03] Artem Bulashev: 97%
[2022-03-14T20:37:15] Artem Bulashev: Btw yes
[2022-03-14T20:37:47] Artem Bulashev: Square wave driven motor has usually efficiency of 80-84%
[2022-03-14T20:38:21] Artem Bulashev: But when we drive it in Simewave! Like FOC in vesc, motor gets a lot more efficient
[2022-03-14T20:38:41] Artem Bulashev: That’s why same 23amps on vesc heat up motor ALOT less
[2022-03-14T20:39:31] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know how much though
[2022-03-14T20:39:33] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2022-03-14T20:39:50] Mirono escooters: Foc VS bldc Bldc has higher spikes right?
[2022-03-14T20:41:56] Happy Giraffe: I think less, the simulations are based on FOC controllers (maybe car motors or others are more efficient then)
[2022-03-14T20:42:26] Happy Giraffe: Yes, on/off min and max point
[2022-03-14T20:42:44] Artem Bulashev: Fun fact
[2022-03-14T20:43:03] Artem Bulashev: Square wave is more efficient at max throttle 100% duty cycle
[2022-03-14T20:43:13] Artem Bulashev: And has higher top speed 100% duty
[2022-03-14T20:43:29] Happy Giraffe: Yep, sine can't reach top😭
[2022-03-14T20:43:48] Artem Bulashev: Sinewave has higher efficiency on low and mid range, and lower top speed as max duty is 95%
[2022-03-14T20:44:33] Artem Bulashev: (On each pass of wave controller gives MAX duty only for short time, while squarewave is just constantly at max level)
[2022-03-14T20:45:42] Happy Giraffe: Last 5% not important😎
[2022-03-14T21:20:51] Dennis: more than 100m now with the new foot pad from monorim its more easy to do a wheely 👍 now i can drive left / right or do a circle, makes a lot fun 😁 next time we see us you will see a +5km wheely :D i know a long road, more than 5km straight forward where not offen drive a car
[2022-03-14T21:21:26] Dennis: <photos/photo_3030@14-03-2022_21-21-26.jpg>
[2022-03-14T21:25:19] Dennis: <video_file>
[2022-03-14T21:26:30] Oliver Eliasson: What Controller are you using?
[2022-03-14T21:30:41] sombre_enfant: Ninebot g30
[2022-03-14T21:31:49] Dennis: that was last week the first test with the new stable footrest of monorim, have immediately tried something new which did not go so well before because the fender was not so stable and has bent through, I started a bit obliquely but was also the first attempt, with the part of monorim makes it even more fun to drive a wheely am fully convinced I can recommend in any case 👍
[2022-03-14T21:33:41] Oliver Eliasson: Original controller?
[2022-03-14T21:33:50] Dennis: yes
[2022-03-14T21:34:07] Paolo ⁭: How destroy escooter
[2022-03-14T21:34:19] Dennis: why ?
[2022-03-14T21:36:14] Mirono escooters: That's pretty cool
[2022-03-14T21:36:29] Dennis: makes very much fun 😁
[2022-03-14T21:36:55] Unknown: My god, where do you guys find these perfectly smooth flat dry and empty parking buildings!! I need one in my life LoL
[2022-03-14T21:37:40] Dennis: its not 100% flat, but its good, and i can also do a good wheely on not so good roads
[2022-03-14T21:43:04] Dennis: this is not only a parking garage, but also a bunker facility
[2022-03-14T21:45:10] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 😁
[2022-03-14T21:55:15] Mirono escooters: That's cool
[2022-03-14T22:10:52] Artem Bulashev: One thing you won’t be able to do with vesc
[2022-03-14T22:11:09] Artem Bulashev: Or I suck
[2022-03-14T22:17:48] Luis Magalhaes: Option 2 😂😂😂
[2022-03-14T22:19:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Is your scooter ready ?
[2022-03-14T22:20:25] Paolo ⁭: Show us performance of your WEPED sucé
[2022-03-14T22:20:48] Luis Magalhaes: No 🙈
[2022-03-14T22:21:13] Luis Magalhaes: Im still waiting for the fase wires and hall sensor
[2022-03-14T22:21:51] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb track day today? 😜
[2022-03-14T22:24:55] Face de Pin Sucé: damn
[2022-03-14T22:25:00] Face de Pin Sucé: yeaaaaah
[2022-03-14T22:25:03] Face de Pin Sucé: lot of fun
[2022-03-14T22:25:18] Luis Magalhaes: Video incoming?
[2022-03-14T22:25:20] Luis Magalhaes: 😁
[2022-03-15T00:30:45] Artem Bulashev: Not bad for eu stock
[2022-03-15T00:32:20] Paolo ⁭: Blade motor better and cost less
[2022-03-15T00:35:47] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2022-03-15T02:10:23] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-03-15T02:10:31] Artem Bulashev: 35e are space efficient
[2022-03-15T02:11:36] Artem Bulashev: 35e stay cooler at same load and give more real world 4.2->3.0v Wh total
[2022-03-15T02:12:29] Artem Bulashev: Only other option is in same space is 16s5p 50s
[2022-03-15T02:18:47] Artem Bulashev: Even 5p of Samsung 50s cant beat 8p of 35e in terms of temp and Wh really delivered = range
[2022-03-15T02:21:14] Happy Giraffe: They are more energy dense but might fully depend on other factors🤔
[2022-03-15T02:21:57] Happy Giraffe: 21700 cells 25.6% more volume. 3.5Ah x 1.256 ~ 4.4Ah😳
[2022-03-15T02:23:01] Artem Bulashev: Enclosed shape is big factor, one type of cells can be layed out to occupy maximum space why 21700 can’t be layed out to to occupy same % of the giver space
[2022-03-15T02:24:16] Happy Giraffe: On bike water bottle battery mounts 21700 fits 70 and 18650 91 cells. There 50S gives more but not a lot
[2022-03-15T02:24:49] Happy Giraffe: It's so nice to have many good options
[2022-03-15T02:25:41] Artem Bulashev: To be real I actually can fit 17s8p … which is 6.25% more wh = 81-84wh more…
[2022-03-15T02:26:20] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-15T02:26:33] Artem Bulashev: Yeah and if you go down to something like 50g, 50e, 48x, you will be at about 35e level spot on than
[2022-03-15T02:27:07] Happy Giraffe: And those cells will work harder than 50S or 40T batt
[2022-03-15T02:27:08] Artem Bulashev: 🥸🥸 those numbers destroy stereotypes
[2022-03-15T02:27:20] Artem Bulashev: Can’t believe but rechecked 5 times
[2022-03-15T02:28:13] Artem Bulashev: In my case they work easier 8p 35e vs even 5p 50s … less heating up on 35e
[2022-03-15T02:29:00] Happy Giraffe: I have a stupid 35A bms that I use 50A with. Im too afraid to know any temps happening there😂
[2022-03-15T02:29:12] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-03-15T02:29:23] Artem Bulashev: Makes me feel like I’m over doing it lol
[2022-03-15T02:30:06] Artem Bulashev: But to be fair I get 4v voltage drop at 60a on my current built on 35e 8p 😊😊 copper and layout is the key 😃
[2022-03-15T02:30:53] Artem Bulashev: Not even. More like 3.5v voltage sag at most actually
[2022-03-15T02:31:55] Happy Giraffe: My battery is 13s6p and built by a guy who makes batteries that work but the quality is "good enough"😅
[2022-03-15T02:32:13] Happy Giraffe: Never had that much sag measured by log volt curve, maybe 5v
[2022-03-15T02:32:24] Artem Bulashev: I think I will sell this 16s8p and build 17s8p
[2022-03-15T02:32:50] Unknown: With JK BMS?
[2022-03-15T02:33:12] Happy Giraffe: Do you really need the extra V and Wh?
[2022-03-15T02:33:19] Unknown: Are satisfied enough with yours to continue using in future?
[2022-03-15T02:34:12] Happy Giraffe: Welcome😁
[2022-03-15T02:34:25] Unknown: Thanks! 😌
[2022-03-15T02:34:34] Unknown: Look at it this way...16s 4v sag at 60a, that extra 1s will make it feel like 16s with 0v at 60a
[2022-03-15T02:35:25] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but worth all the hassle?😳
[2022-03-15T02:36:00] Happy Giraffe: Ofc he is a nerd for all statistical gains like we all here😅
[2022-03-15T02:37:31] Unknown: I'm really super glad I didn't settle on 18s for my build. 20s is 😍 Building is fun and optimizing is always king. Would be a lot of work for slight gain but if time and money allows, why not 🤓
[2022-03-15T02:37:45] Happy Giraffe: But thats a bigger jump😳
[2022-03-15T02:38:27] Happy Giraffe: And also he needs to have stock look, we Xiaomi guys are just too gangsta
[2022-03-15T02:38:37] Unknown: Coming from 16s... 20s was a huge jump. But was considering 18s for an "easier" layout and fitment. Glad I challenged myself and got the 20s to work
[2022-03-15T02:38:52] Unknown: True true
[2022-03-15T02:39:09] Happy Giraffe: That battery is extremely sexy, so nicely done
[2022-03-15T02:39:27] Unknown: Very much appreciated brother 😊
[2022-03-15T02:39:48] Happy Giraffe: Btw, do you know any ebike bottle type boxes that have anything else than the 4-5 pin power connector for max 40Amps?

[2022-03-15T02:41:26] Unknown: I have no experience with those types of battery boxes. Possibly someone else has suggestions
[2022-03-15T02:41:46] Unknown: I actually never realized those were a thing 🤣
[2022-03-15T02:42:59] Happy Giraffe: These would be handy after a littlebit of reinforcement as the frame tube is round and will crack the bolts. Sadly 16s4p 50T is waste on these if they only do 40A max. Otherwise would need an xt90 sticking out from there🤔
[2022-03-15T02:43:49] Unknown: Is 1 10 core data cable for thortle,brakes and power button enough for m365 with ubox.
[2022-03-15T02:46:20] Happy Giraffe: 3+3+4 yes👍
[2022-03-15T02:46:42] Happy Giraffe: If I remember correctly power button taking 4
[2022-03-15T02:49:10] Unknown: Yeaa it takes 4. Nice thanks

[2022-03-15T13:11:36] Artem Bulashev: Also I like building so why da hell not :))
[2022-03-15T13:18:47] Mirono escooters: That's a goood price

[2022-03-16T09:43:09] Mirono escooters: Buy one and test
[2022-03-16T09:43:27] Happy Giraffe: Are they so much cheaper than 35E that they are worth it?
[2022-03-16T09:44:08] Mirono escooters: For me yes, 35e was expensive
[2022-03-16T09:44:12] Mirono escooters: Bulk 29e got very good, so went with that :)
[2022-03-16T09:45:05] Mirono escooters: I Will order more 21700 too if i need best energy density (at higher price)
[2022-03-16T09:50:42] Mirono escooters: Awesome.. :(
[2022-03-16T09:51:48] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, also form factor is key. 21700 is way more energy density for bike bottle mount battery boxes. I think I go lower kv motor with higher voltage so I need less phase amps for the poor 40A connector😅
[2022-03-16T09:52:06] Happy Giraffe: Oof
[2022-03-16T10:03:47] Mirono escooters: I love 21700
[2022-03-16T10:10:01] Happy Giraffe: 🌚
[2022-03-16T10:18:31] Mirono escooters: New brand, once contzcted me to try and sell
[2022-03-16T10:24:53] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-16T10:46:56] Stan: I told you 😢
[2022-03-16T10:52:55] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2022-03-16T12:08:36] Artem Bulashev: 48x are great
[2022-03-16T12:28:30] Happy Giraffe: How is vdrop? Im thinking 48x vs 40T 16s8p
[2022-03-16T12:28:43] Happy Giraffe: Will be using mostly 60A batt I think
[2022-03-16T12:30:16] Mirono escooters: 40t Will perform much better is my bet
[2022-03-16T12:30:20] Mirono escooters: With lower capacity
[2022-03-16T12:34:00] Oliver Eliasson: Adam is using 48x right?
[2022-03-16T12:50:18] Artem Bulashev: Can get you 35e equal price 🙃
[2022-03-16T12:50:58] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂😂
[2022-03-16T12:51:10] Artem Bulashev: Man no
[2022-03-16T12:51:20] Artem Bulashev: No not at all
[2022-03-16T12:51:34] Artem Bulashev: 60amps / 8p is 7.5amp :))
[2022-03-16T12:52:03] Artem Bulashev: That’s what I use on 8p of 35e cells and with my build v drop is 3.5v at 60a load 😄
[2022-03-16T12:53:16] Artem Bulashev: 48x will have even less v drop, 40t is complete waist here - voltage sag will be almost same non existent, but range=delivered wh, will be 20% less at least for no reason
[2022-03-16T12:53:26] Artem Bulashev: Correct
[2022-03-16T12:54:21] Artem Bulashev: 40t or p42a worth it only when you pull more than 15amps often. Or some times around 20amps per cells.
[2022-03-16T12:55:00] Artem Bulashev: Voltage sag of 48x at 15a is equal to 40t or p42a voltage sag at 20amps load if I remember correctly
[2022-03-16T12:55:44] Mirono escooters: I meant only regarding v drop not Diff ah
[2022-03-16T12:55:59] Mirono escooters: Oh wow
[2022-03-16T12:56:11] Mirono escooters: Nvm i shut up xd
[2022-03-16T13:00:19] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3041@16-03-2022_13-00-19.jpg>
[2022-03-16T13:01:01] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3042@16-03-2022_13-01-01.jpg>
[2022-03-16T13:03:16] Artem Bulashev: At 7amps by 2.5wh difference in voltage is 3.9v or 3.87 (that’s basically non existent considering that resting voltage is 4.15v)
[2022-03-16T13:06:12] Artem Bulashev: 48x after 12wh has 3.35v
[2022-03-16T13:07:37] Artem Bulashev: P42a after 12wh, at 7amps as well, has 3.32v. But that is it for p42… after that it goes down fast
[2022-03-16T13:10:22] Happy Giraffe: Thanks, yes I was aware of this. Sometimes cells just under deliver a bit based on the spec
[2022-03-16T13:11:09] Happy Giraffe: Then I have no reason to go 40T if I can get 8p, will see
[2022-03-16T13:11:10] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3045@16-03-2022_13-11-10.jpg>
[2022-03-16T13:11:10] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3046@16-03-2022_13-11-10.jpg>
[2022-03-16T13:11:27] Paolo ⁭: Me after that:
[2022-03-16T13:11:45] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-16T13:14:40] Oliver Eliasson: Please educate me, why use nickel and copper and not only copper? Also is it harder to spot weld copper?
[2022-03-16T13:15:12] Paolo ⁭: You can’t spot weld copper
[2022-03-16T13:15:38] Oliver Eliasson: Oh okey, thats why nickel on top
[2022-03-16T13:15:52] Paolo ⁭: You put upper nickel because has much more resistance, and nickel resistance produced heat will melt copper too
[2022-03-16T13:16:27] Paolo ⁭: In the fact if you use steel you will have a better result
[2022-03-16T13:17:39] Oliver Eliasson: Okey, but steel could rust easier?
[2022-03-16T13:21:02] Paolo ⁭: Yes, if you have good sealing of battery box you shouldn’t have problems
[2022-03-16T13:21:52] Happy Giraffe: How much your supplier for 48x?😳
[2022-03-16T13:23:46] Happy Giraffe: Nkon 3.35€🤔
[2022-03-16T13:24:45] Oliver Eliasson: Okey, does steel need more powerful spot welder or nickel?
[2022-03-16T13:25:04] Paolo ⁭: Pure need need more power
[2022-03-16T13:25:25] Paolo ⁭: With still more or less all spot welder can do (not AliExpress 10€‘s one)
[2022-03-16T13:28:50] Artem Bulashev: Even 7p no reason
[2022-03-16T13:29:11] Happy Giraffe: Kv x voltage = rpm Rpm and tire size = speed in calculator https://www.electrical4u.net/calculator/rpm-to-kmph-kmps-conversion-calculator/
[2022-03-16T13:29:56] Artem Bulashev: How many?
[2022-03-16T13:31:25] Happy Giraffe: 130, exactly what I needed 16s8p (128)
[2022-03-16T13:35:11] Artem Bulashev: Will ask
[2022-03-16T13:35:18] Artem Bulashev: Where you gonna fit it ?
[2022-03-16T13:35:21] Artem Bulashev: Which scooter ?
[2022-03-16T13:43:33] Happy Giraffe: Bike
[2022-03-16T13:43:34] Mirono escooters: Nickel Plated steel??
[2022-03-16T13:43:47] Mirono escooters: Isn't nickel more condu ctive then steel
[2022-03-16T13:43:57] Happy Giraffe: Probably make myself a lockable box inside bike frame triangle
[2022-03-16T13:44:47] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-03-16T13:47:12] Artem Bulashev: Yes, but for welding you don’t want conductive. You want resistive material - because it will heat up a lot more for split second from less current - making copper under it melt better and stick better to cell
[2022-03-16T13:48:02] Artem Bulashev: That’s why you see people put nickel plaited steel or pure nickel tabs above copper or strips
[2022-03-16T13:58:17] Oliver Eliasson: What cells in vsett 8 19.2 And vsett 8 + 16?
[2022-03-16T13:59:07] Artem Bulashev: Mid mh1 3.2ah High mj1 3.5ah
[2022-03-16T13:59:09] Artem Bulashev: LG
[2022-03-16T13:59:38] Happy Giraffe: I had MJ1 and never again, highest vdrop of my life (when using roughly 6.5A)
[2022-03-16T13:59:46] Artem Bulashev: They are ok for 7.5a current not more, at that level drop will be under control and acceptable (about usual .375v)
[2022-03-16T14:01:18] Happy Giraffe: 12s3p 35E performed better than 12s4p MJ1🌚
[2022-03-16T14:01:46] Happy Giraffe: About 3 kmh more topspeed due to less sag
[2022-03-16T14:01:56] Artem Bulashev: 6.5a for them is perfectly ok, problem must hav been else where in the pack build
[2022-03-16T14:02:24] Happy Giraffe: Also true, the guy does welding bukkake sometimes
[2022-03-16T14:02:38] Artem Bulashev: Mj1 sag at 7.5a about same as 35e at 10a
[2022-03-16T14:03:42] Artem Bulashev: Mj1 sag at 5a is same as 35e at 7a
[2022-03-16T14:04:13] Happy Giraffe: Sounds about right then
[2022-03-16T14:05:01] Happy Giraffe: Then the Mj1 had about 6.5A load and 35E 8.5A
[2022-03-16T14:05:10] Happy Giraffe: Still samsung beat lg ass
[2022-03-16T14:06:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah Samsung wins 18650 and 21700 in high capacity relatively high discharge.
[2022-03-16T14:06:48] Happy Giraffe: Another contenser is the LG M50T
[2022-03-16T14:07:03] Artem Bulashev: Its not bad
[2022-03-16T14:07:08] Artem Bulashev: I remember comparing it
[2022-03-16T14:07:44] Artem Bulashev: Not as good as 48x and 50g
[2022-03-16T14:07:58] Artem Bulashev: It heats up a lot at 15a
[2022-03-16T14:08:20] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3048@16-03-2022_14-08-20.jpg>
[2022-03-16T14:09:40] Happy Giraffe: Even at 7A?
[2022-03-16T14:09:52] Happy Giraffe: Its rated 15A...fuking LG at it again
[2022-03-16T14:09:53] Artem Bulashev: 7a is ok yes
[2022-03-16T14:10:12] Artem Bulashev: I would not dare use it at above 12a
[2022-03-16T14:10:16] Artem Bulashev: Long term
[2022-03-16T14:10:32] Artem Bulashev: Also it will sag like crazy
[2022-03-16T14:10:36] Artem Bulashev: You can see actually
[2022-03-16T14:10:58] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3049@16-03-2022_14-10-58.jpg>
[2022-03-16T14:11:03] Artem Bulashev: There, compare
[2022-03-16T14:11:23] Artem Bulashev: Voltage on left, temp on right, ah on bottom
[2022-03-16T14:12:40] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3050@16-03-2022_14-12-40.jpg>
[2022-03-16T14:12:40] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3051@16-03-2022_14-12-40.jpg>
[2022-03-16T14:13:44] Artem Bulashev: M50T is about 0.1v lower
[2022-03-16T14:13:46] Happy Giraffe: About exactly the same on 7A, Im partly colorblind ao bit hard tocsee lol
[2022-03-16T14:13:55] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-03-16T14:14:08] Artem Bulashev: It is at 7a same as 48x at 10a
[2022-03-16T14:14:21] Happy Giraffe: Oh
[2022-03-16T14:14:39] Artem Bulashev: But end result same wh delivered - 15wh
[2022-03-16T14:14:51] Happy Giraffe: Thats insane, Samsung is 10A rated lol
[2022-03-16T14:15:02] Artem Bulashev: M50t has longer lasting curve a bit, but voltage is 0.1v lower during that curve
[2022-03-16T14:15:22] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁 one brand over rates it, other under rated it
[2022-03-16T14:15:39] Artem Bulashev: 48x is perfectly ok at 15a
[2022-03-16T14:16:01] Oliver Eliasson: So 19.2 could do 40amp (45) max and 15.6 maybe 35 or so?
[2022-03-16T14:16:53] Artem Bulashev: Mh1 and mj1 are rated to do same 7.5a max
[2022-03-16T14:16:54] Oliver Eliasson: A friend want to do same mod as we with spindtend dual to vsett 8
[2022-03-16T14:17:06] Artem Bulashev: So you can pull same amps from either one
[2022-03-16T14:17:23] Artem Bulashev: It’s just mh1 is lower capacity - range
[2022-03-16T14:17:24] Oliver Eliasson: Okey, but 15.6 is 5p and 19.2 6p
[2022-03-16T14:17:31] Oliver Eliasson: Oh okey
[2022-03-16T14:17:38] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2022-03-16T14:17:57] Artem Bulashev: Those are both mid Option but one on vsett 8 and other on vsett8+?
[2022-03-16T14:18:05] Oliver Eliasson: But my math doesn’t add upp
[2022-03-16T14:18:12] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂
[2022-03-16T14:18:19] Artem Bulashev: Look
[2022-03-16T14:18:30] Oliver Eliasson: He said he has 17.5ah but i couldn’t find a model like that
[2022-03-16T14:18:39] Oliver Eliasson: So assume he looked wrong
[2022-03-16T14:18:45] Artem Bulashev: VSETT9 has 14s5p
[2022-03-16T14:18:56] Artem Bulashev: Vsett9+ has 13s6p
[2022-03-16T14:19:07] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know about 8 and 8+
[2022-03-16T14:19:07] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah
[2022-03-16T14:19:13] Oliver Eliasson: But vsett 8
[2022-03-16T14:19:17] Oliver Eliasson: 19.2
[2022-03-16T14:19:26] Artem Bulashev: Write out all 3 options for each
[2022-03-16T14:19:49] Oliver Eliasson: 19.2/3.2 would be 6p
[2022-03-16T14:20:03] Artem Bulashev: It is always same Low - Chinese 2.6ah Mid - lg mh1 3.2ah High - lg mh1 3.5ah
[2022-03-16T14:20:17] Oliver Eliasson: Okey
[2022-03-16T14:20:48] Artem Bulashev: Sounds right, and high would be 21ah
[2022-03-16T14:20:48] Oliver Eliasson: So should ve 6p for all?
[2022-03-16T14:21:08] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah
[2022-03-16T14:22:46] Artem Bulashev: 8 15.6 china = 6p 19.2 lg = 6p 21 lg = 6p
[2022-03-16T14:22:52] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-16T14:23:06] rosheee: Thx god i ordered everything i needed before
[2022-03-16T14:23:11] Oliver Eliasson: Could the china cells to 7.5 to?
[2022-03-16T14:24:13] Oliver Eliasson: If he changes to spintend he will get more torque but will lose a little top speed?
[2022-03-16T14:24:40] rosheee: Why lose speed o.O?
[2022-03-16T14:25:01] Artem Bulashev: 8+ has 16ah lg = 5p The only option
[2022-03-16T14:25:21] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-16T14:25:24] Oliver Eliasson: Okey
[2022-03-16T14:25:37] Artem Bulashev: They are less capacity but same ampacity
[2022-03-16T14:26:00] Artem Bulashev: Foc has lower top speed compare to squarewave
[2022-03-16T14:26:04] Oliver Eliasson: People say that foc usually has a little less top speed
[2022-03-16T14:26:45] Artem Bulashev: Potentially more torque yes (not from 0kmh, but gain in acceleration 10-40kmh will be big)
[2022-03-16T14:27:01] Oliver Eliasson: How’s much you lose in top speed? 5%
[2022-03-16T14:27:40] Artem Bulashev: Hard to say but yeah about that or abit more (some will be compensated with higher amps)
[2022-03-16T14:29:24] Oliver Eliasson: It there a performece difference between like spintend or 75100? Aside from quality and protection, will spintend produce more torque etc? Its well within the limits of both. (Don’t know if he want dual or single drive yet)
[2022-03-16T14:37:29] Mirono escooters: Ahaaaaaa. Yes now i get it. :)
[2022-03-16T14:37:39] Mirono escooters: That's why welding copper sandwich with steel went better
[2022-03-16T14:44:35] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-03-16T14:45:46] Happy Giraffe: If the stock controller is more inefficient and doesnt provide enough amps for torque, the difference might be minimal🤔
[2022-03-16T17:33:59] Artem Bulashev: Stock controller heats the motor up more
[2022-03-16T17:34:11] Artem Bulashev: So you can put out less amps to it
[2022-03-16T17:35:34] Artem Bulashev: But yes it is life time long discussion. What is better. Stock square wave or foc for normal consumer
[2022-03-16T17:35:38] Artem Bulashev: Btw
[2022-03-16T17:35:45] Artem Bulashev: I will soon get one more vsett 9
[2022-03-16T17:36:09] Artem Bulashev: Sooo I will be able to configure my vesc to match stock controller and compare them side by side
[2022-03-16T17:36:12] Artem Bulashev: 😄
[2022-03-16T17:41:06] Mirono escooters: I love foc
[2022-03-16T17:44:37] Happy Giraffe: Last 5% speed doesnt mean anything, should just get one more S to battery
[2022-03-16T17:44:40] Happy Giraffe: FOC always wins😎
[2022-03-16T17:45:30] Artem Bulashev: But my question is what parameters of Phase amps and battery amps will match stock 23amp controller punch - acceleration 🥸
[2022-03-16T17:45:37] Artem Bulashev: That’s what I want to know :)
[2022-03-16T17:45:51] Happy Giraffe: Yes, we will see😁
[2022-03-16T20:25:31] Happy Giraffe: People usually say low and high kv have such different torque, but whats interesting is they behave identically when going uphill the same speed😳
[2022-03-16T20:28:32] Mirono escooters: What rlly?
[2022-03-16T20:29:31] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_3052@16-03-2022_20-29-31.jpg>
[2022-03-16T20:29:49] Happy Giraffe: Only difference is 8 turn vs 10 turn
[2022-03-16T20:31:02] Happy Giraffe: Same 37nm torque in both
[2022-03-16T20:34:34] Martin Kaktits: because its torque per phase amp, not torque per watt or smth
[2022-03-16T20:37:33] Happy Giraffe: "High kv is a low volt high amp motor, Low kv is a high volt low amp motor. Same power"🤔
[2022-03-16T20:40:00] Happy Giraffe: "Less resistance on controller and controller wires coupled with higher phase amp limit makes high kv motor similar to low kv in torque. But if you have bad esc then it will have too much resistance"🤔
[2022-03-16T20:43:01] Happy Giraffe: How I understood, when not phase amp limited = motors have identical performance but ofc we all have limits on our escs
[2022-03-16T20:48:02] Happy Giraffe: 6 vs 12kv
[2022-03-16T20:50:12] Paolo ⁭: Oh shit stop giraffe
[2022-03-16T20:55:28] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-16T20:56:29] Happy Giraffe: But on trip simulator that takes wind and 50kmh maxspeed into account I get better efficiency and less wh/km on lov kv motor....
[2022-03-16T20:56:43] Happy Giraffe: Fuck I'm so confused right now
[2022-03-16T21:00:11] Happy Giraffe: Seems that wind drag is the most critical factor to make high kv less efficient, you need to ride faster on high kv and that is not possible without a stronger wind resistance🌚
[2022-03-16T21:01:13] Happy Giraffe: And thats why high kv + low volt, low kv + high volt combos are needed for the balance🌚
[2022-03-16T21:04:00] Unknown: What about High kv high volt 🤔 Super duper speed? LoL
[2022-03-16T21:10:23] Happy Giraffe: And also the abscence of traffic lights makes a difference, low kv motor is more efficient accelerator but high kv is more efficient cruiser😳
[2022-03-16T21:10:35] Happy Giraffe: Put wings and fly

[2022-03-16T21:15:39] Happy Giraffe: And when simulating an uphill (real world ride in my city with terrain and wind) the same speed gives exactly same results for time and wh/km🌚
[2022-03-16T21:46:52] Unknown: I appreciate the research your doing, really fun to learn and educate ourselves. Do you think real world application will be that noticable if simulator results are so similar? In the nicest way possible... Are you overthinking this? 😆
[2022-03-16T21:48:44] Paolo ⁭: Sorry for hot glue xd
[2022-03-16T21:48:58] Mirono escooters: Iueeeuw
[2022-03-16T21:50:43] Unknown: Bro, I used this special black hot glue for automotive dent removal. Shit is insanely strong!
[2022-03-16T21:51:43] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-03-16T21:52:38] Unknown: Between this black hot glue and multiple wraps of fiber tape, kapton and fish tape, plus the heatshrink... I expect my cells to stay put
[2022-03-16T21:54:29] Happy Giraffe: I really want to understand how one should choose right kV for the application. But seems high kV wants to use the efficient spot so it wants to be driven fast = more energy consumption when air resistance increases😅 so for 40kmh cruising I think I get one step lower kv from the middle
[2022-03-16T21:54:45] Mirono escooters: Still prefer holded
[2022-03-16T21:54:46] Mirono escooters: Rs
[2022-03-16T21:54:51] Paolo ⁭: Problem of hot glue is after few month it will loose his capacity. The only way is set gun with very high temp then melt with shrink
[2022-03-16T21:54:53] Happy Giraffe: And yes Im overthinking😂 because I can swap stator for 110€🙈
[2022-03-16T21:55:41] Happy Giraffe: Damn, need to try that one out
[2022-03-16T21:58:24] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_3055@16-03-2022_21-58-24.jpg>
[2022-03-16T21:59:33] Paolo ⁭: Where dragy stat
[2022-03-16T21:59:48] sombre_enfant: Such sucé result
[2022-03-16T22:03:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Didn't had time, it was only me going to work today x)
[2022-03-16T22:06:56] Luis Magalhaes: Were you late?😂
[2022-03-16T22:07:25] Luis Magalhaes: It was on the 75mm motors?
[2022-03-16T22:07:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope, I always run like that x(
[2022-03-16T22:07:33] Face de Pin Sucé: X)
[2022-03-16T22:07:43] Face de Pin Sucé: But too much traffic
[2022-03-16T22:08:03] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-03-16T22:16:36] Paolo ⁭: Something stranger 30Ah used in 2km😐
[2022-03-16T22:17:14] sombre_enfant: His adc param maybe
[2022-03-16T22:17:49] Face de Pin Sucé: No, I never turn off
[2022-03-16T22:17:59] Face de Pin Sucé: So it was on since yesterday
[2022-03-16T22:21:55] Paolo ⁭: A
[2022-03-16T22:38:12] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb you runing what voltage in that? 😁
[2022-03-16T22:40:39] Face de Pin Sucé: 60V only
[2022-03-16T22:42:34] Paolo ⁭: Still haven’t let us see your vedc
[2022-03-16T22:47:03] Luis Magalhaes: Nice 😁👌
[2022-03-16T22:47:50] Paolo ⁭: Sucé *
[2022-03-16T22:50:15] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb field weakening??
[2022-03-16T22:50:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope
[2022-03-16T22:54:01] Luis Magalhaes: Your using the same 75mm motors?
[2022-03-16T23:10:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah 👍👍
[2022-03-16T23:13:27] Luis Magalhaes: Same speed on kelly?
[2022-03-16T23:20:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Quicker on Kelly because more current
[2022-03-16T23:20:45] Face de Pin Sucé: But for now I can't push more due to testingd
[2022-03-16T23:51:52] rosheee: u do the nickel copper now as well^^?
[2022-03-16T23:52:16] rosheee: ^^ nearly done

[2022-03-16T23:54:38] rosheee: stock ubox v1 thermalpads > thermal gayleee
[2022-03-16T23:55:06] rosheee: 15-20 degrees more now lol
[2022-03-16T23:55:13] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-16T23:55:45] rosheee: and the SUPEREXPENSIVE ONE WITH 17 W/K
[2022-03-16T23:55:58] rosheee: 100euro for fucking thermalpads TO TEST IT JUST FOR YOU
[2022-03-16T23:56:05] rosheee: they are like the original ones
[2022-03-16T23:56:12] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-16T23:56:38] rosheee: maybe in single happy box it works but NOT ON UBOX V1
[2022-03-16T23:58:08] Artem Bulashev: How is max speed is same on different Kv??
[2022-03-16T23:58:44] Artem Bulashev: Ho is torque same on max speed ?
[2022-03-16T23:59:05] Artem Bulashev: Why doesn’t efficiency shift in rpm range with change in Kv?
[2022-03-17T00:00:07] Artem Bulashev: Also kv should change not more less torque but ONLY torque at low rpm, which we do see here
[2022-03-17T00:02:47] Unknown: Left handed trigger throttle from Kart for variable Regen 🤓. So now, identical throttles for throttle and e-brake, just mirror images. I think I likey altho boosted/curve is still ideal. Can't find either of those anywhere on Earth. This isn't a bad 2nd option I think
[2022-03-17T00:02:48] Unknown: <photos/photo_3059@17-03-2022_00-02-48.jpg>
[2022-03-17T00:05:19] Artem Bulashev: Now this is more like it
[2022-03-17T00:05:36] Artem Bulashev: Low kv has higher torque in low rpm
[2022-03-17T00:06:23] Artem Bulashev: And it max speed is lower and thus efficiency shifted accordingly
[2022-03-17T00:07:22] Artem Bulashev: That’s why getting CORRECT kv for your needs is most important
[2022-03-17T00:08:37] Artem Bulashev: If you only need 25-30kmh scooter with max torque that yeah go for B. If you need 45-65kmh mostly go for A. If you need in between than go for in between
[2022-03-17T00:09:48] Artem Bulashev: I’m working on a scroll throttle guys for Spintend
[2022-03-17T00:10:02] Artem Bulashev: First design will be down this week
[2022-03-17T00:10:09] Artem Bulashev: But tss
[2022-03-17T00:24:32] Happy Giraffe: I chose to run them both at same speed lets say 20kmh just to compare
[2022-03-17T00:26:49] Happy Giraffe: But truly understanding motor kv is tough, one can get 6kv and 12kv motor and put tire half the size to 12kv
[2022-03-17T00:26:50] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-17T00:26:51] rosheee: Nobody overclocks here?
[2022-03-17T00:27:23] Happy Giraffe: Then both motors spin same speed but fast kv generates half the heat😳
[2022-03-17T00:27:36] Happy Giraffe: The Arm cpu in spintend?
[2022-03-17T00:28:20] Happy Giraffe: I could propably push 3x the powerlimit on that as spintend fellas want me to bolt the arm chip side so its actually well cooled
[2022-03-17T00:28:37] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-17T00:30:43] Happy Giraffe: And this is why I think choosing the lowest kv motor that wont heat too much might be good for me. The slow speed I can compensate with 60v battery. The motor is soo beefy it wont heat up on poor spintend powers anyway
[2022-03-17T00:31:56] Happy Giraffe: Then copper losses wont be an issue, rolling resistance and flux is little so I dont even calculate it
[2022-03-17T00:43:05] Unknown: Only for spintend? 3.3v?
[2022-03-17T00:55:54] Oliver Eliasson: Probably 5v
[2022-03-17T00:56:37] Oliver Eliasson: They needed help designing and i cant do that😅 but @artBula can
[2022-03-17T00:56:56] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-17T00:57:30] Unknown: Then it would be a throttle... For everything. Not sure "throttle for spintend" means
[2022-03-17T00:58:04] Oliver Eliasson: No he’s designing it for spintend (case, wheel, mechanism etc)
[2022-03-17T00:58:10] Oliver Eliasson: They will manufacture it
[2022-03-17T00:58:38] Oliver Eliasson: So yes, throttle for every thing
[2022-03-17T01:07:59] Unknown: Ohh.. for spintend to manufacturer and distribute.. got it got it
[2022-03-17T01:08:15] Unknown: Damn genius that guy lol
[2022-03-17T01:10:09] Unknown: So question guys... Regarding dual motor. When front motor is set to a certain battery amp and phase amp output and rear is set to a different battery/phase output, is the rear motor pushing against the front, like do both motor have different rpms? Should battery amps match? I know phase don't have to match. But is it more efficient if front/rear battery amps match or does it not matter??
[2022-03-17T01:11:03] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah i contacted them and asked if they could make it and they said yes, but i needed to design, so i talked to Arthem because i cant CAD and he also have some design changes he wanted (i think 66% space to roll to left (throttle) and 33 to right instead of 50/50
[2022-03-17T01:12:05] Unknown: Hmm, 50/50 or 66/33 resolution would be perfect. E-brake doesn't really need 50% of the resolution in my opinion so that actually sounds perfect
[2022-03-17T01:12:28] Unknown: Longer throw on throttle and shorter throw on ebrake
[2022-03-17T01:12:34] Oliver Eliasson: Maybe if you have dumb system it would matter, but the controller talk to each other right?
[2022-03-17T01:12:41] Oliver Eliasson: Yes
[2022-03-17T01:12:52] Happy Giraffe: They are both pulling but one is loaded more than other if I'm not lying
[2022-03-17T01:13:21] Happy Giraffe: Will be fine as I think most people use more power anyways on rear for the grip
[2022-03-17T01:14:12] Unknown: No, controllers don't communicate with eachother to achieve any type of "balance" whether it be CANbus or levcan.
[2022-03-17T01:15:08] Unknown: I mean, I'm sure it will be fine but was wondering the effect when front is say 40/90 and rear is 55/135. Does rear have more rpm and actually bogging down because it's pushing the front??
[2022-03-17T01:15:31] Happy Giraffe: They both have same max rpm limit due to voltage tho
[2022-03-17T01:15:40] Happy Giraffe: So other motor would just follow
[2022-03-17T01:16:12] Unknown: What's the formula for rpm? Voltage x motor KV? Amps don't play into ERPM at all?
[2022-03-17T01:16:28] Oliver Eliasson: I think vesc has traction controll
[2022-03-17T01:17:26] Happy Giraffe: Erpm is just the pairs x rpm I think, rpm is kv x volt
[2022-03-17T01:19:54] Happy Giraffe: But im not sure if that much motor current is needed with dual motor setup afterall🤔
[2022-03-17T01:20:08] Unknown: Hmm. Ok. Not sure why I have it in my brain that different battery amps equals different motor speeds. I wonder is battery amps should still be equal with the phase amps being varied
[2022-03-17T01:20:28] Happy Giraffe: Might be worth reducing front to not have traction control bugging you when you accidentally slip it on wet road with some sand on it
[2022-03-17T01:21:13] Happy Giraffe: If you are controlling the torque with throttle, all of them wish to spin at max speed but lack the torque to do so. Just like free spin
[2022-03-17T01:21:16] Unknown: Was just an example. Right now I have 60a battery 135 phase rear and 55a battery 100 phase front. No traction control is setup on Nucular controllers currently
[2022-03-17T01:21:57] Unknown: Hm, that makes sense. Yes, I use throttle to control phase amps... Torque mode
[2022-03-17T01:22:33] Unknown: Was just wondering if I should set battery amps identical or if that really doesn't make a difference
[2022-03-17T01:23:27] Happy Giraffe: Not sure if it makes any difference, maybe Artem has more input as he has done that awd trickery
[2022-03-17T01:25:03] Unknown: 👍.. I feel like I've asked this before but I don't remember the feedback I got 🤦🏻 haha
[2022-03-17T01:26:18] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-17T02:20:40] Unknown: @artBula @PaoloWu @SibClimb @roscheeee @koxx3 Is there any harm in running front and rear motors with different battery amps? Phase amps.. surely different. Do battery amps affect rpm? Will rear motor be "pushing" front motor if battery amps set differently? Really curious for input on this...
[2022-03-17T02:21:29] Unknown: Calling all seasoned veterans!! LoL 😂😂
[2022-03-17T02:56:18] rosheee: So far no prob
[2022-03-17T02:56:29] rosheee: Maybe speed doesnt like it idk
[2022-03-17T02:56:53] rosheee: I set 135A front n rear Before i had 140A front 160A rear
[2022-03-17T02:56:59] rosheee: It os gonna push
[2022-03-17T06:13:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Not really a problem, will depends on the difference
[2022-03-17T09:58:32] Paolo ⁭: I have different phase current in front motor because you loose grip if too much current
[2022-03-17T10:29:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't think there is any issue with that.
[2022-03-17T12:07:09] Artem Bulashev: I have an idea to make a switch parrallel to the pull down resistor. = 3 or 5v
[2022-03-17T12:07:52] Artem Bulashev: Yes rear motor will be dominant at top speed
[2022-03-17T12:08:10] Artem Bulashev: But very top maxed out speed
[2022-03-17T12:08:29] Artem Bulashev: Don’t think it is an issue
[2022-03-17T12:08:38] Paolo ⁭: Ive 150a battery as setting for rear motor
[2022-03-17T12:08:43] Paolo ⁭: And 100 front
[2022-03-17T13:18:48] Luis Magalhaes: 👌ok, and how is it handle the cooling for now? Do you have it with forced ventilation?
[2022-03-17T13:56:45] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2022-03-17T14:04:54] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-17T14:47:23] Face de Pin Sucé: I always use forced ventilation because inside Weped Deck
[2022-03-17T15:00:33] Unknown: Thank you all for the input. Very helpful 🤓
[2022-03-17T15:45:03] Unknown: Broken nickel market huh? That's very specific, of all things to headline they're talking about Nickel in particular. All the more reason to use copper for our battery builds 😆
[2022-03-17T16:13:39] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-03-17T16:14:01] Artem Bulashev: Good thing I have a year long stock of it haha
[2022-03-17T16:14:12] Artem Bulashev: Sexy
[2022-03-17T16:14:50] Artem Bulashev: the only thing I don’t see extra isolation between series :)
[2022-03-17T16:15:12] Paolo ⁭: Double shrink on each cell
[2022-03-17T16:15:21] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok
[2022-03-17T16:15:25] Artem Bulashev: Fair enough
[2022-03-17T16:15:30] Paolo ⁭: Then double layer of pvc extra
[2022-03-17T16:15:35] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-03-17T16:15:45] Artem Bulashev: So 4 layers between series
[2022-03-17T16:15:48] Artem Bulashev: 👍
[2022-03-17T16:15:59] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3061@17-03-2022_16-15-59.jpg>
[2022-03-17T16:16:03] Paolo ⁭: 😂
[2022-03-17T16:16:18] Artem Bulashev: I surely just use fish paper between series because it is less brittle
[2022-03-17T16:16:28] Paolo ⁭: Fish paper better solution
[2022-03-17T16:16:44] Paolo ⁭: This is a fast battery I did for this week because I haven’t scooter ready to use lol
[2022-03-17T16:16:52] Artem Bulashev: But for such build your way makes it a lot easier to assemble
[2022-03-17T16:17:40] Artem Bulashev: Prepare wraps, than just Layer, glue? layer, glue 👍
[2022-03-17T16:17:56] Artem Bulashev: Good thinking. With fish paper it would be a pain in the ass
[2022-03-17T16:18:21] Paolo ⁭: Problem of fish paper is it not good with glue
[2022-03-17T16:18:39] Paolo ⁭: Plastic with glue is more stronger
[2022-03-17T16:21:00] Artem Bulashev: Hot glue doesn’t stick to it? Never had to do that
[2022-03-17T16:23:07] Artem Bulashev: 👍👍

[2022-03-17T17:19:06] Oliver Eliasson: @artBula whats your avrage speed?
[2022-03-17T17:30:26] Unknown: Welding dead center on negative side isn't recommended. That's where the jelly roll is located. Welding heat directly in the center of the negative can damage it. Off to the side on the negative is safer. In some the manufacturer spec sheets they note this in particular and show where to spot on the negative side of the cell. I'll see if I can find one...
[2022-03-17T17:30:26] Unknown: <photos/photo_3064@17-03-2022_17-30-26.jpg>
[2022-03-17T17:33:02] Paolo ⁭: Depends by cell, in Samsung 50E isn’t specified like on vtc6a21700
[2022-03-17T17:34:27] Unknown: It may not be specified in the spec sheet but all lithium cells have jelly roll connected to internal negative center. Is usually best and safest to weld around the outside of "dead center"
[2022-03-17T17:35:31] Unknown: The copper dissipates the heat super quick anyways, so minimal heat is transferred to the cell itself (another benefit of copper 😉) Obviously you know what you're doing, just pointing it out 👍
[2022-03-17T17:36:12] Mirono escooters: Me too
[2022-03-17T17:36:17] Mirono escooters: Or holders. Still easiest

[2022-03-17T17:38:39] Artem Bulashev: 👍👍
[2022-03-17T17:39:03] Paolo ⁭: This is different because those cells have gas escape in that position. Generally are in positive pole
[2022-03-17T18:00:30] Oliver Eliasson: 40min and only 6.2km?
[2022-03-17T18:01:29] Oliver Eliasson: How come i have dubbel efficiency?
[2022-03-17T18:01:58] Artem Bulashev: I was parked for a while
[2022-03-17T18:02:15] Artem Bulashev: So bassivly I was driving 40-58kmh when I was actually driving
[2022-03-17T18:02:33] Oliver Eliasson: Okey
[2022-03-17T18:03:45] Luis Magalhaes: Looks good 😁
[2022-03-17T18:04:10] Luis Magalhaes: Ok 😁👍
[2022-03-17T18:04:36] Oliver Eliasson: Will do again this weekend and see
[2022-03-17T18:23:03] Artem Bulashev: Let’s try both
[2022-03-17T18:24:25] Artem Bulashev: Setting 20a battery each motor, 52v battery fully charged. Start right before going for a long 40kmh target speed drive (need avg 40kmh, max 45kmh, as little brake and stops as possible)
[2022-03-17T18:57:55] Oliver Eliasson: Will try. We say try to hold 30-35 instead. Still a bit slippery in some places here in sweden
[2022-03-17T19:12:31] Artem Bulashev: Oh I forgot
[2022-03-17T19:12:34] Artem Bulashev: It is +15
[2022-03-17T19:12:37] Artem Bulashev: Here
[2022-03-17T19:12:43] Artem Bulashev: Later than

[2022-03-17T19:27:40] Artem Bulashev: This vesc group is really smaller than it should be in theory
[2022-03-17T19:33:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well its not that old and vesc is not that common
[2022-03-17T19:33:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤷‍♂
[2022-03-17T19:34:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also who could spread the words better
[2022-03-17T19:58:14] Oliver Eliasson: Its +5-15 here but still snow melting on some places
[2022-03-17T22:26:01] Unknown: I think VESC is extremely common open source software. Lots of manufacturers make hardware implementing VESC software. Most esk8 guys use VESC only. Lots of scooter users. I used VESC (BlHeli32) and VESC tool for my drone and heli ESCs as well. I feel like the group should be bigger than it is as well. We mostly discuss scooters here except for @Happy_Giraffe on his ebike craze 🤣
[2022-03-17T22:30:17] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-17T23:08:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Where are these ppl bro, Bring em😁
[2022-03-17T23:12:36] Unknown: Haha I have no idea my man! I can share the group link on esk8 forums but do we want a bunch of skateboarders on here? That's a serious question 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-03-17T23:15:35] Unknown: I know VESC is VESC but a lot of our conversations are scooter based. Hell, I don't even use VESC myself but can relate to everyone on here because we're scooter nuts LoL
[2022-03-17T23:16:51] Oliver Eliasson: Without sounding condescending i like that it is focused on scooters, especially for new people it’s easy to get the wrong advice if i maybe frame a question wrong and get an answer that’s more geared towards skateboard and not scooters
[2022-03-17T23:16:54] Unknown: But I will say, esk8 and ebike guys know tons about battery building, motors, other controllers, etc.. so can probably add lots of useful info to the group even if not VESC based discussions
[2022-03-17T23:17:25] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah that’s true
[2022-03-17T23:18:02] Unknown: That's where my brain was going with it too... I use Nucular controllers but relate here because of general scooter conversations. And comparing VESC ubox to Nucular is fun LoL
[2022-03-17T23:18:15] Unknown: It's a double edge sword
[2022-03-17T23:19:08] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah, this is more of a scooter elite mod help group but that’s great
[2022-03-17T23:25:41] Unknown: So I just found/bought a new Nucular 6f and display to have as a spare in case one of my 12f controller shit the bed or my display breaks. I have the best luck finding these things haha. 6F would be perfect for front motor since 90a batt and 120a phase limit. I'm a total nut
[2022-03-17T23:28:10] Unknown: Damn things are like gold!! Especially with a display and both new with the box
[2022-03-17T23:28:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: some 3d rendering. just launched an SLS printing test in china. we'll see the result.

[2022-03-18T00:01:52] Unknown: My question would have been WTF how much F is 19C? 🤣🤣
[2022-03-18T00:02:25] Unknown: I hate imperial system but my brain is already programmed incorrectly to use it
[2022-03-18T00:03:56] Unknown: Fractions suck and Fahrenheit temperature makes no sense whatsoever.
[2022-03-18T00:04:31] Artem Bulashev: what is top left corner?
[2022-03-18T00:05:47] Unknown: 3+ML That isn't an obvious one to me either. Speed mode?
[2022-03-18T00:05:48] Artem Bulashev: lol
[2022-03-18T00:06:00] Unknown: Medium Low?
[2022-03-18T00:06:40] Unknown: Haha. It's painfully true
[2022-03-18T00:07:44] Artem Bulashev: auton also took me a sec to realise it is remaining range estimation - but I don't think there is better word to describe it short and clear
[2022-03-18T00:08:53] Artem Bulashev: may be motor MTEMP coudl pop up when moter gets to specified temp level like 78c? because its helpful but not needed at all times unless it gets boarder line hot
[2022-03-18T00:09:37] Artem Bulashev: just brain storming 🙂
[2022-03-18T00:09:59] Artem Bulashev: I'm sure one cna manually switch to see it
[2022-03-18T00:18:18] Artem Bulashev: btw @koxx3 I have seen some people talk on forums that SLS is more cost effective than MJF, but only untill you need to produce less than 100 parts - due to the process of MJF where more parts can be done at once or something. just FYI in case it may be usefeull. Strength properies are same as I remembr.
[2022-03-18T01:30:40] Unknown: 🤗🤗

[2022-03-18T06:56:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But also skates would more mix the usuall chaos, also i dont what numbers they work with etc
[2022-03-18T07:01:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Totally agreed, We are mostly scooting here I would say near Vesc ,whole is different for them Whole thing physically and in setup also

[2022-03-18T19:02:18] Paolo ⁭: How much max speed?
[2022-03-18T19:04:39] Happy Giraffe: He did 58mph so maybe like 97kmh, I wonder how much is max with load. Go for a run in highway place you know😅
[2022-03-18T19:12:49] Unknown: max was 58mph but still was pulling. i didn't have the balls yet to go faster. I bet can do easy 65mph loaded even with my fat ass on it

[2022-03-18T19:24:52] Mirono escooters: Tighten screws first tho
[2022-03-18T19:25:06] Mirono escooters: Imagine monoshit screw shaking loose
[2022-03-18T19:25:19] Mirono escooters: I was riding looked down and saw thé top left screw almost apart😅😅
[2022-03-18T19:25:49] Happy Giraffe: I havent needed to ever tighten them😳
[2022-03-18T19:25:57] Mirono escooters: Lucky you
[2022-03-18T19:26:04] Mirono escooters: I just went with better 12.9 steel ..
[2022-03-18T19:26:30] Mirono escooters: Old ones are 9.3mm too. Shit tolerances Now perfect 10 🤗 no shaking anymore. Before it bad bad shale

[2022-03-18T19:33:33] Paolo ⁭: Only for moment
[2022-03-18T19:33:49] Paolo ⁭: I’ve did all scooter from 0 including battery , frame etc in 1 week only
[2022-03-18T19:33:49] Mirono escooters: Okok
[2022-03-18T19:33:55] Mirono escooters: Be careful with cheap copy frame
[2022-03-18T19:34:09] Paolo ⁭: Fastest I did xd
[2022-03-18T21:29:08] Artem Bulashev: Adam I’m glad that project worked out so perfect 😇👍
[2022-03-18T21:29:25] Artem Bulashev: Motors I expect will get to 75c in summer, that’s ok even for magnets. I would try not to go above 80c . Looks like ferrofluid really helps your motors to get full potential
[2022-03-18T21:29:35] Artem Bulashev: What setting where those in controllers?
[2022-03-18T22:22:00] Paolo ⁭: Normally magnet support 120°C depends by motor
[2022-03-18T22:23:36] Artem Bulashev: Above 120 they get damaged and loose some performance non recoverable. 80-120c magnets loose performance but recover it when cooled
[2022-03-18T22:23:38] Artem Bulashev: Most
[2022-03-18T22:23:47] Artem Bulashev: There are different grades
[2022-03-18T22:24:18] Artem Bulashev: But generally you don’t want scooter motors magnets to get above 80c ideally
[2022-03-18T22:24:19] Paolo ⁭: Ly are N38H magnet capable of 120C
[2022-03-18T22:24:23] Paolo ⁭: HM. Idk
[2022-03-18T22:26:45] Artem Bulashev: Oh I don’t think most scooters use n38h
[2022-03-18T22:28:41] Artem Bulashev: But lower the better
[2022-03-18T22:28:49] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3083@18-03-2022_22-28-49.jpg>
[2022-03-18T22:28:52] Mirono escooters: Yea i stay under 80
[2022-03-18T22:29:08] Artem Bulashev: Look how much you loose between 20 and 80
[2022-03-18T22:30:14] Mirono escooters: So 20* magnets perform better then 80?
[2022-03-18T22:39:25] Unknown: Really is working great so far. Was messing with some settings on my display and the BMS cutout for like a minute, discharge/charge/balance went off and couldn't connect to Bluetooth, wasn't even discoverable. I powered it on/off via the little display button and it reset. All good now but was strange. Settings were: Speed 2 - front 45a batt 95a phase and rear 48a batt 120a phase Speed 3 - front 55a batt 120a phase and rear 58a batt 150a phase (where motor reached the 150F/66C
[2022-03-18T22:39:53] Artem Bulashev: Yes magnetic field is much stronger
[2022-03-18T22:41:46] Artem Bulashev: It has logs I think
[2022-03-18T22:43:00] Artem Bulashev: Or keep app open and connected to BMS than do screen recording and ride it again
[2022-03-18T22:43:08] Artem Bulashev: Than re view what error popes out
[2022-03-18T22:43:43] Artem Bulashev: May be it went to over voltage on regen ?
[2022-03-18T22:46:36] Mirono escooters: That's cool to know. So if you wanna drag race don't ride on warm motors
[2022-03-18T22:46:43] Mirono escooters: Would it make Sense to.. extra cool motors?
[2022-03-18T22:47:05] Mirono escooters: Superconductors are cooled extremely. But let's say you have some dry ice. 😅
[2022-03-18T22:49:45] Artem Bulashev: To some degree, after magnets are colder than some level they also loose magnetic strength I believe
[2022-03-18T22:53:09] Mirono escooters: Ah. Woops
[2022-03-18T22:54:47] Artem Bulashev: N38 magnets are 80c max
[2022-03-18T22:54:55] Artem Bulashev: But 38h 120c
[2022-03-18T22:55:10] Artem Bulashev: So I’m abit confused by what is n38h magnet 😂
[2022-03-18T22:55:53] Artem Bulashev: But yes Tmax for any magnet is at least 80c, which is what I would set it to for motors with ferrofluid
[2022-03-18T22:58:16] Paolo ⁭: Holes>>>
[2022-03-18T22:58:46] Paolo ⁭: Only if you ride in good tosd
[2022-03-18T22:59:03] Paolo ⁭: My motors are all with holes
[2022-03-18T22:59:17] Unknown: I wasn't riding it at the time.. literally standing next to it scrolling thru the controller menu 🤷🏻‍♂️ It's perfectly fine, no issues, just was a strange cut out
[2022-03-18T23:01:17] Unknown: What about like dust and little rocks n gravel? Does it get inside the holes?
[2022-03-18T23:06:46] Paolo ⁭: You can add net for protect like pc
[2022-03-18T23:11:19] Artem Bulashev: O__o
[2022-03-18T23:12:54] Mirono escooters: Belgium i could never
[2022-03-18T23:14:00] Paolo ⁭: New 75mm
[2022-03-18T23:19:32] Happy Giraffe: Grin guy said holes are ok for water as it comes in it also goes out😂 but I rather keep that away
[2022-03-18T23:28:55] Oliver Eliasson: @artBula do you use a steering damper?
[2022-03-18T23:48:56] Artem Bulashev: No I don’t
[2022-03-18T23:50:34] Oliver Eliasson: No need?
[2022-03-18T23:50:36] Artem Bulashev: But I didn’t fall twice because of our of control wobble. One time during 70kmh wind gusts right after I jumps a curb, I had a shopping bag on handle which acted like a sale and offset my steering… other time was only when I started, tried going 1 hand on poor quality road
[2022-03-18T23:51:07] Artem Bulashev: If you fit Touvt tire well than can drive 35kmh on perfect bike line one hand
[2022-03-18T23:51:12] Artem Bulashev: But I don’t advice
[2022-03-18T23:51:26] Artem Bulashev: Answer sucks, may be
[2022-03-18T23:51:41] Artem Bulashev: More of vsett group question ;-)
[2022-03-18T23:51:49] Oliver Eliasson: I have touvt tire already, came with scooter
[2022-03-18T23:52:34] Oliver Eliasson: I asked there but got no response😅 it mooves much faster people must have missed it
[2022-03-18T23:53:01] Oliver Eliasson: With or without steering damper?
[2022-03-18T23:55:20] Artem Bulashev: Without
[2022-03-18T23:55:52] Artem Bulashev: No wobble no vibrations at all for me once I fitted as per my guid and no flats for over 1k km (no air loss)
[2022-03-19T00:17:37] Oliver Eliasson: Will se i i make mouting brakets myself and buy a cheep one from aliexpress for 40€. 200€ for brakets etc is too expensive for right now
[2022-03-19T00:22:34] Unknown: Just put a solid 20 miles on with the new steering damper. Took a few miles to get the feel for it. This has quickly made me a firm believer that all scooters with the power and speed of Vsett 10+ should come stock with a steering damper. It's unbelievable how much more control it gives. We all think of steering damper as improving straight line stability, which is absolutely does. 45mph is no longer dicey or unstable at all, just sticks to it's line and goes. It also increases turning stability by tons. *Especially* turning at speed and hitting a rough patch, tire stays planted and exactly where it's pointed. Didn't realize how much I was always correcting the steering when hitting bumps and making small balance adjustments. Just made me fall in love with my 10+ all over again after 300+ miles. Highly recommended upgrade, right up there with suspension upgrade This was my review when I first got my damper
[2022-03-19T00:23:00] Unknown: It is a little tricky on the slow end making tight turns using the handlebars more than leaning because you actually need to use a certain amount of "force" to turn them. I feel like it's a big change but the more you ride with it, the more natural it becomes
[2022-03-19T00:26:21] Unknown: I feel like it has it's pros and cons.
[2022-03-19T00:27:38] Unknown: Making super fast adjustments, like trying to avoid a pothole at the last second, is tricky with the damper since steering mech isn't as freely moving. If set too stiff, front tire actually becomes less stable since small corrections are not easy to make
[2022-03-19T00:29:10] Unknown: I still like mine a lot and probably wouldn't feel safe at 50+mph without it. It definitely takes a bit of getting used to since you depend on leaning much more than actually "steering"
[2022-03-19T00:29:13] Artem Bulashev: For me huge pool stick on a side is just behhhh
[2022-03-19T00:29:29] Unknown: LoL. There's that too
[2022-03-19T00:29:42] Artem Bulashev: If it was one of those cool once up front
[2022-03-19T00:29:42] Unknown: Some may say it looks sophisticated 🤓haha
[2022-03-19T00:29:46] Artem Bulashev: I would go for it
[2022-03-19T00:29:50] Artem Bulashev: Under 200€
[2022-03-19T00:30:11] Unknown: Yes, like the Korean one, emaxx or something like that. Integrated into the steering assembly
[2022-03-19T00:30:13] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2022-03-19T00:30:25] Artem Bulashev: Exactly
[2022-03-19T00:30:31] Artem Bulashev: May be next project
[2022-03-19T00:30:37] Unknown: Those are like 500 bucks and not sure if they make one for Vsett yet
[2022-03-19T00:30:58] Artem Bulashev: Looks like time will be well spent if I design one haha
[2022-03-19T00:31:19] Unknown: As horrible as it sounds, on 10+... Tightening the steering assembly bolt to create some resistance actually helps a lot too
[2022-03-19T00:31:30] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-03-19T00:31:37] Artem Bulashev: Just beating may not like it
[2022-03-19T00:31:48] Unknown: Seriously. I have no idea why they're half as much as custom battery... But they are
[2022-03-19T00:32:01] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 300€ top
[2022-03-19T00:32:06] Artem Bulashev: Again off topic ;-)
[2022-03-19T00:32:09] Unknown: Yea, bearings can become notchy if over tightened
[2022-03-19T00:32:46] rosheee: y0
[2022-03-19T00:32:56] rosheee: XT90 max amps cont.?
[2022-03-19T00:33:02] Unknown: Fine balancing act between too tight and just right
[2022-03-19T00:33:15] rosheee: bms is 180A 😆 ^^'
[2022-03-19T00:33:15] Unknown: Not as high as you'd think...
[2022-03-19T00:33:29] rosheee: hmm

[2022-03-19T00:33:55] rosheee: @PaoloWu said it isn't possible to get thicker wires on spintend ubox
[2022-03-19T00:36:02] rosheee: battery is tight in frame
[2022-03-19T00:36:03] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-19T00:36:10] Unknown: I use as150 7mm bullets for my 150a battery/BMS with dual 10awg battery leads and 12awg controller leads. and 6mm bullets on 11awg phase wires on motors and 8awg phase wires from controllers
[2022-03-19T00:36:13] rosheee: <photos/photo_3085@19-03-2022_00-36-13.jpg>
[2022-03-19T00:36:39] rosheee: my 17S has 6AWG ^^'
[2022-03-19T00:36:45] rosheee: ubox has...idk 10awg xD
[2022-03-19T00:36:53] rosheee: use QS8 connect0r
[2022-03-19T00:37:06] Unknown: We are tight battery brothers
[2022-03-19T00:37:07] Unknown: <photos/photo_3087@19-03-2022_00-37-07.jpg>
[2022-03-19T00:37:11] rosheee: yah dude
[2022-03-19T00:37:20] rosheee: i had to take a lot away
[2022-03-19T00:37:34] rosheee: like 2-3mm each side
[2022-03-19T00:37:42] Unknown: I had qs8 on hand but liked the split housing of the as150 (POS and NEG not connected to 1 housing)
[2022-03-19T00:38:02] rosheee: i have no space
[2022-03-19T00:38:07] rosheee: can't even fit the motor wire inside
[2022-03-19T00:38:10] rosheee: need 40mm spacer omg
[2022-03-19T00:38:18] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-19T00:38:23] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-19T00:38:27] rosheee: batterie is 2 fat
[2022-03-19T00:38:28] Unknown: Damn... I just had to sand my inside deck lightly with 800 grit, probably took off .2mm on each side
[2022-03-19T00:39:22] Unknown: Mostly just took off the paint over spray so the deck was nice n smooth inside
[2022-03-19T00:39:22] Unknown: <photos/photo_3089@19-03-2022_00-39-22.jpg>
[2022-03-19T00:39:57] rosheee: YAH BUT U GOT THE FUCKING VSETT XD
[2022-03-19T00:40:17] Unknown: Battery slid in like a lubed up cucumber 😆
[2022-03-19T00:40:38] Unknown: 🤗
[2022-03-19T01:00:16] Artem Bulashev: You use two pairs of as150 (one per controller)
[2022-03-19T01:02:01] Artem Bulashev: Better heat transfer as well
[2022-03-19T01:04:52] Unknown: Oh right right... As150 X 2 👍
[2022-03-19T01:05:59] Unknown: Yup.. the 2.5mm thermal pads are definitely making good contact with the deck metal. Maybe that's one reason my battery stayed so cool today too 🤔 I actually forgot I put those thermal pads between the battery and deck LoL
[2022-03-19T01:06:39] Artem Bulashev: Neh
[2022-03-19T01:06:58] Artem Bulashev: 14.8amp short term is nothing for 48x
[2022-03-19T01:09:05] Artem Bulashev: It will hit up only if you keep it at that level for 30% capacity discharge
[2022-03-19T01:09:14] Artem Bulashev: 15ah
[2022-03-19T01:15:26] Unknown: That's really amazing. Thanks for clarifying that. These 48X are really impressive so far. voltage drop, even discharge/IR, temperature and capacity all seem to be exceeding my expectations. I would need a 5 mile stretch of road at 100% throttle to pull 15ah at 15a per cell (135a) LoL By the way, averaging 63 wh/km. I was pushing it though
[2022-03-19T01:17:16] Unknown: So *I believe* the display only shows phase amps and max power (watts) for 1 motor (the highest recorded of the 2 controllers hooked up)... So is this saying my rear motor pulled 8200w? Disregard the Regen wh, I put a small charge back into it for a night ride tonight lol
[2022-03-19T01:23:19] rosheee: Lol
[2022-03-19T01:23:19] rosheee: Awg6 wont fit xt90 xD
[2022-03-19T01:23:24] Unknown: Nope
[2022-03-19T01:23:35] Unknown: 8awg max
[2022-03-19T01:24:48] Unknown: As150 /QS8 can fit 6awg altho as150 is really really tight with 6awg...
[2022-03-19T01:25:28] Artem Bulashev: Single XT90 is only god for like 50amps long term
[2022-03-19T01:26:09] Artem Bulashev: 65 short time I suppose.
[2022-03-19T01:26:18] Artem Bulashev: Better use dual xt60
[2022-03-19T01:27:11] Artem Bulashev: Or as150 (those are pretty compact)
[2022-03-19T01:28:31] rosheee: <photos/photo_3091@19-03-2022_01-28-31.jpg>
[2022-03-19T01:28:34] Unknown: As150 are pretty small size housings for being 7mm bullets. QS8 is huge.
[2022-03-19T01:29:21] Unknown: The "split" POS and NEG design of the as150 really helped in my layout. Having a single housing for POS and NEG would've made running my wires tough
[2022-03-19T01:29:35] Unknown: 🤣🤣
[2022-03-19T01:30:05] Artem Bulashev: Thing 2 XT90 will do more than qs8
[2022-03-19T01:30:12] Artem Bulashev: Or about same
[2022-03-19T01:30:19] Artem Bulashev: But will take a lot less volume
[2022-03-19T01:30:19] rosheee: <photos/photo_3092@19-03-2022_01-30-19.jpg>
[2022-03-19T01:30:59] rosheee: Aiaiai
[2022-03-19T01:31:07] rosheee: Battery 2 huge for g30
[2022-03-19T01:33:08] Unknown: QS8 looks like the winner, just need to find a backpack to store it in 🤣🤣
[2022-03-19T01:33:33] Unknown: Create an external box or stem bag for your QS8
[2022-03-19T01:34:03] Artem Bulashev: Want something fun?
[2022-03-19T01:34:27] Happy Giraffe: Dual XT90S for antispark?
[2022-03-19T01:34:49] Artem Bulashev: XT90, xt150 As150 Look at 60c with 12 awg 😄😄
[2022-03-19T01:35:12] Artem Bulashev: Xt60 12awg - same 60c
[2022-03-19T01:36:28] Unknown: That's crazy
[2022-03-19T01:36:35] Artem Bulashev: Limiting factor is don’t need dual untispark. Connect AS first and than normal one second
[2022-03-19T01:36:49] Artem Bulashev: Coooing factor of the cable
[2022-03-19T01:37:25] Unknown: Oh yea very true... If you have smart BMS you can always turn off discharge being plugging in... No anti spark needed
[2022-03-19T01:37:29] Unknown: Yup exactly
[2022-03-19T01:37:35] Unknown: Garden hose effect
[2022-03-19T01:37:40] Artem Bulashev: Xt150 rated identical to as150, even though AS150 is larger bullet (but it has resistor so that just offsets it)
[2022-03-19T01:37:53] Unknown: That's right
[2022-03-19T01:37:57] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-03-19T01:38:25] Artem Bulashev: Direct solder battery to controller 🤣🤣
[2022-03-19T01:38:36] Unknown: I realized that after the fact LoL. I'm like wait... I can just shut off discharge and connect, no voltage no spark
[2022-03-19T01:38:54] Unknown: Haha.. that would be something. No losses!
[2022-03-19T01:39:07] Artem Bulashev: Yeah jkbms has antispark built in
[2022-03-19T01:39:18] Unknown: Haha, does it?
[2022-03-19T01:39:22] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-03-19T01:39:28] Artem Bulashev: Most smart full BMS do
[2022-03-19T01:39:28] Unknown: 🤦🏻
[2022-03-19T01:39:38] Happy Giraffe: Oh yes, forgot about that. Normal has bit less resistance
[2022-03-19T01:39:50] Unknown: Soo, I could've just used xt150 and been completely fine
[2022-03-19T01:39:58] Artem Bulashev: Yeah = less heat = less loss
[2022-03-19T01:40:34] Artem Bulashev: I try to have my total battery amp lim to be = than 50% of the plug
[2022-03-19T01:40:55] Artem Bulashev: So 60amp total batttry limit I take - 2 xt60 or as120 or above
[2022-03-19T01:41:20] Unknown: Good rule of thumb
[2022-03-19T01:46:25] Artem Bulashev: Xt150 are def most compact - a pair plugged in is like 40x10x20mm - XT90 with rear cover is 50x11x22mm But rated and mixed current is double !
[2022-03-19T01:47:07] Artem Bulashev: And with smart BMS you don’t need antispark bottle neck
[2022-03-19T01:52:07] rosheee: QS8 only
[2022-03-19T01:52:19] rosheee: No space
[2022-03-19T01:52:37] rosheee: XD this is rly dangerous now
[2022-03-19T01:53:05] rosheee: <photos/photo_3095@19-03-2022_01-53-05.jpg>
[2022-03-19T01:53:48] rosheee: Have to take motorcables on top
[2022-03-19T01:53:53] rosheee: 40mm spacer
[2022-03-19T01:53:58] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-19T02:00:18] Unknown: Wish I would have realized this before using as150. But I think since they fit and still using them under their rated continuous current there should be little to no ill effects versus xt150
[2022-03-19T02:00:59] Unknown: Making a spacer?
[2022-03-19T02:08:10] Artem Bulashev: Xt150 and as150 rate exactly the same
[2022-03-19T02:08:24] Artem Bulashev: Difference is less size but no antispark
[2022-03-19T02:09:55] Artem Bulashev: 7mm Tx150 do have lower resistance but interconnection surface is smaller (higher interconnection losses) = same ampacity rating = heating as 8mm as150
[2022-03-19T02:10:49] Unknown: Ahh, I gotcha... So would have simply had slightly smaller connectors is about it, correct?
[2022-03-19T02:11:00] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-03-19T02:16:26] rosheee: Have 2
[2022-03-19T02:19:21] rosheee: Fuck me xD

[2022-03-19T12:49:45] Artem Bulashev: There is no odo
[2022-03-19T14:09:30] Con Tassios: <photos/photo_3097@19-03-2022_14-09-30.jpg>
[2022-03-19T14:12:41] Happy Giraffe: That resets when you turn vesc off
[2022-03-19T14:13:24] Happy Giraffe: If I remember correctly, I'll test that
[2022-03-19T14:17:46] Con Tassios: I doubt it is supposed to reset when VESC is turned off, firmware changelog even says 'Odometer is now persistent after firmware updates'.
[2022-03-19T15:10:39] Happy Giraffe: Interesting, I will test soon
[2022-03-19T17:12:39] Happy Giraffe: Both odometer and trip zero on reboot for me
[2022-03-19T17:12:41] Happy Giraffe: 5.3

[2022-03-20T18:01:47] Unknown: Bro, how are able to control 15kw? LoL. Your torque must be insane. 8.4kw on Vsett 10+ 20s is pretty nuts. Is it because of the higher kv 60v motors I have running on 72v? Acceleration is blazing fast. 8.4kw Vsett motor temps are 65C absolute max so far, usually more like 50-55C not pushing way hard. So definitely can handle quite a bit more more phase amps and probably another 20-25 battery amps total. Must be the higher kv motors making 8.4kw almost scary fast haha. Does that sound right?
[2022-03-20T18:01:48] Unknown: <photos/photo_3107@20-03-2022_18-01-48.jpg>
[2022-03-20T18:03:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, I've ridden 25+kW escooters so 15kW is not quite impressive now
[2022-03-20T18:03:33] Face de Pin Sucé: I have high kV motors too
[2022-03-20T18:03:43] Face de Pin Sucé: 39kV if I remember well
[2022-03-20T18:04:18] Unknown: Hmm... I wonder what kv Vsett motors are...
[2022-03-20T18:04:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Make it spin max speed on air
[2022-03-20T18:04:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Look at the voltage
[2022-03-20T18:05:06] Unknown: Does this tell anything regarding motor KV?
[2022-03-20T18:05:07] Face de Pin Sucé: And divide RPM/voltage and you get your KV
[2022-03-20T18:05:39] Unknown: ERPM / voltage?
[2022-03-20T18:06:15] Face de Pin Sucé: RPM = ERPM/Poles pairs
[2022-03-20T18:06:25] Face de Pin Sucé: So 487/15 for you
[2022-03-20T18:06:36] Face de Pin Sucé: You have 32kV motor
[2022-03-20T18:06:39] Unknown: 32
[2022-03-20T18:06:46] Unknown: Ahh.. gotcha!! Thanks man
[2022-03-20T18:07:07] Unknown: 32kv on 20s... Is that high?
[2022-03-20T18:07:38] Unknown: I'm not really sure where that falls.. high, low, mid
[2022-03-20T18:08:07] Face de Pin Sucé: To be sure, you should look at max speed on air
[2022-03-20T18:08:15] Face de Pin Sucé: But 32kV is high speed yes
[2022-03-20T18:08:24] Face de Pin Sucé: 22kV is very low speed
[2022-03-20T18:08:39] Face de Pin Sucé: And 26-30 is mid speed
[2022-03-20T18:09:16] Unknown: 👍... I'll check it out next time I have a full charge on the stand
[2022-03-20T18:09:30] Unknown: Gotcha.. awesome info. Thank you man
[2022-03-20T18:10:10] Face de Pin Sucé: 🤝
[2022-03-20T18:11:04] Artem Bulashev: Lol man you are going 100+ kmh under load
[2022-03-20T18:11:18] Artem Bulashev: So that’s fast for scooter = high kv
[2022-03-20T18:11:43] Unknown: 57mph just now... Had PLENTY of top speed left in the tank. No field weakening at all
[2022-03-20T18:12:03] Happy Giraffe: Thats perfect if you have enough amps to push for the motor
[2022-03-20T18:12:05] Unknown: Surprisingly stable with damper believe it or jot
[2022-03-20T18:12:25] Face de Pin Sucé: With your motors you could reach 115Kmh in 20S
[2022-03-20T18:12:38] Unknown: I'm running 110a total right now 110 x 84v = 8400w
[2022-03-20T18:12:59] Artem Bulashev: For an airplane that would be super low. So that “high, mid, low” is only made man terms of individual and subjective classification for specific type of transport (for motorbike that would not be high)
[2022-03-20T18:13:00] Happy Giraffe: Seems like enough👍
[2022-03-20T18:13:04] Unknown: 71mph 😬
[2022-03-20T18:13:45] Unknown: Understood. Doesn't seem like a big number (32kv) but this baby flies LoL
[2022-03-20T18:15:05] Unknown: Battery can easily handle 135a.. probably even 150a in short bursts.. so still have plenty of headroom for more battery amps
[2022-03-20T18:15:09] Happy Giraffe: If you had lower Kv motor it would give more torque at beginning but power ends sooner and it heats up more
[2022-03-20T18:15:35] Happy Giraffe: If amps and phase amps is not a problem and you want to go fast then always go for high Kv
[2022-03-20T18:15:36] Unknown: Can easily push 10kw since motors hit 65c max so far
[2022-03-20T18:15:51] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2022-03-20T18:15:52] Unknown: That makes perfect sense 👍
[2022-03-20T18:16:30] Happy Giraffe: Exactly, thicker copper winding has less resistance. For the torque you can compensate by pushing more amps, and it still heats less than low Kv motor🌚
[2022-03-20T18:16:54] Unknown: And BMS temp sensor at cells reached 22C, so even at 110a the battery is barely warm
[2022-03-20T18:17:14] Unknown: Very interesting
[2022-03-20T18:18:27] Happy Giraffe: Seems like you have a nice balanced setup there. Especially in summer the resistance advantage becomes huge
[2022-03-20T18:19:20] Unknown: 66 wh/km tho... Is that very inefficient? I think maybe higher kv motors become inefficient at higher amp load, correct? I mean, I have 43ah battery so range is no issue
[2022-03-20T18:19:47] Happy Giraffe: Thats 85% air resistance
[2022-03-20T18:20:03] Unknown: = my fat ass
[2022-03-20T18:20:05] Unknown: 🤣🤣
[2022-03-20T18:20:14] Happy Giraffe: You make air drag multiple times compared to a car😀
[2022-03-20T18:20:19] Unknown: But wow.. really huh
[2022-03-20T18:20:39] Unknown: That's extremely interesting to think about
[2022-03-20T18:21:00] Unknown: I also have a big winter jacket on, catching all the air
[2022-03-20T18:21:14] Unknown: Still chilly here at 50mph lol
[2022-03-20T18:21:25] Happy Giraffe: Air resistance increases in squared, if you ride 40kmh 28mph let's see again

[2022-03-20T20:42:16] Oliver Eliasson: Seams like it should at least be somewhat close to yours not under half
[2022-03-20T20:45:19] Happy Giraffe: Maybe it doesnt measure consumed energy correctly?🤔
[2022-03-20T20:45:37] Happy Giraffe: Because air resistance alone should make it more
[2022-03-20T20:45:42] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah also suspects that
[2022-03-20T20:47:18] Oliver Eliasson: At 53.7v now
[2022-03-20T20:48:07] Happy Giraffe: You could calculate it based on the voltage used

[2022-03-20T20:48:48] Oliver Eliasson: Was at 58.5-58.6

[2022-03-21T02:46:51] Happy Giraffe: Should mass produce in china for 4k🌚
[2022-03-21T04:01:47] Unknown: Agreed. Altho, the uniqueness of it is because it's literally hand made. Would be like if Nucular sold to Chinese mass production... They would no longer have the quality control and hands on support they have. It's a double edge sword type of deal with these small batch custom made products
[2022-03-21T04:03:59] Unknown: Just pushed 8.8kw on a night ride on 3/4 charge. It's about 0C/32F outside. Absolutely frozen solid haha
[2022-03-21T04:04:46] Happy Giraffe: Nucular was russian? I think the company is now majorly fucked as west banned some chip/tech transport to Russia
[2022-03-21T04:04:51] Unknown: Mass production would be like worrying about solder balls with Nucular. Not going to happen

[2022-03-21T04:18:35] Happy Giraffe: This is arriving the 120kw territory damn
[2022-03-21T04:18:54] Unknown: Yup.. their largest controller is 160kw capable
[2022-03-21T04:19:30] Unknown: Seems to have auto learn feature and mobile app... The guy developing them sounds like he knows his shit
[2022-03-21T04:19:36] Happy Giraffe: I dont even want to imagine motor torque at those currents, Kawasaki Ninja ZH2 is a toy
[2022-03-21T04:20:55] Unknown: Haha... Yea seriously. Uphill mountain climbing and e-motorcycle capable of 250kmh. I dunno but some guys are drooling over them and obviously have a motor and battery to handle it 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-03-21T04:21:36] Unknown: Would need a damn shipping container to house a 1200a battery 🤣🤣
[2022-03-21T04:22:14] Unknown: Like I said, no idea... Just happen to come across it. They do also make much smaller controllers, more realistic in size
[2022-03-21T04:22:45] Happy Giraffe: I want to see finished builds from this when they are done😂
[2022-03-21T04:23:24] Unknown: OMG me too. I'm follow it and the guys purchasing them so hopefully will see something on endless sphere regarding a build
[2022-03-21T04:25:19] Happy Giraffe: I try to be happy with a higher torque QS205😂 This is what I learned to go one bigger size motor if I want low kv. Then I never overheat but still get the insane power😁 motor weighs 12kg...
[2022-03-21T04:29:20] Unknown: That's on the realistic side of things. Still a great motor capable of tons of power... These guys are just whacked the hell out... I'm running 8.5kw on my Vsett 10 and I'm scared unless I have a few drinks first 🤣. No idea how these guys run 15kw+ on a scooter. The guys running these far driver controllers at 800 battery amps are probably dirt bikes or converted street bikes, which makes sense
[2022-03-21T04:30:42] Happy Giraffe: I can later pay 1000€ for the polish company to mod my motor for 30kw peak but thats not possible using Spintend😂
[2022-03-21T04:35:47] Unknown: Unfortunately not with spintend... Even Nuc 24F is 20kw max
[2022-03-21T04:36:10] Unknown: They were making/shipping the 24F until just recently
[2022-03-21T04:36:41] Happy Giraffe: And I got the shittiest Spintend that throttled at 100A phase stock😂 I will see what comes out first, Paolo vesc or Single Ubox v2
[2022-03-21T04:37:03] Unknown: Those Nucular guys are too valuable to lose. I hope they pull thru big time
[2022-03-21T04:37:17] Unknown: Paolo VESC sounds promising
[2022-03-21T04:37:38] Unknown: Those far driver controllers sound promising too...
[2022-03-21T04:38:16] Happy Giraffe: In the end its not a lot what we need, 200A phase and we are good to go on most motors.

[2022-03-21T10:41:03] D J: I was waiting 6 months for my order, after 6 months they told me that they still didn't have aluminum boxes available for controllers (I had 2 nucular 6f in the order)
[2022-03-21T11:12:52] Paolo ⁭: Ask them share you step file for box and self produce
[2022-03-21T11:21:31] D J: It's been a year since I made this order. now bought spintend. let's see how it goes
[2022-03-21T13:49:33] Artem Bulashev: Even 20p won’t cut it without cooling
[2022-03-21T13:50:00] Artem Bulashev: Need 32p to make it continues in the deck 😀
[2022-03-21T13:51:13] Paolo ⁭: Usually they use lipo or lifepo4 for that discharge
[2022-03-21T13:51:33] Artem Bulashev: Bricks
[2022-03-21T13:51:39] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-03-21T13:51:40] Paolo ⁭: ?
[2022-03-21T13:52:17] Paolo ⁭: Available also cylindrical lifepo4
[2022-03-21T13:53:46] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3117@21-03-2022_13-53-46.jpg>
[2022-03-21T13:53:50] Artem Bulashev: Those
[2022-03-21T13:54:10] Artem Bulashev: Single one is like 60ah and 200a discharge
[2022-03-21T13:54:49] Artem Bulashev: In russia we call them Bricks 🧱
[2022-03-21T13:56:16] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3118@21-03-2022_13-56-16.jpg>
[2022-03-21T13:58:13] Happy Giraffe: Portable Tsar bomba
[2022-03-21T14:00:59] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣
[2022-03-21T14:01:06] Paolo ⁭: lifepo4 are much much more safe than li ion
[2022-03-21T14:01:21] Artem Bulashev: lol 4p of those will not be much portable 🤣🤣
[2022-03-21T14:02:12] Artem Bulashev: Would fit like mini golf cart….. not sure why it would need 800a battery current nominal 🤣🤣🤣

[2022-03-21T14:04:03] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-21T14:04:16] Artem Bulashev: Da hell is that 🤣🤣🤣

[2022-03-21T14:44:52] Face de Pin Sucé: We pay 25€ for the afternoon
[2022-03-21T14:45:08] Paolo ⁭: How much guys?
[2022-03-21T14:45:40] Face de Pin Sucé: We are 4 today
[2022-03-21T14:48:26] Paolo ⁭: Then afternoon for 100€? 😍
[2022-03-21T14:48:45] Paolo ⁭: Here a shit track ask us 100€ for 1h
[2022-03-21T16:51:00] Face de Pin Sucé: It's open trackday so you come and just pay 25€ 😁
[2022-03-21T17:53:00] Happy Giraffe: How hard would it be to create a fingerprint speed limiter?
[2022-03-21T17:54:23] Happy Giraffe: Or vesc profile switcher based on fingerprint

[2022-03-21T18:42:30] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌
[2022-03-21T20:01:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We had guy with similar made for shopping Custom gocart body under it E car engine Drag race battery Can show you,but older vid guess few ppl did it
[2022-03-21T20:02:19] Unknown: 😍
[2022-03-21T20:13:47] Oliver Eliasson: A friend wants to increase the range of his scooter. He has a 52v 18ah battery. If he gets another 52v18ah is it just to wire them in parallel or something else to consider?
[2022-03-21T20:16:43] Mirono escooters: Yes parallel. Make sure to match v beforehand
[2022-03-21T20:17:02] Oliver Eliasson: Fully charge you mean?
[2022-03-21T20:17:32] Oliver Eliasson: Can you wire so you can charge both at the same time?
[2022-03-21T20:18:01] Oliver Eliasson: If not can you have both battery connected if charging one then the other?
[2022-03-21T20:18:58] Mirono escooters: Full charge is easiest solution to match v
[2022-03-21T20:19:05] Mirono escooters: Parallel does that already
[2022-03-21T20:19:13] Mirono escooters: It keeps each other same v
[2022-03-21T20:19:29] sombre_enfant: Only if bms common port
[2022-03-21T20:24:20] Oliver Eliasson: Okey so if you have extra battery in bag on stem you only need to run down 1 cable for discharge? And when charging the original battery it will automatically charge the second battery on the stem?
[2022-03-21T20:27:19] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-03-21T20:28:14] Oliver Eliasson: Could you plug in an extra charger to the second battery if it has wires for it? Think he has a 2a charger so would take a long time to charge
[2022-03-21T20:29:23] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-03-21T20:29:36] Mirono escooters: I have 3 charge ports for this purpose xd
[2022-03-21T20:30:44] Oliver Eliasson: Okey thanks, so all he needs really is the battery and some xt90:s and wire (or a parallel y split)
[2022-03-21T20:31:16] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-03-21T23:17:30] Artem Bulashev: Well depending on his scooter (some have 2 charging ports right away)
[2022-03-21T23:18:26] Artem Bulashev: It doesn’t matter where you connect 2 chargers if batteries are parallel in discharge port (common) or discharge and charge port (split BMS)
[2022-03-21T23:19:24] Artem Bulashev: Chargers in parallel act the same as two controllers in parallel, each does what it needs
[2022-03-21T23:20:40] Paolo ⁭: That’s vesc or kelly
[2022-03-21T23:22:50] Luis Magalhaes: I think its vesc his using
[2022-03-21T23:23:33] Artem Bulashev: If external battery gets full later than internal than you will see - charger 1 goes green - cahrger 1 goes green - one charger than starts charging again minimal current (CV mode) (it is topping up internal battery that moved some mah into external battery due to physics of equalization) If both internal finishes first than step 3 won’t happen ( no over charge of external is possible because in CV mode changer doesn’t push amps)
[2022-03-21T23:23:54] Artem Bulashev: Don’t worry 👍
[2022-03-21T23:43:54] Face de Pin Sucé: VESC
[2022-03-21T23:44:26] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb tomorrow i receive the cables and halls
[2022-03-21T23:44:29] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-03-21T23:44:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh yeahh
[2022-03-21T23:44:56] Oliver Eliasson: Could you use a 60v charger on a 52v battery for a short time or not at all?
[2022-03-21T23:45:18] Luis Magalhaes: Lets see if this week it runs, but i dont have my new battery yet too
[2022-03-21T23:46:29] Oliver Eliasson: If you are at 40% and charge 30min with 60v (16s) 2a charger to gain back a little range. Or would that be bad for the battery etc?
[2022-03-21T23:46:34] Paolo ⁭: Lets see if this week it runs, but i dont have my new battery yet too
[2022-03-21T23:53:14] Luis Magalhaes: I did see that one time, but i dont think its a good thing, why would you do that? If you dont bring your charger and use someone's charger?
[2022-03-21T23:55:21] Oliver Eliasson: Exactly that, if i forget or cant bring my own charger and use someone else’s charger.
[2022-03-22T00:02:09] Luis Magalhaes: Wait for someone smarter 😂
[2022-03-22T00:02:33] Mirono escooters: Well it's possible but not optimal
[2022-03-22T00:02:40] Luis Magalhaes: @artBula i know you want to explain this
[2022-03-22T00:11:12] Unknown: Which VESC?
[2022-03-22T00:11:37] Paolo ⁭: He own developed
[2022-03-22T00:13:19] Unknown: Oh right right. Seems like a beauty
[2022-03-22T00:13:42] Paolo ⁭: We never seen it hahaha
[2022-03-22T00:15:10] Unknown: Think about it like this... Our lithium cells are rated and given a lifespan based off of charge/discharge cycles. They don't really care how long or deep each of those cycles is. Micro charging does, in a way, count as a cycle. So you're stressing and wear the cells unnecessarily. I'd say to top off once in a while is fine, no real harm done but always topping off can prematurely wear the cells since they count as "cycles" to some extent
[2022-03-22T00:16:35] Unknown: Haha. Well, it sounded like that thing was ripping on the track. I imagine it blows ubox out of the water. I guess isn't saying too much for a high powered setup LoL.
[2022-03-22T00:18:34] Paolo ⁭: Idk if we will see in further hahaha
[2022-03-22T00:44:40] Unknown: Holy shit. Just got my spare Nucular 6F and display. It is sooo sooo tiny! Haha. 90a batt 120a phase max. 4000w. 100% potted. Perfect for front motor if it's needed.
[2022-03-22T00:44:41] Unknown: <photos/photo_3126@22-03-2022_00-44-41.jpg>
[2022-03-22T00:47:10] Paolo ⁭: Same as flipsky 75100😅
[2022-03-22T00:54:32] Unknown: But... Not 😉
[2022-03-22T00:55:08] Unknown: I can't believe how small it is. So funny. 12F is a lot bigger LoL
[2022-03-22T01:02:11] Unknown: Hard to believe this tiny little thing is capable of 4000w. I mean, it's not a huge number but for the size it's pretty impressive
[2022-03-22T01:19:27] Paolo ⁭: Size is same as flipsky
[2022-03-22T01:19:47] Paolo ⁭: Flipsky has same hardware capabilities
[2022-03-22T01:44:29] Unknown: Interesting. Flipsky isn't built quite like a Nuc. I've heard of many Flipsky failures and I don't really follow them much.. This is also 100% potted. Can operate under water LoL. I never, actually even once, heard a Nuc failing from normal operation. Also, no such thing as "solder balls" in Russia 😜 Hardware capability equal, size equal but nothing else equal 🤓
[2022-03-22T01:46:28] Paolo ⁭: I tried everything in panic. I hit the brakes really hard but It doesn't do very much when motor is locked with full power. I pushed even the electronic Regen brake and rotated the gas. I was thinking maybe somehow it got in to cruise control. But that does not fix it. Key was the last thing I was thinking of. But luckily it worked.
[2022-03-22T01:46:31] Paolo ⁭: Mhhh
[2022-03-22T01:46:38] Paolo ⁭: A little more dangerous
[2022-03-22T01:46:40] Unknown: I would be very interested to try a quality VESC. It's been a long time since I've used a VESC but I really like their software and mobile app. Just a shame there aren't high power high quality hardware to match. Hence why Sucé made his own
[2022-03-22T01:47:15] Unknown: That was a once off... Field weakening was too high. And still not a failure. He's still using the same controller
[2022-03-22T01:47:40] Unknown: User error
[2022-03-22T01:48:16] Paolo ⁭: System should be to relieve when is too much field weakening
[2022-03-22T01:48:25] Unknown: There have a few software bugs in their updates but those are usually taken care of quickly. Don't even make me go back in this chat and find all the Flipsky issues LoL 😆
[2022-03-22T01:49:00] Paolo ⁭: That’s normal, you have different price and crazy waiting time
[2022-03-22T01:49:04] Unknown: I KNOW we aren't trying to compare Flipsky to Nucular... Sorry Paolo. That will not be a discussion
[2022-03-22T01:49:07] Paolo ⁭: I personally hate flipsky lol
[2022-03-22T01:49:12] Unknown: Haha
[2022-03-22T01:49:21] Unknown: Fair enough brother.
[2022-03-22T01:49:28] Paolo ⁭: But I don’t think so you can get bigger power
[2022-03-22T01:49:37] Paolo ⁭: I just taking about power capabilities
[2022-03-22T01:50:00] Paolo ⁭: You can get 120a phase and 90A batt with 75100 too
[2022-03-22T01:50:10] Unknown: Absolutely... I just couldn't resist saying that's where the differences end is all
[2022-03-22T01:50:47] Unknown: Is that how small a Flipsky 75100 is?
[2022-03-22T01:50:50] Paolo ⁭: I’ve burned 5 flipsky in 3 month xd
[2022-03-22T01:50:53] Unknown: Same size as 6F?
[2022-03-22T01:51:03] Unknown: So small!!! Like tiny baby controller
[2022-03-22T01:51:05] Paolo ⁭: Is more little than 6F
[2022-03-22T01:52:26] Unknown: Gotcha. I opened the box and was like, where's the controller?! Haha. My 12Fs are beefy but 150a batt and 250a phase 10kw, is expected
[2022-03-22T01:52:51] Unknown: Does VESC have a similar controller to 12F?
[2022-03-22T01:53:02] Unknown: Power wise?
[2022-03-22T01:53:06] Paolo ⁭: Sucé ‘s vesc
[2022-03-22T01:53:26] Unknown: Ah ha. Nothing like "off the shelf" though?
[2022-03-22T01:53:56] Unknown: Do you remember his VESC capabilities?
[2022-03-22T01:54:28] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3102@20-03-2022_12-14-58.jpg>
[2022-03-22T01:55:03] Unknown: 15kw. Damn. Per motor/controller? Or total?
[2022-03-22T01:55:21] Paolo ⁭: Idk
[2022-03-22T01:55:23] Paolo ⁭: Ask him
[2022-03-22T01:55:59] Unknown: 510a 😯
[2022-03-22T01:56:20] Paolo ⁭: For both controller I think
[2022-03-22T01:57:06] Unknown: @SibClimb was curious what your VESC's are rated at power wise. Batt amps, phase amps, total wattage... Impressive numbers so far 😁
[2022-03-22T01:57:17] Unknown: Gotcha... Makes sense LoL
[2022-03-22T01:58:10] Unknown: Do higher phase amps affect maximum wattage pulled? Or only battery amps?
[2022-03-22T01:58:16] Paolo ⁭: I need 700amps for both motor😔
[2022-03-22T01:58:29] Paolo ⁭: Only battery amps
[2022-03-22T01:58:34] Unknown: 🥰 love it man.
[2022-03-22T01:58:39] Unknown: Got it. Thank you
[2022-03-22T01:58:50] Unknown: Battery??
[2022-03-22T01:59:07] Paolo ⁭: Phase
[2022-03-22T01:59:24] Paolo ⁭: I was with sabvoton 350 phase each
[2022-03-22T01:59:28] Paolo ⁭: But too big
[2022-03-22T01:59:39] Unknown: 👍👍. Huge power
[2022-03-22T02:00:10] Unknown: Oh really? What can offer the power but not so big? Sucé VESC?
[2022-03-22T02:01:05] Paolo ⁭: Kelly 7218 or 7230
[2022-03-22T02:12:56] Unknown: Smaller than sabvoton?
[2022-03-22T02:14:17] Paolo ⁭: 7218 is arround 1/4 of sabvoton
[2022-03-22T02:14:34] Paolo ⁭: 7218 is 200A peak and sabvoton 350
[2022-03-22T02:16:54] Unknown: Hmm.... So safe to say equal Kelly would be similar size?
[2022-03-22T02:20:13] Unknown: Nuc 24F is 300a battery and 500a phase per motor/controller. Size is very reasonable, quite small I think for the output. 24F aren't very difficult to find but would need display. And people are straight gouging pricing right now bc of short supply. Hopefully they can move to a better place and start higher production. Maybe coming to Italy 🥰
[2022-03-22T02:20:13] Unknown: <photos/photo_3129@22-03-2022_02-20-13.jpg>
[2022-03-22T02:20:41] Unknown: Would be perfect for you @PaoloWu
[2022-03-22T02:21:28] Unknown: Russian brains with Italian production. Can't really get much better than that
[2022-03-22T02:22:55] Unknown: 3 year warranty with potting and 2 year without. That's unheard of in our world
[2022-03-22T02:23:51] Paolo ⁭: Yes but that waiting time is impossible for me
[2022-03-22T02:24:47] Unknown: Well, put that aside... If they move and are able to increase production, it would be a whole new world opened up for us. Just saying
[2022-03-22T02:25:31] Paolo ⁭: They are able to increase production
[2022-03-22T02:25:48] Unknown: They are thinking of moving to Italy. Seriously considering it from what I hear
[2022-03-22T02:25:52] Paolo ⁭: But they don’t take this as serious work, just they looking it as hobby
[2022-03-22T02:26:09] Paolo ⁭: Whut
[2022-03-22T02:26:10] Unknown: I have wondered that myself...
[2022-03-22T02:26:17] Unknown: <photos/photo_3124@21-03-2022_20-02-19.jpg>
[2022-03-22T02:26:26] Unknown: Tuscany
[2022-03-22T02:27:19] Paolo ⁭: Yes but nuc will don’t share their project
[2022-03-22T02:27:23] Unknown: I think this is their full time job. Only Russia and pandemic really hurt them
[2022-03-22T02:27:27] Unknown: They might
[2022-03-22T02:27:41] Unknown: That's the exciting part about it
[2022-03-22T02:28:37] Unknown: I'm praying for them (I'm not religious) but still really praying they're able to do something. Products are amazing. Such a shame they are impossible to attain right noe
[2022-03-22T02:28:41] Paolo ⁭: They are very near with china, is very easy to get components at cheap price for them
[2022-03-22T02:29:27] Paolo ⁭: But if they want self product and not plan for mass production …
[2022-03-22T02:29:44] Unknown: I really don't know the hold up but they are extremely active on telegram and were fulfilling orders until the war started. If they can move and ramp up production they would be huge
[2022-03-22T02:30:04] Unknown: I know.. it's a delicate balance I think. Between mass production and keeping quality
[2022-03-22T02:30:28] Unknown: We'll see... I really hope so. For them and for us
[2022-03-22T02:32:21] Unknown: They were in the process of creating a Canbus BMS to integrate. Their controllers and uLight module are amazing. If they could complete BMS project it would be entire ecosystem, full set-up with all components communicating and working in sync
[2022-03-22T02:32:59] Unknown: That's the dream I suppose 🤓
[2022-03-22T02:34:39] Unknown: Imagine a 20kw controller communicating with lights, brakes, turn signals and battery/BMS at the same time, all shown on the display. Everything keeps everything in check, safe and efficient. That's their hope and dream. I hope they can make it happen
[2022-03-22T02:38:51] Paolo ⁭: In Italy are very much more production cost between Russian lol
[2022-03-22T02:41:23] Unknown: So maybe more $? I would be happy to pay for a set of controllers that will essentially out last my frame, possibly last indefinitely 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-03-22T02:43:51] Unknown: They actually weren't that expensive to begin with, if you could get one. Display was $110, koxx display is looking like 3x that. 12F controller was $300 the last time they had it posted... So 2 12F and display around $750. A worthwhile invest if you ask me
[2022-03-22T02:44:50] Unknown: So even if an entire dual setup with display was $1k... I'd be happy to spend that for a phenomenal setup
[2022-03-22T02:45:54] Unknown: ...Considering 2x Kelly would be in the 500-600 range with no display
[2022-03-22T02:46:18] Unknown: Possibly more for an equal power setup
[2022-03-22T02:46:33] Unknown: 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-03-22T05:27:23] Gigolo Joe: Can get even more actually

[2022-03-22T07:52:09] Face de Pin Sucé: I currently have trouble with high currents, but it's designed for 400A phase and 200-250A battery
[2022-03-22T07:52:47] Mirono escooters: What's thé price for this baby?
[2022-03-22T07:59:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Side bolted mosfets on this too?
[2022-03-22T07:59:56] Mirono escooters: Most likely in that format
[2022-03-22T08:00:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I hate all of that crap heatbox 😅
[2022-03-22T08:01:47] Happy Giraffe: Flipsky burns hotter
[2022-03-22T08:01:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I let them mosfets free 😁 Amd remount whole to have chance to heat bridge properly
[2022-03-22T08:02:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True
[2022-03-22T08:02:21] Happy Giraffe: Wtfff
[2022-03-22T08:02:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well , Paolo could tell🤣
[2022-03-22T08:04:16] Happy Giraffe: Isnt unlocked sabvoton 450?
[2022-03-22T08:04:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This was ?
[2022-03-22T08:04:49] sombre_enfant: @PaoloWu I wait for your flipsky review on the ducati with the data🥸
[2022-03-22T08:06:11] Happy Giraffe: This is why I also got 4 piston magura in front with metallic pads😂
[2022-03-22T08:06:25] Happy Giraffe: Whatever goes wrong the brake is stronger than motor
[2022-03-22T08:07:45] sombre_enfant: I wish theres tiny moped brake i seen some on scooter but cant get wich model it is
[2022-03-22T08:08:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also not sure how much is nuc in price compared 🤷‍♂
[2022-03-22T08:09:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Flip cheap solution, however on first check had no extra balls like Spintend And its dev is high school fella or something like that
[2022-03-22T08:11:10] Mirono escooters: Flipsky is way better with solder balls. Always Found it weird you have to check 300€ esc for solder balls xd
[2022-03-22T08:14:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hope it will be neat , also probably your (our) crazyness lvl is much higher than devs , sadly we cant be wind under there wings ,but hopefully at a point we can help our mate
[2022-03-22T08:16:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well story is abnormal in way ,i cant even imagine that , but we dont know or see all ,but to have proper hidro is Always a win
[2022-03-22T08:16:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do you know the speed rate of yours?
[2022-03-22T08:17:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I seen some also , and to use one would be so neat
[2022-03-22T08:17:46] Happy Giraffe: What do you mean?
[2022-03-22T08:18:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Moped ,pocket bike pitbike world has cheap brakes What beats all bike ones ,but mostly made for thicker disc
[2022-03-22T08:19:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Usually there is a dedicated maximum speed ,if you have Higher speeds you need bigger brakes
[2022-03-22T08:19:27] Happy Giraffe: Aah, idk Mt5e is s pedelec
[2022-03-22T08:20:05] Happy Giraffe: But already scooter rpm is 3x, energy is same tho
[2022-03-22T08:21:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mt5e designed max for 45km/h
[2022-03-22T08:22:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This a recommended number ,so they keep ass safe i guess 🤷‍♂
[2022-03-22T08:28:51] Mirono escooters: Mz with xtech and 60kmh.. :))
[2022-03-22T08:36:23] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_3131@22-03-2022_08-36-23.jpg>
[2022-03-22T08:36:56] sombre_enfant: But on front

[2022-03-22T08:37:04] sombre_enfant: Me*
[2022-03-22T08:37:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This looks a shitty autoset one
[2022-03-22T08:37:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Avoid does
[2022-03-22T08:38:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Brake glides right to left on two axis
[2022-03-22T08:38:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats autoset to middle😂
[2022-03-22T08:38:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On a moped from engine you dont hear it
[2022-03-22T08:38:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But on these
[2022-03-22T08:39:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: One i modified ,axles to bolts to be able to set,never again
[2022-03-22T08:39:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you want i show you ,but that bit bigger
[2022-03-22T08:39:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Pads inside 1,5 cm wide
[2022-03-22T08:39:56] sombre_enfant: But piston are way more huge and pads too, its for quad and pit so designed for more mass to move....
[2022-03-22T08:40:23] sombre_enfant: Would be tuff to fit that on g30 monorim with big motor
[2022-03-22T08:40:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The axis i talk About
[2022-03-22T08:40:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This all true what you say
[2022-03-22T08:41:06] sombre_enfant: Yeah its on a kind of spring
[2022-03-22T08:41:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But avoid autoset ,it makes noises all the time
[2022-03-22T08:41:26] sombre_enfant: So it move shouldnt be a prob at all
[2022-03-22T08:41:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Makes you nuts😅
[2022-03-22T08:41:52] sombre_enfant: I already always had sound prob i bent like 6 disk
[2022-03-22T08:41:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can try but you will be not happy
[2022-03-22T08:42:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But why
[2022-03-22T08:42:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Jumps?
[2022-03-22T08:43:12] sombre_enfant: Never
[2022-03-22T08:43:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Only good thing in these is big pads and caliper ,oil tube like your pinky ,so when you have to brake its not problem
[2022-03-22T08:43:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than how do they bent
[2022-03-22T08:43:36] sombre_enfant: Heat i guess and not high quality one
[2022-03-22T08:43:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh
[2022-03-22T08:44:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than you brake a lot
[2022-03-22T08:44:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Buy better disc like happy has
[2022-03-22T08:44:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Really
[2022-03-22T08:44:37] sombre_enfant: My setup wasnt that much rigid too so when it move...
[2022-03-22T08:44:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Disc overusage can end up brake disc brokes at 50
[2022-03-22T08:45:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thats not fun
[2022-03-22T08:45:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: One of my mate was able to to it
[2022-03-22T08:45:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In next round disc ripped off half scooter front
[2022-03-22T08:46:33] sombre_enfant: Its designed for bike and on 29" rim at 15-30kph not for scooter at 60-80 on 10"
[2022-03-22T08:46:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Worst thing is that i was buggin him to change disc ,new arrived ,this was last day of old disc usage ,lucky that he uses lot gear
[2022-03-22T08:47:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True
[2022-03-22T08:48:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Last week a mate of mine
[2022-03-22T08:48:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_3133@22-03-2022_08-48-57.jpg>
[2022-03-22T08:48:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_3134@22-03-2022_08-48-57.jpg>

[2022-03-22T08:49:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Front flat at 45kmh ,this is all what happened with him or the scooter
[2022-03-22T08:49:55] sombre_enfant: Thats tuff
[2022-03-22T08:50:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah lucky that he has proper helmet and was in leather motor jacket
[2022-03-22T08:51:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So no injuries at all
[2022-03-22T09:19:02] Mirono escooters: Me*
[2022-03-22T09:19:43] Mirono escooters: Problem with xtech is it has no reinforcing metal so it tube goes it doesnt have any structural strenth
[2022-03-22T09:20:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh
[2022-03-22T09:20:11] Mirono escooters: Sorry typeaids
[2022-03-22T09:20:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Adhd better
[2022-03-22T09:20:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thc good for it😁
[2022-03-22T09:22:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Xtech is cheap clone of an old Shimano so for its price kinda ok, near that really small amount of oil in it what dies fast
[2022-03-22T09:24:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Best outcome so far with it ,was like Get a new ,get calipers out shine them too mirror I drilled bigger internal holes for oil ,but this is not too easy , than all together rebleed, use
[2022-03-22T09:27:14] Mirono escooters: I have that too 🤗
[2022-03-22T09:27:21] Mirono escooters: Idk what i take. Something
[2022-03-22T09:27:42] Mirono escooters: Xtech for price i cant complain. Works fine for most (cheap) scooters
[2022-03-22T09:27:54] Mirono escooters: Atleast better then stock xiaomi Brake 😂😂😂
[2022-03-22T09:32:01] Happy Giraffe: Actually slowing scooter tire has less torque on brakes I think as radius is smaller. So on scooter it gets stressed less.
[2022-03-22T09:32:42] Happy Giraffe: Energy of moving mass is same but it slows down more gently and not as violent as a bike
[2022-03-22T09:36:55] sombre_enfant: But less efficient ig so more energy loss
[2022-03-22T09:38:13] Happy Giraffe: Heat production is same and you can get max 160/180mm rotor so yeah
[2022-03-22T09:38:54] Happy Giraffe: Cant wait to test 223mm
[2022-03-22T09:39:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅🙈
[2022-03-22T09:40:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you take what doc gives you🙈🙈🙈🙈
[2022-03-22T09:41:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Actually for adhd they give 🤔 how to explain this in a nice way
[2022-03-22T09:42:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: amphetamine derivatives , actually pretty close to speed ,they have given ppl this eu wise
[2022-03-22T09:43:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I had mate here and one next to you in the Nl
[2022-03-22T09:43:51] Happy Giraffe: Speeeeed, then you go fast af like RS
[2022-03-22T09:44:09] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-22T09:44:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its not really that ,but since this is a disease whole turns different
[2022-03-22T09:45:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Weed is better for it,for sure
[2022-03-22T09:45:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔 some would say Rs is a New page in the book
[2022-03-22T09:46:09] Mirono escooters: Yes doc knows better
[2022-03-22T09:46:21] Mirono escooters: 😂 heard this before
[2022-03-22T09:46:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But actually Rs is full new book
[2022-03-22T09:46:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its actually true
[2022-03-22T09:47:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically i am talking edibles from cbd
[2022-03-22T09:49:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sadly i cant agree 😅 they know so less And to know would need testing ,but nowdays human testing is forbidden if you are not testing for corona
[2022-03-22T09:49:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😏
[2022-03-22T09:53:56] Mirono escooters: 😂
[2022-03-22T09:53:57] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-03-22T09:56:33] Happy Giraffe: 32 x 84v and then rpm calculation on 10" wheel
[2022-03-22T10:01:03] Oliver Eliasson: My ubox dident have any solder balls so maybe they have fixed it?
[2022-03-22T10:02:00] Mirono escooters: Hope so
[2022-03-22T10:19:18] Paolo ⁭: How 9000w?
[2022-03-22T10:29:14] Paolo ⁭: Max is 90v
[2022-03-22T10:35:50] Paolo ⁭: The electronic hardware is based to 100v components. 90v is already much, generally stay safe voltage is 20s to prevent spikes
[2022-03-22T10:42:26] sombre_enfant: Poor stm😐
[2022-03-22T10:43:50] Paolo ⁭: Stm no problem because resistor are capable for over 100v. But the reverse spikes can damage capacitor and mos or other components like voltage converter etc
[2022-03-22T10:45:15] Happy Giraffe: I want to see flipsky temps using 100A battery current😂
[2022-03-22T11:10:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Single?
[2022-03-22T11:12:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sadly i can only provide 55 with this bms if i ever have time trying filip😂
[2022-03-22T11:13:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But me too curios
[2022-03-22T11:14:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The smaller one was nice but has half the power only ,but it comes without Stupid box with nice mount ,was suprised on that
[2022-03-22T11:16:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So far 35c° was its max
[2022-03-22T11:19:09] Oliver Eliasson: 75v dual
[2022-03-22T11:24:29] sombre_enfant: U made a scoot with a flipsky ? The one with blade motor ?
[2022-03-22T11:27:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That had no balls so far we have know , problem was in the single one
[2022-03-22T11:27:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: No this is another
[2022-03-22T11:27:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Blade Spintend 13s
[2022-03-22T11:27:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This smallest filip with 12s 350w ali engine with added temp sensor
[2022-03-22T11:28:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I search you pictures if you like to see
[2022-03-22T11:30:26] SirGeoff: This is mine! 😁 Flipsky mini v6.7, 55A motor amp, 30A battery amp, 12S battery
[2022-03-22T11:31:19] Oliver Eliasson: Oh okey
[2022-03-22T12:52:24] Gigolo Joe: Already done With proper cooling it doesn't overheat
[2022-03-22T12:53:00] Happy Giraffe: And that proper cooling is?
[2022-03-22T12:53:15] Gigolo Joe: Dm
[2022-03-22T12:58:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Why dm ?
[2022-03-22T12:58:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Just share here mate
[2022-03-22T12:59:34] sombre_enfant: Gatekeeping on cooling 🤨
[2022-03-22T13:00:23] Unknown: LoL. No secrets around these parts
[2022-03-22T13:00:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Gatekeeping on bullets soon
[2022-03-22T13:00:56] Gigolo Joe: Screw the controller to the frame Other than that, think of other creative solutions
[2022-03-22T13:07:01] Unknown: Use the frame itself as a heatsink. Thermal pad/paste. I believe Happy did that with uBox, correct? Mounting controller(s) externally can help tremendously with direct airflow. A fully (and properly) potted controller can be mounted anywhere since weatherproof and the proper potting compound can help cooling tremendously since it connects components with outer metal housing
[2022-03-22T13:08:07] Gigolo Joe: Cooling the 75100 with direct air doesn't really help... it need B I G heatsink
[2022-03-22T13:09:45] Paolo ⁭: Flipsky have lot better heat dissipation than ubox single
[2022-03-22T13:10:05] Paolo ⁭: You have much better thermal transfer
[2022-03-22T13:10:11] Unknown: Nucular controllers that are potted run much cooler than non-potted. It's cools in the same function as ferrofluid... It essentially creates a connection (route for heat to escape) directly from the components to the outer shell just like ferrofluid connects stator to magnets type thing
[2022-03-22T13:10:27] Unknown: Hmm... Interesting
[2022-03-22T13:10:40] Paolo ⁭: I want see nuc 6f in full power
[2022-03-22T13:11:01] Unknown: I wonder if ubox can be potted. Flipsky has same "box" like housing as Nuc so potting would be easy
[2022-03-22T13:11:03] Paolo ⁭: I think use 12f at 130A phase can’t show his real temps
[2022-03-22T13:11:13] Paolo ⁭: Should be used at 250A
[2022-03-22T13:12:02] Gigolo Joe: Nuc12f at 130 phase amp is a joke... Dude is running 12f on 135 battery amps and 250 phase Fookin beast
[2022-03-22T13:12:03] Paolo ⁭: You have no method due to mosfet type. Ubox and nuc uses TO220 than you can fix with screw, with ubox that’s impossible because it’s smd mos
[2022-03-22T13:17:23] Unknown: Definitely not, my 12Fs are mounted externally and barely get above ambient. That's the point, using controllers at 60% capacity they will last forever and run very efficient
[2022-03-22T13:18:15] Unknown: Since mounted externally, space is not an issue. Using 2 6F instead would gain me nothing
[2022-03-22T13:18:44] Unknown: Oh I see.
[2022-03-22T13:28:54] Happy Giraffe: Single has case design error
[2022-03-22T14:58:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lovely
[2022-03-22T14:59:00] Artem Bulashev: 75/100 is the only worth while flips it and that is not even their design
[2022-03-22T14:59:03] Artem Bulashev: 😁
[2022-03-22T15:00:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Could you show or explain what you mean under potted?
[2022-03-22T15:01:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Or needs to sand top and use it as bottom 🤷‍♂
[2022-03-22T15:02:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Whole is not🤷‍♂
[2022-03-22T15:05:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its always easier to step on road when somebody was Before you🤷‍♂
[2022-03-22T15:08:12] Artem Bulashev: Potting helps to transfers heat from entire pcb and other components on pcb that act as thermal mass
[2022-03-22T15:08:44] Artem Bulashev: So you can pot anything and it will help to reduce fets temp Indirectly
[2022-03-22T15:10:06] Artem Bulashev: Considering design of single Punic that is done wrong and causes fets to drop heat into pcb mainly, potting may be very effective as it would allow pcb to transfer heat a lot better than air
[2022-03-22T15:12:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thanks but potting word confuses me what he ment under ,like english is poor ,for some reason it gets me closer t grandma potting something 🤣😅
[2022-03-22T15:14:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I usually make custom adapter to the ones what have mosfets to bolt ,so shit box bye bye and bolt with adapter to frame
[2022-03-22T15:14:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Frame outer side huge heatsink
[2022-03-22T15:15:16] Artem Bulashev: It means submerging sort of
[2022-03-22T15:15:34] Unknown: A potted Nucular controller is filled fully with a silicone based compound. It makess them 100% waterproof since entire housing is filled and components are protected. The potting compound also has thermal properties, essentially like thermal paste that connects internal components to the outer housing, allowing them to radiate heat out to the housing. So the housing acts as q huge heatsink for internal components
[2022-03-22T15:15:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Proper paste ,heat bridged out to outer sink what has airflow
[2022-03-22T15:15:56] Artem Bulashev: Holly shit
[2022-03-22T15:16:01] Artem Bulashev: That’s next level
[2022-03-22T15:16:10] Unknown: They operate them in a bucket of water LoL
[2022-03-22T15:16:27] Unknown: As a test, before sending them out to the consumer. 100% waterproof
[2022-03-22T15:17:23] Artem Bulashev: Thats requires airflow. In the deck there is non so have to deal with passive
[2022-03-22T15:17:52] Artem Bulashev: Potting allows heat to be transferred away from whole thing instead of only what touches the heat pad / past
[2022-03-22T15:18:16] Artem Bulashev: I have seen some people pot vesc
[2022-03-22T15:18:21] Artem Bulashev: But often it caused issues
[2022-03-22T15:18:28] Unknown: I believe they have a solution that dissolves it, so repairs are possible but not easy for the user. Also, internal ports are off limits, so when buying a potted controller from them you must specify which ports you want wired. Usually just need canbus and halls unless you need PAS or pwm
[2022-03-22T15:18:28] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know why
[2022-03-22T15:21:46] Paolo ⁭: Same as mantis or wolf controller
[2022-03-22T15:21:46] Unknown: There are probably countless types of compounds out there. I know the Nuc guys use the proper "stuff". They don't recommend potting by the user since they have no idea what will be used. Could be a matter of using the wrong type of compound. Theirs also expands slightly as it dries, so it fills in all the small places and leaves mo air bubbles. There are compounds that could definitely expand too much and cause strain on the internals and housing. Obviously (very obvious) its important to use non conductive compound and when applying it, all capacitors must be discharged fully
[2022-03-22T15:22:11] Unknown: 🤷🏻‍♂️ oh nice. I didn't know that
[2022-03-22T15:22:37] Paolo ⁭: But I think they did this for prevent cloning 😂
[2022-03-22T15:24:00] Unknown: Makes sense. Nucular is optional, specified by the buyer at time of purchase. Non potted units have 2 year warranty and potted have 3 year. So they are expecting the potted units to experience less vibration, less heat and overall longer lasting... I suppose
[2022-03-22T15:25:46] Unknown: I'm sure it helps tremendously in dirt bike setups where guys are jumping and riding off road. Non potted would be subject to all those vibrations and strain. Potting compound reduces that type of strain on all the internal components by keeping them snug in place
[2022-03-22T15:57:51] Mirono escooters: Got mine 🤗
[2022-03-22T15:58:14] Mirono escooters: If i don't have the connectors.. where can i find them?
[2022-03-22T16:06:42] Gigolo Joe: Hobby shop/aliexpress
[2022-03-22T16:07:20] Gigolo Joe: If you have any shop that deals with rc stuff (boats/cars/helis) you can check there
[2022-03-22T16:07:47] Mirono escooters: Anyone know thé name of connectors? There r many sizes
[2022-03-22T16:47:35] Mirono escooters: Solder balls 🤗🤤

[2022-03-22T16:59:13] Mirono escooters: Also
[2022-03-22T17:00:23] Mirono escooters: Are thé screws grounded?
[2022-03-22T17:01:36] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-03-22T17:01:51] Artem Bulashev: But if two phases get exposed that’s phase short
[2022-03-22T17:03:15] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-03-22T17:03:20] Mirono escooters: Ill add some isolation
[2022-03-22T17:03:45] Mirono escooters: Spintend doesnt seem to be "replying immediately" as they say xd Does it need Batt power or a on off button to work when connected via USB c?
[2022-03-22T17:18:21] Unknown: <photos/photo_3150@22-03-2022_17-18-21.jpg>
[2022-03-22T17:19:44] Unknown: I think there was something you need to be careful about when using USB C... Ground loop? Others would know better than I but remember Koxx may have burned one like that
[2022-03-22T17:20:41] Unknown: by the way, i also fried a spintend by connecting usb port (ground loop i guess), so now, i tend to do everything wireless(bleutooth for mobile and wifi for computer)
[2022-03-22T17:21:18] Mirono escooters: I don't wanna put more € in it if i don't know if it works tho
[2022-03-22T17:21:22] Unknown: @Mirono_escooters might want to inquire with some guys about that before using USB C port
[2022-03-22T17:21:41] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-03-22T17:21:46] Unknown: 👍
[2022-03-22T17:23:07] Mirono escooters: No manual? 😅
[2022-03-22T17:27:54] Mirono escooters: It could make Sense it doesnt power on without battery, but it also does not 😂 Power button also same story. Damnet that i don't have it
[2022-03-22T17:29:12] Mirono escooters: To turn on without button. I cant figure out wich port it is Gnd and sw ? It has 2 led ports (for thé button?) Just short thé 2 pins?
[2022-03-22T17:33:04] Oliver Eliasson: Well it is in the middle of the night there so thats maybe why. I chatted with them this morning and they replied within 5 minutes
[2022-03-22T17:33:29] Mirono escooters: Hmm ok. Site reported that they we're online. Prob a bug :)
[2022-03-22T17:34:46] Oliver Eliasson: Oh yeah same
[2022-03-22T17:35:19] Oliver Eliasson: Send them by messenger or mail
[2022-03-22T17:35:26] Oliver Eliasson: Messenger is easiest i think
[2022-03-22T17:49:05] Happy Giraffe: They have always replied within 2-3 working hours to me🌚
[2022-03-22T18:20:32] Mirono escooters: I have time 🤗
[2022-03-22T18:39:36] Happy Giraffe: Chinese working time is different also
[2022-03-22T18:42:09] Mirono escooters: I kno
[2022-03-22T18:43:05] Happy Giraffe: I'm amazed you were willing to spend the 250€
[2022-03-22T18:44:11] Happy Giraffe: To add for that Im scared how high will Spintend price the Single Ubox V2
[2022-03-22T18:44:48] Mirono escooters: :? Me?
[2022-03-22T18:46:34] Happy Giraffe: Yes😂
[2022-03-22T18:46:41] Mirono escooters: Ah i didnt Tell you all
[2022-03-22T18:46:46] Mirono escooters: I paid 30£ 🤗
[2022-03-22T18:47:02] Mirono escooters: That's why i am missing cables and a powerbutton😂😂
[2022-03-22T18:47:34] Happy Giraffe: Oh, its the possibly broken one I think. I asked Abs if it was a vesc of someone I know but he didnt reply because I think its fried.
[2022-03-22T18:47:44] Mirono escooters: Yes. His
[2022-03-22T18:48:05] Mirono escooters: He told me thé story It died when riding (powerbutton light whent off) Didnt invrstigate just replaced So yep. :)
[2022-03-22T18:48:17] Mirono escooters: I had a shipment from him anyways so worth a bet
[2022-03-22T18:49:02] Happy Giraffe: Let's see, maybe it can be easily fixed if broken. Im just used to people being honest when selling stuff so I avoided😅
[2022-03-22T18:49:06] Mirono escooters: First ill try to get it working on pc, then i can focus on connectors. :)
[2022-03-22T18:49:15] Mirono escooters: He was honest to me
[2022-03-22T18:49:23] Mirono escooters: LOng time customer. I trust him
[2022-03-22T18:49:27] Happy Giraffe: Lets see😂
[2022-03-22T18:49:31] Mirono escooters: I got a Free motor cover :)
[2022-03-22T18:49:46] Happy Giraffe: Well thats 30£ atleast
[2022-03-22T18:49:52] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-03-22T18:50:32] Mirono escooters: Does spintend have a limit on how low your. S is?
[2022-03-22T18:51:01] Mirono escooters: I have a 3s Batt w xt90 on it. Hence y i am Wondering Not hooking up to a power supply and pc at once. Possible ground loop
[2022-03-22T18:57:49] Happy Giraffe: Main rules to install a VESC : 1/ connect battery only once everything else is plugged 2/ if >= 20s, precharge capacitors even with xt90s/xt150s before pluging the battery 3/ if the VESC was plugged to the battery before, once battery is unplugged, empty capacitors by powering it again with power button 4/ never plug anything above 3.3v on ADC input (like 5v throttle) 5/ never plug/replug something while VESC is powered 6/ never make ground loops : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_loop_(electricity) 7/ when something isn't working always think about the 6 previous rules before making any mistake

[2022-03-22T19:26:57] Artem Bulashev: Looks so small
[2022-03-22T19:27:50] Artem Bulashev: They need to make dual 150a phase 70a battery controller
[2022-03-22T19:27:58] Artem Bulashev: Market would be huge
[2022-03-22T19:28:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Normaly its a mean thing to say this to a man 🤣

[2022-03-22T19:45:08] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2022-03-22T19:45:16] Mirono escooters: Even connector fitted
[2022-03-22T19:46:41] D J: it's good to know it works. maybe it's a good solution for me too 🙂
[2022-03-22T19:46:59] Mirono escooters: It's a small display but gives me all info i 'eed
[2022-03-22T19:48:51] D J: exactly! small but with the most important information. what port is it plugged into?
[2022-03-22T19:52:22] Mirono escooters: Thé biggest one. With RX and TX
[2022-03-22T20:12:57] Mirono escooters: A.yone here got spare spintend cables/power button and bluetooth module? I don't wanna pay taxes and wait so long
[2022-03-22T20:13:38] Happy Giraffe: Someone should talk sense to spintend about including tax beforehand, not so fucking hard to include +24%
[2022-03-22T20:22:38] Artem Bulashev: It is
[2022-03-22T20:23:18] Artem Bulashev: lol I actually think it is HUGE
[2022-03-22T20:26:31] Happy Giraffe: How? One person would be enough for them to do manually as they dont move volume. Could charge 10€ fee for prepaid tax and everyone wins
[2022-03-22T20:26:57] Mirono escooters: Ioss
[2022-03-22T20:33:56] Artem Bulashev: As B2P from china to EU it is not easy to ship with eu tax incl without buyer being forced to pay again. It is a bureaucratic mess
[2022-03-22T20:34:51] Mirono escooters: Alieexpress always works for me
[2022-03-22T20:35:40] Artem Bulashev: If you get it as Aliexpress Shipping method (not Chinese post and others)
[2022-03-22T20:36:02] Mirono escooters: Still works with cainao and such
[2022-03-22T20:36:13] Mirono escooters: Or im Lucky. Belgium processes it good and quick
[2022-03-22T20:36:31] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-03-22T20:36:57] Artem Bulashev: All non aliexpress standard / savvier that I ordered arrived with customs to be paid to Austria
[2022-03-22T20:37:04] Artem Bulashev: But it was 4 month ago
[2022-03-22T20:37:12] Oliver Eliasson: Maybe have will check
[2022-03-22T20:37:13] Artem Bulashev: May be they finally cleared things up
[2022-03-22T20:37:15] Mirono escooters: In beginning 1 parcel with weird shipment method got stuck
[2022-03-22T20:37:18] Mirono escooters: Hero
[2022-03-22T20:53:07] Happy Giraffe: Fucking EU at it again
[2022-03-22T21:19:53] Artem Bulashev: Than again
[2022-03-22T21:20:14] Artem Bulashev: All taxes are handled by aliexpress as well as payments - not small businesses
[2022-03-22T21:20:22] Artem Bulashev: Also it is only handled up to 150€
[2022-03-22T21:20:33] Artem Bulashev: Above that tax is not incl usually
[2022-03-22T21:20:43] Artem Bulashev: No obligation to include
[2022-03-22T21:26:34] Happy Giraffe: Spintend just shoots itself on foot here sadly
[2022-03-22T21:26:39] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-03-22T21:26:48] Mirono escooters: Meanwhile flipsky has alieexpress ioss
[2022-03-22T21:26:50] Mirono escooters: :)
[2022-03-22T21:27:11] Happy Giraffe: Spintend could sell accessories through ali
[2022-03-22T21:27:44] Happy Giraffe: Make them 20% more expensive or whatever but Im not gonna pay 30€ tax and duty for 20€ bt module😂
[2022-03-22T21:29:08] Artem Bulashev: Order on Ali
[2022-03-22T21:29:35] Artem Bulashev: Yes I already spoke with them about it Ele time ago
[2022-03-22T21:29:38] Artem Bulashev: It is in works
[2022-03-22T21:37:47] Paolo ⁭: only two little capacitor wtf
[2022-03-22T21:38:38] Paolo ⁭: I think they’ve sacrificed much important things for this
[2022-03-22T21:40:34] Mirono escooters: Have to make small somhow
[2022-03-22T21:41:36] Artem Bulashev: Well reliability is top notch and performance as well, so guess not really. I do see an other cap under wires
[2022-03-22T21:42:36] Artem Bulashev: What are the dimensions like this?
[2022-03-22T21:42:49] Artem Bulashev: And 6f is same dimensions?
[2022-03-22T21:43:16] Paolo ⁭: Be sure not for ebikes. Ebikes need very much capacitor
[2022-03-22T21:44:15] Paolo ⁭: It’s too without current filter
[2022-03-22T21:44:25] Mirono escooters: And scooters not? Where is thé diff
[2022-03-22T21:44:42] Paolo ⁭: Much more spikes in ebike
[2022-03-22T21:44:49] Mirono escooters: Why?
[2022-03-22T21:45:22] Paolo ⁭: Big wheel and motor than escooter
[2022-03-22T21:50:38] Artem Bulashev: Yeah Back emf increases with increase in number of coils or size of the coils. Large starter will have larger coils. Large wheel will require lower Kv = more turns = more back EMF = more spikes
[2022-03-22T21:51:31] Artem Bulashev: Those controllers are mainly targeting larger bikes and large scooters
[2022-03-22T21:52:35] Artem Bulashev: I don’t see much complaining but yeah it is Interesting how they managed to keep it contained this is 250a phase 150a battery, fairly rated controller
[2022-03-22T21:54:36] Paolo ⁭: 12f but yeah different size
[2022-03-22T22:11:01] Oliver Eliasson: What cable you nnee?
[2022-03-22T22:12:19] Oliver Eliasson: <photos/photo_3156@22-03-2022_22-12-19.jpg>
[2022-03-22T22:12:38] Oliver Eliasson: I have adc board with all the cables for it
[2022-03-22T22:13:17] Oliver Eliasson: Thats about it. But i think the 3 pin cable can be solderd to powerbutton
[2022-03-22T22:19:58] Artem Bulashev: Not sure what you meant :) what is that?
[2022-03-22T22:21:17] Paolo ⁭: 6 capacitor for 12 mos
[2022-03-22T22:21:45] Mirono escooters: Hmm it's something 🤔
[2022-03-22T22:21:58] Mirono escooters: I do have Found that generic Jumper wires fit in, so that's another solution
[2022-03-22T23:23:10] Unknown: These mostly used on e-bikes. High power single motor e-bikes. Scooters are the outlier. They're designed with pedal assist, clutch settings and cruise control specifically for mid drive e-bikes... And obviously work amazing on hub motors too. There have been no sacrifices made in the production of these controllers
[2022-03-22T23:24:47] Unknown: 12F is quite a bit bigger than 6F. 12F and 24F have same width and height but 24F is simply longer (60mm longer to be exact)
[2022-03-22T23:25:08] Unknown: <photos/photo_3157@22-03-2022_23-25-08.jpg>
[2022-03-22T23:27:28] Unknown: It has always been a talking point how they were able to squeeze such power into these small dimensions. One of the many beauties of them. I can tell you with certainty they didn't cut corners or leave out any essential components to keep the size small
[2022-03-22T23:35:11] Paolo ⁭: Ask they if have current filter
[2022-03-22T23:48:10] Unknown: A low pass filter?
[2022-03-22T23:49:25] Unknown: Low pass cut-off filter...?
[2022-03-22T23:53:13] Paolo ⁭: No this is a hardware thing not easy to explain
[2022-03-22T23:53:56] Unknown: Oh gotcha... Just want to know what I'm asking. It's simply a "current filter"
[2022-03-22T23:55:55] Paolo ⁭: Also I want know if has tvs diodes
[2022-03-22T23:59:55] Unknown: I certainly don't mind asking questions but I literally don't know what I'm asking LoL. So, Current filter and tvs diodes...?
[2022-03-23T00:12:11] Unknown: Ok, keep your eye on Nuc chat. I asked the best way I knew how
[2022-03-23T02:29:35] Artem Bulashev: don't forget it is a system, nearly no soldering. all lights and horn and so on controlelr though pnp external board so tvs diods on 12v 5v may be out there.
[2022-03-23T02:30:01] Artem Bulashev: they do state that all line have voltage sensing and HW current protection - likely tvs diod
[2022-03-23T13:07:45] Artem Bulashev: Spintend got back to me about solder balls on your Single. This revision you have 1.2 is very old one, they since have changed QC and solder - no more solder balls
[2022-03-23T13:08:22] Artem Bulashev: That explains why all new 75/200 and 100v dual arrive without solder balls in recent posts 😊👌
[2022-03-23T13:20:04] Happy Giraffe: Good news
[2022-03-23T13:37:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes , but still check
[2022-03-23T16:12:20] Happy Giraffe: Copper not big enough to fit mosfets😢
[2022-03-23T16:12:53] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I should find a broken AMD TR4 cooler and use that finstack on spintend😂
[2022-03-23T16:16:46] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-03-23T16:18:51] Happy Giraffe: Spintend genius put mosfets 1mm in different level so cooling is fucked right away😂
[2022-03-23T16:21:31] Mirono escooters: Haha yea saw thzt
[2022-03-23T16:21:33] Mirono escooters: Smort
[2022-03-23T16:38:52] Happy Giraffe: @artBula Did they tell you more about Single V2?
[2022-03-23T16:39:19] Happy Giraffe: I hope it won't exceed 300$ price😅
[2022-03-23T16:42:17] Mirono escooters: Just get flipsky at that point for those specs
[2022-03-23T16:45:42] Unknown: They just released another new firmware to correct the 1 Issue someone had with over field weakening (the issue Paolo forwarded the other day from Nuc chat). They also adjusted some PIDs and added some other field weakening safety nets. A user and the developer is testing the new PIDs and they are making adjustments as they go. This type of service isn't found anywhere else. They said the questions from Paolo regarding the current filter and tvs diodes were "very unspecific" 🤷🏻‍♂️ LoL. Regardless, as Artem mentioned when looking at the system as a whole those may be mundane aspects since their controllers work very well with the current design.
[2022-03-23T19:00:55] Artem Bulashev: Didn’t ask
[2022-03-24T01:13:31] Unknown: @PaoloWu did you see the new firmware they released to fix that 1 issue of over field weakening? 1 known occurance and new firmware with field weakening safety nets because of it. Pretty awesome if I say so myself 😉
[2022-03-24T01:14:26] Paolo ⁭: I will able to review them only when I have one xd
[2022-03-24T01:14:34] Unknown: I can't imagine another manufacturer that would reimplement a new firmware over 1 incident
[2022-03-24T01:14:50] Unknown: Understood 👍 hopefully soon bro
[2022-03-24T01:15:14] Paolo ⁭: I will never buy up to when no they will reduce waiting time
[2022-03-24T01:15:19] Unknown: I praise them because I use them 🙏
[2022-03-24T01:15:36] Unknown: Hopefully that will happen in the near future
[2022-03-24T01:15:42] Paolo ⁭: 3 month is max as waiting time ;(
[2022-03-24T01:16:10] Unknown: I think, that is not unreasonable... hopefully they will be able meet that request
[2022-03-24T01:17:27] Unknown: Up until recently they were making and shipping 24F. Would dual 24F fit for you? 86x43x185?
[2022-03-24T02:10:54] Paolo ⁭: Problem is $$$$$$$
[2022-03-24T02:19:08] Unknown: C'mon. You get what you pay for my man!
[2022-03-24T02:19:25] Unknown: Best of the best isn't cheapo crap
[2022-03-24T02:20:24] Unknown: You know this...
[2022-03-24T02:20:48] Unknown: Still way way cheaper than trampa VESC LoL
[2022-03-24T02:21:14] Unknown: And you get an amazing display. Trampa has no such display
[2022-03-24T02:22:22] Unknown: Their display has me floored. So nice to see what's happening real time without mounting your phone via Bluetooth. CanBus (Nuc levcan) is much faster and responsive than Bluetooth could ever be
[2022-03-24T02:24:14] Unknown: That alone is huge... Plus you make ALL controller adjustments via display... No phone app or PC needed. Display is adjustable with screen heating, button color to suit your wants, throttle/brake calibration all thru display... And so much more
[2022-03-24T02:25:52] Unknown: Display communicating to controllers (up to 8 controllers by the way) via levcan canbus is amazing. Virtually zero lag time
[2022-03-24T02:26:10] Paolo ⁭: Trampa same shit as flipsky 75200
[2022-03-24T02:26:23] Paolo ⁭: Random firework
[2022-03-24T02:26:38] Unknown: Could be... But Nucular is way advanced between both of them put together
[2022-03-24T02:27:05] Paolo ⁭: I always called them nuclear and seem now it’s name is nucular lol
[2022-03-24T02:27:18] Unknown: Never fireworks. Never solder blobs, never
[2022-03-24T02:27:27] Unknown: Yes, Nucular LoL
[2022-03-24T02:28:06] Unknown: I advocate for them because I know what they do and what they're capable of
[2022-03-24T02:28:46] Unknown: And their support is insane. I don't see a live, real time developer support telegram chat for Flipsky ubox6or trampa
[2022-03-24T02:29:11] Unknown: Someone has an issue, they make a new firmware to correct it
[2022-03-24T02:29:19] Unknown: What else could one ask for
[2022-03-24T02:30:37] Unknown: ... even user error. They created new safety nets to reduce user error
[2022-03-24T02:54:59] Unknown: 10.5kw Vsett 10+ motors 😁
[2022-03-24T02:59:11] Paolo ⁭: Each?
[2022-03-24T02:59:42] Unknown: Nahhh . Total
[2022-03-24T03:02:20] Paolo ⁭: That is possible with ubox too
[2022-03-24T03:02:45] Unknown: Only 78v resting. Maybe 75% charge
[2022-03-24T03:02:59] Unknown: And still not maxed. Only 135a battery
[2022-03-24T03:03:17] Unknown: Testing. Pushing. Not absolute max even close
[2022-03-24T03:03:32] Unknown: Raining now. Potted Nucs in the rain 👍
[2022-03-24T03:05:04] Unknown: I bet 13-14kw on full charge with stock Vsett 10+ motors 50mm magnets. I'll keep testing higher and higher
[2022-03-24T03:06:28] Unknown: They're 1400w rated each at 60v nominal. 72v (20s) pushing over 5000kw per motor, Pretty impressive for "stock" motors with 50mm magnets
[2022-03-24T03:07:41] Unknown: As long as you clean solder balls away and have thermal pads situated perfectly. My 12Fs are running about 3C above ambient 🤣
[2022-03-24T03:12:23] Unknown: Motors are the limiting factor here... Controllers running about 60% capacity tops, probably more like 50%. Battery capable of 180a. Still need more testing to find motor max. Motor temps still around 150F/65C max ever... So still room to push for sure
[2022-03-24T08:50:50] Oliver Eliasson: Anyone have spare nutt or zoom hydraulic brake set lying around after upgrading?
[2022-03-24T09:03:16] Mirono escooters: I have some brand i cznt remember
[2022-03-24T09:03:26] Mirono escooters: From flj scoots. Nice brakes
[2022-03-24T09:03:30] Mirono escooters: Ill check when home
[2022-03-24T09:04:05] Oliver Eliasson: Vill fit vsett 9? Have eebrake cutoff?
[2022-03-24T09:04:18] Mirono escooters: Yes cutoff cable And fit. Problably. I can meausre sizes
[2022-03-24T09:04:30] Oliver Eliasson: Great
[2022-03-24T09:04:31] Mirono escooters: It's a pretty hefty Brake, was from 80kmh scoot. i like it
[2022-03-24T09:04:34] Mirono escooters: Thic
[2022-03-24T09:04:44] Oliver Eliasson: Il see
[2022-03-24T09:10:56] Mirono escooters: Xod e300 is model
[2022-03-24T09:11:05] Mirono escooters: Have 1 on Xiaomi :)
[2022-03-24T09:29:39] Oliver Eliasson: Would varla eagle one motors fit on vsett 9?
[2022-03-24T11:32:35] Happy Giraffe: Trampa guy is in forums but he's sassy and usually didn't give a fuck😂
[2022-03-24T11:36:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And you can play super Mario also😅🙈
[2022-03-24T11:36:48] Mirono escooters: Rlly?? Im buying 1
[2022-03-24T11:37:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean does color buttons are a killer 😅
[2022-03-24T11:56:39] sombre_enfant: Adam ay do you think a single 10+ motor has enough torque to reach 80kph on 72v
[2022-03-24T11:59:09] Paolo ⁭: Blade motor in single can reach 92 on 72v and more if have road
[2022-03-24T11:59:29] Paolo ⁭: Tested with flipsky 75100 and dragy
[2022-03-24T11:59:36] Paolo ⁭: I think are similar both motor
[2022-03-24T12:00:15] Mirono escooters: Don't fall at that speed xd
[2022-03-24T12:01:04] sombre_enfant: Nice thanks mrWu
[2022-03-24T12:02:54] Paolo ⁭: With my frame no problem
[2022-03-24T12:03:06] Paolo ⁭: But with Ducati one yes 😂
[2022-03-24T12:06:04] sombre_enfant: Wich param on the 75100 tho ? Acceleration is long ?
[2022-03-24T12:06:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Why would he 🤷‍♂
[2022-03-24T12:22:42] Paolo ⁭: Omg no balance , WHY DALY SHIT
[2022-03-24T12:23:12] Paolo ⁭: 10 seconds to 80 and 15 to 90
[2022-03-24T12:23:34] Paolo ⁭: 130 phase and 70 batt
[2022-03-24T12:24:52] Mirono escooters: Daly shit .. only 30mah and not even active
[2022-03-24T12:25:13] Happy Giraffe: Does the balancing turn itself off or?
[2022-03-24T12:25:20] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-24T12:25:32] Paolo ⁭: You can't active it manually like ant BMS
[2022-03-24T12:25:48] Paolo ⁭: And auto balance no work
[2022-03-24T12:25:58] Happy Giraffe: Ah shite, then you need to charge cells to 4.18v I think
[2022-03-24T12:26:28] Paolo ⁭: Too not work
[2022-03-24T12:26:37] Happy Giraffe: I'm not sure how your bms has it, mine got resistor based
[2022-03-24T12:27:17] Mirono escooters: Expensive but shit
[2022-03-24T12:27:20] Happy Giraffe: Vedder needs to do a bms
[2022-03-24T12:27:35] Mirono escooters: It's potted shut Well but too Well. Cant fix it if u burn 1 resistor accidentally
[2022-03-24T12:27:35] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-03-24T12:28:50] Happy Giraffe: I would happily pay 120€ for a nice beefy bms if I knew it worked like a hungry whore😂
[2022-03-24T12:29:06] Mirono escooters: I love ant
[2022-03-24T12:29:37] Paolo ⁭: Before I was thinking DALY is better than ant overall
[2022-03-24T12:29:46] Paolo ⁭: But ant BMS much much better
[2022-03-24T12:30:14] Happy Giraffe: Only daly basic bms seems good
[2022-03-24T12:30:47] Paolo ⁭: Shit too
[2022-03-24T12:30:56] Paolo ⁭: For series battery burn like paper
[2022-03-24T12:31:51] Artem Bulashev: He gets to 56mph on 73v so yea
[2022-03-24T12:32:11] Paolo ⁭: 96mph😱
[2022-03-24T12:32:20] Paolo ⁭: More than 150kmh
[2022-03-24T12:33:21] Artem Bulashev: JKBms 👌
[2022-03-24T12:33:32] Artem Bulashev: No no
[2022-03-24T12:33:33] Artem Bulashev: Haha
[2022-03-24T12:33:36] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2022-03-24T12:33:36] Artem Bulashev: 56mph
[2022-03-24T12:33:56] Paolo ⁭: But he running double motor
[2022-03-24T12:33:59] Mirono escooters: I tried ordering 1, cancelled shipment twice for 2 weeks Already :(
[2022-03-24T12:34:05] Mirono escooters: Not help full in chat eithrr
[2022-03-24T12:34:35] Happy Giraffe: Damn, so far I've done 5000km on cheap dalys
[2022-03-24T12:35:01] Mirono escooters: Little competition sadly
[2022-03-24T12:35:11] Mirono escooters: For 50a couldn't find anything non bluetooth. Space is a problem in m365
[2022-03-24T12:36:31] Happy Giraffe: 35A does 50A😂 but how much more I dont wanna find out
[2022-03-24T12:36:53] Mirono escooters: Yes but a cheap 35a bms is already overrated
[2022-03-24T12:37:12] Happy Giraffe: What do you mean?🌚
[2022-03-24T12:37:34] Mirono escooters: A generic 35a bms was already overrated. Don't think it Will like 50a (and peak is even more)
[2022-03-24T12:37:52] Artem Bulashev: Huge though
[2022-03-24T12:38:06] Happy Giraffe: I think someone pulled 100A from 20A, it melted but lasted quite long
[2022-03-24T12:38:21] Happy Giraffe: Ive been using 50A on 35A daly for 6 months now no issues
[2022-03-24T12:38:27] Mirono escooters: Sadly. But on my e-bike i got loads of space
[2022-03-24T12:38:37] Mirono escooters: Hmmmm😂
[2022-03-24T12:38:53] Mirono escooters: It's peak tho. Or do u drive so fast u need that continuous
[2022-03-24T12:39:01] Happy Giraffe: What kind of an ebike you gonna build?
[2022-03-24T12:39:11] Mirono escooters: With 2 wheels
[2022-03-24T12:39:26] Happy Giraffe: For me its continuous usually upto 3km runs
[2022-03-24T12:39:27] Mirono escooters: 14s8p rear 5000w with flipsky 75100, dual suspension dual brake frame from friend
[2022-03-24T12:39:31] Mirono escooters: Damn
[2022-03-24T12:39:41] Happy Giraffe: 2 motors?😳 Why?
[2022-03-24T12:39:41] Mirono escooters: Well considering daly weight it does have Margin for some more
[2022-03-24T12:39:47] Mirono escooters: No, 1 motor
[2022-03-24T12:39:51] Mirono escooters: Xas a bad joke
[2022-03-24T12:40:01] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-24T12:40:01] Mirono escooters: AWD isn't so Common on e-bikes as scooters. So weird
[2022-03-24T12:40:25] Happy Giraffe: QS205?
[2022-03-24T12:40:36] Mirono escooters: Meh some China from friend
[2022-03-24T12:40:50] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse ferrofluid it
[2022-03-24T12:40:52] Happy Giraffe: They aint 5000w but yeah
[2022-03-24T12:41:06] Mirono escooters: This one is, h Ran 8000 xd
[2022-03-24T12:41:14] Mirono escooters: And with ferrofluid. I got a temp sensor so let's see
[2022-03-24T12:41:27] Happy Giraffe: QS205 is beefiest motor that still has freehub mount in rear
[2022-03-24T12:41:42] Mirono escooters: Let's start on budget if i like it i go bigger But i did like my friends one. Scoot is Fun, but e-bike rides so good
[2022-03-24T12:43:14] Happy Giraffe: You sure the motor fits frame tho? Normal bike frames have 135mm dropouts on rear. Mxus 3K turbo has widest (45mm) magnets available for normal bike dropout
[2022-03-24T12:43:34] Mirono escooters: Well it comes pre fitted from him so 😅
[2022-03-24T12:43:56] Happy Giraffe: Then no problem haha, what kind of magnets and winding it has?
[2022-03-24T12:45:32] Happy Giraffe: I wouldnt go below the 45mm mark, you loose all the fun torque. They lie to you that it can be compensated but I did some simulations and it was always worse with 30mm than 40mm
[2022-03-24T12:46:58] Mirono escooters: Ill measure when i open it
[2022-03-24T12:47:08] Mirono escooters: Yep saw that
[2022-03-24T13:17:42] Unknown: JK BMS
[2022-03-24T16:33:24] Unknown: My JK BMS is working great so far. Artem also uses that same brand with good results. Really super beefy design and uses active balancer via 2 huge capacitors. Phone app and Bluetooth are super stable.
[2022-03-24T17:07:18] Mirono escooters: Yea it's 1 of the best Ive seen
[2022-03-24T17:34:06] Unknown: Yup, really well made BMS. Found 1 solder ball/chip but all soldering was super clean. Dual 7awg for B- and P- for 150a continuous version. No C- dedicated charge wire... P- is common discharge/charge. Active Balancing is toggled on/off in the app. The little display is awesome and has on/off button for BMS main power.

[2022-03-24T17:49:44] Mirono escooters: Even those little copper jumpers between mosfets. Art
[2022-03-24T17:50:02] Mirono escooters: I wonder if it's hand soldered
[2022-03-24T19:27:31] Happy Giraffe: Number of turns is squared in inductance equation🤔 this is why low kv is such powerful in low amp-escs

[2022-03-24T21:50:58] Oliver Eliasson: Any tips on motor cable that will fit vsett 9 motor? 9 pin for temperture also
[2022-03-24T23:24:58] Unknown: Higo L1019
[2022-03-24T23:27:41] Unknown: 3X 11awg with 7 sensor wires. The connectors themselves are 2.5mm solid bullets for phase wires, so should be plenty for Vsett 9. I cut off the actual connectors and replaced with 6mm bullets on phase and Higo 6 pin for sensors (halls and temp).

[2022-03-24T23:30:59] Oliver Eliasson: Should be able to handle 40a?
[2022-03-24T23:31:20] Unknown: And I believe Artem said the 7.5mm cable should fit 9 motor/axle hole
[2022-03-24T23:31:25] Unknown: Definitely
[2022-03-24T23:31:33] Oliver Eliasson: Great

[2022-03-24T23:38:25] Unknown: You can splice but if you're opening motor and installing temp sensor... May as well do it the right way and hard wire Higo L1019. Splices get messy and solder is shit for carrying current. Splicing and soldering phase wires would likely do more harm than good
[2022-03-24T23:39:00] Unknown: Go direct to copper phase leads with new phase wires 👍
[2022-03-24T23:40:16] Oliver Eliasson: I presume the connector is waterproof?
[2022-03-24T23:41:02] Oliver Eliasson: When i do that mod i will ask for guidance again😅 Probably closer to summer
[2022-03-24T23:41:28] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu it wasn't the cable damaged 😂 it was a fase solder inside that was in contact with the motor just had to isolate it right and push it near the windings 😂

[2022-03-24T23:48:30] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3186@24-03-2022_23-48-30.jpg>
[2022-03-24T23:49:11] Artem Bulashev: 13awg aprox
[2022-03-24T23:49:24] Artem Bulashev: On vsett9
[2022-03-24T23:51:52] Artem Bulashev: I guess opening is 8mm
[2022-03-24T23:53:12] Artem Bulashev: But yeah 2.5mm bullets still give me chills 😅 sounds like such bottle neck compare to direct solder
[2022-03-24T23:56:53] Unknown: Yea, as we we're discussing... Those solid 2.5mm bullets on high power setup is probably not good. After thinking about it, I was convinced lol. 6mm bullets much more free flow of current and not al bullets have spring connection action vs solid bullet "sized fit only"
[2022-03-24T23:58:48] Unknown: Do you think that connector would be ok on Vsett 9? Or would still replace actual connector is using the Higo 20 wire cable?
[2022-03-25T00:00:36] Artem Bulashev: Ok ? Yes absolutely Good? Yes absolutely Better than direct solder? No absolutely Would you notice difference? Likely not
[2022-03-25T00:00:43] Artem Bulashev: And one more aspect !
[2022-03-25T00:01:36] Artem Bulashev: Remember we are after system low resistance! Replacing wires with 11awg vs 13awg will lower resistance more than this connector will introduce So over all I think it will be a win if you replace vsett direct soldered wires to those wires! Specially if you use Silver solder - because solder joints have its own resistance (solder is very poor conductor actually)
[2022-03-25T00:02:59] Oliver Eliasson: So getting that cable at same time as doing ferrofluid and temp sensor is good
[2022-03-25T00:03:09] Artem Bulashev: 👍🤝
[2022-03-25T00:03:12] Artem Bulashev: Me too
[2022-03-25T00:04:10] Artem Bulashev: I just convince my self lol
[2022-03-25T00:05:07] Artem Bulashev: There are other options
[2022-03-25T00:05:31] Artem Bulashev: Hee
[2022-03-25T00:06:37] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3187@25-03-2022_00-06-37.jpg>
[2022-03-25T00:06:58] Artem Bulashev: 3mm bullet I think
[2022-03-25T00:07:42] Artem Bulashev: And mt60
[2022-03-25T00:08:20] Artem Bulashev: They should be in theory better than that connector … as it is larger bullet
[2022-03-25T00:08:40] Artem Bulashev: I think I will buy just the cable lol if they sell
[2022-03-25T00:08:52] Artem Bulashev: I don’t like connectors haha
[2022-03-25T00:14:31] Paolo ⁭: No bro, you can't measure like that
[2022-03-25T00:14:49] Paolo ⁭: You should be measured each single conductor
[2022-03-25T00:15:03] Paolo ⁭: But anyway you have writes on cable it’s diameter
[2022-03-25T00:16:15] Paolo ⁭: Seen now, vsett 9 is with 2mm2 phase wire
[2022-03-25T00:16:44] Artem Bulashev: 2.5mm2
[2022-03-25T00:16:51] Artem Bulashev: 1.84mm dia
[2022-03-25T00:17:04] Artem Bulashev: That’s 13awg
[2022-03-25T00:19:16] Artem Bulashev: Worst case they are 14awg 1.6mm dia
[2022-03-25T00:19:48] Artem Bulashev: You are right about it I should measure one strand and multiply
[2022-03-25T00:21:13] Paolo ⁭: It’s good 2.5mm2
[2022-03-25T00:21:47] Paolo ⁭: Running up to 90A phase and 25/30A battery
[2022-03-25T00:24:15] Artem Bulashev: 19*0.4 = 0.1288mm2*19 = 2.4472mm2 total
[2022-03-25T00:28:17] Artem Bulashev: Yes it gets barely warm with 90a phase 30a battery in summer. (But mine are super short) I think this is limit for them. So will be looking for 3mm2 at least for new project
[2022-03-25T00:29:03] Artem Bulashev: Adam what is vsett10+ original motor wire spec?
[2022-03-25T00:29:17] Artem Bulashev: Outer dia, conductor dia?
[2022-03-25T00:43:38] Artem Bulashev: Says here L1019 outer diameter is 8.5mm 😅 won’t fit than
[2022-03-25T00:45:48] Artem Bulashev: You measured it multiple times 7.5mm though. Odd. That measurement is of L1019 right?
[2022-03-25T00:47:31] Artem Bulashev: Yes L1019 strange. I like that cable. Will ask them to buy cable without connector
[2022-03-25T00:58:14] Artem Bulashev: I just emailed company asking to start selling 3x4mm2 + 6pin wire without connectors 🤓 Hope they will agree!

[2022-03-25T02:54:19] Unknown: Yes that was the Higo L1019 outer diameter. Stock Vsett 10 phase wires are 12awg. Higo L1019 is 11awg. Grin Tech sells just the wire only but they say the phase wires are 12awg... I swear it's the same exact cable.. just no connectors
[2022-03-25T02:54:39] Unknown: https://ebikes.ca/grinmotorcable.html
[2022-03-25T02:55:19] Unknown: Hmm.. it might be slightly different with 12awg... Higo doesn't have the aluminum foil shield around the singal wires
[2022-03-25T03:01:21] Unknown: Yup, L1019 is 7.75mm... last time was 7.5, maybe on a small section where internal wires weren't overlapping. But definitely under 8mm for sure. This is the new connector setup. 6mm bullets on phase and Higo 6 pin for halls/temp

[2022-03-25T10:44:14] Artem Bulashev: This one has 24awg signal - L1019 has 26awg signal wires This one says 12awg wires - L1019 has 4mm2 = a bit smaller than 11awg but def bigger than 12awg
[2022-03-25T10:44:30] Artem Bulashev: But nice find 🤝👍👍
[2022-03-25T10:46:24] Artem Bulashev: How does mt60 feel on phase wire of vsett 10+? On long fast rides (40kmh) it should get toasty ?
[2022-03-25T10:50:01] zekoslav mrkva: I didn't have no problem whole samer last year
[2022-03-25T10:52:28] Artem Bulashev: This summer try mount them where you can touch and check after some hard riding for 30min. I suspect they may be real hot
[2022-03-25T10:57:30] zekoslav mrkva: Last summer I tried it already that I did not notice any heating from this connectors, tried after going up hill, it was not 30 min, maybe was 20 not more
[2022-03-25T12:24:21] Artem Bulashev: That’s nice
[2022-03-25T12:24:45] Artem Bulashev: Considering it is rated to be 45a max
[2022-03-25T12:25:48] Artem Bulashev: I think we should see heating up 60c at least with currents above 60a phase per motor. But guess there is something else happening 🥸

[2022-03-25T12:57:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe bad isolation for USB
[2022-03-25T12:58:22] Gigolo Joe: What does it mean?
[2022-03-25T12:58:53] Face de Pin Sucé: maybe there is current going through USB from VESC
[2022-03-25T12:59:03] Gigolo Joe: Oh ok
[2022-03-25T12:59:14] Gigolo Joe: So there's no fix i guess?

[2022-03-25T14:56:16] Oliver Eliasson: Ixs trigger ff is a downhill bike helmet if in not mistaken. It seamed nice and light weight
[2022-03-25T14:56:23] Oliver Eliasson: About 600grams
[2022-03-25T14:57:36] Happy Giraffe: The purpose of that helmet is for other applications but surely it should still protect
[2022-03-25T15:31:08] Luis Magalhaes: Mine is a nexx xr2 carbon but i have it for the motorcycle too

[2022-03-25T15:46:54] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, should be good especially for hot summer days
[2022-03-25T15:47:33] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah, better then my normal bike helmet or hövding inflatable helmet
[2022-03-25T15:50:15] Happy Giraffe: Haha

My active balancer is set to trigger on at .01v difference. 183 miles driven on it and balancer hasn't had to kick on even once, even during charging. I keep it off during discharge obviously.
[2022-03-26T00:42:30] Mirono escooters: Sick

[2022-03-26T01:03:27] Unknown: Temp cutoff and low voltage cutoff on the battery at 64v. 84v max charge with 5-6v drop... Take a long time before I hit LVC. But no, I don't have an actual voltage drop number set to cutoff

[2022-03-26T01:08:19] rosheee: 17S 2 much for them?

[2022-03-26T01:10:30] Unknown: Yea.. I highly doubt it would
[2022-03-26T01:10:44] rosheee: People use 20S in it
[2022-03-26T01:10:49] Unknown: That's close with 17s but still a bit of breathing room
[2022-03-26T01:10:57] Unknown: How? G30?
[2022-03-26T01:11:35] Unknown: Would need to mount your controllers externally.. then 18s would fit

[2022-03-26T01:19:17] rosheee: So now
[2022-03-26T01:19:22] rosheee: 17S vs 75V ubox

[2022-03-26T03:19:25] Unknown: I wonder how my JK BMS would hold up to that. Hopefully Nucular gets their wish to move to EU and we can all enjoy their products. None of that nonsense with Nucs. 95v max absolute. Don't exceed with regen and you're good to go.
[2022-03-26T03:20:26] Unknown: Why did you have to disconnect xt90? USB to PC?
[2022-03-26T03:26:59] Luis Magalhaes: I had to disconect xt90 because ubox was burning non stop, and then i had a short with nikel strip in one cell near the cable output conection to the cells 😌

[2022-03-26T03:49:16] Happy Giraffe: Faster charging always results in a deceased lifespan, get two chargers if you can leave it overnight or need some 10A stuff🌚
[2022-03-26T03:49:39] rosheee: easy
[2022-03-26T03:49:43] rosheee: the 3A charger doesn't work
[2022-03-26T03:49:43] rosheee: omg
[2022-03-26T03:51:12] rosheee: The main specs from Samsung 40T datasheet : Capacity: 4000mAh Nominal voltage: 3.6V Standard charge current: 2A (200mA cut-off) Fast charge current: 6A (100mA cut-off) Charge end voltage: 4.2V
[2022-03-26T03:51:35] rosheee: so if i have 6P it is 6x2A =12A
[2022-03-26T03:52:21] rosheee: and 6x6A =36A fast charge
[2022-03-26T03:53:48] rosheee: and if i charge 17S with 16S charger it charges until 67.2V
[2022-03-26T03:54:10] rosheee: XD SRY I LOST ALL MEMORIES when i look at that battery
[2022-03-26T03:54:21] rosheee: 😆not wanna bomb myself

[2022-03-26T03:54:39] Happy Giraffe: Get a fancy programmable charger that you can vary output🌚
[2022-03-26T03:55:06] Happy Giraffe: 12A charging will be ridiculously fast
[2022-03-26T03:56:13] rosheee: yah bat per cell u can do 2A
[2022-03-26T03:56:25] rosheee: i go with 8A
[2022-03-26T03:56:31] rosheee: but i can use the 16S charger for 17S
[2022-03-26T03:56:37] rosheee: it just charges until the 67V
[2022-03-26T03:57:17] rosheee: 8A shouldn't be problem for 6P
[2022-03-26T03:57:21] rosheee: HAPPY PLS XD
[2022-03-26T03:58:30] Happy Giraffe: Nope, but by all means get two chargers or a programmable one
[2022-03-26T03:58:42] Happy Giraffe: Can use 3A and 12A
[2022-03-26T03:58:52] rosheee: o.O why 2?
[2022-03-26T03:58:58] rosheee: i just wanna charge 8A xD
[2022-03-26T03:59:08] rosheee: but i can use the 16S charger for 17S, right
[2022-03-26T03:59:09] Happy Giraffe: Sure, shouldnt be an issue
[2022-03-26T03:59:12] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-26T03:59:19] rosheee: ❤️
[2022-03-26T03:59:44] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but depending how bms balances you need to know whats happening there
[2022-03-26T03:59:57] rosheee: omg what does that mean?
[2022-03-26T04:00:02] Happy Giraffe: If you have Daly non smart bms then you can't
[2022-03-26T04:00:08] rosheee: i have smart daly
[2022-03-26T04:00:16] Happy Giraffe: Active balance?
[2022-03-26T04:00:24] rosheee: i think so second
[2022-03-26T04:00:39] Happy Giraffe: Cheap dalys need cells to be 4.18v for balance
[2022-03-26T04:01:23] Happy Giraffe: Just get a fancy charger and spoil yourself a little
[2022-03-26T04:01:48] rosheee: it's the fancy one i think
[2022-03-26T04:01:53] rosheee: yah later i get one 😆but for now
[2022-03-26T04:02:22] rosheee: balance open volt?
[2022-03-26T04:03:02] rosheee: it should be no prob puting in 16S charger 3A
[2022-03-26T04:04:22] rosheee: Tomorrow i solder xt60 to this
[2022-03-26T04:04:29] rosheee: <photos/photo_3209@26-03-2022_04-04-29.jpg>
[2022-03-26T04:04:31] Happy Giraffe: Just get a proper charger...
[2022-03-26T04:04:34] rosheee: I KNOW
[2022-03-26T04:04:42] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-26T04:04:44] rosheee: what is + and what is -?
[2022-03-26T04:04:57] rosheee: blue = - ?
[2022-03-26T04:05:02] rosheee: or the brown one?
[2022-03-26T04:05:42] Happy Giraffe: Idk
[2022-03-26T04:05:47] rosheee: me2
[2022-03-26T04:05:52] rosheee: that's why i wanna use 16S to charge it a bit
[2022-03-26T04:06:01] rosheee: omf
[2022-03-26T04:06:09] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-26T04:06:26] rosheee: this scooter gonna be the worst
[2022-03-26T04:06:57] rosheee: <photos/photo_3210@26-03-2022_04-06-57.jpg>
[2022-03-26T04:07:16] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2022-03-26T04:07:24] rosheee: better than the crap before xD
[2022-03-26T04:07:44] Happy Giraffe: XT150 is so nice, good upto 150A I think
[2022-03-26T04:07:59] Happy Giraffe: Phase is easier than DC
[2022-03-26T04:08:09] rosheee: <photos/photo_3211@26-03-2022_04-08-09.jpg>
[2022-03-26T04:08:16] rosheee: before XD
[2022-03-26T04:08:28] rosheee: but now the shit is different with the 17S omg
[2022-03-26T04:08:31] rosheee: 180A -210A
[2022-03-26T04:09:12] rosheee: <photos/photo_3212@26-03-2022_04-09-12.jpg>
[2022-03-26T04:09:13] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-26T04:09:15] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, if that's dc batt current then it's gonna be a warm connector
[2022-03-26T04:09:27] Happy Giraffe: Lol, this should do it
[2022-03-26T04:09:46] rosheee: XD LOL 10AWG
[2022-03-26T04:10:03] rosheee: @PaoloWu thought not possible to solder thicker wires
[2022-03-26T04:10:18] rosheee: i open 100V later and see if maybe 8AWG fits
[2022-03-26T04:11:46] Unknown: That's extremely high
[2022-03-26T04:12:05] rosheee: yah i just go 8A xD
[2022-03-26T04:15:52] Unknown: That's 1.3333...C per cell in 6p. Still high but looks like they can handle. Still quite fast for 6p 40T. Shouldn't harm but definitely reduced lifespan. I charge at . 25C Max (43ah @ 10a) usually more like 7a fast charge and 4a slow overnight charge
[2022-03-26T04:16:37] rosheee: they say charge current 2A and fast 6A per cell
[2022-03-26T04:16:37] Unknown: Just remember, what they can "handle" isn't optimized for lifespan
[2022-03-26T04:16:42] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-26T04:17:02] rosheee: have to buy IQ charger like happy said
[2022-03-26T04:17:39] Unknown: 4ah x 1.3333C is 5.3A
[2022-03-26T04:17:57] Unknown: Yes, for sure. Especially with "ok" BMS
[2022-03-26T04:19:07] Unknown: Does BMS have active balancer? Or is it typical "constant voltage" balancer? Top off balancing so to speak
[2022-03-26T04:19:40] rosheee: it is smart daly
[2022-03-26T04:19:41] rosheee: with bluetooth
[2022-03-26T04:20:01] rosheee: i charge tonight with 16S charger 3A
[2022-03-26T04:20:42] Unknown: That should be safe 👍👍
[2022-03-26T04:20:53] rosheee: Charging voltage: 4.20V : Charging current: 2000mA 丨6000mA: Standard丨Rapid: Charging time: 3.0 hours
[2022-03-26T04:21:07] rosheee: tomorrow then i use the 17S charger
[2022-03-26T04:26:29] rosheee: it charges
[2022-03-26T04:26:29] rosheee: omg
[2022-03-26T04:26:40] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-26T04:27:40] rosheee: Looks very criminal
[2022-03-26T04:27:45] rosheee: Thx mates
[2022-03-26T04:28:09] rosheee: Btw
[2022-03-26T04:28:23] rosheee: <photos/photo_3213@26-03-2022_04-28-23.jpg>
[2022-03-26T04:28:27] rosheee: Check balance?
[2022-03-26T04:34:16] rosheee: yes xD?
[2022-03-26T04:39:14] Unknown: Yes
[2022-03-26T04:40:56] Unknown: Enable balancing while charging. Should balance "as needed"
[2022-03-26T04:41:01] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-26T04:41:12] rosheee: then have to change balance value to 3.4v?
[2022-03-26T04:41:24] Unknown: Mine have needed balancing at all. Will give you a rough idea how matched the p groups are with IR and true capacity
[2022-03-26T04:41:44] rosheee: balancing starts at 3.8v cells have 3.485v atm
[2022-03-26T04:41:51] Unknown: Not sure how Daly works. Usually set delta voltage difference
[2022-03-26T04:42:29] Unknown: If p groups are ***V out of sync, balancer will kick in... But Daly might be different
[2022-03-26T04:44:07] Unknown: If p groups are within .010v, balancer shouldn't really be needed. I use JK BMS which sets p group voltage difference (delta)
[2022-03-26T04:45:04] Unknown: Balance trigger voltage
[2022-03-26T04:45:23] rosheee: 0.004V difference
[2022-03-26T04:45:39] Unknown: I have set to .015v but my p groups never get above . 004v
[2022-03-26T04:45:45] Unknown: .004 is great
[2022-03-26T04:46:12] rosheee: and cell volt high protection 4.2v?
[2022-03-26T04:46:14] rosheee: or 4.25?
[2022-03-26T04:46:15] rosheee: ^^
[2022-03-26T04:46:16] Unknown: Balancing shouldn't be needed if difference doesn't exceed say .010v
[2022-03-26T04:46:21] Unknown: 4.2
[2022-03-26T04:46:21] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-26T04:46:38] rosheee: ❤️ thx
[2022-03-26T04:46:44] rosheee: send video of your scooter damn :D
[2022-03-26T04:47:20] Unknown: Even 4.2 (100%) is on the higher side. 4.15 - 4.05 for cell lifespan
[2022-03-26T04:47:30] rosheee: aiiigjh
[2022-03-26T04:47:38] Unknown: 4.2v is perfectly fine
[2022-03-26T04:48:11] Unknown: Just saying... To increase lifespan. 4.15 to 4v is good for cells....
[2022-03-26T04:48:37] rosheee: hmm..what is long for a battery? daily use
[2022-03-26T04:48:42] rosheee: 1--2 years?
[2022-03-26T04:49:00] Unknown: Cycles... Each cell has "cycle life"
[2022-03-26T04:49:44] rosheee: hmm..then idk how many the 16S had
[2022-03-26T04:49:49] Unknown: https://m.facebook.com/batterymooch/posts/bench-test-results-samsung-40t-4000mah-21700-retestsan-incredible-25a30a-battery/2104108709878704/
[2022-03-26T04:51:03] rosheee: lol
[2022-03-26T04:51:16] rosheee: 50G should do 500 cycles untill 75% at 23C degrees
[2022-03-26T04:51:23] Unknown: Usually typical cell is 500-800 cycles before 70% capacity degradation (4000mah down to 2800mah in your case)
[2022-03-26T04:51:24] rosheee: or 70% at 45 degrees C
[2022-03-26T04:51:32] rosheee: shiit 😆that's why it is still like new
[2022-03-26T04:52:05] Unknown: Samsung 48X is 3000 cycles before 70% degradation 🥰
[2022-03-26T04:52:27] rosheee: 😆whut
[2022-03-26T04:52:32] rosheee: but where to buy...?
[2022-03-26T04:52:33] Unknown: Another reason they kick so much ass
[2022-03-26T04:52:47] Unknown: Nkon for EU
[2022-03-26T04:53:00] rosheee: they have this o.O lemme check
[2022-03-26T04:53:02] Unknown: I'm in USA, got mine from a Canadian dealer
[2022-03-26T04:54:15] rosheee: damn
[2022-03-26T04:54:15] rosheee: xD
[2022-03-26T04:54:18] Unknown: In your case 6p would only be good for 120a discharge absolutely max... More like 100a... So not huge discharge... Better in larger P configs
[2022-03-26T04:54:19] rosheee: send over from USA :D
[2022-03-26T04:54:32] rosheee: max is 6P
[2022-03-26T04:54:42] rosheee: 6P is even with that setup nearly impossible
[2022-03-26T04:54:51] rosheee: with 3d printed brackets
[2022-03-26T04:54:58] Unknown: Right... Figure 15a safe and 20a absolute max
[2022-03-26T04:55:17] Unknown: So 6p isn't huge discharge
[2022-03-26T04:55:23] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-26T04:55:42] rosheee: 140A-150A peak from 5P
[2022-03-26T04:55:43] Unknown: I use 9p... So 180a max or 135a completely safe
[2022-03-26T04:56:11] rosheee: so with the 40T there shouldn't be that -20Vdroop
[2022-03-26T04:56:24] Unknown: Optimal cell used depends on P#
[2022-03-26T04:56:37] rosheee: i would like more P
[2022-03-26T04:56:47] rosheee: like 7P or more in g30 ^^'
[2022-03-26T04:56:59] rosheee: 16S10P would be superhardcore
[2022-03-26T04:57:00] Unknown: Shouldn't be... Not sure exact specs but rated at 35a per cell. 35 x 6 is 210a
[2022-03-26T04:57:10] rosheee: yep now 5x10A
[2022-03-26T04:57:16] rosheee: 60A bms
[2022-03-26T04:57:16] Unknown: 20s9p is better 🤓
[2022-03-26T04:57:45] Unknown: Higher the voltage, less amps needed for same watts
[2022-03-26T04:57:53] rosheee: true but more space ^^
[2022-03-26T04:58:07] Unknown: That's why my 20s9p can output 10kw at 130a
[2022-03-26T04:58:20] Unknown: Higher voltage
[2022-03-26T04:58:31] rosheee: 130A per motor?
[2022-03-26T04:58:49] Unknown: Watts. = Volts X amps
[2022-03-26T04:58:58] Unknown: Total... 70/60
[2022-03-26T04:58:59] rosheee: ah that ^^' not the motor
[2022-03-26T04:59:27] Unknown: <photos/photo_3215@26-03-2022_04-59-27.jpg>
[2022-03-26T05:00:01] Unknown: 130a at 84v is over 10kw.. account for sag... Right around 10kw
[2022-03-26T05:00:03] rosheee: i do 9400-10800W motor
[2022-03-26T05:00:12] rosheee: but XD yours could do more
[2022-03-26T05:00:21] Unknown: But you're stressing you battery hardcore
[2022-03-26T05:00:25] Unknown: Definitely
[2022-03-26T05:00:27] rosheee: yas
[2022-03-26T05:00:36] rosheee: hmm i do 120A atm
[2022-03-26T05:00:37] Unknown: Mine is barely warm
[2022-03-26T05:00:47] rosheee: 8kw
[2022-03-26T05:00:58] rosheee: i feel the heat through the steelbottom ^^' after 30min+
[2022-03-26T05:01:10] Unknown: <photos/photo_3216@26-03-2022_05-01-10.jpg>
[2022-03-26T05:01:31] Unknown: Yes... Because battery is stressing
[2022-03-26T05:02:13] rosheee: yas 😆but now i see temp. and other stuff
[2022-03-26T05:02:29] rosheee: before i just had over-temp. protection from bms or cells itself
[2022-03-26T05:03:27] Unknown: Yup... VESC will show you tons of parameters and able to set limits
[2022-03-26T05:03:43] rosheee: ah i mean cuz daly bms
[2022-03-26T05:03:57] Unknown: You want to make sure your p groups are balanced like this... Just taken now at resting
[2022-03-26T05:04:44] Unknown: Within .001v. quality cells with good welding and all copper series connections
[2022-03-26T05:05:13] rosheee: when fully charged?
[2022-03-26T05:05:41] Unknown: How well the p groups stay balanced will tell you how good the cells are matched and how good the battery is built
[2022-03-26T05:05:51] Unknown: Regardless. Anytime
[2022-03-26T05:06:19] Unknown: Especially after hard discharge (hard ride)
[2022-03-26T05:06:47] rosheee: Ok
[2022-03-26T05:06:52] rosheee: What shpuld i change here?
[2022-03-26T05:06:55] rosheee: <photos/photo_3218@26-03-2022_05-06-55.jpg>
[2022-03-26T05:06:55] rosheee: <photos/photo_3219@26-03-2022_05-06-55.jpg>
[2022-03-26T05:07:08] Unknown: If you come back from a long hard ride and your p groups are within .010v, you're in good shape
[2022-03-26T05:07:16] rosheee: Will see today
[2022-03-26T05:08:45] Unknown: Diff volt "balance trigger" should be .025v max or so with active balancer. I don't use my active balancing while riding... Only at rest and charging and has never needed to kick on at all
[2022-03-26T05:09:01] rosheee: Ok
[2022-03-26T05:09:38] rosheee: diff volt protect? 0.025v?
[2022-03-26T05:10:15] rosheee: <photos/photo_3220@26-03-2022_05-10-15.jpg>
[2022-03-26T05:10:19] rosheee: thx btw ❤️
[2022-03-26T05:11:32] Unknown: Diff volt protect is when BMS shuts down due to voltage difference... That may (or may not) be while riding... That doesn't need to be any higher or lower
[2022-03-26T05:12:01] Unknown: Diff volt "trigger" is what I would try to find and set to say .020v
[2022-03-26T05:12:43] Unknown: Is there a "balance trigger" voltage option?
[2022-03-26T05:13:01] rosheee: <photos/photo_3221@26-03-2022_05-13-01.jpg>
[2022-03-26T05:13:51] Unknown: That might be it
[2022-03-26T05:14:06] Unknown: Balance open diff volt
[2022-03-26T05:14:49] Unknown: .005v is fine... As long as it doesn't trigger while riding since cells are surely to exceed that under hard discharge
[2022-03-26T05:15:15] Unknown: Smaller number the better but don't want to over work the BMS balancer
[2022-03-26T05:17:15] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-26T05:19:15] rosheee: it is 0.05v atm
[2022-03-26T05:19:26] rosheee: so 0.025 or should i test sit hthe se values first?
[2022-03-26T05:19:33] rosheee: sry u're the man :D i have 0 idea
[2022-03-26T05:25:03] Unknown: I would leave at .005v and see what happens. Raising higher would allow p groups to go further out of balance if they were going to... Raising higher would allow you to see the difference better while charging. If set to .005v, balancer might kick in without you knowing you you think everything is fine and balanced when it's really not
[2022-03-26T05:25:25] Unknown: Will you be watching the charge or charging over night?
[2022-03-26T05:25:40] rosheee: yep battery is next 2 me
[2022-03-26T05:26:01] Unknown: Then just keep an eye on the voltage difference between the p groups/cells
[2022-03-26T05:26:56] Unknown: I would set to .010v just to see... Or even .015v... That way you can know if cells are backed or if balancer is activated
[2022-03-26T05:28:06] Unknown: If set too low (.005v) your balancer may kick on (without realizing it) and make you think everything is good when it might not be (balancer is making up the difference) .. make sense?
[2022-03-26T05:29:42] Unknown: Personally I would set high (so balancer never kicks in)... And see where voltages end up after charging. That will give you a really good idea how balanced they are... If way off.... Set balance diff volt lower and balanced will kick on and balance your cells
[2022-03-26T05:29:56] Unknown: Just good to get a baseline without the balancer is all
[2022-03-26T05:36:55] rosheee: ok
[2022-03-26T05:41:14] rosheee: can't charge to 100% tnght
[2022-03-26T10:29:54] Artem Bulashev: It spent handle 180a battery
[2022-03-26T10:30:11] Artem Bulashev: And will be real hot at 200a
[2022-03-26T10:30:23] Artem Bulashev: Nearly melting hot
[2022-03-26T10:31:19] Artem Bulashev: It has rating of 110a
[2022-03-26T10:34:46] Artem Bulashev: At 200a I would expect it to get to 80c in relatively short time (30-60sec)

[2022-03-26T10:39:54] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-26T14:15:25] Oliver Eliasson: Could you link a good fancy charger?
[2022-03-26T14:19:11] Happy Giraffe: Haven't used them personally yet, I plan to in 4 months. I've used basic bms that balance when full so no need. Later on I will only charge to 95%
[2022-03-26T14:19:50] Oliver Eliasson: But i cant seem to find any but the satioator for 350$
[2022-03-26T14:29:02] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I looked at something but can't remember. Adjustable ones should do same thing tho if you have active balance bms

[2022-03-26T14:37:49] Happy Giraffe: I wonder how much can voltage trimming knob usually do, @artBula got input on this? Could 95% charge be achieved just with trim?

[2022-03-26T15:46:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Very slow x)
[2022-03-26T15:47:08] Happy Giraffe: I have torque now with 140A phase😂
[2022-03-26T15:47:44] Happy Giraffe: There was some overheating shit going on with the vesc before I think so I never got the full power

[2022-03-26T21:03:35] Unknown: Guys... Does ant BMS use active balancer? Like, a button to toggle in the app for balance on/off?
[2022-03-26T21:04:15] Unknown: I have someone asking me a question but not sure how ant BMS balances
[2022-03-26T21:06:44] Unknown: What could be happening here? Doesn't seem likely 4-5 bad/weak p groups ... Maybe just hasn't been balanced in a long time?
[2022-03-26T21:17:23] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-03-26T21:24:01] Unknown: Can activate even at low state of charge?
[2022-03-26T21:24:24] Unknown: Says here battery must be charged to balance...? True or not true?

[2022-03-27T04:23:06] Unknown: Yup... 80a Vsett motors can *probably* handle.. not sure about continuous but with ferrofluid I think maybe
[2022-03-27T04:23:35] Unknown: What makes blade motor 1500w vs Vsett 10 1400w.. difference?
[2022-03-27T04:23:39] Unknown: KV?
[2022-03-27T04:23:53] Unknown: Both very similar correct?
[2022-03-27T04:25:06] Paolo ⁭: Do not see watt declaration
[2022-03-27T04:25:23] Paolo ⁭: You should measure with tool to see how much current can support
[2022-03-27T04:25:27] Unknown: Ohh . I thought blade were 1500w
[2022-03-27T04:25:35] Unknown: How?
[2022-03-27T04:25:48] rosheee: Tjrottlee doesnt work omg
[2022-03-27T04:25:58] Paolo ⁭: They customize serial of motor based by controllers
[2022-03-27T04:26:08] Unknown: I only know this... Test motors and watch temps as batt amps increase. Limit batt amps when motor temps reach max
[2022-03-27T04:27:08] Paolo ⁭: Motor heat it’s directly proportional with motor resistance 🤷‍♂️
[2022-03-27T04:27:12] Unknown: Oh really? So what if you needed a spare motor? I did notice with a replacement 10+ motor the kv was quite a bit higher than the previous motor (470 ERPM vs 490 ERPM)
[2022-03-27T04:27:45] Paolo ⁭: Yes in the fact they don’t changed watt in serial lol
[2022-03-27T04:27:49] Unknown: Slightly different amount of copper in the windings maybe?
[2022-03-27T04:27:59] Unknown: Interesting
[2022-03-27T04:28:05] Paolo ⁭: If anyway more kV with same motor = more current supported
[2022-03-27T04:28:26] Unknown: Gotcha. I have the higher kv motor on rear 👍👍
[2022-03-27T04:28:27] Paolo ⁭: But normally you have shit torque lol, not efficient
[2022-03-27T04:28:51] Paolo ⁭: You need to find the good setup
[2022-03-27T04:28:53] Unknown: Well, my torque is actually insane. Efficiency is.. ehh
[2022-03-27T04:29:12] Unknown: But 43ah battery, I can afford 70 wh/km 🤣

[2022-03-27T04:32:00] Paolo ⁭: Now it goes automatically protection mode
[2022-03-27T04:32:05] Unknown: Makes sense

[2022-03-27T04:39:19] Unknown: Beautiful. Thermal pads are our friend. I have them under my battery (2.5mm) and under my external controllers (2mm). Going to get thicker ones for my controllers to give them more cushion from vibration on the stem/neck
[2022-03-27T04:39:57] Unknown: They can make a huge difference when placed properly

[2022-03-27T05:03:42] Paolo ⁭: You can also use for measure wire resistance and battery resistance
[2022-03-27T05:03:49] Paolo ⁭: Not accurate
[2022-03-27T05:03:49] rosheee: Ok
[2022-03-27T05:04:09] rosheee: But u feel the difference when only use 3 instead of 6 wires
[2022-03-27T05:04:15] rosheee: Cant even reorder them

[2022-03-27T05:15:33] Unknown: Lower kv?
[2022-03-27T05:15:53] Paolo ⁭: Can be did

[2022-03-27T05:17:32] Paolo ⁭: Excluding shipping but🥲

[2022-03-27T05:30:57] Unknown: I used CST 10x3, which ended up at 10x2.75 when mounted/inflated and also PMT 10x3 (true 10x3 when mounted/inflated)... Honestly they are quite similar but PMT do perform better. CST close 2nd place
[2022-03-27T05:32:03] Unknown: CSTs are really nice actually but will not use them in place of my PMT E-Fire 10x3 if I can help it. Have 2 sets of PMT 10x3 🤓

[2022-03-27T13:15:32] Artem Bulashev: You realize you can’t get to be as fast as 1400w motor that needs 35a * dual with dual 350w and using only 20a setting
[2022-03-27T13:16:19] sombre_enfant: Was on 72v but w given compared its about less
[2022-03-27T13:16:19] Artem Bulashev: Even if you increase your voltage 36v to 75v that will set you motor to equivalent of 730w
[2022-03-27T13:16:37] rosheee: Ok hefe bitch
[2022-03-27T13:16:39] rosheee: Wait
[2022-03-27T13:16:44] rosheee: I send it
[2022-03-27T13:16:56] sombre_enfant: On 36v it was on delta switching
[2022-03-27T13:16:56] Artem Bulashev: Still will not be able to have faster acceleration than 1400w dual that needs 35amp :)
[2022-03-27T13:17:09] Artem Bulashev: Oh that is no longer same motor than
[2022-03-27T13:17:22] rosheee: Prepare 2 cry

[2022-03-27T13:19:14] Artem Bulashev: you pass by scooter rent that is NOT 40kmh slower than you
[2022-03-27T13:19:24] Artem Bulashev: I don’t think your speed shows accurate
[2022-03-27T13:19:29] Artem Bulashev: It doesn’t look like 65kmh

[2022-03-27T13:25:16] Artem Bulashev: Go constant 40kmh and compare to gps
[2022-03-27T13:25:21] Artem Bulashev: 👍
[2022-03-27T13:25:37] Artem Bulashev: Gps can’t measure acceleration speed well
[2022-03-27T13:25:54] Artem Bulashev: Unless it is dedicated high frequency gps like RaceLoggic
[2022-03-27T13:26:11] Artem Bulashev: Phone gps is terrible in accuracy of acceleration

[2022-03-27T13:31:28] Artem Bulashev: Top speed is just volt at r and kv you can have 60kmh if you use 75v

[2022-03-27T13:32:18] Artem Bulashev: I think stock motor on that scooter doesn’t have such kv
[2022-03-27T13:32:32] Artem Bulashev: To spin 45 kmh at 36v

[2022-03-27T13:34:18] Artem Bulashev: No idea on g30 motor kv
[2022-03-27T13:34:29] Artem Bulashev: I can believe it can go 45kmh top speed sure
[2022-03-27T13:34:52] Artem Bulashev: Under load
[2022-03-27T13:35:02] Artem Bulashev: But acceleration that’s the question
[2022-03-27T13:35:11] sombre_enfant: It go 30kph on 36v stock
[2022-03-27T13:35:41] Artem Bulashev: I dual Gen 2 max g30 motors doing that acceleration that is hard to believe
[2022-03-27T13:36:01] sombre_enfant: 😐😐
[2022-03-27T13:36:04] Artem Bulashev: Than how does his go 50kmh ?
[2022-03-27T13:36:20] sombre_enfant: u dont heard the relay do clack
[2022-03-27T13:36:35] Artem Bulashev: More amps should not result in such top speed boost
[2022-03-27T13:37:09] sombre_enfant: Its delta the rpm increase its totally normal...
[2022-03-27T13:37:23] Artem Bulashev: He said he didn’t rewind
[2022-03-27T13:37:28] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2022-03-27T13:37:51] sombre_enfant: Its rewinded but not by him
[2022-03-27T13:38:12] Artem Bulashev: Your video makes sense if it is rewinded motor than it is no longer same 👍😊 great job
[2022-03-27T13:38:27] Artem Bulashev: His video I don’t understand
[2022-03-27T13:38:38] Artem Bulashev: This
[2022-03-27T13:38:41] sombre_enfant: It should get more top speed right ? My battery was sag ing hard
[2022-03-27T13:39:17] Artem Bulashev: Increase in amps can result in a lot better acceleration and abit better top speed (not above stock Air rpm)
[2022-03-27T13:39:51] sombre_enfant: On my vid its stock wiring nothing changed but a bad 72v (flat layout) and dual motor and stock controller
[2022-03-27T13:39:58] Artem Bulashev: Didn’t think stock max g30 can get up to 48kmh
[2022-03-27T13:40:13] sombre_enfant: No real stock its impossible
[2022-03-27T13:40:13] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-27T13:40:24] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-03-27T13:41:22] Artem Bulashev: Exactly isn’t stock g30 max air speed is like 32kmh-38kmh?
[2022-03-27T13:42:10] rosheee: Was my lighter btw
[2022-03-27T13:42:11] sombre_enfant: Gen 2 39 in air gen 1 30, he got german so gen1
[2022-03-27T13:42:25] rosheee: Hmm
[2022-03-27T13:42:30] rosheee: I had gen1 and gen2
[2022-03-27T13:42:36] rosheee: So idk which motor is on
[2022-03-27T13:42:51] rosheee: Or gen1 housing with gen2motor
[2022-03-27T13:42:55] sombre_enfant: Its blue so gen1 for me idk🥸
[2022-03-27T13:43:07] rosheee: I changed
[2022-03-27T13:43:16] rosheee: Dis scooter was my old one..sold 2 friend
[2022-03-27T13:43:21] rosheee: But motor brand new
[2022-03-27T13:43:45] rosheee: Gen1 more torque
[2022-03-27T13:43:49] rosheee: Gen2 more speed
[2022-03-27T13:44:15] rosheee: This is gen2 in gen1 housw
[2022-03-27T13:44:19] sombre_enfant: I still wait for the 16s delta 90kph😐
[2022-03-27T13:44:24] rosheee: <photos/photo_3262@27-03-2022_13-44-24.jpg>
[2022-03-27T13:44:37] rosheee: 16S with amps can go 90
[2022-03-27T13:44:46] rosheee: When i do nearly 100 with 17S
[2022-03-27T13:45:06] Happy Giraffe: Grippy texture on the wheel on all sides?
[2022-03-27T13:45:38] sombre_enfant: The gorilla grip😏
[2022-03-27T13:47:13] Artem Bulashev: Gen2 on stock 36v can’t get above 40v without load, this means that doesn’t matter how many amps you push it won’t get above that speed under load
[2022-03-27T13:47:26] Artem Bulashev: Are you high man😄🤣🤣
[2022-03-27T13:47:52] Artem Bulashev: Stock g30 max motor on 16s will not do 90kmh even in the air
[2022-03-27T13:49:28] Happy Giraffe: High kv is always capable of same torque at same heating level, you just gotta push more amps🌚
[2022-03-27T13:49:57] Mirono escooters: I prefer low kv high v
[2022-03-27T13:50:22] Paolo ⁭: Yes but I can’t fit more than 18s lol
[2022-03-27T13:59:19] Happy Giraffe: Thats sexy!
[2022-03-27T14:03:12] sombre_enfant: True 20s go 78 freewheel
[2022-03-27T14:03:37] Happy Giraffe: Yes, easiest is to do vesc log and compare difference😎
[2022-03-27T14:04:07] sombre_enfant: But delta should do around 90 on 16s...
[2022-03-27T14:07:19] Happy Giraffe: For this the motor needs to be decently sized, for the bike motor a QS205 or 3K turbo will take lot of phase even with 5/6T winding
[2022-03-27T14:08:33] Happy Giraffe: High kv and small wheel like scooters is perfect tho as you get best of both worlds
[2022-03-27T14:13:52] Artem Bulashev: 2s delta yeah I suppose, but not stock winding :))
[2022-03-27T16:04:09] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/EtC0mShaRbo
[2022-03-27T16:04:45] Happy Giraffe: This guy had to jumpstart the bms using 5v higher psu😳 is this common practice on these bms?
[2022-03-27T16:05:05] Unknown: Get the display. Has power button
[2022-03-27T16:05:15] Mirono escooters: I know that ant bms you can activate thé logic board
[2022-03-27T16:06:40] Unknown: JK BMS display. Has power button to turn BMS on and back off as you wish
[2022-03-27T16:06:41] Unknown: <photos/photo_3165@24-03-2022_17-34-09.jpg>
[2022-03-27T16:23:50] Happy Giraffe: Can't it be just turned on forever?😅
[2022-03-27T16:23:59] Artem Bulashev: = charger
[2022-03-27T16:24:19] Artem Bulashev: Yes BMS is set into protection mode from factory
[2022-03-27T16:24:21] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but if battery is nearly full🤔
[2022-03-27T16:24:33] Artem Bulashev: So that no matter what you do you won’t kill BMS
[2022-03-27T16:24:45] Artem Bulashev: Even if you short wires or connect in wrong order
[2022-03-27T16:24:50] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-27T16:25:07] Artem Bulashev: Battery are never assembled fully charged
[2022-03-27T16:25:09] Artem Bulashev: Never
[2022-03-27T16:25:11] Happy Giraffe: If cells are 3.7v then charger should work
[2022-03-27T16:25:17] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-27T16:25:26] Happy Giraffe: Was just weird to see this on video
[2022-03-27T16:26:29] Unknown: Oh course...
[2022-03-27T16:27:15] Happy Giraffe: Then no need for display😁
[2022-03-27T16:27:21] Unknown: It had me confused as well but it's not as difficult as it sounds. I just bought the $15 display to make sure I could turn it on after it was assemebled
[2022-03-27T16:27:23] Happy Giraffe: I hate displays
[2022-03-27T16:27:31] Unknown: No need but it's nice to have
[2022-03-27T16:27:45] Unknown: You can just use as a button and then put it aside, disconnect it
[2022-03-27T16:28:19] Happy Giraffe: So far I love the abcence of one, always thinking about speed in relation to road and surroundings
[2022-03-27T16:28:24] Unknown: I considered it a $15 on/button but turned out really nice so I mounted mine
[2022-03-27T16:28:29] Happy Giraffe: Yes, thanks for the tip
[2022-03-27T16:40:28] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3265@27-03-2022_16-40-28.jpg>
[2022-03-27T16:40:36] Artem Bulashev: My ride today :) stock 25kmh limited
[2022-03-27T16:40:39] Artem Bulashev: 😄😁
[2022-03-27T16:41:15] Artem Bulashev: Such f solid frame though it’s nuts! (Update designs - new neck, handlebar, better tires from stock)
[2022-03-27T16:57:44] Unknown: Seriously hard to beat Vsett design for solid chassis... Single stem design anyways
[2022-03-27T16:58:07] Unknown: I can't wait to see what you end up doing with this one 😁

[2022-03-27T19:02:05] Mirono escooters: I only see 2 shunts so... No phase shunts?
[2022-03-27T19:02:21] Artem Bulashev: 4.2 only users 2
[2022-03-27T19:02:27] Artem Bulashev: 3rd is calculated
[2022-03-27T19:02:35] Mirono escooters: Oh boy😂
[2022-03-27T19:02:37] Mirono escooters: Sounds sketchy?
[2022-03-27T19:02:42] Artem Bulashev: It is
[2022-03-27T19:02:48] Mirono escooters: no Batt shunt? Can prob calculate aswell
[2022-03-27T19:02:59] Mirono escooters: Why not just add a Third shunt i wonder. Even Xiaomi does
[2022-03-27T19:03:06] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2022-03-27T19:03:11] Artem Bulashev: No idea about it d
[2022-03-27T19:03:36] Artem Bulashev: I know it was said that foc was not very good on it because 2 instead of 3
[2022-03-27T19:03:40] Mirono escooters: I wanna mod thé cooling but stock shall be fine Shit that they only supply halls connector. I have to direct solder thé rest
[2022-03-27T19:03:50] Mirono escooters: 4.12 sucked on foc
[2022-03-27T19:03:59] Mirono escooters: But my 4.2 i never noticed anything
[2022-03-27T19:03:59] Artem Bulashev: Yeah may be 4.12
[2022-03-27T19:04:07] Artem Bulashev: 👍
[2022-03-27T19:04:10] Mirono escooters: It was suppper quiet. Maybe they fixed software or whatever
[2022-03-27T19:04:14] Artem Bulashev: You are right I think
[2022-03-27T19:04:22] Mirono escooters: It's just going in a cruiser scoot. No 150a phase anymore
[2022-03-27T19:04:23] Artem Bulashev: 4.2 fixed it I think
[2022-03-27T19:04:50] Mirono escooters: Yea i remember so
[2022-03-27T19:08:32] Mirono escooters: No display and bluetooth at same time. Pitty
[2022-03-27T19:12:22] Mirono escooters: Anyone know how to hook thé display up? Need specific firmware? This one does also display no info
[2022-03-27T19:27:53] Mirono escooters: Nvm needs firmware 3.6 or lower wich is rather shit
[2022-03-27T19:29:50] Mirono escooters: Where Can you find a library of older fw?
[2022-03-27T19:42:24] Artem Bulashev: Oh man
[2022-03-27T19:42:27] Artem Bulashev: That’s old as hell
[2022-03-27T19:42:35] Mirono escooters: Uhu i know 😂
[2022-03-27T19:42:45] Mirono escooters: Worth downgrading? 😅😅
[2022-03-27T19:42:51] Mirono escooters: I kinda want a display but yea
[2022-03-27T19:44:09] Mirono escooters: And i cant even get vesc to connect to pc, apperantly i am stupid
[2022-03-27T19:48:14] Mirono escooters: Ok fuck this.😂
[2022-03-27T19:48:20] Mirono escooters: No display For me
[2022-03-27T19:48:33] Mirono escooters: Ill use it with some generic controller as a cheap v display and speed
[2022-03-27T19:49:43] Artem Bulashev: Drove stock vsett9+ today 25kmh max. Was refreshing I have to say)) actually enjoyed it with my kid on a bicycle next to me. Even questions why do we really need MORE, and MOOOORRE AND mmmMmooooorrreree!
[2022-03-27T19:50:03] Artem Bulashev: + literally made circles around police car 🤣 Best feeling ever lol, gonna keep it this way and rest police patience and really make them know this is legal scooter 😄😄
[2022-03-27T19:51:31] Artem Bulashev: Than Boom mother fucker 65kmh pass police car 😁😁😎😎
[2022-03-27T19:51:35] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2022-03-27T19:52:32] Happy Giraffe: This is the way
[2022-03-27T19:52:37] Artem Bulashev: Damn 1450€ for 10+ is a bargain
[2022-03-27T19:53:28] Mirono escooters: Jezus they expensive 😂
[2022-03-27T19:54:49] Artem Bulashev: People spend more on m365 modes and it is still worse spec 😂
[2022-03-27T19:55:04] Mirono escooters: But but it's fun🥺👉👈
[2022-03-27T19:55:07] sombre_enfant: For a 20.8 it should be cheaper
[2022-03-27T19:55:46] Artem Bulashev: - dual shocks - dual disco breaks - dual 1000w - 60v battery upgrade - dual controller - m365 it self = much more than 1400€
[2022-03-27T19:56:26] Mirono escooters: I know i know
[2022-03-27T19:56:36] Mirono escooters: Just hefty to pay at once
[2022-03-27T19:56:43] Artem Bulashev: Well it so 2000€ new, so 600€ discount is not bad for eu local
[2022-03-27T19:57:32] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-03-27T19:58:11] Artem Bulashev: I stick with vsett9 because it has all the exterior futures I want, so I can mod it and retail “legal “ original look
[2022-03-27T19:59:11] Artem Bulashev: So of those m365 are dope and fast as hell and over 2000€ total, but they do not look stock anymore more so police will be like no way it is not modified power
[2022-03-27T19:59:35] Mirono escooters: Haha nop does not look stock at qll
[2022-03-27T19:59:41] Mirono escooters: Prob looks more modded then a modded 10x
[2022-03-27T20:00:00] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_3273@27-03-2022_20-00-00.jpg>
[2022-03-27T20:00:07] Artem Bulashev: Lol yeah and more regressive than stock blade 10
[2022-03-27T20:00:15] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2022-03-27T20:00:19] Mirono escooters: I admit
[2022-03-27T20:01:50] Artem Bulashev: That’s why i didn’t go m365 or g30 route + I realized it is illogical from money point of view vs vsett9 or other scooters that have dual disk breaks and good dual suspension from factory. Aerlang h6 pro v4 was my first take 😊 was amazing, but had design flat where deck would bend up near neck - after market solution was developed to weld cnc metal insert, but I didn’t want to bother and sold it used for more than I bought it from china
[2022-03-27T20:03:23] Mirono escooters: True. Even fully modded thé Xiaomi suspension cant cope with good design,
[2022-03-27T20:04:30] Oliver Eliasson: Im thinking of modding an inmotion s1 with 75100 and rest stock. Maybe new battery if needed and ferro fluid
[2022-03-27T20:05:20] Mirono escooters: But but my m365 pro was only 700€ Total +- and for that budhet beats any scoot in price range
[2022-03-27T20:14:13] Artem Bulashev: What happens when novice person makes a complex battery build 😂
[2022-03-27T20:14:18] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2022-03-27T20:16:25] sombre_enfant: Look G30 2nd hand 210€ Sold battery 150€ Sold motor 130€ Part: Monorim fork 70€ Nutt brake pair 100€ Motor x2 380€ 16s5p 40t 260€ Charger 30€ Controller component 100€ Divers fourniture 50€ For less than 1000€ you do something decent
[2022-03-27T20:26:03] Unknown: To be honest I agree with you... to a point lol. The power on my 10+ is straight ridiculous when set high. Find myself cruising on speed mode 2 with moderate but still powerful settings (7.5kw or so). It's faster than stock for sure but still very enjoyable. Speed mode 1 is about close to stock 10+ power and acceleration and still very fun and enjoyable. I'm finding the biggest benefit to my new setup is the range and extremely low voltage drop. The power is fun and nice to have but the bigger battery with insane range is hot ticket
[2022-03-27T20:27:16] Artem Bulashev: Imagine with stock controller the range 😄😄
[2022-03-27T20:27:29] Artem Bulashev: Set battery amps to 30 each 😎😁😁👌
[2022-03-27T20:27:52] Artem Bulashev: Not even actually
[2022-03-27T20:28:25] Artem Bulashev: 75v 24a each = stock 60v 30a

[2022-03-28T12:38:26] Artem Bulashev: M50LT is great if it is cheaper than 50g
[2022-03-28T12:38:55] Artem Bulashev: 50g has less sag at 15a but at 10a almost identical
[2022-03-28T12:39:09] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2022-03-28T12:39:17] sombre_enfant: Yeah just find out today in scooterhacking chat, their 500$ battery is 13s4p tesla model3, maybe already factory made
[2022-03-28T12:39:19] Paolo ⁭: You should be know LG cells are all designed for long life, not for performance
[2022-03-28T12:40:20] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3290@28-03-2022_12-40-20.jpg>
[2022-03-28T12:40:21] Paolo ⁭: Same cells used on boyueda and laotie ti30 etc because very cheap
[2022-03-28T12:40:24] Artem Bulashev: Here is m50
[2022-03-28T12:40:33] Artem Bulashev: Same as 48x at 10a
[2022-03-28T12:40:42] sombre_enfant: "So nice, expensive quality"😂😂💀
[2022-03-28T12:41:25] Artem Bulashev: So M50LT is actually better than 48x at 15a and for sure at 10a
[2022-03-28T12:41:25] Paolo ⁭: Expensive?
[2022-03-28T12:41:35] Paolo ⁭: Cost 2$ grade D
[2022-03-28T12:41:37] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-03-28T12:42:04] sombre_enfant: The layout is weird asl tho why he do 4p like that when he can do straight 4p
[2022-03-28T12:42:13] Artem Bulashev: Sure but m50LT performs awesome if we are to trust that test above
[2022-03-28T12:42:42] Artem Bulashev: This is 4 straight
[2022-03-28T12:42:43] sombre_enfant: He will go viral as carter nordium incident one day
[2022-03-28T12:42:52] Paolo ⁭: If you check cycle life it’s top than all
[2022-03-28T12:43:01] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3292@28-03-2022_12-43-01.jpg>
[2022-03-28T12:43:07] Artem Bulashev: Will do
[2022-03-28T12:43:16] Paolo ⁭: Also he use these cells?
[2022-03-28T12:43:32] sombre_enfant: Maybe he forgot insulator on some...
[2022-03-28T12:43:49] Happy Giraffe: 50LT is 3.65€/each for 130
[2022-03-28T12:44:00] Artem Bulashev: 48x cycle life is 2000 cycles down to 80%
[2022-03-28T12:44:33] sombre_enfant: Nah nordium was milled bulk littokala, but its the same thing, overpriced just to get monopole of a community (g30)
[2022-03-28T12:44:52] Happy Giraffe: 50G 5.8€
[2022-03-28T12:44:53] Artem Bulashev: M50 cycle life 500 cycles - that’s typical.
[2022-03-28T12:44:58] Artem Bulashev: Nothing great
[2022-03-28T12:45:13] Artem Bulashev: And that is with 0.33C charge and discharge
[2022-03-28T12:45:22] Happy Giraffe: LT supposed to go 1000 but they say its 4.15v then
[2022-03-28T12:45:26] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-28T12:47:30] Paolo ⁭: Let me check
[2022-03-28T12:47:34] Paolo ⁭: I was never focused on cycle life
[2022-03-28T12:47:44] Paolo ⁭: But in 18650 LG is the top
[2022-03-28T12:48:23] Artem Bulashev: 48x 1000cycles at 80% but they are running 1C charge and discharge, not 0.33C
[2022-03-28T12:49:05] Happy Giraffe: Why cant one guy just buy 3x of each cells and test all?😂
[2022-03-28T12:49:29] Artem Bulashev: https://www.dnkpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-INR21700-M50-Datasheet.pdf

[2022-03-28T12:51:15] Paolo ⁭: P42A vs VTC6A
[2022-03-28T13:03:22] Artem Bulashev: Considering 60c is max you should see both of them should be rated 20a continuous
[2022-03-28T13:03:31] Artem Bulashev: Without cooling like we have
[2022-03-28T13:04:05] Artem Bulashev: P42a is better specially at 20/30/40a
[2022-03-28T13:04:17] Paolo ⁭: With more sag
[2022-03-28T13:05:16] Artem Bulashev: ?)
[2022-03-28T13:05:22] Artem Bulashev: Vtc6 has more sag
[2022-03-28T13:05:53] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3298@28-03-2022_13-05-53.jpg>
[2022-03-28T13:06:55] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3299@28-03-2022_13-06-55.jpg>
[2022-03-28T13:07:04] Paolo ⁭: You see when cell is less than 50% , that isn’t sag, that is because cell has less capacity
[2022-03-28T13:07:51] Paolo ⁭: Sag is difference from voltage by cell no working to cell working voltage
[2022-03-28T13:08:43] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3300@28-03-2022_13-08-43.jpg>
[2022-03-28T13:08:59] Paolo ⁭: If I have 100Ah but 10A only cell then less sag?
[2022-03-28T13:09:48] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3301@28-03-2022_13-09-48.jpg>
[2022-03-28T13:09:52] Paolo ⁭: That’s the sag
[2022-03-28T13:09:56] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3302@28-03-2022_13-09-56.jpg>
[2022-03-28T13:10:34] Paolo ⁭: There’s no sense comparative
[2022-03-28T13:10:57] Artem Bulashev: No man
[2022-03-28T13:10:59] Artem Bulashev: 😄
[2022-03-28T13:11:10] Artem Bulashev: That’s original drop
[2022-03-28T13:11:29] Artem Bulashev: Why would you care about what happens when you remove charger
[2022-03-28T13:11:37] Artem Bulashev: And than apply first load?
[2022-03-28T13:11:59] Artem Bulashev: At least look at 0.5ah at first step
[2022-03-28T13:12:01] Paolo ⁭: If you have more capacity, the drop in graphic is normal will be lower
[2022-03-28T13:12:24] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3303@28-03-2022_13-12-24.jpg>

[2022-03-28T13:13:46] Paolo ⁭: If there’s the sense why they made Samsung 30T 😂
[2022-03-28T13:13:49] Artem Bulashev: Vtc has less sag for first 0.2ah
[2022-03-28T13:13:51] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2022-03-28T13:13:57] Artem Bulashev: Who cares about those ?
[2022-03-28T13:14:16] Artem Bulashev: Votage sag referees to entire curve Andre specific load
[2022-03-28T13:14:36] Artem Bulashev: The higher average voltage hold the less sag you experience during ride
[2022-03-28T13:16:04] Paolo ⁭: I repeat , voltage sag means the drop voltage difference from no working state to working state
[2022-03-28T13:18:33] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3305@28-03-2022_13-18-33.jpg>
[2022-03-28T13:19:06] Artem Bulashev: Yes exactly
[2022-03-28T13:19:31] Artem Bulashev: But that very first part is of the cell first 0.2ah capacity
[2022-03-28T13:20:21] Paolo ⁭: I anyway for choose cell I make a difference grade from measured internal resistance with measured capacity
[2022-03-28T13:20:21] Artem Bulashev: Do you really care more about what happens when cell is super full or what happens when cell is 90-0% ?
[2022-03-28T13:20:27] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3306@28-03-2022_13-20-27.jpg>
[2022-03-28T13:20:54] Artem Bulashev: Here is vtc6a and p42a
[2022-03-28T13:21:04] Artem Bulashev: Higher voltage one will have higher Wh
[2022-03-28T13:21:10] Artem Bulashev: His is down to 3v only
[2022-03-28T13:21:35] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3307@28-03-2022_13-21-35.jpg>
[2022-03-28T13:22:17] Artem Bulashev: 10% higher at any amp draw even though capacity is 5% higher
[2022-03-28T13:23:03] Paolo ⁭: You have date of these stats ?
[2022-03-28T13:23:12] Paolo ⁭: They have did more version
[2022-03-28T13:23:42] Paolo ⁭: Comparative with old version cell no make sense
[2022-03-28T13:23:43] Artem Bulashev: What you mean ?
[2022-03-28T13:23:50] Artem Bulashev: Oh moment
[2022-03-28T13:24:04] Artem Bulashev: Vtc6a or p42a?
[2022-03-28T13:24:10] Paolo ⁭: Both
[2022-03-28T13:24:24] Paolo ⁭: For example here is 2018
[2022-03-28T13:24:36] Paolo ⁭: 2020 batch is different
[2022-03-28T13:24:50] Paolo ⁭: But I cannot find 2020 test
[2022-03-28T13:25:02] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3308@28-03-2022_13-25-02.jpg>
[2022-03-28T13:25:31] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3309@28-03-2022_13-25-31.jpg>
[2022-03-28T13:25:42] Artem Bulashev: That’s what was tested
[2022-03-28T13:26:32] Artem Bulashev: I sent my 2021 35e Samsung and they were 100% identical and even a bit better than original when 35e where released in 2016 and tested by same guy on same bench
[2022-03-28T13:26:59] Artem Bulashev: So not sure if cells change chemistry that much without clear indication of model change
[2022-03-28T13:33:55] Paolo ⁭: Old cells are 9.5/9.6mOhm , new ones are 8.3/8.4
[2022-03-28T13:34:18] Paolo ⁭: And yes perform better too
[2022-03-28T13:34:39] Paolo ⁭: Have 8v with 200A batt
[2022-03-28T13:37:06] Happy Giraffe: I have no idea why volts dont start from 4.2v either
[2022-03-28T13:37:22] Happy Giraffe: Start 4.2 end 3.0
[2022-03-28T13:37:25] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-28T15:03:59] Artem Bulashev: Old vtc6?
[2022-03-28T15:04:20] Artem Bulashev: Did you measure them when they were new back than or just now?
[2022-03-28T15:04:34] Artem Bulashev: Because cells age even when seating on the shelf not being used
[2022-03-28T15:04:40] Artem Bulashev: I tested it
[2022-03-28T15:06:56] Artem Bulashev: Bottom one is 2016 cell in 2016 top one is early 2020 cell new I had and shipped for test in mid 2021 Middle one is 2021 cell I shipped to test in mid 2021

[2022-03-28T23:41:43] Unknown: I use 2.5cm spacer on Vsett 10+ and center of gravity is a lil different. Wouldn't want to go much or really any higher. 5cm spacer will ride very differently
[2022-03-28T23:42:08] Artem Bulashev: They have deck opening on bottom
[2022-03-28T23:42:16] Artem Bulashev: So they loose clearance
[2022-03-28T23:42:29] Artem Bulashev: But doesn’t make you stay higher

[2022-03-28T23:44:38] Unknown: But pretty damn close

[2022-03-28T23:44:52] Artem Bulashev: We do :)
[2022-03-28T23:44:58] rosheee: ENJOY
[2022-03-28T23:45:12] Unknown: Oh gotcha. That's included in the 455?
[2022-03-28T23:45:35] Unknown: .. rear most part of circle
[2022-03-28T23:45:35] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-03-28T23:45:57] Unknown: Oh oh.. well that's good. So square portion is 455
[2022-03-28T23:46:26] Artem Bulashev: Each about 55mm more but of course that is half circle so not that much useful area, and front is not high at about 25-49.5m gradient
[2022-03-28T23:46:42] Artem Bulashev: But still a lot of real estate from such small 23kg scooter
[2022-03-28T23:47:56] Unknown: Oh interesting. Deck is more shallow at front? Didn't know that. But yea, that is lots of room for that size scooter
[2022-03-28T23:48:58] Artem Bulashev: No no, it is under neck
[2022-03-28T23:49:31] Artem Bulashev: So there is some gradual shapes and not open top (it goes abit under neck, so structural ribs on sides and on top but yeah still enough space for wires for example and dc-dc

[2022-03-30T00:17:37] rosheee: "hey can i put 72V inside?"
[2022-03-30T00:17:54] rosheee: he like 16 years old and i asked how fast he thinks 72V bring him
[2022-03-30T00:18:00] rosheee: "like 40-50kmh"
[2022-03-30T00:18:18] rosheee: looks like they talk about 72V @schoool but never drove 36V
[2022-03-30T00:19:05] Paolo ⁭: I need g30
[2022-03-30T00:19:18] Paolo ⁭: I bought one with monorim for 300€ wtf
[2022-03-30T00:19:32] Paolo ⁭: And still ask why I sold it
[2022-03-30T00:29:24] Happy Giraffe: You can buy frame for 300€ I think
[2022-03-30T00:29:43] Mirono escooters: Me who got rental frame for 140
[2022-03-30T00:29:45] rosheee: Lol
[2022-03-30T00:29:50] rosheee: 97kmh uphill
[2022-03-30T00:32:23] Unknown: This is g30? Segway ninebot...?

[2022-03-30T00:39:40] rosheee: Even 3rd run..bit slower but omg
[2022-03-30T00:40:27] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-03-30T00:43:09] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣 true
[2022-03-30T00:43:22] rosheee: Word
[2022-03-30T00:43:34] Luis Magalhaes: you have to do top speed too 🤣🤣
[2022-03-30T00:46:24] rosheee: Yes
[2022-03-30T00:46:37] rosheee: I go to vsett kaboo dealer next week
[2022-03-30T00:46:47] rosheee: Tell him to fire his shit up He 20kg lighter
[2022-03-30T00:46:55] rosheee: But need LN2 cooling
[2022-03-30T00:47:28] rosheee: 1st run, uphill and downhill

[2022-03-30T00:50:14] rosheee: Another one
[2022-03-30T00:51:22] Luis Magalhaes: 90+kmh on a gmax ? you dont like to be alive? 🤣🤣💪
[2022-03-30T00:51:27] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-03-30T00:53:34] rosheee: It id pretty stable
[2022-03-30T00:53:48] rosheee: Not like gi gerwheels storm wobble
[2022-03-30T00:53:59] Luis Magalhaes: bigger wheels made diference too 😁
[2022-03-30T00:54:14] Luis Magalhaes: send a pic of the scooter
[2022-03-30T00:54:25] rosheee: 10 inch
[2022-03-30T00:54:29] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-30T00:54:48] Luis Magalhaes: larger tyre then original 🤣
[2022-03-30T00:55:15] Paolo ⁭: Which monorim you use?
[2022-03-30T00:55:19] Happy Giraffe: Isnt g30 10"?
[2022-03-30T00:55:21] Paolo ⁭: G30 model of xiaomi model
[2022-03-30T00:55:35] Paolo ⁭: Because I don’t see where’s brake support
[2022-03-30T00:57:34] Luis Magalhaes: @roscheeee pic pic
[2022-03-30T00:57:37] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-03-30T00:58:08] Unknown: I mean.. impressive but definitely not sustainable at that power. uBox will turn to molten liquid metal. Even Vsett motors on 240 battery amps will fail pretty quick especially without ferrofluid. Those 20 second bursts are fun to watch but definitely nothing you can run at for any extended period of time
[2022-03-30T00:58:26] rosheee: <files/2022-03-30_00-27-31.csv>
[2022-03-30T00:58:29] rosheee: I know
[2022-03-30T00:58:47] rosheee: But i gonna test it sooon until 10% battery
[2022-03-30T00:58:58] rosheee: With lower amps
[2022-03-30T00:58:59] Artem Bulashev: Man fit tempnsenor
[2022-03-30T00:59:05] rosheee: Motor?
[2022-03-30T00:59:08] Artem Bulashev: And ferrofluid
[2022-03-30T00:59:10] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-30T00:59:15] Luis Magalhaes: your not using a electric scooter long range at full speed 😁
[2022-03-30T00:59:17] rosheee: Ferro is inside xD
[2022-03-30T00:59:20] rosheee: Motors arr not even earm
[2022-03-30T01:00:07] Unknown: When I'm pulling 10kw on my Vsett, my motors with ferrofluid aren't hot at all and my 12F controllers are barely above ambient. uBox temp raising that fast is sort of scary LoL
[2022-03-30T01:00:08] Luis Magalhaes: 250A is fase dual current @roscheeee right ?
[2022-03-30T01:00:17] Artem Bulashev: 180a phase 60a battery each I will be suprised if vsett 10+ motor wont get over 80c in summer 25km ride
[2022-03-30T01:00:19] Unknown: Dual battery I believe
[2022-03-30T01:00:35] Paolo ⁭: Yea
[2022-03-30T01:00:50] Paolo ⁭: Ubox will fail with more than 200A phase
[2022-03-30T01:00:55] Unknown: That's about what I estimate too
[2022-03-30T01:01:31] Unknown: I was around 60C with 15C ambient... 180a phase and 65a battery
[2022-03-30T01:01:38] rosheee: Yup
[2022-03-30T01:01:57] Artem Bulashev: No wonder your ubox is getting hot lol
[2022-03-30T01:02:17] Luis Magalhaes: my setup was 60Ax2 battery and 220Ax2 motors on ubox and 16S and it runs fine, when i go to long rides a have to be conservative or the battery dont last any way 😂
[2022-03-30T01:02:21] rosheee: Here
[2022-03-30T01:02:21] rosheee: <files/2022-03-30_00-27-31.csv>
[2022-03-30T01:02:22] rosheee: I need better cooled esc which generates less heat
[2022-03-30T01:02:22] rosheee: <photos/photo_3327@30-03-2022_01-02-22.jpg>
[2022-03-30T01:03:00] Artem Bulashev: Swap mosfets for better once with lower IR
[2022-03-30T01:03:19] Artem Bulashev: That should cut heat production by twice
[2022-03-30T01:03:40] Luis Magalhaes: that should be a good mod to see
[2022-03-30T01:03:48] Artem Bulashev: Ubox Dual running 440a phase?
[2022-03-30T01:03:57] Artem Bulashev: lol no way
[2022-03-30T01:04:13] Artem Bulashev: Absolute or Phase amp limit 220?
[2022-03-30T01:04:14] rosheee: i hit 260a
[2022-03-30T01:04:25] Artem Bulashev: Man spike doesn’t matter
[2022-03-30T01:04:30] Artem Bulashev: Sustainable matters
[2022-03-30T01:04:41] Luis Magalhaes: it was whats programed 🤣 it spikes and lower right after start 🙈🤣
[2022-03-30T01:04:50] Paolo ⁭: Not too much 80C
[2022-03-30T01:04:55] rosheee: <photos/photo_3328@30-03-2022_01-04-55.jpg>
[2022-03-30T01:05:07] Paolo ⁭: I got 100c with flipsky
[2022-03-30T01:05:09] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-03-30T01:05:11] rosheee: omg
[2022-03-30T01:05:12] rosheee: XD
[2022-03-30T01:05:14] Luis Magalhaes: fase absolute was higher then fase
[2022-03-30T01:05:49] Artem Bulashev: 220a is phase amp setting or absolute setting ?
[2022-03-30T01:06:15] Luis Magalhaes: thats the max i done at mine but was decreasing power at that temperature too but never shut down or get above 82
[2022-03-30T01:06:41] Artem Bulashev: Ubox on stem?
[2022-03-30T01:06:55] Luis Magalhaes: motor phase 220A the absolute was like 250A i think
[2022-03-30T01:07:09] Luis Magalhaes: on deck, but with vents
[2022-03-30T01:07:21] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-03-30T01:07:37] Artem Bulashev: How did ubox not melt
[2022-03-30T01:08:06] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb used more 😂😂
[2022-03-30T01:08:10] Artem Bulashev: We used to get stater on 135a phase setting due to interfere and noise from power board getting to MCU
[2022-03-30T01:08:12] rosheee: holy i have 135A each motor + 180A each esc max and 2x80A battery
[2022-03-30T01:08:34] rosheee: but hmm..
[2022-03-30T01:08:47] Artem Bulashev: Is yours new design or old red one ?
[2022-03-30T01:09:12] rosheee: vents...hmm i had my frame open that it gets direct air + mounted to frame
[2022-03-30T01:09:19] Unknown: That was sort of my point
[2022-03-30T01:09:20] rosheee: maybe these shitty thermalgrizzly pads
[2022-03-30T01:09:21] Luis Magalhaes: you use more battery amps so the phase amps maintain higher for more time, at full speed i was doing like 85Ax2
[2022-03-30T01:09:46] Luis Magalhaes: red
[2022-03-30T01:10:15] Luis Magalhaes: it does not melt because it decreases fast to lower value lolol
[2022-03-30T01:10:43] Luis Magalhaes: but it was fun to start and burn rubber till 60kmh lolol
[2022-03-30T01:10:51] rosheee: LOL
[2022-03-30T01:10:55] Luis Magalhaes: front wheel of course 😂
[2022-03-30T01:11:11] Luis Magalhaes: on porpouse
[2022-03-30T01:11:54] Luis Magalhaes: but my top speed was 101.5kmh small downhill and 101kmh in the same rode up hill
[2022-03-30T01:11:58] Luis Magalhaes: full battery
[2022-03-30T01:12:07] rosheee: WITH 1 MOTOR'
[2022-03-30T01:12:09] rosheee: xD?
[2022-03-30T01:12:20] rosheee: damn..why is it get so hot
[2022-03-30T01:12:29] Artem Bulashev: I mean in other way, how doesn’t that generate enough EMI to short circuite MCU that is right there. Old mirco usb design could not handle 135a phase without glitching
[2022-03-30T01:12:32] rosheee: the 16S stays at max 60 degrees over 8-15km
[2022-03-30T01:12:56] Luis Magalhaes: no dual
[2022-03-30T01:13:05] rosheee: ah good
[2022-03-30T01:13:10] rosheee: what? vsett stuff?
[2022-03-30T01:13:45] Luis Magalhaes: dont know, i follow @SibClimb lead i think i use 250A lolol
[2022-03-30T01:13:55] Luis Magalhaes: wolf warrior
[2022-03-30T01:14:02] rosheee: 11"
[2022-03-30T01:14:08] Luis Magalhaes: yup
[2022-03-30T01:14:34] rosheee: Damn
[2022-03-30T01:14:40] Luis Magalhaes: but i fuked up the ubox ...
[2022-03-30T01:14:49] Stan: And controller from ?
[2022-03-30T01:15:29] Luis Magalhaes: and now i was mounting kelly 7218 but i was able to fuck up the front controller when trying to detect halls 😅 dont know why
[2022-03-30T01:15:38] Luis Magalhaes: ubox dual red one
[2022-03-30T01:15:48] Stan: Nice
[2022-03-30T01:15:48] rosheee: v1 is the best
[2022-03-30T01:15:51] rosheee: v2 is so hot
[2022-03-30T01:15:58] rosheee: the 16S has v1
[2022-03-30T01:16:00] rosheee: 17S v2
[2022-03-30T01:16:06] Stan: Where can u get v1
[2022-03-30T01:16:16] rosheee: productione nded
[2022-03-30T01:16:18] rosheee: ended
[2022-03-30T01:16:26] Stan: Anyone selling ?
[2022-03-30T01:16:28] rosheee: maybe they have some spare should i ask?
[2022-03-30T01:16:30] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-03-30T01:16:48] Luis Magalhaes: pass to the 100v
[2022-03-30T01:17:09] rosheee: and ubox v2 75V
[2022-03-30T01:17:11] Stan: Yes im actually Iinterested would be great thanks
[2022-03-30T01:17:12] rosheee: the purple one
[2022-03-30T01:17:16] rosheee: already done
[2022-03-30T01:17:24] Stan: Thanks man
[2022-03-30T01:17:37] rosheee: no prob i write when i get assnewr
[2022-03-30T01:17:38] rosheee: ANSWER
[2022-03-30T01:18:09] Stan: 👌 thx
[2022-03-30T01:18:25] rosheee: if i use 1:1 settings from 16S and the shit gets warm is it because battery has dem amps more than the 16S and no vdroop so it can't relax at voltcut?
[2022-03-30T01:21:09] rosheee: hmmm and input voltage dropped under 49volt
[2022-03-30T01:22:00] rosheee: what means SOC @ daly bms?
[2022-03-30T01:22:19] Paolo ⁭: Battery % at actually voltage
[2022-03-30T01:22:24] rosheee: ah ok ^^
[2022-03-30T01:22:24] rosheee: thx
[2022-03-30T01:22:26] rosheee: not health XD
[2022-03-30T01:22:31] rosheee: rofl
[2022-03-30T01:22:39] rosheee: from 100% to 26% in 4km
[2022-03-30T01:22:46] rosheee: maybe 6
[2022-03-30T01:22:48] rosheee: 4-6km
[2022-03-30T01:23:01] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-03-30T01:23:13] Paolo ⁭: Is hot only because heat dissipation is optimized
[2022-03-30T01:23:23] Luis Magalhaes: you are at worst voltage sag then me
[2022-03-30T01:23:24] Paolo ⁭: Red one burn fast due to no thermal contact
[2022-03-30T01:24:03] rosheee: it is ok
[2022-03-30T01:24:10] rosheee: where?
[2022-03-30T01:24:18] rosheee: red one has now 11'000km
[2022-03-30T01:24:26] Luis Magalhaes: from 67 to 48 sag ?
[2022-03-30T01:24:29] rosheee: <photos/photo_3329@30-03-2022_01-24-29.jpg>
[2022-03-30T01:24:45] rosheee: maybe i have to fuck it more
[2022-03-30T01:24:49] rosheee: that it get used to it like 16S
[2022-03-30T01:25:02] rosheee: <photos/photo_3330@30-03-2022_01-25-02.jpg>
[2022-03-30T01:25:16] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-03-30T01:25:27] rosheee: the sag is ok
[2022-03-30T01:25:32] Luis Magalhaes: i was getting like 10 to 12v sag 😅

[2022-03-30T01:26:48] rosheee: i think
[2022-03-30T01:26:50] Unknown: 19v sag? 🤣 If that's for real you might be pushing battery a lil much
[2022-03-30T01:26:55] Luis Magalhaes: ok
[2022-03-30T01:27:09] rosheee: yah cmon the 16S had couple times so hot that bms shutted off
[2022-03-30T01:27:09] Luis Magalhaes: just a litlle too much lolol
[2022-03-30T01:27:25] rosheee: the 16S has these sags 24/7
[2022-03-30T01:27:41] Unknown: Bro... Cells hate you

[2022-03-30T01:29:38] Unknown: Shit .1 or even .2 nickel will not take that abuse for long. You need copper to push like that safely... Nickel is acting like an insulator. Is you Chinese battery built with copper?
[2022-03-30T01:29:55] rosheee: since 11'000km
[2022-03-30T01:29:58] rosheee: it takes it

[2022-03-30T01:32:30] rosheee: or i just use the normal vsett 10+ motors
[2022-03-30T01:32:38] rosheee: instead of this dualshizzl

[2022-03-30T01:54:43] rosheee: Hmmm
[2022-03-30T01:55:02] Luis Magalhaes: the original firmware is up to 135A each
[2022-03-30T01:55:03] rosheee: 16S use 135A phase 170A max

[2022-03-30T03:19:32] rosheee: 12F?
[2022-03-30T03:19:58] Unknown: <photos/photo_3351@30-03-2022_03-19-58.jpg>
[2022-03-30T03:20:05] Unknown: Dual 12F
[2022-03-30T03:20:13] rosheee: Yes 2x12F
[2022-03-30T03:20:17] rosheee: Thrn onboard pc?
[2022-03-30T03:20:29] Unknown: 70/60 battery amp is 50% usage plus air cooled. They barely get above ambient
[2022-03-30T03:20:40] Unknown: Yup. The best
[2022-03-30T03:20:54] Unknown: No app, no PC. All settings direct from Canbus display
[2022-03-30T03:21:23] Unknown: But Nucular is hard to find right now. Kelly sabvoton would be best right now for similar setup
[2022-03-30T03:21:31] rosheee: This? Anything else?
[2022-03-30T03:21:53] Unknown: Bro... They're Russian. War. Not available
[2022-03-30T03:22:13] Unknown: I've had order for 4x 12F and 2x 6F for over a year
[2022-03-30T03:22:31] rosheee: <photos/photo_3353@30-03-2022_03-22-31.jpg>
[2022-03-30T03:22:33] Unknown: That's why I say Kelly/sabvoton
[2022-03-30T03:22:37] rosheee: I wait
[2022-03-30T03:22:50] rosheee: But argh...
[2022-03-30T03:22:56] Unknown: Preorder is free but probably 50000 people already waiting
[2022-03-30T03:23:14] rosheee: I preoeder
[2022-03-30T03:23:38] Unknown: Can't hurt. No cost. Maybe they'll move to Italy and fulfill orders soon 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-03-30T03:24:02] Unknown: I have a 18 month old preorder for 6x of their controllers LoL
[2022-03-30T03:24:23] Unknown: I have 1 spare 6f and display but I'm not selling it 😆😆😆
[2022-03-30T03:24:59] rosheee: <photos/photo_3354@30-03-2022_03-24-59.jpg>
[2022-03-30T03:25:00] Unknown: Sometimes guys will sell on endless sphere. That's where I found all 3 of mine
[2022-03-30T03:25:22] Unknown: That's great. But doesn't mean much.. very very very unfortunately
[2022-03-30T03:25:28] rosheee: Hmmm
[2022-03-30T03:25:31] rosheee: Now vsett
[2022-03-30T03:26:09] Unknown: I would go for Vsett. It's perfect chassis for upgrading battery and controllers. Plus exa 291r shocks and PMT 10x3 e fire
[2022-03-30T03:26:23] Unknown: But would be illegal in your country due to motor size
[2022-03-30T03:27:05] Unknown: Vsett 11 super is amazing but almost as much as Weped/NAMI LoL
[2022-03-30T03:27:22] Unknown: So not great for upgrading unless your millionaire
[2022-03-30T03:30:47] rosheee: Hmm
[2022-03-30T03:31:06] rosheee: Looks gay
[2022-03-30T03:31:13] rosheee: Jah i had 7 scooter so far xD
[2022-03-30T03:31:26] rosheee: 291r is best
[2022-03-30T03:31:40] rosheee: So i took 20.8Ah battery
[2022-03-30T03:31:46] rosheee: Gonna put 17S in there
[2022-03-30T03:31:54] rosheee: Until 20S is rdy
[2022-03-30T03:33:14] rosheee: Or go for more battery?
[2022-03-30T03:34:09] rosheee: Nah instant sell the 20.8Ah
[2022-03-30T03:36:56] Unknown: Yup. If upgrading, go for 20.8ah and sell it
[2022-03-30T03:37:05] Unknown: Altho...
[2022-03-30T03:37:35] Unknown: Many guys run 25.6ah and are looking for 2nd battery to parallel. 25.6ah and 28ah use LG cells. 20.8ah uses Chinese cells I believe
[2022-03-30T03:37:46] Unknown: So 25.6ah or 28ah would be easier to sell for sure
[2022-03-30T03:38:42] Unknown: If I could've found a stock 25.6ah battery to buy, I would have just paralleled it to my stock battery and not built my 20s. I'm glad I didn't find one 😆
[2022-03-30T03:39:59] Unknown: 20s is monster. Couldn't be happier with the outcome of my setup. Probably have the fastest and longest range Vsett 10+ on planet earth 🤷🏻‍♂️. Just saying.. not bragging
[2022-03-30T03:40:57] Unknown: I haven't seen or heard of another Vsett 10+ that comes close. @roscheeee you could be the first to compete 🤓
[2022-03-30T03:41:05] rosheee: Ordered
[2022-03-30T03:41:15] rosheee: And took of dualtron order
[2022-03-30T03:41:20] rosheee: So damn have to sleep
[2022-03-30T03:41:33] rosheee: 0530 standup xD and it is 0341
[2022-03-30T03:41:35] rosheee: Gn8
[2022-03-30T03:41:50] Unknown: Sleep tight sweetie 😘
[2022-03-30T03:45:12] Artem Bulashev: Actually. Vesc Ubox would likely also be just fine with those Phase and battery amps if it was outside 😄😄 but it is 90% smaller, so you can add huge heat sink 😁
[2022-03-30T03:45:46] rosheee: I use the g30frame
[2022-03-30T03:45:50] rosheee: Directly
[2022-03-30T03:46:02] rosheee: But i gonna print bigger spacer
[2022-03-30T03:46:07] rosheee: Then do it like with the 16S
[2022-03-30T03:46:11] Artem Bulashev: And for the price could also swap fets for low IR and even cnc custom new Ubox case 😃😃 and still buy a pack of bear on change
[2022-03-30T03:46:18] rosheee: Mount it directly on bottom steel plate
[2022-03-30T03:46:47] rosheee: Copper case
[2022-03-30T03:46:55] rosheee: I sleep now xD
[2022-03-30T03:47:25] Artem Bulashev: 12f are really great for 200+ phase Unix for 135-150a 6f 120a ——- we are missing 150-200a controller in compact size
[2022-03-30T03:50:17] Unknown: Yes we most definitely are altho Nuc 12F comes really close. Size vs power is quite amazing. Nothing wrong with running controller at 50-60% output. My 12Fs literally raise about 3-5C above ambient at 170a phase/70a batt . They will last forever. Barely breaking a sweat, like a fast walk for them 😂
[2022-03-30T03:51:14] Unknown: But yes, I do totally agree. Need like a compact 8fet or 10fet for 150-200a phase and 60-80a batt
[2022-03-30T03:51:31] rosheee: Stop it xD
[2022-03-30T04:04:41] Unknown: Samsung 48X 21700 20s9p battery. Cells are so matched, it's amazing. Never go beyond .003-4v resting and super balanced during discharge. Balancer still hasn't kicked in for 36 days since activating the BMS. 6-7v MAX sag at 140 battery amps. Copper clad. Mind is blown. I didn't "match" p group IR or capacity before assembling, which I should have done but now looks like completely unnecessary with this batch of cells
[2022-03-30T04:05:38] Unknown: Thank you Samsung, Artem and Canadian seller 😘
[2022-03-30T05:31:40] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-03-30T05:47:46] Unknown: Go to sleep 😴😴 🤣🤣

[2022-03-30T12:16:21] Artem Bulashev: 73mph gps without Sport mode 😄
[2022-03-30T12:17:43] Artem Bulashev: Adam looks like your vsett 10+ is lower kv than 11+ super, so you may actually beat it 0-50mph acceleration in theory
[2022-03-30T12:19:47] Artem Bulashev: Though it has more powerful motor at 2000w each nominal (yours even at 75v are 1750w nominal) But motors nominal is not very important here :) I wonder who would win
[2022-03-30T12:28:41] rosheee: The motors on 17S csnt do burnout But they begi to be nasty mofos around 60-70

[2022-03-30T15:34:41] Luis Magalhaes: Watter cooling 😂
[2022-03-30T15:34:47] Paolo ⁭: Problem is heat dissipation, this package can’t be dissipated like to220 or to 247

[2022-03-30T20:09:57] Artem Bulashev: Well may be lower voltage one if you don’t need 100v
[2022-03-30T20:10:04] Artem Bulashev: I think non of us need 100v
[2022-03-30T20:10:55] Paolo ⁭: The power is 80v, but buy ubox 75v at that point
[2022-03-30T20:14:07] rosheee: Rion needs 500a and 105V
[2022-03-30T20:31:05] Face de Pin Sucé: <sticker>
[2022-03-30T20:35:21] Paolo ⁭: No really 500A
[2022-03-30T20:35:35] Paolo ⁭: It’s set at 400A phase but not more than 100A batt current
[2022-03-30T20:35:53] Face de Pin Sucé: what is set at 400A ?
[2022-03-30T20:36:53] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb your dream scooter 🤣🤣
[2022-03-30T20:37:28] Face de Pin Sucé: I love Rion design, but I would put it only behind a glass and a good light
[2022-03-30T20:52:00] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>

[2022-03-31T07:44:50] Face de Pin Sucé: They're going more power
[2022-03-31T07:44:57] Face de Pin Sucé: But their carbon frame...
[2022-03-31T07:45:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Not stable
[2022-03-31T08:59:22] rosheee: Why?
[2022-03-31T08:59:34] rosheee: I use.esc in g30

[2022-03-31T12:05:25] Mirono escooters: Gimme thé structural formule
[2022-03-31T13:24:02] Happy Giraffe: 1000T carbon on mtb frames is stronger than steel so Im confused
[2022-03-31T13:24:43] Face de Pin Sucé: It doesn't mean that Rion frame is strong or hard ;)
[2022-03-31T13:24:47] Face de Pin Sucé: I've ridden 2
[2022-03-31T13:25:41] Happy Giraffe: But how???
[2022-03-31T13:26:28] Happy Giraffe: Maybe they weaved it in shity pattern idk
[2022-03-31T13:29:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Remember
[2022-03-31T13:30:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Rion was designed by a external designer
[2022-03-31T13:30:20] Face de Pin Sucé: For SINGLE motor, small battery and small power
[2022-03-31T13:30:37] Happy Giraffe: = Xiaomi
[2022-03-31T13:30:53] Face de Pin Sucé: Design never upgraded but they added tons of kilograms and a second motor in front without modifications
[2022-03-31T13:31:08] Face de Pin Sucé: 140mm brakes discs
[2022-03-31T13:31:13] Paolo ⁭: Not things designed by they, also esc are designed by external lol
[2022-03-31T13:31:54] Face de Pin Sucé: We saw with a time attack last year on track, second lap pilot stopped because no brakes anymore
[2022-03-31T13:32:13] Happy Giraffe: Crazy
[2022-03-31T13:32:46] Happy Giraffe: It should have dual 180mm in front😳
[2022-03-31T13:33:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Not necessarily
[2022-03-31T13:33:34] Face de Pin Sucé: But at least 160mm on both would help a lot
[2022-03-31T13:33:44] Face de Pin Sucé: And 1 180mm on front even better
[2022-03-31T13:34:06] Happy Giraffe: Maybe custom motor housing and 125cc bike brake
[2022-03-31T13:34:11] Paolo ⁭: 180 with 11 inch isn’t sucé
[2022-03-31T13:34:22] Paolo ⁭: I think max 160 for 11 inch
[2022-03-31T13:34:23] Mirono escooters: Bigger disk means better heat dissapation?
[2022-03-31T13:34:29] Happy Giraffe: These 2.5mm discs are bit toys
[2022-03-31T13:34:32] Paolo ⁭: If you curve on track much you will touch
[2022-03-31T13:35:01] Face de Pin Sucé: It's okay with the right setup, my friend curves a loooooot without touching his MDR P in front
[2022-03-31T13:35:46] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but also further away from center so I think bites better
[2022-03-31T13:36:52] Mirono escooters: Hmm some centrifugal science.
[2022-03-31T13:37:11] Paolo ⁭: Suce
[2022-03-31T13:41:42] Happy Giraffe: Same rpm but the disc travels bit faster but should be easier to stop🤔
[2022-03-31T13:47:21] Mirono escooters: I didnt finish sciencr classes so
[2022-03-31T13:47:24] Mirono escooters: It sounds logical
[2022-03-31T14:17:03] Mirono escooters: Even on 30/100a and 500w kugoo motor. This packs power
[2022-03-31T14:17:07] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 4.2 :)

[2022-03-31T17:23:32] Gigolo Joe: Did anyone tried re-flashing a nuculr controller?
[2022-03-31T17:23:44] Artem Bulashev: Adam did update it
[2022-03-31T17:24:30] Gigolo Joe: Adam can you share a how-to?
[2022-03-31T17:25:07] Oliver Eliasson: Is it jeffrey frisen?
[2022-03-31T17:26:57] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-03-31T17:28:06] Artem Bulashev: Original
[2022-03-31T17:46:44] Unknown: Yup. You need a micro SD card formatted to fat32. That's the most important part. Format SD card first. Upload firmware of your choice onto the SD card (one for display, one for controller(s) and one for uLight if you have). Insert SD card into display. Update controller(s) first then display second. I've had some bugs issues with 0.8.5 on my end. A few others have reported it but many use it with no issue. I've switched back 0.8.2 and works perfectly for me now. They just released 0.8.6 which should be stable but I'm still running 0.8.2 because it works great. If you use 0.8.2 there is no on/off option for MTPA but can be easily be disabled by putting flux linkage to zero in motor setup.. after detection.
[2022-03-31T17:49:05] Unknown: Also make sure you only have 1 firmware file for controller/display on the SD card at one time. Ncontr.bin / Ndisp.bin should be the file name on the SD card. If it is renamed Ncontr(1).bin or Ndisp(1).bin it will not be recognized
[2022-03-31T17:58:28] Gigolo Joe: Thank you very much
[2022-03-31T18:05:09] Mirono escooters: Someone made their own antispark yet?

[2022-04-01T01:06:46] Mirono escooters: I wonder if a 3d printed case makes sense or if it's good on it's own
[2022-04-01T01:06:53] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3389@01-04-2022_01-06-53.jpg>
[2022-04-01T01:07:09] Artem Bulashev: should be good already

[2022-04-01T01:07:36] Mirono escooters: In revieuws no plugs seeable
[2022-04-01T01:07:54] Artem Bulashev: just ask for them in order details
[2022-04-01T01:08:00] Mirono escooters: I did
[2022-04-01T01:09:06] Mirono escooters: Debating bEtween purple and Blue xd
[2022-04-01T01:09:24] Mirono escooters: Ah fuck it. You only live once
[2022-04-01T01:10:46] Unknown: Damn. Nice. Would like to hear how it performs. So Artem.. with JK BMS, how does a typical CC to CV charger work? Does it balance still at the end of charge or just reduce current and balancing is handled by BMS app? (Like my 56v power supply charge thru Nuc)
[2022-04-01T01:11:43] Artem Bulashev: it is independant
[2022-04-01T01:11:47] Artem Bulashev: yes it does work
[2022-04-01T01:12:20] Artem Bulashev: bms starts to balance when voltage is high enough and delta is big enough
[2022-04-01T01:13:41] Mirono escooters: Ordered mine :)
[2022-04-01T01:14:12] Artem Bulashev: CC charges as fast as possible for good part and than switches to CV at specific voltage = At this point current will NOT be pushed into battery, but battery will suck it from "powersupply" due to voltage difference. The less the voltage difference the slower sucking will be = gradual reduction in current charging = better filled up battery without over voltage
[2022-04-01T01:15:57] Artem Bulashev: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003827699575.html?spm=a2g0o.cart.0.0.5c473c00KWOUXD&mp=1 possibley best lamp in its size it seems. Will order to test
[2022-04-01T01:15:59] Unknown: Oh okay.. gotcha. That's a good explanation. Just wasn't sure how that works with active balancer
[2022-04-01T01:16:19] Mirono escooters: U wanna make me broke with ur alieexpress links
[2022-04-01T01:16:57] Mirono escooters: Mine are small and 15w (×2) is plenty For me
[2022-04-01T01:17:21] Unknown: Does your battery ever get to a point where the delta is reached while charging? Say .010v or .015v... Mine never had needed to kick on, like ever
[2022-04-01T01:17:23] Artem Bulashev: this is tiny and 25W(white 25W, yellow 25W) Lumen: 3500LM/pc
[2022-04-01T01:17:29] Unknown: Have mine set to .012v
[2022-04-01T01:17:34] Artem Bulashev: for 20euro shipped 😄
[2022-04-01T01:17:35] Mirono escooters: I like it
[2022-04-01T01:17:42] Mirono escooters: How much lämp u need

[2022-04-01T01:18:03] Artem Bulashev: I alway do 🙂
[2022-04-01T01:18:14] Mirono escooters: Keep us updated
[2022-04-01T01:18:15] Artem Bulashev: single 16w lamp with sharp line now does well
[2022-04-01T01:18:38] Mirono escooters: Yea. Me dual 15w and i see super far. Don't know how much more i need 😂😂
[2022-04-01T01:18:42] Artem Bulashev: but this is similar size but seems like alot more versetile - low and high beam
[2022-04-01T01:18:56] Artem Bulashev: lol, probably don't need
[2022-04-01T01:19:03] Mirono escooters: Low and high is. Nice to have
[2022-04-01T01:19:08] Artem Bulashev: yeah
[2022-04-01T01:20:00] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3390@01-04-2022_01-20-00.jpg>
[2022-04-01T01:20:09] Artem Bulashev: good size
[2022-04-01T01:20:32] Paolo ⁭: Is that Halloween mask?
[2022-04-01T01:33:47] Unknown: The lights I have are similar (with high and low beam).. I hooked the wires in parallel so "high" and "low" beam angles/lamps are in at the same time. They work great
[2022-04-01T01:34:38] Unknown: <photos/photo_3391@01-04-2022_01-34-38.jpg>
[2022-04-01T01:34:39] Unknown: <photos/photo_3392@01-04-2022_01-34-39.jpg>
[2022-04-01T01:34:39] Unknown: <photos/photo_3393@01-04-2022_01-34-39.jpg>
[2022-04-01T01:36:12] Unknown: I think any light with a high and low beam (3 wire) can be wired this way. Gives the brightest and widest angle of light
[2022-04-01T01:36:58] Unknown: Run the 2 positives in parallel and then the ground, for a total of 2 wire connection (from 3 wire lamp)
[2022-04-01T01:38:14] Unknown: I still need to optimize the lamp angles on mine, maybe one a little higher and one a little lower so they overlap a bit but also illuminate closer and further from the stem. Right now they are shining at the same spot identical
[2022-04-01T01:57:52] Mirono escooters: Mine can only do 1 at a time :/
[2022-04-01T01:58:16] Mirono escooters: Idk why. It's wtupid

[2022-04-01T02:14:03] Unknown: Hmm. Should be a separate signal wire for low and high. Mine were 3 wire and reduced them down to 2 wire
[2022-04-01T02:14:17] Unknown: Those lamps Artem showed looked awesome
[2022-04-01T02:14:17] Mirono escooters: 2a does seem optimistic but idk. My other stepdow' of 2a atleast had heatsink
[2022-04-01T02:14:39] Artem Bulashev: bigger and only 2amp vs above smaller and 3amp
[2022-04-01T02:14:45] Mirono escooters: True

[2022-04-01T02:16:44] Mirono escooters: No hassle with stepdown or v drop over thé long switch cables

[2022-04-01T17:06:48] Mirono escooters: Yea haha enough for me
[2022-04-01T17:06:57] Artem Bulashev: 450w at 72v = 6a exactly
[2022-04-01T17:06:59] Artem Bulashev: 👍👍
[2022-04-01T17:07:18] Mirono escooters: I Will use for mostly 15s and lower

[2022-04-01T21:30:31] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-04-01T21:42:04] Happy Giraffe: Has anybody of you used torque arms on scooters? Ofc the motors are higher kv and usually provide bit less torque but Im still wondering if stock forks are strong enough for very high currents + regen
[2022-04-01T21:53:22] Mirono escooters: I wonder this too
[2022-04-01T21:53:25] Mirono escooters: Ebikes always have
[2022-04-01T21:53:32] Mirono escooters: Scoots never. Maybe a torque washers
[2022-04-01T21:58:09] Gigolo Joe: Don't need when suspension arms are 15mm thiccc
[2022-04-01T22:12:26] Oliver Eliasson: Ubox v2 75v Spintend bt Works now when i switched ports but not on other port
[2022-04-01T22:14:49] Happy Giraffe: If you have tight cutout maybe then not
[2022-04-01T22:15:39] Happy Giraffe: They have alu dropout on most of them, also ebike motors have lower kv so higher torque
[2022-04-01T22:17:02] Happy Giraffe: Something QS205 6T will have 200Nm torque with Sabvoton
[2022-04-01T22:55:02] rosheee: on g30?
[2022-04-01T22:55:14] rosheee: yep i have that as well

[2022-04-02T00:49:59] Mirono escooters: These are all max 35v
[2022-04-02T00:50:12] Mirono escooters: And 100v need shitty external v source of 12v+-
[2022-04-02T00:50:19] Mirono escooters: Isn't there just a simple universal v meter.. 😂
[2022-04-02T00:50:40] Mirono escooters: Preferably that size? Or suggestions? This one fit underneath display of xiaomi
[2022-04-02T00:51:37] Paolo ⁭: Ggg
[2022-04-02T00:51:54] Happy Giraffe: Duct tape multimeter probes into battery wire

[2022-04-02T00:52:33] Mirono escooters: 😂😂
[2022-04-02T00:52:51] Mirono escooters: I just want a clean setup with it underneath display next to button but China Cant make 100v apperantly without stupid feed me 12v
[2022-04-02T00:53:02] Mirono escooters: Maybe i can tap it from throttle and hope it's enough but cmon
[2022-04-02T00:54:33] Mirono escooters: 4-30v Throttle is 3.3v Grrat
[2022-04-02T00:57:19] Happy Giraffe: https://www.autoevolution.com/news/freego-f12-e-scooter-is-made-for-comfortable-urban-rides-has-large-wheels-and-a-wide-deck-185421.html
[2022-04-02T00:57:32] Happy Giraffe: " It also boasts of adopting a 48V voltage instead of 36V, which translates to an increased torque and the ability of the F12 to climb hills much easier, while also reducing power waste and heat output. That also means an increased lifespan of the two-wheeler. "
[2022-04-02T00:57:52] Happy Giraffe: This hurts my brain when magazines post crap like this😂
[2022-04-02T00:58:23] Happy Giraffe: Those throttles have volt meters?
[2022-04-02T00:59:38] Mirono escooters: Yeap. Mar'eting
[2022-04-02T00:59:56] Mirono escooters: I Will just steal display from a throttle with display

[2022-04-02T04:43:10] Unknown: 🤣
[2022-04-02T04:43:15] rosheee: how many amps phase can ubox xD?
[2022-04-02T04:44:41] rosheee: hmm
[2022-04-02T04:44:51] rosheee: 300 absolute current per esc + 270A motor like tested?
[2022-04-02T04:44:54] rosheee: 😆
[2022-04-02T04:45:30] Unknown: <animation>
[2022-04-02T04:45:35] rosheee: yes lots
[2022-04-02T04:45:38] Unknown: Haha
[2022-04-02T04:45:43] rosheee: then *blob*
[2022-04-02T04:47:19] Unknown: Sorry lol.. I have no idea. I would guess around 140-160 phase per motor continuous. Obviously burst is different. Heat is the killer for uBox with capable motors and battery
[2022-04-02T04:47:35] rosheee: i ordered copper
[2022-04-02T04:47:37] rosheee: pure copper plate XD
[2022-04-02T04:47:45] rosheee: + 1kg copper to melt
[2022-04-02T04:47:52] Unknown: For uBox heatsink?
[2022-04-02T04:47:54] rosheee: then take ubox frame -> sand .-> make fullcopper
[2022-04-02T04:48:04] rosheee: full batterycover gonna be copper
[2022-04-02T04:48:16] rosheee: + vesc housing
[2022-04-02T04:48:16] Unknown: Hmm. Sounds like it would work if done properly
[2022-04-02T04:48:21] rosheee: i hope
[2022-04-02T04:48:24] rosheee: copper is cheap atm xD
[2022-04-02T04:48:28] Unknown: Oh damn. That would be something
[2022-04-02T04:48:31] rosheee: yes
[2022-04-02T04:48:37] rosheee: then vesc housing -> copper
[2022-04-02T04:48:45] Unknown: Yup, it is. Tons cheaper than nickel that's for sure
[2022-04-02T04:48:48] rosheee: ^^
[2022-04-02T04:48:53] rosheee: or use silver as heatsink
[2022-04-02T04:48:53] rosheee: XD
[2022-04-02T04:49:12] Unknown: Very expensive g30 🤓
[2022-04-02T04:49:19] rosheee: nah
[2022-04-02T04:49:29] rosheee: 50$ silver for heatsink
[2022-04-02T04:49:48] Unknown: Oh, not bad at all if it would make that much of a difference
[2022-04-02T04:50:00] rosheee: it should
[2022-04-02T04:50:02] rosheee: but copper
[2022-04-02T04:50:05] Unknown: No room for fan or way to cool externally?
[2022-04-02T04:50:06] rosheee: XD gold would be prn
[2022-04-02T04:50:09] rosheee: no xD
[2022-04-02T04:50:13] rosheee: it has now x D
[2022-04-02T04:50:24] rosheee: wait
[2022-04-02T04:50:28] rosheee: give me 5min
[2022-04-02T04:51:10] Unknown: Gotcha. Can mount uBox outside? Needs to look stock? Or are you past that "abiding by the law" stage? Haha
[2022-04-02T04:51:43] rosheee: nope
[2022-04-02T04:51:45] rosheee: still stock
[2022-04-02T04:51:46] rosheee: 😃
[2022-04-02T04:51:51] rosheee: but i dreamed about it ^^
[2022-04-02T04:52:09] Unknown: uBox mounted external in direct wind sounds like best option to me. But that can be tricky with completely non-waterproof design
[2022-04-02T04:52:17] rosheee: wtf
[2022-04-02T04:52:19] Unknown: I'm sure LoL

[2022-04-02T04:53:01] rosheee: but now everything fits perfect ^__^
[2022-04-02T04:53:38] Unknown: Then why is still not good enough? Trying to push to absolute limit before 🧨??
[2022-04-02T04:53:48] rosheee: no
[2022-04-02T04:53:54] rosheee: the aliexpress alu is piece of crap
[2022-04-02T04:53:55] rosheee: XD

[2022-04-02T04:54:05] Unknown: Well, yea... LoL
[2022-04-02T04:54:08] rosheee: AND
[2022-04-02T04:54:13] rosheee: THESE MOTORS TAKE SO MANY AMPS
[2022-04-02T04:54:25] Unknown: They look like they do
[2022-04-02T04:54:29] rosheee: 24Ah = 15km max
[2022-04-02T04:55:10] rosheee: and if ubox with copper (fancy shit selling then for 1337$) had absolute best temp. on earth and cool as hell then ^^
[2022-04-02T04:55:10] rosheee: ❤️❤️
[2022-04-02T04:55:12] Unknown: That's crazy.
[2022-04-02T04:55:21] rosheee: after 10km i had 30%
[2022-04-02T04:55:42] Unknown: Damn. That's some seriously high wh/km
[2022-04-02T04:56:37] rosheee: ya
[2022-04-02T04:56:39] Unknown: I wonder what kv motors are. Vsett 10 is 32kv, which is on the higher side for 20s. Really high output I was seeing 80-90wh/km
[2022-04-02T04:56:41] rosheee: but now 60A xD
[2022-04-02T04:56:53] rosheee: how many erpm u get?

[2022-04-02T05:03:46] rosheee: mine has a bad connetor
[2022-04-02T05:03:55] Unknown: Basically zero deadzone on front or back. You can adjust endpoints in VESC tool right?
[2022-04-02T05:04:01] Unknown: Ugh, that's a bitch
[2022-04-02T05:17:07] rosheee: ok

[2022-04-02T05:26:56] rosheee: Nearly 40000
[2022-04-02T05:27:46] Unknown: ERPM?
[2022-04-02T05:27:51] rosheee: Yo
[2022-04-02T05:27:56] rosheee: See screenshot
[2022-04-02T05:27:59] rosheee: Or video
[2022-04-02T05:33:22] Unknown: I don't know how to read that chart. Maybe 40000 is equal to 400?
[2022-04-02T05:34:12] rosheee: idk

[2022-04-02T05:35:54] rosheee: XD
[2022-04-02T05:36:33] rosheee: eRPM=RPM*Pole Pairs.
[2022-04-02T05:36:44] rosheee: When eRPM of the motor is above 40,000, we can call it high speed motor for Kelly controller.
[2022-04-02T05:37:20] rosheee: 32-bit microprocessor, higher PWM frequency. Standard model: 16.6KHz, 40,000 eRPM. High speed model: 33KHz, 70,000 eRPM. Ultra high speed model: 100KHz, 100,000 eRPM. eRPM=Mechanical RPM*Pole pairs. It does generate more heat because of higher switching frequency.
[2022-04-02T06:05:32] Unknown: Hmm, interesting. I forget how to get motor KV from that equation

[2022-04-02T10:37:33] rosheee: Why
[2022-04-02T10:37:40] Face de Pin Sucé: You using the dual phase motors ?
[2022-04-02T10:37:41] rosheee: The motord run extreme bad at low amps

[2022-04-02T10:38:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Should show 120A or 130A
[2022-04-02T10:38:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Not 270A
[2022-04-02T10:38:09] rosheee: No
[2022-04-02T10:38:12] rosheee: It has to
[2022-04-02T10:38:17] rosheee: It 9ushes 270A

[2022-04-02T10:38:34] Face de Pin Sucé: I mean auto detection, should show 120/130A
[2022-04-02T10:38:42] rosheee: No
[2022-04-02T10:38:45] rosheee: Not with them
[2022-04-02T10:38:50] rosheee: The vset get 190A
[2022-04-02T10:38:56] rosheee: Vsett10+
[2022-04-02T10:39:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Because I see motor resistance and flux linkage are measured correct
[2022-04-02T10:39:23] Face de Pin Sucé: I think there's a different parameter that you use for your detection
[2022-04-02T10:39:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Vsett motors barely shows 100/110A when I do auto detection
[2022-04-02T10:40:02] Face de Pin Sucé: And the dualphase I tested on many VESC
[2022-04-02T10:40:13] Face de Pin Sucé: But we go the same measurements
[2022-04-02T10:40:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Which means measurement are okay, dunno why it shows you so high amps for reference
[2022-04-02T10:40:56] rosheee: Lol xD

[2022-04-02T14:39:49] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe remove the side cover ? 🤷
[2022-04-02T14:40:03] Mirono escooters: Install it back
[2022-04-02T14:40:06] Mirono escooters: Wiggle cover off
[2022-04-02T14:41:25] Unknown: Install it back and loosen remove other cover, then tap axle lightly with a hammer (like tap it out of the cover). It will break the seal on the stuck cover side. Just few light taps
[2022-04-02T14:41:34] Unknown: That's how I always loosen my covers

[2022-04-02T14:46:55] Paolo ⁭: $$$
[2022-04-02T14:47:10] Paolo ⁭: I haven’t more cash to spend , then now I stopped
[2022-04-02T14:48:00] Unknown: That's exactly why I got out of it. So expensive. Especially 700-800 size nitro and 12s-14s electric Heli's
[2022-04-02T14:48:16] Paolo ⁭: 12s?😱
[2022-04-02T14:48:17] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-04-02T14:48:21] Paolo ⁭: My max was 8s
[2022-04-02T14:48:25] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-04-02T14:48:35] Unknown: 12s and had one 14s setup.
[2022-04-02T14:48:53] Unknown: Synergy 766 on 14s
[2022-04-02T14:49:21] Unknown: Fucking BEAST heli. 766mm blades 🤓
[2022-04-02T14:51:44] Unknown: With Kontronik 200a ESC, BK brushless servos, 2 7s packs in series, vbar full size flybarless... Phew. Must've had $4,000 into that heli
[2022-04-02T14:52:50] Unknown: At one point I probably had $20,000 in Heli's hanging my wall. Then we had kids 🤣 bye bye toys
[2022-04-02T14:52:54] Paolo ⁭: I’ve not these money to spent hahaha

[2022-04-02T14:54:32] Unknown: Heli's are tough because if they crash, they're a total loss usually. Very nerve-racking to say the least haha
[2022-04-02T14:55:40] Unknown: Ok, sorry. Back to scoots 😉
[2022-04-02T14:57:00] Happy Giraffe: I wanna build a vesc heli that carries my fatass
[2022-04-02T14:57:14] Happy Giraffe: Then would be perfect for traffic
[2022-04-02T15:00:34] Unknown: Haha. For Heli's there way way way better controllers than VESC. VESC for drone ESCs blheli32 is best tho.
[2022-04-02T15:00:55] Unknown: Kontronik and HobbyWing are amazing ESCs. Castle is... Ehh
[2022-04-02T15:01:16] Unknown: Haha, good point
[2022-04-02T15:02:10] Happy Giraffe: If high power 400A vesc exist
[2022-04-02T15:02:31] Happy Giraffe: But I would rather not sit in a lipo bathtub
[2022-04-02T15:02:36] Unknown: Would probably be the size of a brick tho

[2022-04-02T17:50:00] Happy Giraffe: 🙈
[2022-04-02T17:50:12] Happy Giraffe: And it's 5% faster than 3080 gg

[2022-04-02T17:54:54] rosheee: we pay
[2022-04-02T17:54:58] rosheee: 0 for electricity

[2022-04-02T17:57:32] Stan: I paid 999 euro per card so its more profitable to buy x2 6800 for 2000k euro
[2022-04-02T17:57:41] Stan: Nice good value

[2022-04-02T18:34:37] Paolo ⁭: Totally fucked
[2022-04-02T18:34:45] Paolo ⁭: You have 5.3 firmware?
[2022-04-02T18:35:39] rosheee: yep now
[2022-04-02T18:35:43] rosheee: before 292A
[2022-04-02T18:35:43] rosheee: XD
[2022-04-02T18:35:46] rosheee: but only with this motors
[2022-04-02T18:36:18] rosheee: absolute max current per vesc?
[2022-04-02T18:36:21] rosheee: max 200?
[2022-04-02T18:36:25] rosheee: not 420 xD
[2022-04-02T18:36:38] rosheee: and @PaoloWu use "slow abs current limit" ?
[2022-04-02T18:36:54] Mirono escooters: Sounds boring
[2022-04-02T18:36:55] Mirono escooters: Slow
[2022-04-02T18:52:30] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-04-02T19:41:25] Face de Pin Sucé: So weird, we got the same motor, same parameters and same measurements but not same recommended current 😂
[2022-04-02T19:41:40] Face de Pin Sucé: This is what I get
[2022-04-02T20:09:37] Paolo ⁭: I think something is fucked in firmware
[2022-04-02T20:11:54] Unknown: @Happy_Giraffe interesting thing. Thought of you. So it's super windy today riding. I'm usually around 63-65wh/km with these same settings. Today with insane wind I'm at 72 wh/km. Wind resistance can make that much difference you think??
[2022-04-02T21:03:49] Face de Pin Sucé: I think too because many VESC give always the same results for me
[2022-04-02T21:12:44] Happy Giraffe: Surely, it makes more difference at lower speed if you only ride 20kmh and then 20kmh wind against you
[2022-04-02T21:13:30] Oliver Eliasson: @PaoloWu you use 75100 right?
[2022-04-02T21:13:32] Happy Giraffe: But 63wh is more than double the consumption of my 40kmh cruising
[2022-04-02T21:14:07] Oliver Eliasson: What bt module do i buy? Aliexpress or banggood
[2022-04-02T21:14:52] sombre_enfant: Spinted one cheaper
[2022-04-02T21:15:12] Oliver Eliasson: That one works for 75100 to?
[2022-04-02T21:15:17] sombre_enfant: Btw do you know if it need adc board ?
[2022-04-02T21:15:45] Oliver Eliasson: I dont know but i have two adc board from spintend anyway
[2022-04-02T21:15:53] sombre_enfant: I seen ago there was Koxx who was saying its the same chip but flipsky is overpriced...
[2022-04-02T21:16:06] Oliver Eliasson: Oh okey
[2022-04-02T21:16:41] Happy Giraffe: Spintend bt module also sold in Ali if you need to order only that, it has tax included
[2022-04-02T21:17:05] Oliver Eliasson: Great thanks, will look
[2022-04-02T21:23:59] Oliver Eliasson: V4 or V6?
[2022-04-02T21:38:31] Happy Giraffe: Not sure what you mean
[2022-04-02T21:39:07] Happy Giraffe: I got mine from spintend directly so not familiar with ali options, I just looked that its there for 30€ once
[2022-04-02T21:43:06] Oliver Eliasson: Flipsky bt
[2022-04-02T22:03:45] Oliver Eliasson: Can you send link?
[2022-04-02T22:19:13] Paolo ⁭: I’ve more or less tested and burned all vesc existing
[2022-04-02T22:33:28] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-04-02T23:05:45] Unknown: Nickel 🙄
[2022-04-02T23:06:18] Oliver Eliasson: You dont need bt module right?
[2022-04-02T23:06:42] Oliver Eliasson: Only for changing setting and so but to not to ride?
[2022-04-02T23:28:41] Oliver Eliasson: Ordered a 75100 on banggood. 940kr
[2022-04-02T23:29:57] Mirono escooters: Banggood is cheaper wich is nice
[2022-04-02T23:30:11] Mirono escooters: It's sad
[2022-04-02T23:30:20] Mirono escooters: No

[2022-04-03T01:53:38] Paolo ⁭: Bought simple nrf module for 8€

[2022-04-03T02:04:01] Paolo ⁭: Isn’t plug play
[2022-04-03T02:05:03] Oliver Eliasson: Then ill maybe stick to spintend bt. Only 20€
[2022-04-03T15:14:22] rosheee: Tested with official 5.3 and spintend
[2022-04-03T15:14:47] rosheee: When battery charged 100% set SOC TO 100?
[2022-04-03T16:20:49] Artem Bulashev: This is ok no?
[2022-04-03T16:21:10] Artem Bulashev: What’s wrong ? Mine works great
[2022-04-03T16:21:42] Artem Bulashev: Ubox red usb-c on 5.3 is ALOT better than 5.2 on vsett 9 motors
[2022-04-03T16:22:01] rosheee: I ask
[2022-04-03T16:22:01] Artem Bulashev: 5.2 never worked well, 5.3 is butter smooth
[2022-04-03T16:22:04] rosheee: Faly bms
[2022-04-03T16:22:08] rosheee: Daly bms

[2022-04-03T16:22:18] rosheee: Soc 18%?
[2022-04-03T16:22:46] Artem Bulashev: State of charge = battery level
[2022-04-03T16:22:55] Artem Bulashev: What is the question ?
[2022-04-03T16:23:19] Artem Bulashev: Bellow 20 or 25% is low on Daly
[2022-04-03T16:23:50] Artem Bulashev: Oh I see you are actually at 4.070v
[2022-04-03T16:24:01] Mirono escooters: Yes daly SoC is shit
[2022-04-03T16:24:05] Mirono escooters: It has to calibrate long
[2022-04-03T16:24:11] Mirono escooters: Set SoC manually in settings
[2022-04-03T16:24:29] Mirono escooters: Yesh
[2022-04-03T16:26:20] rosheee: Good
[2022-04-03T16:26:44] rosheee: Question is Why is it at 18% Because cells are at 4V
[2022-04-03T16:27:15] Mirono escooters: Bcs it's doodoo
[2022-04-03T16:27:18] Mirono escooters: Has to calibrate

[2022-04-03T16:29:13] Artem Bulashev: Remaining Mah
[2022-04-03T16:29:19] Artem Bulashev: Which is why it has to learn it

[2022-04-03T16:54:02] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2022-04-03T17:23:47] Happy Giraffe: The max is just some peak millisecond value, I set that to 300A😂
[2022-04-03T17:24:08] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise I get some errors, but yeah

[2022-04-03T17:54:11] Unknown: 10C 🤣 (displayed in Fahrenheit obviously)
[2022-04-03T17:54:13] rosheee: and sell the limited edition motors
[2022-04-03T17:54:30] Paolo ⁭: Isn’t limited
[2022-04-03T17:54:43] rosheee: ??
[2022-04-03T17:54:43] Paolo ⁭: If you message huameng they sell you
[2022-04-03T17:54:44] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-04-03T17:54:53] rosheee: what isnt limited?
[2022-04-03T17:54:59] Paolo ⁭: Motor
[2022-04-03T17:55:03] rosheee: yah they can 😆they are for the LE
[2022-04-03T17:55:09] rosheee: i just write what i get sold
[2022-04-03T17:55:36] Unknown: @Happy_Giraffe no wind today. Back down to 59wh/km Yesterday with strong wind was like 72 wh/km. So crazy
[2022-04-03T17:55:58] Happy Giraffe: If you do this when riding 30kmh it will double consumption😂
[2022-04-03T17:56:17] Unknown: That's insane how much it is affected
[2022-04-03T17:56:18] Happy Giraffe: Rolling resistance + copper losses + air resistance
[2022-04-03T17:56:44] Happy Giraffe: Yep, and you already create lot air drag from high speed so wind is tiny part
[2022-04-03T17:56:52] Unknown: 🤔 interesting
[2022-04-03T17:57:16] Unknown: Yup... Plus I'm still wearing a huge puffy winter jacket that acts like a parachute haha
[2022-04-03T17:57:19] Happy Giraffe: Thats basically how much energy is spent to travel on smooth road
[2022-04-03T17:57:19] Artem Bulashev: No no man
[2022-04-03T17:57:28] Artem Bulashev: Wind = same as you going
[2022-04-03T17:57:50] Artem Bulashev: 0kmh wind 40kmh = 20kmh wind 20kmh going
[2022-04-03T17:57:57] Artem Bulashev: Same air resistance
[2022-04-03T17:58:03] Happy Giraffe: Of course
[2022-04-03T17:58:09] Artem Bulashev: So it effects a lot
[2022-04-03T17:58:25] Happy Giraffe: But him going 80kmh and 20km wind is small
[2022-04-03T17:58:30] Artem Bulashev: Can double wh consumption
[2022-04-03T17:58:34] Unknown: Wind so strong yesterday it was throwing me off balance and I could feel the drag when riding into it
[2022-04-03T17:58:40] Artem Bulashev: Well still 25%
[2022-04-03T17:58:42] Happy Giraffe: If you go 20+20 its double
[2022-04-03T17:58:45] Artem Bulashev: That’s not little
[2022-04-03T17:58:59] Happy Giraffe: Yep, that's exactly what his numbers show
[2022-04-03T18:00:14] Artem Bulashev: I think you are ready to move on to the white side 😄😄 use Celsius
[2022-04-03T18:00:19] Unknown: I was thinking the same thing. Consumption and efficiency is (can be) affected by wind. 10-13 wh/km difference from yesterday to today on same speed mode 2 settings
[2022-04-03T18:00:57] Unknown: Haha... I'm so tempted to. But at quick glance my brain registers fahrenheit quickly. No mental math involved 😂😭
[2022-04-03T18:00:58] rosheee: I had 63
[2022-04-03T18:01:46] Artem Bulashev: Wait what
[2022-04-03T18:01:47] Happy Giraffe: Better to measure everything 10*10*10 than your foot*footballfield*your moms bed

[2022-04-03T18:02:57] Artem Bulashev: So… very good measurement haha
[2022-04-03T18:03:07] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-03T18:03:20] Unknown: F to C is 9/5. Nine fifths, I think... Damn imperial fractions. I hate it so much haha. So C is F divided by 2 and another 20% (one fifth) Is there an easier way to mentally calculate quickly?? Any tricks? LoL
[2022-04-03T18:03:58] rosheee: Why is there even inch and F and these crapperia
[2022-04-03T18:04:16] Artem Bulashev: Not exactly
[2022-04-03T18:04:18] Unknown: Good question. Imperial system blows
[2022-04-03T18:04:22] Artem Bulashev: 32f = 0c
[2022-04-03T18:04:49] Artem Bulashev: 50f = 10c
[2022-04-03T18:05:00] Unknown: Yup.. but how to calculate as temp rises/falls?
[2022-04-03T18:05:02] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2022-04-03T18:05:10] Artem Bulashev: 68f = 20c
[2022-04-03T18:05:27] Happy Giraffe: Just type "how many celsius is 20F" in google
[2022-04-03T18:05:31] Unknown: Oh.. jump by 10's..
[2022-04-03T18:05:31] Happy Giraffe: 20F to C
[2022-04-03T18:05:33] Artem Bulashev: 86f = 30c

[2022-04-03T18:06:02] Artem Bulashev: So
[2022-04-03T18:06:06] Unknown: <photos/photo_3445@03-04-2022_18-06-06.jpg>
[2022-04-03T18:06:08] Happy Giraffe: This is faster haha
[2022-04-03T18:06:34] Artem Bulashev: So
[2022-04-03T18:07:01] Artem Bulashev: 32f = 0c after that +/-18f = 10c +/-
[2022-04-03T18:07:27] Artem Bulashev: 18*5+32= 50c
[2022-04-03T18:07:32] Artem Bulashev: That’s how I would do it
[2022-04-03T18:07:34] Artem Bulashev: Should work
[2022-04-03T18:07:36] Unknown: Ohh.. I see that now! Good point
[2022-04-03T18:08:05] Artem Bulashev: 90+32= 122f = 50c
[2022-04-03T18:08:26] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3446@03-04-2022_18-08-26.jpg>
[2022-04-03T18:08:29] Artem Bulashev: Works
[2022-04-03T18:09:18] Unknown: That helps 🙂 Thank you for breaking it down. I'll be ready to convert in no time LoL
[2022-04-03T18:11:06] Unknown: This battery keeps my mind absolutely blown. This is after a 6 mile ride. 7kw max pulled (moderate settings) .001v difference with balancer OFF Just.. wow

[2022-04-03T18:12:20] Unknown: Amazing cells @artBula Absolutely amazing
[2022-04-03T18:12:27] Happy Giraffe: Thats really impressive, I plan similar 16s8p 48x setup
[2022-04-03T18:12:28] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄👍 told you 48x is exceptional 🥰for your tasks (amps pulled )
[2022-04-03T18:12:44] Unknown: Bro... Wayyy beyond my expectations
[2022-04-03T18:12:46] Happy Giraffe: 130 pieces 48X 3.35€
[2022-04-03T18:13:44] Unknown: That's beautiful. They are killer cells. Super low V drop with copper, excellent capacity and high discharge (15-20a capable) for 4800mah cell
[2022-04-03T18:13:55] Unknown: 🤯
[2022-04-03T18:14:37] Unknown: Couldn't imagine a better cell for my setup honestly

[2022-04-03T18:22:36] rosheee: I use them xD like said 1337 times before
[2022-04-03T18:22:37] rosheee: Good stuff
[2022-04-03T18:22:39] Artem Bulashev: But basically same
[2022-04-03T18:22:50] Artem Bulashev: 50g deliver more Wh still at 15a
[2022-04-03T18:23:49] rosheee: 50G 5P
[2022-04-03T18:24:01] Paolo ⁭: 👎
[2022-04-03T18:24:35] Artem Bulashev: V drop on 48x and 50g is same basically
[2022-04-03T18:25:10] rosheee: Ah then 50G for president
[2022-04-03T18:25:16] Artem Bulashev: Just 0.7wh more at bellow 3.2v
[2022-04-03T18:25:45] Artem Bulashev: 50g wins in wh at lower amp draw
[2022-04-03T18:25:52] Artem Bulashev: Which is common when you roll around
[2022-04-03T18:26:01] Artem Bulashev: Than you see range gains abit in real life
[2022-04-03T18:26:05] Artem Bulashev: But
[2022-04-03T18:26:10] rosheee: Wtf i get 68V on 16S
[2022-04-03T18:26:15] Artem Bulashev: 48x has 4x more cycle life
[2022-04-03T18:26:25] rosheee: With 5P u get 50km fullspeed until end
[2022-04-03T18:26:39] Mirono escooters: 😦
[2022-04-03T18:26:42] Artem Bulashev: Same will be with 48x
[2022-04-03T18:26:54] Artem Bulashev: Because at max amps 15+ amps wh is same
[2022-04-03T18:26:55] Mirono escooters: Artem is that all knowledge in your head
[2022-04-03T18:27:47] Artem Bulashev: Lol I just recap quickly on diagrams to be sure but yeah by now I remember them for best cells like those two
[2022-04-03T18:28:31] Mirono escooters: Must be cool😂
[2022-04-03T18:28:42] Paolo ⁭: Can you share me 48x datasheet?
[2022-04-03T18:29:48] Unknown: 48x is 3000 cycle life
[2022-04-03T18:34:15] Unknown: <photos/photo_3452@03-04-2022_18-34-15.jpg>
[2022-04-03T18:35:23] Unknown: Battery will out live me. Plus 9p with 43ah, I charge to 80% and discharge to 35% or so and still have more range than I could use in a day. So cells are extremely happy in their optimal voltage range for lifespan
[2022-04-03T18:37:01] Unknown: 3000 cycle life is based off 3v soc discharge I believe. Maybe even 2.5v, not sure how to read that part of the datasheet. So keeping within 80-30 percent soc, that 3000 cycle life will probably increase by a lot
[2022-04-03T18:40:49] Artem Bulashev: It is not exactly correct to compare
[2022-04-03T18:40:59] Artem Bulashev: Correct to consider them 2000
[2022-04-03T18:41:15] Happy Giraffe: I will be putting 2.5v cutoff for emergency situation but mostly will use 30-95% range anyways
[2022-04-03T18:41:44] Artem Bulashev: Because all cells normally 500 cycles down to 80% 48x is 3000 down to 70% = so we instead use 2000 cycles down to 80 %
[2022-04-03T18:41:58] Happy Giraffe: 👍
[2022-04-03T18:42:15] Artem Bulashev: Still a lot more than typical 500 for sure = dischage so equal and stable :))
[2022-04-03T18:49:26] Unknown: Good point. I did notice they use 70% standard as opposed to the typical 80%. Still, awesome technology in 48X. 4800mah, 15-18a continuous say, and extra high cycle life. I mean, that's pretty amazing
[2022-04-03T18:51:13] Paolo ⁭: Where is 48x datasheet
[2022-04-03T18:51:22] Paolo ⁭: I can’t find it, maybe a secret?
[2022-04-03T18:55:58] Unknown: 🤫
[2022-04-03T18:56:38] Happy Giraffe: Also for cell test for comparong, need to have same guy doing test with same equipment and methods
[2022-04-03T18:57:17] Mirono escooters: 😦🤤
[2022-04-03T18:57:23] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise it can have too much variables, like the idiot ebike guys saying 500w motor is more powerful than 250w because it says it in motors name😂
[2022-04-03T18:59:16] Paolo ⁭: Normal… you can’t know how much people let me lose time for this. Only because on my motor are declared only real nominal current and not fake watts like huameng 😂
[2022-04-03T19:00:18] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, so many misinformation in this area
[2022-04-03T19:02:28] Artem Bulashev: True very hard to find because it goes to 48g instead
[2022-04-03T19:02:40] Artem Bulashev: I found it once but don’t have it now
[2022-04-03T19:04:11] Artem Bulashev: Lol well it should be if it is from good company with same nominal measuring algorithm or from same company so algorithm is same for both 250w and 500w
[2022-04-03T19:04:55] Artem Bulashev: But yeah between brands not good way lol

[2022-04-03T20:46:35] rosheee: motors just need max 130A normally they chill around 105-110A when boost
[2022-04-03T20:46:37] Mirono escooters: Sounds weird
[2022-04-03T20:47:32] rosheee: give 120A motor and absolute max 160A and battery 2x 80A ?
[2022-04-03T20:47:48] Mirono escooters: It problably never hits that much battery is my bet

[2022-04-03T23:48:41] Oliver Eliasson: I dont use them
[2022-04-03T23:48:48] rosheee: ah ok
[2022-04-03T23:54:15] Mirono escooters: Manually unplug phase cables 🤓
[2022-04-03T23:54:20] Mirono escooters: Ok no. Always AWD
[2022-04-03T23:54:47] rosheee: ^^?
[2022-04-03T23:55:40] Paolo ⁭: Should be switched by vesc setting

[2022-04-04T00:06:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1. option "multiple vesc over can"
[2022-04-04T00:14:46] Happy Giraffe: Why would you want to only use single motor?
[2022-04-04T00:14:59] Happy Giraffe: Dual should be always more efficient due to copper losses🤔
[2022-04-04T00:16:25] Mirono escooters: I think too
[2022-04-04T00:16:36] Mirono escooters: And a undriven motor has more resistance then a normal wheel
[2022-04-04T00:16:39] Mirono escooters: So yea
[2022-04-04T00:16:41] Mirono escooters: Why single
[2022-04-04T00:17:05] Mirono escooters: My random esc from China has dual single button. Problably only reason is for wjeelies or to drive slow
[2022-04-04T00:19:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no goal/advantage in single single motor
[2022-04-04T00:20:27] Paolo ⁭: No legit in Italy

[2022-04-04T00:21:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what isn't ? dual motor ?
[2022-04-04T00:22:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: drive slow when you have a shitty combo of controller/throttle, yes 😅
[2022-04-04T00:22:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: like dualtron...
[2022-04-04T00:22:58] Paolo ⁭: Yes, single motor max 500w and no zero start
[2022-04-04T00:23:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: "oups, i pressed 2mm on the throttle, i am now at 50km/h"
[2022-04-04T00:23:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2022-04-04T00:23:28] Artem Bulashev: Police mode 500w single
[2022-04-04T00:23:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok
[2022-04-04T00:23:32] Artem Bulashev: 😊👍
[2022-04-04T00:23:49] Artem Bulashev: But better set phase amps 0 for that mode
[2022-04-04T00:24:07] Mirono escooters: Or when your gf drives 25
[2022-04-04T00:24:11] Artem Bulashev: And keep - phase amps for regen so that you can explain why power cables to front motor
[2022-04-04T00:24:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: interesting. i should add this to the smart then
[2022-04-04T00:24:36] Mirono escooters: Thé throttle is so shit lol, its all or nothing, super hard to control low speeds in slow ttzffic
[2022-04-04T00:24:57] Mirono escooters: If they understand ebrake Already im happy
[2022-04-04T00:25:10] Artem Bulashev: I think I pitched that idea a while ago but you may be didn’t follow what I meant 🙂✅ yeah would be great
[2022-04-04T00:25:43] Artem Bulashev: As single motor 500w are actually a thing and dual 250 not really 😄 police not complete idiots
[2022-04-04T00:26:00] Artem Bulashev: They do as cars use it
[2022-04-04T00:26:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's not so easy with vesc, but i'll check
[2022-04-04T00:26:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeah hot changing parameters may be problematic on SW level
[2022-04-04T00:26:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i managed to do that yesterday, but i needed to disable traction control too 😔
[2022-04-04T00:27:03] Mirono escooters: Your police is smarter then mine then

[2022-04-04T00:27:26] Artem Bulashev: Never thought about it
[2022-04-04T00:27:29] Mirono escooters: I did that on Xiaomi why not. I use excuse extra grip
[2022-04-04T00:27:29] Artem Bulashev: You are right
[2022-04-04T00:27:41] Artem Bulashev: Other wise no wheels will spin
[2022-04-04T00:27:46] Artem Bulashev: I guess
[2022-04-04T00:28:20] Mirono escooters: I just let Wheels spin uncontrollably. More fun
[2022-04-04T00:28:26] Mirono escooters: And dangerous. But = fun
[2022-04-04T00:28:54] Mirono escooters: It was snowing friday in Belgium. I forgot to turn down power and gave full throttle from dead stop, front wheel had 0 grip no idea how i didnt fall

[2022-04-05T01:30:13] Paolo ⁭: What are you mean
[2022-04-05T01:30:52] Paolo ⁭: What thickness is
[2022-04-05T01:32:28] Luis Magalhaes: let me ask him
[2022-04-05T01:32:40] Luis Magalhaes: but he said the cooper dont weld to the cell
[2022-04-05T01:32:55] Paolo ⁭: You need nickel upper
[2022-04-05T01:33:21] Luis Magalhaes: yes he is using, the nickel welds to cooper and not to cell
[2022-04-05T01:33:33] Paolo ⁭: Depends by copper thickness
[2022-04-05T01:33:35] Paolo ⁭: Max is 0.1
[2022-04-05T01:34:11] Luis Magalhaes: of copper ?
[2022-04-05T01:34:38] Luis Magalhaes: maybe its that
[2022-04-05T01:35:05] Luis Magalhaes: i asked him about that waiting for the response
[2022-04-05T01:44:52] Luis Magalhaes: he sais he tryed 0.1 but wanted 0.2 🤣
[2022-04-05T01:45:21] Luis Magalhaes: with 0.1 how much current it helds ?
[2022-04-05T01:46:05] Paolo ⁭: 50/60 joule
[2022-04-05T01:46:14] Paolo ⁭: 0.2 no compatible
[2022-04-05T01:47:20] Luis Magalhaes: and about current from controller ?
[2022-04-05T01:48:55] Stan: 1000 euro per card including vat
[2022-04-05T02:12:51] Unknown: <photos/photo_2981@13-03-2022_03-16-40.jpg>
[2022-04-05T02:13:39] Unknown: .1 copper at 10mm width can handle 15a continuous. Same .1 nickel is 4a continuous 🤣
[2022-04-05T02:14:28] Luis Magalhaes: 🙈
[2022-04-05T02:14:36] Unknown: Also, resistance is super important. Much lower resistance. .1 copper is good for 15-20a continuous per cell without heating much and low voltage drop.
[2022-04-05T02:15:37] Unknown: So, .1 copper is say 9p (using only 10mm wide strips) is good for around 200a very very safely with little heat/resistance
[2022-04-05T02:16:56] Unknown: Can definitely handle more but may warm up a bit. So get the same performance from nickel, you would need .4 or .45 nickel which is stupid. 2 layers of .2 don't count LoL
[2022-04-05T02:17:04] Luis Magalhaes: so for a battery that will take 160A i should have 8 cooper plates sandwish ?! lolol
[2022-04-05T02:17:16] Unknown: No man... 15a per cell group
[2022-04-05T02:17:27] Unknown: Per series connection
[2022-04-05T02:17:35] Unknown: Cell to cell.. not the whole battery
[2022-04-05T02:18:21] Luis Magalhaes: ok so for the series conection i would have to have 8 plates ?
[2022-04-05T02:18:31] Luis Magalhaes: cell to cell
[2022-04-05T02:18:41] Luis Magalhaes: +-
[2022-04-05T02:19:27] Unknown: For each positive to negative connection (cell group 1 to cell group 2 say) you would only need .1 copper going from cell positive to cell negative
[2022-04-05T02:20:39] Luis Magalhaes: right thats what i understand in the second time 👌😂
[2022-04-05T02:21:57] Luis Magalhaes: so i just have to use the .1 copper to conect in the series and im good
[2022-04-05T02:22:10] Luis Magalhaes: it will be a 16s8p
[2022-04-05T02:22:22] Unknown: Like any of these. Using .1 copper for the series connection from positive to negative cell to cell. If you have 8p, you can 8 separate piece of .1, from each cell to cell or you can use a plate/sheet that acts as series and parallel at the same time

[2022-04-05T02:22:28] Luis Magalhaes: so 8 plates for each series conection
[2022-04-05T02:22:45] Unknown: Yup exactly. Parallel connections can be nickel
[2022-04-05T02:23:16] Luis Magalhaes: ok nice thanks for the info
[2022-04-05T02:23:29] Unknown: <photos/photo_3478@05-04-2022_02-23-29.jpg>
[2022-04-05T02:23:34] Luis Magalhaes: lets see if pedro can solder the .1copper now 😅
[2022-04-05T02:23:42] Unknown: Red is .1 copper series. Blue is parallel and can be anything, nickel or copper
[2022-04-05T02:25:31] Unknown: With K-Weld can definitely weld .1 copper with nickel tabs on top. I did .15 copper with malectrics V4 (less powerful than K-Weld) but the type of battery he is using for his welder is important. If shit battery, shit power
[2022-04-05T02:26:56] Luis Magalhaes: he was using a car battery, i saw they use the same one and boght one
[2022-04-05T02:27:14] Luis Magalhaes: this
[2022-04-05T02:28:03] Unknown: <photos/photo_3479@05-04-2022_02-28-03.jpg>
[2022-04-05T02:28:16] Unknown: CCA rating on the battery is important (cold cranking amps)
[2022-04-05T02:28:44] Unknown: At least 700-1000 CCA is usually needed for decent welding power
[2022-04-05T02:29:28] Luis Magalhaes: he said he can push 1300a
[2022-04-05T02:29:45] Luis Magalhaes: dont know if its that
[2022-04-05T02:29:48] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2022-04-05T02:30:09] Unknown: That should be plenty. If that's what K-Weld is saying the weld current is at...
[2022-04-05T02:30:42] Unknown: Tell him to put some good pressure on the probes. Don't be shy to press hard so current penetrates down into cell tip
[2022-04-05T02:31:05] Unknown: ... especially on the positive tabs
[2022-04-05T02:31:48] Luis Magalhaes: ok i will 👌
[2022-04-05T02:31:55] Unknown: 👍👍
[2022-04-05T02:32:03] Unknown: Also...
[2022-04-05T02:33:16] Luis Magalhaes: hope i can do it, i really wanted those copper plates in my battery 😂
[2022-04-05T02:33:26] Unknown: Using 2 separate pieces of nickel tabs, one probe on each piece, helps the current travel down into the cell with less current needed. "Infinite slot" method
[2022-04-05T02:33:28] Luis Magalhaes: and i know that jppl wants it too
[2022-04-05T02:34:35] Unknown: It's the best by so so far. Tons less heat, less voltage sag and very high current carrying capacity. Nickel is actually shit for carrying current, it's just easy to weld which is why most people/companies use it
[2022-04-05T02:35:21] Luis Magalhaes: 👌 ok
[2022-04-05T02:35:33] Unknown: <photos/photo_3481@05-04-2022_02-35-33.jpg>
[2022-04-05T02:35:34] Unknown: <photos/photo_3482@05-04-2022_02-35-34.jpg>
[2022-04-05T02:35:37] Unknown: Like this
[2022-04-05T02:36:21] Unknown: Super clean and super strong welds. Using 2 separate nickel tabs (instead of 1 solid piece) helps tremendously
[2022-04-05T02:37:17] Luis Magalhaes: nice 👌
[2022-04-05T02:38:05] Luis Magalhaes: he said he tried and it was not welding and the power was so high that it cracked the cooper 😂
[2022-04-05T02:38:40] Luis Magalhaes: but did not weld to the cell
[2022-04-05T02:39:10] Luis Magalhaes: but maybe it was more then .1 copper plate
[2022-04-05T02:40:11] Luis Magalhaes: Adam thanks for the help, when he test it i will say something here if it was good
[2022-04-05T02:41:15] Unknown: Anytime bro 🤓

[2022-04-05T02:59:46] Unknown: I was talked into try a half twist throttle by a friend 🙄. Not sure about it but will need a test ride to see for sure. He swears by it. Doesn't anyone here use a half twist? My guess is, no LoL
[2022-04-05T03:05:20] Unknown: I didn't have any problems or issues at all with my Kart trigger throttle, actually really like it. I bought this to entertain him. He claims, so smooth, steady and natural that he doesn't even think about the throttle. @artBula please make your scroll wheel throttle available soon 🤓 LoL

[2022-04-05T12:00:28] Artem Bulashev: Pm me will see
[2022-04-05T12:01:06] Artem Bulashev: Working on it day and night
[2022-04-05T12:02:22] Artem Bulashev: Re designed entire thing again from ground up
[2022-04-05T12:02:57] Artem Bulashev: Reduced area by 10% and hight by 12% 🙃🤘
[2022-04-05T12:03:06] Artem Bulashev: 🤝🙂
[2022-04-05T12:03:38] Artem Bulashev: Spintend will be producing it
[2022-04-05T12:03:40] sombre_enfant: Look mad respectful with the burbery scarf
[2022-04-05T12:04:00] Artem Bulashev: I design it for them
[2022-04-05T12:04:27] Artem Bulashev: Do you want 40-60$ or 160$? 😅😅
[2022-04-05T12:05:17] Artem Bulashev: Will be injection molding 😊 great quality plastic (like their remote is)
[2022-04-05T12:05:49] Artem Bulashev: I think Beta version will be CNC after we do Alpha testing with 3D printer
[2022-04-05T12:06:25] Face de Pin Sucé: hell yeah
[2022-04-05T12:06:32] Artem Bulashev: Will see. My design is made possible for CNC as well
[2022-04-05T12:06:47] Artem Bulashev: Tsss
[2022-04-05T12:06:50] Artem Bulashev: 😁
[2022-04-05T12:07:01] Artem Bulashev: It will
[2022-04-05T12:07:09] Artem Bulashev: Don’t tell any one :)
[2022-04-05T12:07:16] Artem Bulashev: It will not be “basic”
[2022-04-05T12:07:26] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-04-05T12:07:31] Artem Bulashev: It will have pcb
[2022-04-05T12:07:49] Artem Bulashev: And some futures to it like 3.3 / 5v selectable
[2022-04-05T12:08:23] Artem Bulashev: And dual direction or single direction (for normal controllers) selectable
[2022-04-05T12:09:40] Artem Bulashev: Still have to solve something before we can confirm that direct mode works correctly
[2022-04-05T12:12:47] Artem Bulashev: I know I strangling my self and every body else … that’s why it will be out very soon
[2022-04-05T12:14:23] sombre_enfant: Quick release design and multiple holder ?
[2022-04-05T12:14:51] sombre_enfant: Bc buying 10 time an expensive throttle 😰
[2022-04-05T12:16:03] Artem Bulashev: It will have dual screw mounting yes (so no need to remove grips) or may be it will open up like a lid will see (one screw than)
[2022-04-05T12:16:53] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that’s why I try to keep it 3-5 times cheaper than competition with much more basic throttle with no extra futures
[2022-04-05T12:17:36] Artem Bulashev: Target is 45-55€
[2022-04-05T12:19:06] Artem Bulashev: But I didn’t know if that’s realistic or may be we can make cheaper :) I will be finalizing design in a few days, so will know soon 😊
[2022-04-05T12:22:32] Mirono escooters: Pls soon😂
[2022-04-05T12:22:35] Mirono escooters: We all need
[2022-04-05T12:27:55] Oliver Eliasson: Please two screws not one and hinge. Accedently overtightened one with hinge and it snapped.
[2022-04-05T12:28:16] Oliver Eliasson: I’ll will take care of that
[2022-04-05T12:30:38] Artem Bulashev: It won’t because I have counter support 🙂, I will try to scquize in 2 screws
[2022-04-05T12:30:58] Oliver Eliasson: Okey👍🏼
[2022-04-05T12:33:08] Happy Giraffe: Sabvoton actually has 3-way speed switch wire. Heck I could put it behind a key😂

[2022-04-05T14:09:26] Artem Bulashev: Wastage doesn’t heat up wires.
[2022-04-05T14:10:05] Artem Bulashev: So doesn’t matter if you have 150a phase and 40a battery setting at 60v battery or if you have it at 84v battery
[2022-04-05T14:10:34] Oliver Eliasson: Is it needed or just recommended
[2022-04-05T14:10:57] rosheee: Never used
[2022-04-05T14:11:27] Happy Giraffe: Not ultimately needed, just comes as default in spintend tho
[2022-04-05T14:11:56] Artem Bulashev: Smart BMS have built in antispark + ubox has button to turn on and off - so no need. This is to be able to turn of vesc that doesn’t have power button

[2022-04-05T14:30:45] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah thats not that bad
[2022-04-05T14:31:01] Oliver Eliasson: No danger in charging battery when its on right?
[2022-04-05T14:31:18] Artem Bulashev: Not an issue
[2022-04-05T14:33:03] Mirono escooters: It would take some time to drain a normal battery lol
[2022-04-05T14:48:28] Happy Giraffe: I got the led on the button on 24/7
[2022-04-05T14:49:10] Happy Giraffe: Don't know the consumption but I think it would take more than 3 weeks to drain battery anyways
[2022-04-05T14:49:36] Mirono escooters: More problably
[2022-04-05T15:23:17] Artem Bulashev: 20ah battery with draw of 20mah = 41 day
[2022-04-05T15:23:21] Artem Bulashev: Full to dead
[2022-04-05T15:23:37] Artem Bulashev: Self discharge is about 400 days due to slight use of BMS. Other wise even longer , about 3 years self discharge I believe
[2022-04-05T15:29:09] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but Spintend button led
[2022-04-05T15:54:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😰😰

[2022-04-05T18:32:05] Artem Bulashev: Lol man :) can imagine the pain
[2022-04-05T18:32:35] Artem Bulashev: You can actually reduce width of UBOX BY ABOUT 15%
[2022-04-05T18:32:51] Artem Bulashev: Cut aluminum off
[2022-04-05T18:32:57] Happy Giraffe: +1
[2022-04-05T18:34:56] Happy Giraffe: Or...make custom case even if you want to be flexy

[2022-04-05T19:04:20] rosheee: And then it has a copperbar
[2022-04-05T19:04:26] Artem Bulashev: 100v is better heat decepation
[2022-04-05T19:04:31] Artem Bulashev: Spintend said
[2022-04-05T19:04:41] rosheee: Ok
[2022-04-05T19:05:00] rosheee: I try to test xD
[2022-04-05T19:05:00] Artem Bulashev: So fets with higher IR result in same performance they say as 75v with lower Ir fets
[2022-04-05T19:05:29] Artem Bulashev: But can you explain again what you tried to say? Which one you think is better / why?

[2022-04-05T23:23:08] Happy Giraffe: Absolute current gives small kick when it gives error but doesnt go full brake. Tho the kick is enough to make you crash if one handed
[2022-04-05T23:32:16] Unknown: No its with a reciever
[2022-04-05T23:33:08] Unknown: And it was full brake tho no joke i've had some kicks with my previous phase wires

[2022-04-06T00:14:09] Artem Bulashev: This is not just regen brake
[2022-04-06T00:14:23] Artem Bulashev: But more like complete motor lock with phase
[2022-04-06T00:14:27] Artem Bulashev: Am I wrong ?

[2022-04-06T19:38:48] Happy Giraffe: Could make adapters for those to fit any width motor
[2022-04-06T19:38:55] Mirono escooters: Or do as herodash does and use monorim forks in rear bolted to widen
[2022-04-06T19:39:14] Happy Giraffe: Or could make custom stainless sides for monorim🤔
[2022-04-06T19:39:23] rosheee: But it fits no prob

[2022-04-06T23:59:41] Paolo ⁭: Buy heat shrink by you self
[2022-04-07T00:00:06] Paolo ⁭: Because these cells are for Tesla that not use wrap for reduce total weight
[2022-04-07T00:01:44] Oliver Eliasson: Oh okey, so essier to just but wraped

[2022-04-07T00:38:18] rosheee: Something is gay
[2022-04-07T00:38:30] Artem Bulashev: Kv describes the RPM (revolutions per minute) a motor does per Volt that is put into it.
[2022-04-07T00:38:37] rosheee: At least i had the chance to go 107kmh gps on g30 xD
[2022-04-07T00:38:54] Artem Bulashev: Issue is not battery voltage
[2022-04-07T00:39:11] Artem Bulashev: 17s and 16s is basically same shit
[2022-04-07T00:39:16] Artem Bulashev: For motor

[2022-04-07T00:46:51] Artem Bulashev: Stock settings have 28 magnets instead of 30, and tire size adjusted
[2022-04-07T00:47:03] rosheee: Lol
[2022-04-07T00:47:06] rosheee: It has 30

[2022-04-07T00:47:23] rosheee: 90kmh downhill.
[2022-04-07T00:48:02] Artem Bulashev: - 5% duty of foc mode on ubo, so top speed should be about 87-89kmh on 67volts
[2022-04-07T00:48:59] Artem Bulashev: At your voltage 71.4v that would be minimum 92-95kmh
[2022-04-07T00:49:17] rosheee: Yup
[2022-04-07T00:49:20] Artem Bulashev: Yea manufacturer set lower to make speed look higher
[2022-04-07T00:49:23] rosheee: And thr LE motors 107
[2022-04-07T00:49:31] rosheee: With 17S
[2022-04-07T00:49:42] Artem Bulashev: Ok sure no idea :)
[2022-04-07T00:50:07] Artem Bulashev: Point is same 10+ motor can’t be slower top speed on higher voltage

[2022-04-07T00:54:30] rosheee: What his weight? 50kg?
[2022-04-07T00:54:36] rosheee: Nope

[2022-04-07T00:55:33] Paolo ⁭: 15s9p
[2022-04-07T00:56:23] Paolo ⁭: And this was sensorless then soft start for avoid motor saturation
[2022-04-07T00:57:37] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-04-07T00:57:51] Artem Bulashev: Starve is that you have 4151w with 249amps
[2022-04-07T00:58:03] Artem Bulashev: Oh those phase amps
[2022-04-07T00:58:07] rosheee: Yup on 1 motor ^^'
[2022-04-07T00:58:22] Artem Bulashev: 249a single motor ?
[2022-04-07T00:58:34] Paolo ⁭: 2
[2022-04-07T00:58:48] rosheee: O.o only 4000w
[2022-04-07T00:58:53] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-04-07T00:58:55] Paolo ⁭: Very efficient
[2022-04-07T00:59:17] Paolo ⁭: Why you say is shit @artBula ?
[2022-04-07T01:00:33] Artem Bulashev: To maintain 85kmh it draws 600-1000w total from both wheels? 😂😂
[2022-04-07T01:00:43] Artem Bulashev: Scooter
[2022-04-07T01:00:46] Artem Bulashev: As a frame
[2022-04-07T01:00:51] Artem Bulashev: Not motor man
[2022-04-07T01:00:57] Paolo ⁭: Oh lol
[2022-04-07T01:01:07] Artem Bulashev: Frame is garbage, and he was asking about good scooter as whole
[2022-04-07T01:01:14] Unknown: Max speed so far on road with Vsett 10 motors and 20s was 63mph. Was around 78v resting at that time. I didn't have the balls to go any faster. I think at full 84v resting and balls of steel, I could hit 67-68mph, maybe break 70. Add some field weakening and extreme balls of steel, I can push 75mph on road. Not sure if my balls will ever be metallic LoL
[2022-04-07T01:01:33] Unknown: Is that what you're seeing in dedicated forums?
[2022-04-07T01:01:58] Artem Bulashev: Thats what people that do scooter repairs told me
[2022-04-07T01:02:00] Paolo ⁭: Yeah I think don’t good for do high speed, but I think is best (for cheap price) about comfort
[2022-04-07T01:02:19] Unknown: Hmm. Interesting
[2022-04-07T01:02:31] Artem Bulashev: And yeah i have seen that confirmed on forums, but originally all seems rainbows good
[2022-04-07T01:02:34] Unknown: Who wants comfort and not speed if customizing?
[2022-04-07T01:02:39] rosheee: So same speed so far as me with g30 ln 17S
[2022-04-07T01:03:02] Artem Bulashev: I do not understand any one who wants to go 85kmh on scooter
[2022-04-07T01:03:04] rosheee: Yah fuck. Kabooo warrior pro gt?
[2022-04-07T01:03:06] Artem Bulashev: Sorry :)
[2022-04-07T01:03:14] rosheee: 100 feels nice
[2022-04-07T01:03:17] Paolo ⁭: Idk I have blade frame and it’s pretty good for me
[2022-04-07T01:03:20] Artem Bulashev: No it doesn’t
[2022-04-07T01:03:24] Paolo ⁭: Need only few mod

[2022-04-07T01:03:40] Artem Bulashev: Feels like you are in the wind tunnel
[2022-04-07T01:03:43] Paolo ⁭: I’ve reached 118kmh without wobble
[2022-04-07T01:03:45] rosheee: No xD
[2022-04-07T01:03:50] Paolo ⁭: 21s
[2022-04-07T01:04:01] Unknown: Yea, it was a little scary lol. I'm usually topping out around 55mph and then backing off. 45-50mph is fun fun cruising speed and not stupid
[2022-04-07T01:04:18] rosheee: Vsett is to wobbly people sa,
[2022-04-07T01:04:30] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-04-07T01:04:33] Paolo ⁭: Sabvoton is very crazy, but are giant
[2022-04-07T01:05:00] Artem Bulashev: At that price you better of buying a proper bike used
[2022-04-07T01:05:05] Unknown: And still efficient with moderate amp settings. 30s can reach 55mph without a sweat
[2022-04-07T01:05:07] rosheee: @lBabacar bought the LE motors..hmm they wpuld fit perfrct on vsett 10+ xD
[2022-04-07T01:05:11] Artem Bulashev: More speed and more safety same price
[2022-04-07T01:05:29] Unknown: Mine is solid as a rock with PMT tires, exa shocks and Matris damper
[2022-04-07T01:05:34] Artem Bulashev: What is speed rating on PMT tire?
[2022-04-07T01:05:47] Paolo ⁭: I think stock steering damper bracket isn’t good for vsett and blade
[2022-04-07T01:05:57] Artem Bulashev: Stock?
[2022-04-07T01:06:16] Artem Bulashev: There is no stock damper on vsett or i miss understood you

[2022-04-07T01:06:52] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3523@07-04-2022_01-06-52.jpg>
[2022-04-07T01:06:59] Paolo ⁭: Fix it here is much more stable
[2022-04-07T01:07:01] rosheee: Yes BUT WHERE XD?
[2022-04-07T01:07:59] Artem Bulashev: https://alienrides.com/products/vsett-11-super-72
[2022-04-07T01:08:04] Unknown: Vsett 10 has no stock damper. FalconGo damper kit with 35cm Matris damper is as good as it gets
[2022-04-07T01:08:12] Artem Bulashev: It is on sale in eu and china and us
[2022-04-07T01:08:15] Paolo ⁭: Did custom fix bracket too
[2022-04-07T01:08:31] Unknown: I don't see a speed rating. Maybe on the tire itself...
[2022-04-07T01:08:44] rosheee: But same frame n stuff like 11+ Exceot battery
[2022-04-07T01:08:55] Artem Bulashev: Better check not to be supriced with a pop on that speed
[2022-04-07T01:08:59] Paolo ⁭: It’s fake matris, also ohlins they sell are fake. I’ve opened both and not original parts
[2022-04-07T01:09:18] Unknown: I bought my Matris damper separate. It's genuine
[2022-04-07T01:09:29] Paolo ⁭: I mean that FalconPev sell
[2022-04-07T01:09:45] Unknown: FalconGo is different than falconpev
[2022-04-07T01:09:52] Paolo ⁭: Oh lol
[2022-04-07T01:10:08] Paolo ⁭: How much paid?
[2022-04-07T01:10:39] Paolo ⁭: You too have this fixage
[2022-04-07T01:11:02] Unknown: <photos/photo_3527@07-04-2022_01-11-02.jpg>
[2022-04-07T01:11:09] rosheee: Ds Amper
[2022-04-07T01:11:19] rosheee: Damper xD ehy need that?
[2022-04-07T01:11:20] Unknown: <photos/photo_3528@07-04-2022_01-11-20.jpg>
[2022-04-07T01:11:26] Unknown: 3 anchor points
[2022-04-07T01:12:01] Paolo ⁭: Not mean anything the marking here, you can know only opening it. But normally Matris cost about 250€
[2022-04-07T01:12:05] Unknown: Why wouldn't you
[2022-04-07T01:12:24] Unknown: Opening how?
[2022-04-07T01:12:46] Artem Bulashev: Man going 90kmh without damper on g30?
[2022-04-07T01:12:47] Unknown: I don't see a speed rating on the PMT tires
[2022-04-07T01:12:53] Unknown: Yea...
[2022-04-07T01:13:24] Paolo ⁭: How much you paid your ?
[2022-04-07T01:14:48] rosheee: Ofc
[2022-04-07T01:14:51] Paolo ⁭: G30 no wobble lol
[2022-04-07T01:14:56] rosheee: Never
[2022-04-07T01:15:01] Paolo ⁭: But anyway risk
[2022-04-07T01:15:27] rosheee: Never
[2022-04-07T01:15:35] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-04-07T01:15:52] Unknown: $60. I don't know 100% if it's genuine but I have no reason to think it's not. Regardless, it works really good and not sure how much better or what benefits spending $250 on a damper would make
[2022-04-07T01:15:57] rosheee: So fucl it
[2022-04-07T01:16:07] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-04-07T01:16:13] rosheee: Kaboo wolf king.gt pro super looks best and.best quality
[2022-04-07T01:17:11] Artem Bulashev: That’s next level retarded to go 90+kmh on frame like that, without damper to back you up from tiny rock on the ground that is just suicidal. You need reality check
[2022-04-07T01:17:30] rosheee: I have xD
[2022-04-07T01:17:44] rosheee: Tiny rocks?
[2022-04-07T01:17:59] Artem Bulashev: Your fork is literally sheet of metal 4mm thick
[2022-04-07T01:18:11] Unknown: Any of the high power high speed scooters always always have damper or have aftermarket dampers. I would never ride my 10+ without a damper
[2022-04-07T01:18:13] rosheee: Yah then it happens
[2022-04-07T01:18:57] Artem Bulashev: Sorry I will never feel for any one on g30 going above 55kmh.
[2022-04-07T01:18:59] Paolo ⁭: Yes no sense in the fact on electric scooter . But just let you genuine matris cost very much, AliExpress and Amazon sell clone.
[2022-04-07T01:19:22] Paolo ⁭: I’ve genuine arrow on mine
[2022-04-07T01:19:25] rosheee: It was was fun Always felt safe
[2022-04-07T01:19:39] Artem Bulashev: Breaking news, it is not
[2022-04-07T01:19:52] rosheee: Felt save over 10000km
[2022-04-07T01:20:22] Artem Bulashev: At that speed on that scooter one mistake and you will not text again
[2022-04-07T01:20:28] rosheee: Yes
[2022-04-07T01:20:31] rosheee: Like with card
[2022-04-07T01:20:32] rosheee: Cars
[2022-04-07T01:20:59] Artem Bulashev: Suspention is not made for that not scooter design is strong enough to handle any impact on that speed
[2022-04-07T01:21:14] rosheee: Which suspension?
[2022-04-07T01:21:23] Artem Bulashev: Monorim even
[2022-04-07T01:21:34] rosheee: Thr thing is our streets here are flat xD there is no.holes n stuff
[2022-04-07T01:21:41] Unknown: Gotcha. I wasn't aware of that. Good to know. Clone works just fine for me 🤓
[2022-04-07T01:21:52] rosheee: Monorim is crap truw
[2022-04-07T01:22:21] Artem Bulashev: I lived in switzerland for 12 years, I know, but than I hit a metal pole on the high way and pfff 4000euros of wheels are gone

[2022-04-07T01:27:36] Artem Bulashev: Common 225/40 = 90mm looks big for me

[2022-04-07T01:35:37] Luis Magalhaes: But the battery dont seem to be good for the amps it push
[2022-04-07T01:35:51] Luis Magalhaes: Low discharge cells i think
[2022-04-07T01:36:05] Luis Magalhaes: And the rear suspension could be better too
[2022-04-07T01:36:40] rosheee: u have 18650 cells?

[2022-04-07T01:43:53] rosheee: 35Ah 21700 battery
[2022-04-07T01:44:01] rosheee: 20S
[2022-04-07T01:44:05] Luis Magalhaes: Thats why they put controller outside
[2022-04-07T01:44:38] Luis Magalhaes: Yes,i dont like that battery 😂
[2022-04-07T01:44:46] rosheee: Ehy?
[2022-04-07T01:44:54] Luis Magalhaes: Good for going slow 😝
[2022-04-07T01:45:14] rosheee: Meh
[2022-04-07T01:45:33] rosheee: Then go for 4kw motors
[2022-04-07T01:45:46] rosheee: Then steering damper
[2022-04-07T01:45:47] Luis Magalhaes: 7P of low discharge cells
[2022-04-07T01:45:53] rosheee: I chs ge to 22S
[2022-04-07T01:45:58] rosheee: 9P

[2022-04-07T01:46:09] Luis Magalhaes: What? 😂
[2022-04-07T01:46:10] rosheee: First ride it
[2022-04-07T01:46:12] rosheee: Yes
[2022-04-07T01:46:19] rosheee: Until something happens
[2022-04-07T01:46:33] rosheee: Then measure And then use 5000mAh high dischwrge cells
[2022-04-07T01:46:50] Luis Magalhaes: You can and it will ride good, dont know about the voltage drop but would like to know
[2022-04-07T01:47:02] Paolo ⁭: Yea and controllers are outside
[2022-04-07T01:47:47] Luis Magalhaes: Doing the same with kelly 😂
[2022-04-07T01:48:02] rosheee: Nucluar controllers then
[2022-04-07T01:48:52] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_3534@07-04-2022_01-48-52.jpg>
[2022-04-07T01:49:20] Luis Magalhaes: It should be running now, but had a problem with the left controller
[2022-04-07T01:49:28] Luis Magalhaes: It got brick
[2022-04-07T01:50:50] Luis Magalhaes: Now waiting for a new one from fastride but its difficult to prepare the package and ship, they are packaging from day 29 till now and dont respond to messages..
[2022-04-07T01:51:04] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-04-07T01:53:08] Unknown: I like that setup a lot man. Looks great, nice clean brackets. No limit on controller size really at all. Kelly?
[2022-04-07T01:53:38] Luis Magalhaes: yes kls7218
[2022-04-07T01:53:50] Unknown: I would use like 3-5mm thermal pad between controller and mounting plate to absorb vibration and shock
[2022-04-07T01:53:58] Unknown: Awesome 👍👍
[2022-04-07T01:54:39] Unknown: That how I have my Nucs mounted, with 5mm thermal pad between controller body and frame to soften vibrations to controllers
[2022-04-07T01:54:45] Luis Magalhaes: Its a good idea 👌
[2022-04-07T01:54:59] Artem Bulashev: That’s what I hear as well other than that seems solid
[2022-04-07T01:55:06] Unknown: Metal controller direct to metal bracket will see 100% of all vibrations
[2022-04-07T01:55:47] rosheee: kaboo has samsung 50E xD
[2022-04-07T01:56:01] rosheee: maybe i can mount 20S 35Ah on g30 frame
[2022-04-07T01:56:31] Unknown: Thermal pads are obviously great for transferring heat but they work really great for vibration dampening. I also have a 3mm thermal pad under my battery so it isn't sitting directly on the metal frame
[2022-04-07T01:56:38] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, same frame for years, no big mods, only higher suspension on front and larger stearing
[2022-04-07T01:56:57] Artem Bulashev: How is it 20s7p with controllers outside if even smaller scooter vsett 10+ fits 20s9p inside with controllers outside ?
[2022-04-07T01:57:26] Unknown: Keeping your essential components cushioned will just extend their lifespan and reduce wear n tear on components
[2022-04-07T01:57:36] Luis Magalhaes: True, i was going to use some rubber but your idea seems better 😁
[2022-04-07T01:57:38] Unknown: Good question
[2022-04-07T01:57:51] Artem Bulashev: Right? 😅😅😂
[2022-04-07T01:58:01] Unknown: Benefits of vibration dampening and cooling 👌👌
[2022-04-07T01:58:12] Artem Bulashev: Makes that project more and more fabulous
[2022-04-07T01:58:17] Unknown: Haha... I'm curious myself
[2022-04-07T01:58:34] rosheee: OMG
[2022-04-07T01:58:36] rosheee: 1.5A CHARGER
[2022-04-07T01:58:38] rosheee: ARE THEY RETARD
[2022-04-07T01:58:41] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-04-07T01:58:41] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, like 70A discharge battery and 50A per controller ?! 😅
[2022-04-07T01:58:46] Unknown: I still can't believe I pulled it off man 😂. Battery JUST fit
[2022-04-07T01:58:54] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂😂
[2022-04-07T01:59:06] rosheee: now 150A discharge on 50A
[2022-04-07T01:59:08] rosheee: battery
[2022-04-07T01:59:10] Unknown: Oh my... Poor cells
[2022-04-07T01:59:16] Artem Bulashev: 😋 welcome 😁😁🙃
[2022-04-07T01:59:17] rosheee: no prob for samsung
[2022-04-07T01:59:18] Luis Magalhaes: I have some rubber stripes 😂
[2022-04-07T01:59:30] Unknown: 🙏🙏🙌🙌
[2022-04-07T01:59:35] Artem Bulashev: 50e is 10a cell mainly
[2022-04-07T01:59:44] rosheee: yes i have 50G
[2022-04-07T01:59:48] rosheee: 5P
[2022-04-07T01:59:54] rosheee: take 150A pek

[2022-04-07T02:00:04] rosheee: pika pika
[2022-04-07T02:00:07] Luis Magalhaes: They use plastic spacers the battery is using all space
[2022-04-07T02:00:08] Artem Bulashev: At 15 it goes to shit
[2022-04-07T02:00:16] Artem Bulashev: 70c
[2022-04-07T02:00:19] rosheee: yes
[2022-04-07T02:00:21] rosheee: i know
[2022-04-07T02:00:22] Paolo ⁭: It’s good
[2022-04-07T02:00:22] rosheee: ^___^
[2022-04-07T02:00:25] Paolo ⁭: Look WEPED
[2022-04-07T02:00:36] Paolo ⁭: 16s6p for 160A
[2022-04-07T02:00:39] Artem Bulashev: 70c in 10min
[2022-04-07T02:00:40] Paolo ⁭: Of 50E
[2022-04-07T02:00:46] Luis Magalhaes: Thats normal now 😂
[2022-04-07T02:00:54] rosheee: nah bit longer
[2022-04-07T02:01:16] Artem Bulashev: 2.5ah/15a*60min = 10min
[2022-04-07T02:01:17] rosheee: weped has magura
[2022-04-07T02:01:21] Luis Magalhaes: No space no fun 😂
[2022-04-07T02:01:31] rosheee: why
[2022-04-07T02:01:38] rosheee: 17S has 210A 180A bms
[2022-04-07T02:01:38] Unknown: Even cheap thermal pads work just fine. Thise Kellys won't be overheating so will mostly be useful for vibration dampening but 6w/mk thermal heat transfer is an added bonus even though it's not a crazy high number
[2022-04-07T02:02:27] rosheee: lol vsett 11+ super72 use 140mm disc
[2022-04-07T02:02:31] rosheee: XD THAT IS UNSAFE!!
[2022-04-07T02:02:38] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-04-07T02:02:54] rosheee: <photos/photo_3537@07-04-2022_02-02-54.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:03:08] Luis Magalhaes: They will not heat, and outside deck thats not a problem 😁 just for vibration 😁
[2022-04-07T02:03:08] rosheee: <photos/photo_3538@07-04-2022_02-03-08.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:03:14] Artem Bulashev: No way
[2022-04-07T02:03:18] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3539@07-04-2022_02-03-18.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:03:26] Artem Bulashev: That does not look like 140mm
[2022-04-07T02:03:41] Luis Magalhaes: kaabo upgrade to 160 in the king i think
[2022-04-07T02:04:06] rosheee: <photos/photo_3540@07-04-2022_02-04-06.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:04:23] rosheee: i put the shimano discs + magura braks i have from other scooter on it
[2022-04-07T02:04:33] Luis Magalhaes: its wheel on air 🤣
[2022-04-07T02:04:34] rosheee: + put vesc in it
[2022-04-07T02:05:15] Luis Magalhaes: that i like
[2022-04-07T02:05:31] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3541@07-04-2022_02-05-31.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:05:31] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3542@07-04-2022_02-05-31.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:05:41] Artem Bulashev: Definitely not 140
[2022-04-07T02:05:49] Luis Magalhaes: but vesc for bigger power are not very cheap
[2022-04-07T02:05:52] Artem Bulashev: 160 I think
[2022-04-07T02:06:11] rosheee: I CAN PUT 180MM DISC on it
[2022-04-07T02:06:18] rosheee: + pmt slicks 90/65-5
[2022-04-07T02:06:39] Unknown: Yup exactly. Plus they're tacky/sticky a bit so will keep controllers planted, vibration free and slight thermal transfer is just added bonus. My 12Fs only get 5C above ambient at 70a batt/200a phase 🤣 They're just barely working, slow walk for them
[2022-04-07T02:06:59] rosheee: omg epicfail
[2022-04-07T02:07:07] Luis Magalhaes: really like that frame
[2022-04-07T02:07:11] rosheee: controllers of kaboo are here
[2022-04-07T02:07:14] Artem Bulashev: Yes confirmed 11+ stock is 160mm
[2022-04-07T02:07:24] Artem Bulashev: So super is for sure not less
[2022-04-07T02:07:29] rosheee: <photos/photo_3543@07-04-2022_02-07-29.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:07:49] Luis Magalhaes: easy, but you have wrong side on the brake pumps did you see it ?
[2022-04-07T02:07:56] Luis Magalhaes: the brakes are right side
[2022-04-07T02:08:16] rosheee: ??
[2022-04-07T02:08:22] rosheee: <photos/photo_3544@07-04-2022_02-08-22.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:08:42] Luis Magalhaes: almoust all brakes are done for the left side
[2022-04-07T02:08:56] rosheee: hmm
[2022-04-07T02:08:59] rosheee: but dosen't matte
[2022-04-07T02:09:00] rosheee: does it?
[2022-04-07T02:09:14] Unknown: So smaller inside deck than 10+
[2022-04-07T02:09:19] Paolo ⁭: Easy to fix
[2022-04-07T02:09:22] rosheee: dude
[2022-04-07T02:09:24] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3545@07-04-2022_02-09-24.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:09:26] rosheee: what are u talking xD
[2022-04-07T02:09:28] rosheee: the 11+ is smaller
[2022-04-07T02:09:31] Luis Magalhaes: some people use but have do to small mods
[2022-04-07T02:09:47] rosheee: <photos/photo_3546@07-04-2022_02-09-47.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:09:50] rosheee: this is vsett11+
[2022-04-07T02:10:16] Unknown: 21700 20s9p 10+ deck
[2022-04-07T02:10:16] Unknown: <photos/photo_3548@07-04-2022_02-10-16.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:10:25] rosheee: yes
[2022-04-07T02:10:26] Luis Magalhaes: yes, you can put it on top but have do change the cable side of the pump
[2022-04-07T02:12:13] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-04-07T02:12:13] Unknown: Kaabo max battery size..? Deck is full. What model and which battery?
[2022-04-07T02:12:17] Artem Bulashev: Guys
[2022-04-07T02:12:19] Artem Bulashev: https://electric-scooter.guide/comparisons/compare-electric-scooters/
[2022-04-07T02:12:36] Artem Bulashev: Select sag performance data only
[2022-04-07T02:12:44] Artem Bulashev: Than sort by 0-40mph
[2022-04-07T02:12:48] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂
[2022-04-07T02:12:53] rosheee: sag?
[2022-04-07T02:13:00] Artem Bulashev: Warrior X pro is slowest
[2022-04-07T02:13:53] rosheee: wolf king gt only 4000w o.O?
[2022-04-07T02:15:56] Luis Magalhaes: 20s7P 50E cells
[2022-04-07T02:16:07] Luis Magalhaes: the deck is small inside
[2022-04-07T02:17:24] rosheee: 20.5" x 9
[2022-04-07T02:17:28] Luis Magalhaes: the X is the small one lol
[2022-04-07T02:17:33] Luis Magalhaes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmuWCUZsvH0&ab_channel=Sky-Bike.ru
[2022-04-07T02:17:40] Luis Magalhaes: they compare specs here
[2022-04-07T02:17:50] rosheee: yeh i watched it
[2022-04-07T02:17:51] Unknown: If those prices are correct (which I know they're MSRP and everyone gets their own deals).. but assuming they are.. WK GT $3600 vs Vsett 10 $2300... With $1300 difference, plus a little bit more, you can buy Vsett 10+, build 20s battery and 2 Kelly/sabvoton controllers and have a monster that will eat a wolf king gt for breakfast
[2022-04-07T02:18:17] Artem Bulashev: Same length as 10+ but wider
[2022-04-07T02:18:17] rosheee: nice ^^'
[2022-04-07T02:18:21] Unknown: That's really interesting such a big scooter has such a smaller deck bay than a smaller scooter
[2022-04-07T02:18:25] rosheee: my g30 is same speed as you so far
[2022-04-07T02:18:29] rosheee: for 1500 or more less
[2022-04-07T02:18:31] Luis Magalhaes: i like the front suspension on wolf and the rear on vsett lolol
[2022-04-07T02:18:34] rosheee: ^^
[2022-04-07T02:18:50] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-07T02:19:16] Luis Magalhaes: for that way of thinking you can go laoti 🤣
[2022-04-07T02:19:34] Unknown: The ride is nowhere near as comfortable and you're pushing your controller and battery to the absolute limit, can't sustain that power. Plus I have full suspension, PMT tires...
[2022-04-07T02:19:47] rosheee: why? battery is 23 degrees
[2022-04-07T02:19:55] Unknown: Controller?
[2022-04-07T02:20:00] rosheee: bit hotter
[2022-04-07T02:20:07] rosheee: but i take 180A phase 😆
[2022-04-07T02:20:16] rosheee: if i go lower then ^__^stays at 50 degrees
[2022-04-07T02:20:19] Unknown: 🤣
[2022-04-07T02:20:19] Luis Magalhaes: its not that big scooter, if you compare it to an zero 11x its a small one 🤣
[2022-04-07T02:20:21] rosheee: but stil 100kmh
[2022-04-07T02:20:31] rosheee: but wobble
[2022-04-07T02:20:35] rosheee: wobble wobble wobble
[2022-04-07T02:20:41] rosheee: fuck me
[2022-04-07T02:20:42] Unknown: Hmm.. the dual stem makes it look big I guess
[2022-04-07T02:20:48] rosheee: or the new fucking ninebot
[2022-04-07T02:21:19] Unknown: Not to mention... I haven't come close to maxing my 10+ out yet. That 10.5kw run was moderate settings
[2022-04-07T02:21:33] rosheee: yes u have 20S
[2022-04-07T02:21:34] rosheee: XD
[2022-04-07T02:21:38] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅😅
[2022-04-07T02:21:39] rosheee: i stuck 13kw
[2022-04-07T02:21:42] rosheee: with 17S
[2022-04-07T02:21:53] Luis Magalhaes: stearing dumper, i have a friend doing 100+ no problems lol
[2022-04-07T02:21:53] rosheee: u have beefier controllers
[2022-04-07T02:22:06] rosheee: <photos/photo_3550@07-04-2022_02-22-06.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:22:26] Unknown: Right... So it's not direct comparison even though you peaked around the same wattage, so far 😉 Completely different animals g30 and Vsett 10
[2022-04-07T02:22:47] Artem Bulashev: Police be like : it’s a bird, no it’s bike, no it’s a scooter, da fuck
[2022-04-07T02:22:47] Luis Magalhaes: you can always modify, thats why i say to people to buy what they like 😅
[2022-04-07T02:23:13] Unknown: That's exactly right. I agree 100%.
[2022-04-07T02:23:31] Unknown: Vsett is an affordable chassis to buy and build up
[2022-04-07T02:23:43] Luis Magalhaes: ofcourse you have to think about what you want to build because of space too
[2022-04-07T02:23:46] Unknown: And solid AF
[2022-04-07T02:24:07] Luis Magalhaes: we should be able to buy just chassis haha
[2022-04-07T02:24:15] rosheee: i tried
[2022-04-07T02:24:20] rosheee: but these motherfuckers said no
[2022-04-07T02:24:22] rosheee: NO NO NO
[2022-04-07T02:24:25] rosheee: bitchass
[2022-04-07T02:24:29] Luis Magalhaes: they dont like to sell that way
[2022-04-07T02:24:51] Oliver Eliasson: What chassie you want?
[2022-04-07T02:24:55] Unknown: Yup, planning ahead is always smart. I was very surprised this 20s battery fit in my 10+. Would have never dreamed it until Artem showed me the CAD layout
[2022-04-07T02:25:02] rosheee: i tried the vsett 10+ befoer gone crazy on g30
[2022-04-07T02:25:14] rosheee: but they even said "no" to the importer...he even lied xD
[2022-04-07T02:25:21] rosheee: said he needs it for customer who broke it
[2022-04-07T02:25:26] rosheee: BUT THEY SMELEED THE CHICKEN
[2022-04-07T02:25:29] Artem Bulashev: This is slowest to fastest 0-40mph
[2022-04-07T02:26:48] Unknown: Yea, pity it's impossible to buy chassis's only. That's where Vsett 20ah version comes in handy to keep initial cost down. Can always resell controller and battery for decent money
[2022-04-07T02:27:15] rosheee: but this also is strange for me
[2022-04-07T02:27:37] Paolo ⁭: You have much stability difference between wolf and vsett 10
[2022-04-07T02:27:37] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3552@07-04-2022_02-27-37.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:27:43] Unknown: I still have my 25.6ah battery sitting here with 1-5a variable charger. Probably worth around $650-800 for batt/charger combo
[2022-04-07T02:27:50] rosheee: this
[2022-04-07T02:28:01] rosheee: lol xD?
[2022-04-07T02:28:17] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3553@07-04-2022_02-28-17.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:28:17] Unknown: Who is more stable you think?
[2022-04-07T02:28:25] Oliver Eliasson: Whats the messurments for that?
[2022-04-07T02:28:52] Paolo ⁭: Direct fork is always more stable than “C” type
[2022-04-07T02:29:09] Artem Bulashev: 100%
[2022-04-07T02:29:10] Unknown: 68mm tall, 340mm long with wires and I think 155mm wide. I can measure exactly
[2022-04-07T02:29:13] Paolo ⁭: Can’t be compared
[2022-04-07T02:29:18] Luis Magalhaes: true, my battery was 18650 with 160cells and the minimotors controllers, with controllers outside kaabo fitted a 21700 140cells but the way they build use a lot of space too
[2022-04-07T02:29:42] Unknown: So the dual fork models more stable by default design?
[2022-04-07T02:29:50] rosheee: yes$
[2022-04-07T02:30:04] Paolo ⁭: I have difficult to sell my 72v 32Ah at 600€😂
[2022-04-07T02:30:09] Unknown: Gotcha...
[2022-04-07T02:30:28] rosheee: AND
[2022-04-07T02:30:29] Artem Bulashev: Deck is 172mm X 70mm X 430mm I believe
[2022-04-07T02:30:35] rosheee: i have 2 years warranty
[2022-04-07T02:30:37] rosheee: in switzerland
[2022-04-07T02:30:39] rosheee: no china shit
[2022-04-07T02:30:42] Paolo ⁭: Normal, just need goo quality suspension
[2022-04-07T02:30:54] Unknown: I think in USA, prices are different. New Vsett 25.6ah battery is 1200-1400 USD depending who you call
[2022-04-07T02:30:58] Paolo ⁭: Wolf fork suspension is cheap no work good
[2022-04-07T02:31:19] rosheee: OMG WHY CHEAP NOW
[2022-04-07T02:31:19] rosheee: xD
[2022-04-07T02:31:22] rosheee: EVERYTHING IS CHEAP
[2022-04-07T02:31:33] Paolo ⁭: Wtf cost more than vsett scooter factory price
[2022-04-07T02:31:34] rosheee: which is good then
[2022-04-07T02:31:40] Unknown: I misunderstood... Direct to fork.. is..?
[2022-04-07T02:31:45] Unknown: Yup
[2022-04-07T02:31:46] rosheee: lol? tbhey retard?
[2022-04-07T02:31:57] Unknown: Supply and demand guys
[2022-04-07T02:31:59] Paolo ⁭: 0.5$
[2022-04-07T02:32:00] Unknown: Lol
[2022-04-07T02:32:10] Luis Magalhaes: i think that kaabo has higher kv motor or not?
[2022-04-07T02:32:18] rosheee: idk
[2022-04-07T02:32:20] rosheee: it has 11" motor
[2022-04-07T02:32:25] rosheee: then can fit 4kw motor
[2022-04-07T02:32:31] rosheee: then bitch bye
[2022-04-07T02:32:37] Unknown: Guy on Vsett chat build 35ah battery with 50e cells for 10+ and sells for 1600 😲😲😲
[2022-04-07T02:32:37] rosheee: but fork is crap
[2022-04-07T02:32:38] rosheee: this crap

[2022-04-07T02:33:05] Paolo ⁭: The only motor with really 4kw are 75mm ones , and doesn’t fit xd
[2022-04-07T02:33:07] rosheee: rofl
[2022-04-07T02:33:08] Artem Bulashev: I think less

[2022-04-07T02:35:29] Luis Magalhaes: all they are counting at the electric brakes
[2022-04-07T02:35:37] rosheee: like people go to prosche garage and change turbo charger after 2500lkm
[2022-04-07T02:35:43] rosheee: ebrake?
[2022-04-07T02:35:49] Unknown: Not capable and lazy to learn. Want to just plug and play and have the best

[2022-04-07T02:36:33] Artem Bulashev: On website 1450$ = 1300€
[2022-04-07T02:36:34] Paolo ⁭: I have 32Ah 72v batt for sell
[2022-04-07T02:36:40] Luis Magalhaes: yes
[2022-04-07T02:36:43] Artem Bulashev: If that was with tax okey and with shipping okey
[2022-04-07T02:36:58] Artem Bulashev: But without tax 20% and than 80€ shipping that’s nuts
[2022-04-07T02:37:09] Unknown: Probably so lol. Which is why when people say to me, instead of modding your 10+, you should have just bought a NAMI or Rion. I just laugh
[2022-04-07T02:37:48] Artem Bulashev: Measured 0-40mph? Yet
[2022-04-07T02:37:59] Unknown: It was 1500... 1450 sounds more appealing lol. No shipping included and I think for USA customers, tax might be included but not sure
[2022-04-07T02:38:09] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-04-07T02:38:22] rosheee: they don't udnerstand
[2022-04-07T02:38:26] rosheee: it's like modding car
[2022-04-07T02:38:26] Unknown: I haven't figured a good way to measure yet
[2022-04-07T02:38:34] rosheee: u get the 5000$ car
[2022-04-07T02:38:37] Artem Bulashev: Nami 5.7 sec
[2022-04-07T02:38:37] rosheee: with 600hp
[2022-04-07T02:38:48] rosheee: that explode because heat
[2022-04-07T02:38:52] rosheee: but then fun
[2022-04-07T02:38:56] Unknown: Exactly. The joy and satisfaction of making something yourself rather than opening a box and saying, "look at me"
[2022-04-07T02:38:57] Artem Bulashev: Year display is accurate
[2022-04-07T02:39:03] Artem Bulashev: Record video of it
[2022-04-07T02:39:11] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3557@07-04-2022_02-39-11.jpg>
[2022-04-07T02:39:13] Artem Bulashev: 60fps
[2022-04-07T02:39:28] Unknown: Hmm.. ok, I will try that 👍
[2022-04-07T02:40:14] rosheee: still waiting
[2022-04-07T02:40:19] Unknown: Will need to fully charge and give it a go. I think it's really fast 🤓
[2022-04-07T02:40:20] Artem Bulashev: Phone gps?
[2022-04-07T02:40:53] rosheee: the 1800$ 35Ah use 60A bms
[2022-04-07T02:41:07] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-07T02:41:13] Unknown: I can use logging but (wheel speed enabled) but not sure how to calculate actual time
[2022-04-07T02:41:21] Artem Bulashev: I don’t trust GPS for acceleration test, unless it is Draggy or Racelogic
[2022-04-07T02:41:41] Unknown: Yup, that's all it's good for. It's for range, not power. Meant to be used with stock 30-35a controllers
[2022-04-07T02:41:47] Artem Bulashev: Logging is done by time stamps
[2022-04-07T02:42:05] Unknown: So, not accurate right?
[2022-04-07T02:42:08] Paolo ⁭: Dragy
[2022-04-07T02:42:12] Artem Bulashev: It is
[2022-04-07T02:42:17] Paolo ⁭: 160€ module
[2022-04-07T02:42:45] Unknown: Sorry, I'm illiterate when it comes to this. Have done zero research on the topic of timing speed
[2022-04-07T02:43:00] Unknown: Oh oh...
[2022-04-07T02:43:20] Paolo ⁭: Usa people not poor
[2022-04-07T02:44:10] Unknown: So if I set log speed to 100ms say.. I can find the top speed mark and compared to time elapsed? Convert milliseconds to seconds?
[2022-04-07T02:44:44] Unknown: Ehh, there are... Most just don't like to admit it. Too much pride over here in USA
[2022-04-07T02:46:01] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-04-07T02:46:14] Luis Magalhaes: thats world wide
[2022-04-07T03:23:16] rosheee: Wtf
[2022-04-07T03:23:25] rosheee: Ubox v1 i get 135a vesc detection xD
[2022-04-07T03:23:30] rosheee: Ubox v2 only 88
[2022-04-07T03:23:31] rosheee: O.O
[2022-04-07T04:11:04] rosheee: Ubox and battery fit in 10+?
[2022-04-07T04:15:13] Unknown: You have wolf gt ordered, no? 🤣
[2022-04-07T04:15:23] Unknown: Depends which battery
[2022-04-07T04:15:34] Unknown: And BMS
[2022-04-07T04:18:24] rosheee: ffs
[2022-04-07T04:18:27] rosheee: wolf is so big
[2022-04-07T04:18:36] rosheee: and limited edition motors fit vsett ^^
[2022-04-07T04:25:53] Unknown: 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-04-07T04:26:01] rosheee: I sell whole g30 frame monorim + r291 150lbs coilspring 2x vsett 10+ motor Sharkset steering ^^
[2022-04-07T04:26:30] Unknown: I would go for Vsett 10+, use your LE motors, build a 20s battery and get 2x Kelly or sabvoton and mount externally. Done. Monster scooter
[2022-04-07T04:26:44] rosheee: Phuu
[2022-04-07T04:26:47] rosheee: Idl
[2022-04-07T04:26:49] rosheee: Idk
[2022-04-07T04:26:51] rosheee: Rly idk
[2022-04-07T04:26:57] Unknown: Will blow a wolf gt out of the water
[2022-04-07T04:27:07] Unknown: No question. Zero question.
[2022-04-07T04:27:11] rosheee: Yah what if i fit 22S in ^^'?
[2022-04-07T04:27:17] rosheee: 2x4000w motor
[2022-04-07T04:27:29] Unknown: Can't bro... Unless 18650, maybe
[2022-04-07T04:27:40] rosheee: What cant?
[2022-04-07T04:27:41] Unknown: 21700 20s9p is absolute max on 10+
[2022-04-07T04:27:49] rosheee: Ah lol 10+
[2022-04-07T04:27:49] Unknown: 10+ or gt?
[2022-04-07T04:27:51] rosheee: I mean gt
[2022-04-07T04:27:55] Unknown: Oh oh, gorcha
[2022-04-07T04:28:05] rosheee: And ordered nucluar
[2022-04-07T04:28:11] rosheee: But fpr what..omg
[2022-04-07T04:28:15] Unknown: Well yea... But cost 1k more than 10+ off the bat
[2022-04-07T04:28:44] Unknown: I thought you were buying gt and keeping battery
[2022-04-07T04:30:39] Unknown: Buy Vsett 20ah... Cheapest version. Throw battery in the woods. Build 20s and mount controllers external, I would move away from ubox for power honestly, at those power levels, uBox won't hang. You'll be a little bit over the cost of a gt out of the box. Keep your le motors and Magura brakes, put on Vsett.
[2022-04-07T04:31:55] rosheee: 20S with what?
[2022-04-07T04:31:56] Unknown: Knowing what I know now about 10+, that's where I'd put my money. Only if... You're replacing the battery. GT battery stock will be better than stock Vsett battery
[2022-04-07T04:32:53] Unknown: Kelly or sabvoton... 20s8-9p with 50g or 48x... Even p42a but less capacity, huge amps. Best question for Artem the battery guru
[2022-04-07T04:33:12] rosheee: Never ever 50g again
[2022-04-07T04:33:25] Unknown: 48x . I see nkon has them
[2022-04-07T04:33:32] rosheee: They crap
[2022-04-07T04:33:38] rosheee: Molicel 50
[2022-04-07T04:33:43] Unknown: They are fabulous cells man. Actually amazing
[2022-04-07T04:33:49] rosheee: Can i configure these controllers?
[2022-04-07T04:34:02] Unknown: Yes... Molicel 50 are bangin
[2022-04-07T04:34:02] rosheee: Mobilephone?
[2022-04-07T04:34:11] rosheee: If police coms
[2022-04-07T04:34:12] Unknown: Yes of course
[2022-04-07T04:34:17] rosheee: O.o
[2022-04-07T04:34:27] Unknown: There are guys here who use both...
[2022-04-07T04:34:42] Unknown: Sabvoton is huge power but big... If mounted external, no issue
[2022-04-07T04:35:23] rosheee: This?

[2022-04-07T04:36:02] rosheee: If police 1x takes me out i am fucked
[2022-04-07T04:36:04] Unknown: I believe so. Paolo knows sabvoton and Luis knows Kelly
[2022-04-07T04:36:14] rosheee: I write nucularguys
[2022-04-07T04:36:24] Unknown: No luck there brother
[2022-04-07T04:37:01] Unknown: You need 2x 12F and display. Might as well be looking for flying unicorn X2
[2022-04-07T04:37:24] Unknown: Still don't know how I found mine... So Fing lucky
[2022-04-07T04:39:51] Unknown: So unfortunate. Makes me mad they aren't available because I know how great they are
[2022-04-07T04:40:50] Unknown: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=87870&start=4750 No idea what these are... KT controllers

[2022-04-07T04:41:56] rosheee: Omg
[2022-04-07T04:42:41] Unknown: Yea... If even possible to ship out of Russia
[2022-04-07T04:43:15] Unknown: Or 2 of these Rion VESC's 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-04-07T04:43:43] Unknown: Not exactly small or easy to mount externally
[2022-04-07T04:45:20] rosheee: No prob
[2022-04-07T04:45:27] rosheee: Link
[2022-04-07T04:45:35] rosheee: Vsett looks so instabil xF
[2022-04-07T04:45:51] Unknown: No clue bro... Will need to do some digging for those
[2022-04-07T04:46:24] Unknown: It is absolutely not. I've been 64mph on mine. Stable as I could ask for
[2022-04-07T04:46:35] Unknown: Damper kit is a must tho
[2022-04-07T04:46:40] Unknown: At those speeds
[2022-04-07T04:47:28] Unknown: Stem system is super solid. Exa shocks, PMT/CST tires and damper kit... Thing's rock solid, no lie
[2022-04-07T04:48:30] Unknown: If I hadn't tested it myself, I would comment. But I have. And it's a great chassis with those few mods for super duper power setups
[2022-04-07T04:49:32] rosheee: Dont want
[2022-04-07T04:49:56] Unknown: 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-04-07T04:50:01] rosheee: I tested the g30 stuff as well ^^ only rhe ones ...
[2022-04-07T04:50:07] rosheee: Maybe ninebot gt2
[2022-04-07T04:50:30] rosheee: 11 inch
[2022-04-07T04:52:10] Unknown: Keeps the front tire planted and stable as can be, even more planted in turns since it's helping you keep the tire on track. I can corner much faster now with the damper. Can ride with 1 hand and wheel stays on course. At high speed there is much less danger for incident.
[2022-04-07T04:52:21] rosheee: <photos/photo_3560@07-04-2022_04-52-21.jpg>
[2022-04-07T04:53:18] rosheee: 13S 70 kmh ^^
[2022-04-07T04:53:22] Unknown: 👍. There are lots of options out there. I just know Vsett and what it is capable of and how it rides under lots of power

[2022-04-07T04:54:43] Unknown: Can make anything look amazing on an edited YouTube video
[2022-04-07T04:55:47] Unknown: Remember, motor watt ratings are literal garbage
[2022-04-07T04:56:01] rosheee: Yah but it looks good
[2022-04-07T04:56:17] Unknown: The deck space for battery looks very small
[2022-04-07T04:56:32] rosheee: For the price of the scooters i had i could buy rion
[2022-04-07T04:56:39] rosheee: I am.done with bstteryexperoments xD
[2022-04-07T04:57:08] rosheee: The 17S is going back..doesnt fit and i fucled scooterframe
[2022-04-07T04:58:00] Unknown: All depends what you're looking to do. If using stock battery that comes with scooter then your decision will be very different than if you're looking to replace the battery with upgraded one. Same with controllers
[2022-04-07T04:58:11] rosheee: Ofc i wanna replace
[2022-04-07T04:58:30] rosheee: Vsett 10+ would be good
[2022-04-07T04:58:34] rosheee: Thst is rly true
[2022-04-07T04:58:47] Unknown: Kind of hard to beat for the price and upgradable options
[2022-04-07T04:59:11] Unknown: Something tells me you're not the kind of guy to use a stock scooter
[2022-04-07T04:59:22] rosheee: The thing is
[2022-04-07T04:59:25] Unknown: That Segway doesn't look upgrade friendly at all
[2022-04-07T05:00:09] rosheee: Vsett 10+ 2600chf 60V Vsett 11+ 3000chf 60V Kaboo 3800chf 72V 21700
[2022-04-07T05:00:41] Unknown: Vsett 11 is beast. 11+ super with TFT display looks awesome but to integrate VESC with that display might be tough
[2022-04-07T05:00:58] Unknown: Segway has built-in dashboard but probably won't be useful with VESC
[2022-04-07T05:01:07] rosheee: Dont need display ^^
[2022-04-07T05:01:17] rosheee: Yah but i cant buy vsett11 super
[2022-04-07T05:01:21] rosheee: Only the normal
[2022-04-07T05:01:53] Unknown: But the ones with built in dashboards will look stupid as hell with a non functional black display built into the chassis... 10+ has no such display, easy to upgrade
[2022-04-07T05:02:16] Unknown: Just saying
[2022-04-07T05:02:21] rosheee: And brakes?
[2022-04-07T05:02:34] rosheee: Can i just put 160mm on it and my brskes?
[2022-04-07T05:02:42] Unknown: Nutt brakes are great. Or use your Maguras, easy swap onto 10+
[2022-04-07T05:02:47] Unknown: Absolutely
[2022-04-07T05:03:01] rosheee: Without buying parts
[2022-04-07T05:03:21] Unknown: Will need 2 post mount to IS adapters. 10 bucks each
[2022-04-07T05:03:48] rosheee: Omg
[2022-04-07T05:05:45] Unknown: Actually, 1 post mount to IS 180F/160R adapter and 1 zero 11X adapter for Magura on 10+ with 160mm rotrs
[2022-04-07T05:06:26] Unknown: Zero 11x adapter is for the rear and 180F PM to IS adapter for the front
[2022-04-07T05:07:02] rosheee: Hmm kabooo then put vesc in until i made myself s plan
[2022-04-07T05:07:31] rosheee: Then buy new g30 and make kt perfect xD for daily with 16S6P where cables fit
[2022-04-07T05:08:45] Unknown: 👍👍 . I'm just saying 10+ is great chassis to upgrade and is semi affordable to initially buy. There are many many other options out there would be great as well. I don't think there is a perfect decision, just for what you want like and want to upgrade
[2022-04-07T05:10:00] rosheee: And tire change?
[2022-04-07T05:11:13] Unknown: PMT 10x3 E-Fire with CST 10x2.5 tubes. Split rim is super simple
[2022-04-07T05:11:50] rosheee: Yah like same with my motors
[2022-04-07T05:11:56] Unknown: Or.. CST 10x3 tubeless tires.. I've used CST and PMT, both are great but obviously PMT radials are better
[2022-04-07T05:11:57] rosheee: But have to take whole motor out
[2022-04-07T05:12:13] rosheee: So many cables xD
[2022-04-07T05:12:31] Unknown: Nope.. tire/tube change takes 3 minutes

[2022-04-07T05:15:33] Unknown: Oh man. Yea, not with Vsett. Even with stock motor wires hard wired to deck, tire slides off fixed rim side easy enough. No need to undo wiring. Using motor connectors (bullets for phase and Higo 6 pin for halls) just makes it even easier
[2022-04-07T05:16:34] Unknown: These are my motor connectors. 6mm bullets for phase and 6 pin for halls/temp sensor.
[2022-04-07T05:16:49] rosheee: The 6pin is iq300

[2022-04-08T20:12:08] Paolo ⁭: Not
[2022-04-08T20:12:14] Happy Giraffe: Seems bit longer
[2022-04-08T20:12:26] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-04-08T20:12:38] Happy Giraffe: Do you plan to make it waterproof?😳
[2022-04-08T20:12:40] Paolo ⁭: But much more heat dissipation 😂
[2022-04-08T20:12:50] Artem Bulashev: Dual?
[2022-04-08T20:12:53] Paolo ⁭: 👎
[2022-04-08T20:13:03] Paolo ⁭: Single , for high power
[2022-04-08T20:13:29] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2022-04-08T20:13:32] Artem Bulashev: 👍
[2022-04-08T20:13:48] Artem Bulashev: How wide ?
[2022-04-08T20:13:52] Artem Bulashev: 40mm?
[2022-04-08T20:14:18] Paolo ⁭: 60 xd
[2022-04-08T20:14:23] Artem Bulashev: I’m thinking such could fit side ways and still support 35a battery
[2022-04-08T20:14:39] Artem Bulashev: Without case? 60mm?
[2022-04-08T20:14:46] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-04-08T20:15:02] Artem Bulashev: Ok for high power that is great
[2022-04-08T20:15:11] Artem Bulashev: How high are we talking?
[2022-04-08T20:15:23] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt fit for xiaomi pro with battery inside (if its long)
[2022-04-08T20:15:28] Paolo ⁭: Can support 150A battery continuos on flat road
[2022-04-08T20:15:46] Paolo ⁭: (Fitting external with heatsink)
[2022-04-08T20:15:46] Artem Bulashev: Nuclear 12f competitor? 250a phase /100a battery? (Internally on metal deck)
[2022-04-08T20:16:08] Happy Giraffe: But need waterprooooof
[2022-04-08T20:16:42] Artem Bulashev: You don’t need high power if your motor is 1000w max.
[2022-04-08T20:16:45] Paolo ⁭: 150a can be also with metal deck. More or less the same because 12F , but can more power because more capacitor
[2022-04-08T20:17:03] Happy Giraffe: Then spintend shit is also enough
[2022-04-08T20:17:05] Paolo ⁭: Flipsky for giraffe
[2022-04-08T20:17:24] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-04-08T20:18:07] Happy Giraffe: Im thinking Mxus 3K turbo and 4T winding, should take 200A phase easy
[2022-04-08T20:19:44] Happy Giraffe: What is the phase wire awg in your vesc?
[2022-04-08T20:19:49] Happy Giraffe: 8?
[2022-04-08T20:31:24] Paolo ⁭: This is the last of problems lol
[2022-04-08T20:37:51] Happy Giraffe: I was making sure you are not turning into a pussy in the last meters
[2022-04-08T20:40:34] Paolo ⁭: This thing can be modified without complications lol. No need pcb rebuild
[2022-04-08T20:54:56] Unknown: Trampa vesc mk6, limited to 12s, i did 13s for a while but using brake was no option and voltages where checked live at all times haha
[2022-04-08T20:55:10] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-04-08T20:55:38] Happy Giraffe: Oh you had trampa, oof
[2022-04-08T20:55:58] Unknown: Can't wait 2 months tho :/ gonna have to use the original 250w motor from xiaomi and burn that little bitch till i have a better one 😆
[2022-04-08T20:56:18] Mirono escooters: Oh no
[2022-04-08T20:56:25] Mirono escooters: Préparé for slow shitty speed
[2022-04-08T20:56:42] Mirono escooters: Ill Donate you a 350w.👍

[2022-04-08T21:15:38] Luis Magalhaes: Sorry 😂
[2022-04-08T21:25:52] Mirono escooters: Aha that
[2022-04-08T21:27:28] Unknown: Yup, if it fits you i could also bring it over and pick up a motor? 🤔😆
[2022-04-08T21:27:42] Unknown: Untill i can get a new one,
[2022-04-08T21:28:02] Unknown: I was thinking to rewind it but magnets have overheated so many times

[2022-04-08T21:28:52] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2022-04-08T21:29:11] Mirono escooters: Just don't
[2022-04-08T21:30:37] sombre_enfant: Keep it as a rim
[2022-04-08T21:30:38] Unknown: Idd 😆
[2022-04-08T21:30:47] Unknown: Why
[2022-04-08T21:31:09] sombre_enfant: Remove the magnet winding just to have an axle and rim
[2022-04-08T21:50:26] Unknown: To do what with haha
[2022-04-08T21:58:15] Mirono escooters: Yeet to cops
[2022-04-08T22:00:56] Happy Giraffe: Then put a plexi side panel and leds
[2022-04-08T22:01:43] Happy Giraffe: Could cut small windows for those

[2022-04-09T01:18:36] Paolo ⁭: Looks an 40mm motor, if you want I have it
[2022-04-09T01:21:54] Unknown: What kind of motor? The outer rim is also damaged... and i'd like a high kv motor for sure
[2022-04-09T01:25:22] Paolo ⁭: What speed you can reach with that motor?
[2022-04-09T05:26:34] sombre_enfant: Do these value are right ? I seen 10k and 22k too
[2022-04-09T05:26:35] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_838@25-08-2021_19-02-38.jpg>
[2022-04-09T08:48:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no issue with those values
[2022-04-10T11:16:05] sombre_enfant: Do theres any esp32 or arduino project for vesc ?
[2022-04-10T11:48:33] Happy Giraffe: Koxx display
[2022-04-10T21:19:44] rosheee: Give display

[2022-04-11T02:04:05] Unknown: 😍 phenomenal man. I'm a huge fan of big oversized batteries
[2022-04-11T02:04:34] Unknown: Bigger the better. More capacity, more amps, less sag and stress
[2022-04-11T02:04:57] Unknown: Wtf controllers are those? They're sort of big 😂
[2022-04-11T02:06:27] Paolo ⁭: Kelly 7230
[2022-04-11T02:06:34] Unknown: External controllers and monster battery built with copper is the way of the future. Just need a monster go to controller to match
[2022-04-11T02:07:06] Unknown: Kelly 72 series... What is the max voltage/S count in those?
[2022-04-11T02:07:36] Paolo ⁭: 20s I think
[2022-04-11T02:07:37] Unknown: 72v 300a is 7230... I know that, but what is the max voltage? Is it 72v max or 72v nominal?
[2022-04-11T02:07:47] Unknown: Oh ok... That would be perfect
[2022-04-11T02:08:44] Paolo ⁭: It’s full rebuilded box lol, tig welded frame

[2022-04-11T14:30:47] Happy Giraffe: Is there any thread/info on how programmable are these? Just thinking ASI vs Vesc
[2022-04-11T14:49:17] Mirono escooters: How much power u nerd
[2022-04-11T14:49:19] Mirono escooters: Need
[2022-04-11T14:49:25] Mirono escooters: And i doubt those specs sometimrs
[2022-04-11T14:56:18] Happy Giraffe: 10,000w (peak) if I get the QS205
[2022-04-11T14:56:45] Happy Giraffe: If controller is over powered then no need to place it outside for cooling
[2022-04-11T14:57:47] Happy Giraffe: Mostly looking at the BAC 4000, 8000 is overkill
[2022-04-11T15:06:44] Happy Giraffe: But it's really weird that the seller has to install a motor profile for it to work... Like wtf
[2022-04-11T15:07:35] Mirono escooters: Clearly marketingbs
[2022-04-11T15:14:50] Happy Giraffe: Based on my research the sellers of ASI are rather scammer type anyways so I avoid
[2022-04-11T16:25:01] rosheee: Marketing
[2022-04-11T16:43:51] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, BearEbike gets all programming tools so easy for them to be happy
[2022-04-11T16:49:47] Valentin Holländer: Anyone have stl file for xiaomi battery spacer? :)
[2022-04-11T16:54:05] rosheee: Yes

[2022-04-12T17:01:42] Happy Giraffe: Wow, such scam is impressive. I think the similar charger might be a piece of junk
[2022-04-12T17:04:01] Mirono escooters: Yes, i asked for pictures
[2022-04-12T17:04:03] Mirono escooters: We Will see
[2022-04-12T17:04:15] Mirono escooters: They already " shipped it" so i Cant open dispute for 2 weeks
[2022-04-12T17:04:29] Mirono escooters: Months*
[2022-04-12T17:05:34] Mirono escooters: If the other. Charger Looks ok , i Will agree and still open dispute if it sucks
[2022-04-12T17:07:52] Mirono escooters: Listed unavaibkle now
[2022-04-12T17:16:46] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, hold your ground but maybe best to accept and then dispute because if you try to fuck with them now you can be left empty handed I think
[2022-04-12T17:17:49] Happy Giraffe: I told them my led light was like 70% of the advertised power and they gave me 6€ from dispute lol
[2022-04-12T17:18:46] Mirono escooters: Yes i Will play smort
[2022-04-12T17:18:47] Mirono escooters: Xd

[2022-04-12T18:58:32] Paolo ⁭: For avoid cost should be ordered as minimum 20/30 PCs
[2022-04-12T18:58:44] Paolo ⁭: I’m not factory :/
[2022-04-12T19:01:39] sombre_enfant: Flipsky store made their price up at 40€ you got a chance to be "competitive"
[2022-04-12T19:02:04] Mirono escooters: 40€ jezus
[2022-04-12T19:02:11] Paolo ⁭: They have mass production bro
[2022-04-12T19:02:25] Paolo ⁭: I do this only for unit that I sell
[2022-04-12T19:03:46] sombre_enfant: I understand dw
[2022-04-12T19:05:07] Paolo ⁭: It’s like if you produce a single case of spintend versus when they produce 1000 unit
[2022-04-12T19:05:12] Paolo ⁭: Price is a lot different

[2022-04-13T22:43:18] Happy Giraffe: BAC is gay, no support, no programming, you rely on seller retard to program your motor profile. I'm not even sure if you can limit the amps lol
[2022-04-13T22:43:48] Lechu: looks nice, but is misleading for ebike. needs pas (cadency/torq)
[2022-04-13T22:44:03] Mirono escooters: Yea agree
[2022-04-13T22:44:04] Happy Giraffe: Throttle ebike?
[2022-04-13T22:44:17] Happy Giraffe: I won't be pedaling on mine😂
[2022-04-13T22:46:27] Lechu: yes. but ride without pedaling on ebike are not natural, what do with legs ? in that case pedaling helps. but still you can use throttle
[2022-04-13T22:47:23] Happy Giraffe: I get wide and comfy pedals to rest my feet on😁 my 300w pedal power will be next to useless in 6000w+ setup
[2022-04-13T22:48:17] Happy Giraffe: To use throttle I gotta pay some small insurance, not sure how it is on other countries
[2022-04-13T22:50:04] Lechu: then how to ride on ebike?
[2022-04-13T22:50:37] Happy Giraffe: What do you mean?😳 Sit on in and press throttle
[2022-04-13T22:51:24] mat: Is flisky 75100 worth buying?
[2022-04-13T22:51:25] Unknown: Yup exactly. Not sure what the craze is and why they're so expensive. I know they're powerful but support and setting customization is shit
[2022-04-13T22:51:50] Luis Magalhaes: Here no one cares ... Yet 😂
[2022-04-13T22:51:56] Happy Giraffe: You have to buy also power button if your bms doen't have that
[2022-04-13T22:52:06] Happy Giraffe: Lucky
[2022-04-13T22:52:20] Luis Magalhaes: True 😁
[2022-04-13T22:52:31] Happy Giraffe: Also sellers are shady and do bad job programming sometimes
[2022-04-13T22:52:32] Lechu: yeah. but is too easy without pedaling ;)
[2022-04-13T22:53:02] Happy Giraffe: Sometimes you want easy, you can go ride 80kmh in trails then😂
[2022-04-13T22:53:28] sombre_enfant: Keep it on💪🏾
[2022-04-13T22:53:59] Happy Giraffe: Flipsky melts itself if kelp on for too long I think😂
[2022-04-13T22:54:17] Mirono escooters: It draws 2microamps so ur good
[2022-04-13T22:54:31] Mirono escooters: Just don't touch throttle accidental when it's in garage :)
[2022-04-13T22:54:51] Mirono escooters: My friend uses a switch for his throttle because he once fell off, gripped thé motorcycle like throttle and yea
[2022-04-13T22:58:12] Happy Giraffe: Yeah it's bad, half twist is the only ok one
[2022-04-13T22:58:38] Happy Giraffe: I kinda like the Xiaomi throttle so I will be keeping that😂
[2022-04-13T22:58:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i do
[2022-04-13T22:59:53] Lechu: are U using in the same time with BT module?
[2022-04-13T23:00:00] rosheee: They send me something idk if it is that
[2022-04-13T23:00:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. i can. no issue. and other boards on the same can bus. and even usb at the same time 🤣🤣
[2022-04-13T23:06:16] Lechu: ok. good to know. Today I received Single Ubox and there is less inputs than on Dual which also I have and I was worry

[2022-04-14T02:52:44] Mirono escooters: Nothih wrong with that
[2022-04-14T02:53:06] Mirono escooters: Mine is ziptied around a screw so it doesnt hit Brake disk G30 motor with monoshit adaptor. They smort design
[2022-04-14T02:54:07] Happy Giraffe: Why not ziptie it to fork side?
[2022-04-14T02:54:20] Mirono escooters: Too much work😂
[2022-04-14T02:54:28] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>

[2022-04-14T02:54:36] Mirono escooters: I have to clear cable
[2022-04-14T02:54:48] Mirono escooters: And ziptie ING to fork directly made it touch thé Brake disk
[2022-04-14T02:54:57] Mirono escooters: And yes that's super idea having a cable grind at 40kmh
[2022-04-14T02:55:18] Happy Giraffe: Very interesting, on blade motor not an issue
[2022-04-14T02:55:51] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-04-14T02:55:54] Mirono escooters: G30 with Brake adaptor
[2022-04-14T02:56:00] Mirono escooters: It's not made for it anyways xd
[2022-04-14T02:59:53] Happy Giraffe: Whatever you do better not have torn cables and shorted phases😂
[2022-04-14T03:00:05] Mirono escooters: Uhu eif rather not

[2022-04-14T04:33:32] Unknown: Just logged a few timed runs. From what I can see... 0-60khm 4.6 seconds 0-80khm 7.5 seconds Is that fast? It felt really fast 😝🤪

[2022-04-14T04:33:41] Mirono escooters: Good morning lol
[2022-04-14T04:34:01] Mirono escooters: For Paolo slow. For me fast. Especially if my topspeed is 45
[2022-04-14T04:35:56] Unknown: Logging started at 7200ms (raw data) 0-80kmh --- 14700 -7200 = 7.5 seconds 0-60kmh --- 11950 - 7200= 4.75 seconds
[2022-04-14T04:37:43] Unknown: I had to lean all of my weight forward to keep front wheel front spinning out. Felt very fast LoL. Not sure how one could go so much faster without losing control. Maybe 70mm rear motor pulling 20kw 🤷🏻‍♂️ Shit was fast.
[2022-04-14T04:37:55] Unknown: Vsett 10 motors are quite amazing. 10.7kw total and 196a phase on rear motor only (probably around 130a phase on front, total of around 325 phase amps) 😲... Can still go higher... Actually quite a bit higher, especially for speed runs
[2022-04-14T04:38:14] Unknown: Settings were... Rear 78a batt / 200a phase and Front 70a batt / 130a phase... 81v resting so 8v sag at 148a battery... Speed runs so motors only got up to around 130F, no sweat.
[2022-04-14T04:39:01] Unknown: Seriously, not sure how so much more power would even be manageable on a scooter
[2022-04-14T04:40:43] Mirono escooters: 196?? Damn
[2022-04-14T04:40:55] Unknown: Just on rear motor
[2022-04-14T04:41:06] Mirono escooters: Lol a scooter has a limit. E-bike can do more
[2022-04-14T04:41:07] Mirono escooters: Imo
[2022-04-14T04:41:17] Unknown: Absolutely agreed
