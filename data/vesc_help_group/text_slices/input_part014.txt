[2025-08-18T22:00:42] Marius: What He do
[2025-08-18T22:01:12] Smart Repair: more Spintend power üî•
[2025-08-18T22:03:09] Yamal: What are the best options other than Spintend? And why?
[2025-08-18T22:03:16] Yamal: I really want to know
[2025-08-18T22:03:21] Yamal: VESC world
[2025-08-18T22:05:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nothing
[2025-08-18T22:05:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: Just bought spintend and after 1000km boom
[2025-08-18T22:05:29] Franchesco Carofano: Foc
[2025-08-18T22:05:57] Yamal: Makers-x?
[2025-08-18T22:06:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: I bought now spintend because people keep saying that flipksy and makerbase sucked and from what I see now spintend is the same
[2025-08-18T22:06:03] Smart Repair: Preferably ones with TOLT FETs like the X12, only with a shunt and not a current transformer. I recently saw an ESC that's the same size as the 85150, but with TOLT. I'll see if I can find it again.
[2025-08-18T22:07:28] Yamal: but it seems that several users do not have them working fully I mean x12 also website now down
[2025-08-18T22:07:34] Yamal: Where to buy,,?
[2025-08-18T22:07:35] Smart Repair: In this case, the cause is not yet known. The 85150s are actually very robust and durable. The 85250 V1 has caused a lot of problems in the past. I'm curious to see if this has been resolved with the V2.
[2025-08-18T22:07:40] Yamal: Wich brand
[2025-08-18T22:07:44] Yamal: Interesting
[2025-08-18T22:08:49] Marius: X12 sexy
[2025-08-18T22:09:13] Marius: Paolo says He sells them
[2025-08-18T22:09:50] Smart Repair: On paper, the controller makes a good impression https://www.ennoid.me/esc/mk8-esc
[2025-08-18T22:10:21] Smart Repair: apart from the motor detection
[2025-08-18T22:10:35] Marius: Whats the issue there?
[2025-08-18T22:11:10] Smart Repair: the photos are from one of this group

[2025-08-18T22:12:19] Smart Repair: Almost everyone has problems with the automatic motor detection. I suspect it's the current transformer, which works very poorly with little load.
[2025-08-18T22:18:27] Smart Repair: If you replace the installed FETs with others you can operate the ESC up to 26s with 500A phase https://www.infineon.com/part/IPTC017N12NM6
[2025-08-18T22:19:08] Marius: Thats crazy
[2025-08-18T22:19:37] Marius: 1000a in dual üò≥
[2025-08-18T22:19:52] Smart Repair: same values as X12 24s only with shunts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2025-08-18T22:20:31] Marius: Is there anyone here who has dual x12?
[2025-08-18T22:20:50] Marius: I think u have x12 right but Single

[2025-08-18T22:25:38] Smart Repair: 70h and gt1 stock
[2025-08-18T22:28:39] Smart Repair: Does anyone here have experience with 3shul? The data doesn't look bad either.
[2025-08-18T22:53:56] Nobrrr: Hi, Can you please look dm I wrote you quite a while ago.
[2025-08-18T23:18:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: The problem is the lack of warranty they burn for no reason and no one is giving money back
[2025-08-18T23:19:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: I bought new 85150s
[2025-08-18T23:20:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is all stock with only 30a battery
[2025-08-18T23:20:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: I very nice
[2025-08-18T23:22:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: Let's seen when I have the 20s7p molicel battery what can I do with it I will use stock vsett motors so I hope it stays very stable and give me a lot of km
[2025-08-18T23:22:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: I did 2000km with pair of flipksy 75100 v1 box

[2025-08-19T00:02:25] Yamal: It's going to be nice to see a Dualtron working only with a VESC controller and everything else as standard. I've even considered the possibility of doing the same in the future. xD
[2025-08-19T00:07:11] Romain: üëç
[2025-08-19T00:07:53] Romain: Flip sky can't go at 96voltsüòû

[2025-08-19T00:15:25] LiquorHole .: I could use this controller for My scooter right now lol

[2025-08-19T00:18:04] Yamal: The true no need a powerfull VESC with your ‚Äústock battery ‚Äú and motors
[2025-08-19T00:18:25] Yamal: 100v/100A Alu lite Spintend ?
[2025-08-19T00:22:11] Yamal: I would love to try that controller.

[2025-08-19T00:28:43] LiquorHole .: Might as well run on The rims No tires
[2025-08-19T00:28:59] Marius: Yuh
[2025-08-19T00:29:02] Marius: Perfect
[2025-08-19T00:29:56] skrtt: Problem with storm is that the bat already takes all deck space
[2025-08-19T00:30:11] skrtt: So either extended deck or a box in the stem
[2025-08-19T00:30:47] skrtt: But i think dual cl350 would be cool to see on a storm. Maybe motors can handle peak bat power
[2025-08-19T00:31:30] Yamal: I forget yeah
[2025-08-19T00:31:33] Yamal: Cl

[2025-08-19T00:34:57] skrtt: 124v
[2025-08-19T00:35:00] LiquorHole .: Higher voltage at Roughly the same amp hours
[2025-08-19T00:35:17] LiquorHole .: 24s thats like a 88v battery if im not mistaken?
[2025-08-19T00:35:26] skrtt: Is it possible to fit 24s9p in thunder??

[2025-08-19T01:10:55] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-08-19T01:13:48] Yamal: A visit to Weped Cafe would change things! That's all they're missing
[2025-08-19T01:15:32] Yamal: By the way, what do you think if I put an Alulite on the G2 Max with everything as standard? Would it go over 25km/h or would it burn?
[2025-08-19T01:16:55] Yamal: 20A battery 20A phse
[2025-08-19T01:23:55] Noname: Yes faster
[2025-08-19T03:20:24] skrtt: X12 with case or only board?
[2025-08-19T03:37:47] haku: how much voltage and battery/phase can you push these?
[2025-08-19T03:41:00] haku: and how do you guys blow up fets. mine just dies. no char.
[2025-08-19T04:03:22] Noname: You can't even break things properly
[2025-08-19T04:09:45] haku: is your logic board still good?
[2025-08-19T04:09:49] haku: or cooked?
[2025-08-19T04:10:29] Noname: Yeah sure you want it
[2025-08-19T04:10:36] Jason: lol
[2025-08-19T04:10:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: How ?
[2025-08-19T04:10:54] Jason: I still can't figure out how to blow it up like that
[2025-08-19T04:10:55] haku: alcohol will clean that
[2025-08-19T04:11:24] Jason: I can also see blown gate drivers
[2025-08-19T04:11:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Probably over 20s or 20s with heavy field weakening
[2025-08-19T04:11:32] Jason: didnt he just
[2025-08-19T04:11:40] Jason: turn it on and push a bit
[2025-08-19T04:11:46] Noname: I turned on made motor noise idk Push outside hit throttle to move and it blows up
[2025-08-19T04:12:01] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-08-19T04:12:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: What motor?
[2025-08-19T04:12:31] Noname: Qs hub motor

[2025-08-19T04:13:23] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-08-19T04:13:51] Noname: O had bumped the phase amps up a tiny bit and he fixed my throttle issue. I pressed next instead of save lol
[2025-08-19T04:13:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: For heavy motors you need lower possible inductance, spintend has only 5 small caps ant it's not suitable for these application
[2025-08-19T04:14:13] Jason: teeeeny tiny
[2025-08-19T04:14:15] Noname: It was working for probably a few thousand miles
[2025-08-19T04:14:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: That's why all emoto controllers has like 50 capacitors hehe
[2025-08-19T04:14:31] Jason: and huge
[2025-08-19T04:14:32] haku: noob
[2025-08-19T04:15:00] Noname: I have space just what to use?
[2025-08-19T04:15:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just get a VESC made for heavy application or just get a fardriver
[2025-08-19T04:15:22] haku: you already ascended dont dwell on it.
[2025-08-19T04:15:29] Noname: <photos/photo_25336@17-08-2025_02-58-22.jpg>

[2025-08-19T23:53:03] LiquorHole .: Alright üëçüèæ good to know I still wasnt 100% sure
[2025-08-19T23:57:41] LiquorHole .: This your scooter right? What size rotors your running and it‚Äôs also 4 piston right?
[2025-08-19T23:58:53] haku: yes. this mine. tbh i dont know the rotor but the brakes are 4piston china
[2025-08-19T23:59:08] haku: dot fluid though
[2025-08-19T23:59:33] LiquorHole .: Dot, They have a Motor cutoff Sensor?
[2025-08-19T23:59:42] LiquorHole .: Might buy those over the Mt7e
[2025-08-20T00:00:01] haku: dot 4or5 fluid not mineral oil.
[2025-08-20T00:00:32] Yamal: Nice photo
[2025-08-20T00:00:40] Yamal: Look Africa
[2025-08-20T00:00:43] Yamal: Tree
[2025-08-20T00:00:54] skrtt: We need this haku
[2025-08-20T00:01:35] skrtt: Not mini bmx haku
[2025-08-20T00:01:36] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-08-20T00:01:41] LiquorHole .: Just was wondering the rotor size cause i was going down to 180mm and i need to know if it will have clearance for the 4 piston brakes and the rotor with those tires since we have the EXACT same tires
[2025-08-20T00:01:43] haku: that haku is scared to get impounded. the new haku rides this.
[2025-08-20T00:02:34] haku: i see ill look it up when i get home. it might be 160
[2025-08-20T00:04:09] skrtt: Disk size depends on rim size or tire size? @PaoloWu
[2025-08-20T00:05:05] haku: LiquorHole just go for magura. its proven
[2025-08-20T00:06:20] Jason: oh
[2025-08-20T00:06:27] Jason: thats interesting
[2025-08-20T00:08:37] Noname: My friend just got his Molo 5 today
[2025-08-20T00:09:34] LiquorHole .: Alright i was just looking at the hayes dominion A4 üòÇ
[2025-08-20T00:10:02] LiquorHole .: The only difference between the two from what I‚Äôve just researched is the A4 has Slightly smaller piston but dot 5
[2025-08-20T00:10:40] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-08-20T00:10:41] skrtt: Molo 5?
[2025-08-20T00:10:55] Noname: Wepoor
[2025-08-20T00:10:59] skrtt: Get mt5
[2025-08-20T00:11:11] skrtt: Change levers and u good to go
[2025-08-20T00:25:40] LiquorHole .: Wepoor is a rebrand
[2025-08-20T00:26:19] LiquorHole .: Geofought,flj,wepoor and I think Some other brand uses the Molo 5 frame which Comes from Yishuncheye
[2025-08-20T00:26:24] Noname: My friend got one of those minibike things Haku has
[2025-08-20T00:26:28] Noname: Whatever the name
[2025-08-20T00:26:52] LiquorHole .: It‚Äôs a frame i was tempted into building on
[2025-08-20T00:27:23] LiquorHole .: Idk if the entirety of their line up is a clone or rebrand But that Specific frame is a rebrand Or clone Of the Yishuncheye molo 5
[2025-08-20T00:28:12] Noname: No prize for being overly specific on the name
[2025-08-20T00:29:00] LiquorHole .: I wonder if someone can put extended rear swing arms On it and turn it into a Literal Mini Bike lol
[2025-08-20T00:29:20] LiquorHole .: Extended rear swing arms and Longer forks, slap on some qs motors üòÇ
[2025-08-20T00:33:53] LiquorHole .: I was actually gonna get the Mt7, not a Major difference in performance
[2025-08-20T00:34:47] haku: soon. gathering resources haha
[2025-08-20T00:36:05] haku: thats my brand haha. on these these frames
[2025-08-20T00:38:52] haku: i know ahaha

[2025-08-20T06:18:45] Yamal: Very cheap
[2025-08-20T06:50:52] Noname: Problem with rear motor. Idk how much these cost?
[2025-08-20T06:53:37] Yamal: 11‚Äù 60h 17/4
[2025-08-20T06:55:19] Yamal: I give for free one ,last year? Can‚Äôt remember ,,
[2025-08-20T06:58:21] Yamal: But that price is what a second-hand chassis is worth here in Spain, without swingarms and nothing else
[2025-08-20T06:59:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Wow they have also tolt fet
[2025-08-20T07:12:57] Arnau Martinez Casals: Hii

[2025-08-20T08:34:59] Amel Hodzic: actually before the 125 run i found out witth gps app that my speed was acurate at low speeds but now at high speeds. if it said 102 on vesc in gps it said 111 and i tried to go 111 on vesc and then on gps it said 122. and then i fixed it but before all of that then i went 119 on vesc but i didnt have gps open so i might have gone 130 kmh without knowing it.
[2025-08-20T08:35:24] Amel Hodzic: and then a few days later it was acurate and i went 125 on gps
[2025-08-20T08:37:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Send screenshots
[2025-08-20T08:37:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway is contrary , gps gets more accurate at higher speed
[2025-08-20T08:47:57] Amel Hodzic: i dont have screenshots i have the recording tho. i was doing like 17 kW if i remember correctly and im featherweight so i dont need that much power
[2025-08-20T08:49:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Send the recording
[2025-08-20T08:50:24] Amel Hodzic: i will when im home from school
[2025-08-20T08:51:18] Amel Hodzic: i didnt even record the 125 run because it came really like unexpected i just wanted to full throttle and before i knew i was going 125
[2025-08-20T09:12:56] Dualtron Achilleus: I ¬¥m now blind after lokking at this scooter
[2025-08-20T09:28:29] Yamal: I'm not a fan of so many LEDs on e-scooters, to be honest. The only good thing is that you can be seen well at night
[2025-08-20T09:30:06] Yamal: But the thing for e-scooters, especially large ones in the EU, is that they don't attract much attention ^^'
[2025-08-20T09:30:23] Yamal: Police in helicopter
[2025-08-20T09:33:11] Nobrrr: Helmet? Brakes? Cooling?
[2025-08-20T09:58:29] Amel Hodzic: Bike helmet. Ebrake only and Alu plate only as cooling
[2025-08-20T10:34:06] Marius: thats the sigma mindset we need
[2025-08-20T10:34:26] Marius: just pure balls to walls no announcing and then pussing out

[2025-08-20T14:57:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Does 6.06 have auto wheelie?
[2025-08-20T14:59:11] Unknown: what is this logoüò≠

[2025-08-20T17:06:42] Jason: a BMS
[2025-08-20T17:06:46] Jason: WITH A CAPACITOR
[2025-08-20T17:07:12] Jason: whaaaaaaa
[2025-08-20T17:12:34] Jason: then there should be like 32 capacitors
[2025-08-20T17:12:35] Jason: isn't it
[2025-08-20T17:12:53] Jason: thats what I've seen in chinese ones
[2025-08-20T17:12:58] Jason: hmm
[2025-08-20T17:13:01] Jason: interesting
[2025-08-20T17:13:14] Jason: idon have any pics of it sadly
[2025-08-20T17:13:59] Jason: lol
[2025-08-20T17:14:11] Jason: repeat that few thousand times in a second
[2025-08-20T17:14:14] Jason: > balance
[2025-08-20T17:14:22] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-08-20T17:14:49] Jason: man its gonna be very fun if multiple fets get triggered at the same time
[2025-08-20T17:15:43] Jason: but yeah im quite interested what chip the new vesc bms will use
[2025-08-20T17:16:12] 'lekrsu': O.o vedder website
[2025-08-20T17:18:43] 'lekrsu': Weak specs for 400‚Ç¨ (/2 per motor.. xd)
[2025-08-20T17:18:52] Jason: yeah
[2025-08-20T17:18:58] Jason: quite expensive
[2025-08-20T17:19:33] 'lekrsu': I'mma ride to Vedder on VESC & skip the postal
[2025-08-20T17:19:43] Jason: lol
[2025-08-20T17:19:53] Noname: Well its still annoying I didnt make it 32s and now we have nice Vesc for it
[2025-08-20T17:20:27] Jason: now i can say I had 30s before nice vesc for 30s
[2025-08-20T17:20:36] 'lekrsu': Need 40S VESCs

[2025-08-20T17:20:58] Jason: go faster
[2025-08-20T17:21:25] 'lekrsu': You have two banks of the 35E in identical configs, in parallel?
[2025-08-20T17:21:36] Jason: 40s however, high phase amps are quite hard as there aren't cheap and strong fets
[2025-08-20T17:21:50] Jason: should I just put 2x 20s bms
[2025-08-20T17:21:59] Jason: so tempting but I dont wanna
[2025-08-20T17:22:09] Jason: its jank
[2025-08-20T17:22:16] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-08-20T17:22:42] 'lekrsu': Love not covering caps though. So they can vent.
[2025-08-20T17:22:52] Jason: yeah
[2025-08-20T17:23:00] Jason: vent into outside, not inside heh
[2025-08-20T17:23:11] Jason: no cap juice(or less) inside
[2025-08-20T17:23:35] 'lekrsu': It's not included.
[2025-08-20T17:23:47] 'lekrsu': 530‚Ç¨ for the weak dual controller
[2025-08-20T17:23:57] Jason: I gotta pay a tax
[2025-08-20T17:24:13] Jason: for the parts I imported
[2025-08-20T17:24:15] Jason: aaaaa
[2025-08-20T17:24:24] Jason: gotta find a way how
[2025-08-20T17:25:22] 'lekrsu': https://usercontent.one/wp/www.vesclabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/vesc_duet_datasheet.pdf?media=1755682693
[2025-08-20T17:25:43] 'lekrsu': Love the docs though
[2025-08-20T17:26:01] 'lekrsu': Peak 100V input and 150A phase output.
[2025-08-20T17:26:17] Jason: mm

[2025-08-20T17:29:47] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-08-20T17:33:31] 'lekrsu': Well basically 100100?
[2025-08-20T17:33:34] Jason: thaaats questionable
[2025-08-20T17:33:46] Jason: does stm32f405 have enough peripherals even
[2025-08-20T17:34:15] Jason: dam
[2025-08-20T17:34:19] 'lekrsu': How?
[2025-08-20T17:40:28] 'lekrsu': You're probably right about that

[2025-08-20T18:04:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Where did they say that? I didn't see in the datasheet
[2025-08-20T18:14:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: They probably don't use f405 but variant with more peripheral
[2025-08-20T18:14:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway a company with less than 50 employee I have many doubts

[2025-08-21T08:59:07] Yamal: I also think that 600A is not a crazy amount of amps
[2025-08-21T08:59:31] Yamal: Why not ?
[2025-08-21T08:59:41] Yamal: In the end is like 1 battery right
[2025-08-21T09:03:41] Dualtron Achilleus: // isnt about additional s
[2025-08-21T09:03:54] Dualtron Achilleus: It s about additional AH
[2025-08-21T09:04:34] Dualtron Achilleus: If you want 40s its series connection not parallel
[2025-08-21T09:04:50] Dualtron Achilleus: No limit!only voltage limit
[2025-08-21T09:05:08] Dualtron Achilleus: Can have 20s 600ah it will work
[2025-08-21T09:10:00] Yamal: 600ah 50pl
[2025-08-21T09:12:47] Arnau Martinez Casals: I dont wanna damage anything with bad connections, thats why i ask
[2025-08-21T09:13:22] Arnau Martinez Casals: I buyed to try, i will use it with 85150
[2025-08-21T09:15:34] Arnau Martinez Casals: Dt spider 2 stock battery 60v 30ah dual 50h now on single cause one motor is burned
[2025-08-21T09:15:37] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its for this one
[2025-08-21T09:21:37] Yamal: Arnau, you're doing a great job in the northern part of the peninsula. You're literally transforming a bunch of standard e-scooters into vesc scooters. This is great

[2025-08-21T09:23:38] Yamal: XD
[2025-08-21T09:48:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: But, if one motor burned with dual, is it a good idea to put it in single (if you use the same motor) ?
[2025-08-21T09:49:54] Arnau Martinez Casals: I Burned on single
[2025-08-21T09:50:18] Arnau Martinez Casals: Without temp sens at 110 phase riding hard +30km‚Ä¶
[2025-08-21T09:59:24] Arnau Martinez Casals: Last log before burn
[2025-08-21T09:59:45] Arnau Martinez Casals: 60v single motor 50h
[2025-08-21T10:00:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: Okay
[2025-08-21T10:26:50] Yamal: What do you think about the Achilleus Limited, Max Battery, what can be done or with the standard battery, what space would there be for small vesc?
[2025-08-21T10:28:42] Yamal: I think come with 16s7p (60v/35ah)

[2025-08-21T10:35:40] Yamal: I mean, with the drawer it comes with, the dimensions of which I don't know, if it would be possible to fit a higher voltage battery + controllers
[2025-08-21T10:36:13] Yamal: It's fine as a Daly legal scooter project.
[2025-08-21T10:36:48] Yamal: I even like the traditional suspension more than the new one on the DT Thunder 3.

[2025-08-21T11:17:31] Dualtron Achilleus: You can fit somethink like 22s9p but controlor outside
[2025-08-21T11:21:08] Yamal: The issue is being able to put the controllers inside so that they are more protected, in the end it is the best, perhaps with less voltage and smaller controllers, in the same case, thanks machine
[2025-08-21T11:26:34] Rose: Hey there Christian, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-08-21T11:32:43] Dualtron Achilleus: You want to stay stock motor also?
[2025-08-21T11:35:44] Yamal: For the moment it would be all stock except the electronics, to later finish assembling the motors and the high-discharge battery
[2025-08-21T11:43:17] Yamal: 8p 50pl 500A battery =36kw escooter nice
[2025-08-21T11:46:25] Yamal: Amazing nominal Big Poppa
[2025-08-21T11:56:13] Yamal: I have two options for a future e-scooter, just like the Vesc scooter: 1. Orient it towards the track with maximum power/components and power. 2. Orient it towards a road scooter with a large battery (even an extra battery)
[2025-08-21T11:58:52] Yamal: The g2Max project is a separate story with a fixed date that will arrive sooner or later

[2025-08-21T16:55:10] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: you can see it yourself

[2025-08-21T16:59:55] Nobrrr: It doesn‚Äôt give me a reason why the logo was removed.
[2025-08-21T17:00:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but the cell is the same, no difference on performance
[2025-08-21T17:00:26] Nobrrr: Are there 50PL cells where it says eve 50Pl?
[2025-08-21T17:00:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nope
[2025-08-21T17:00:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is a question about responsibility
[2025-08-21T17:00:46] Nobrrr: Thanks
[2025-08-21T17:01:24] Dualtron Achilleus: ¬´ This is a EVE 50PL with customized logo for a client. The client did not pickup this cell and EVE removed the logo and sold them. So check the picture, they don't look like other EVE 50PL and you an see the logo has been removed. ¬ª
[2025-08-21T17:01:49] Nobrrr: But sure that they are A grade?
[2025-08-21T17:02:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's also a question about image authorization, probably eve don't want to sell the cells to end customer so the reseller remove the logo
[2025-08-21T17:02:24] Dualtron Achilleus: Nkon say when is lower grade most of the time no
[2025-08-21T17:02:30] Nobrrr: How to even remove it?
[2025-08-21T17:02:35] Dualtron Achilleus: We can expect this to be grade A
[2025-08-21T17:02:53] Dualtron Achilleus: Before printing
[2025-08-21T17:03:06] Nobrrr: Alright thanks
[2025-08-21T17:03:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don't know but in china all battery pack are sold with insurances, because many batteries caught fire in the past in the battery industry
[2025-08-21T17:03:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: So now the government is very serious about batteries
[2025-08-21T17:03:58] Nobrrr: It somehow makes the cell even better because industrial products have to be very reliable, right?
[2025-08-21T17:04:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Probably the guy don't has bms
[2025-08-21T17:04:32] Nobrrr: Unlike consumer products
[2025-08-21T17:05:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mhh not consumer cells are with higher standards, in the fact on all super high discharge cells they print "fire hazard! Not for vape!"

[2025-08-21T17:19:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: BMS maybe not mandatory but fuse is the minimum
[2025-08-21T17:25:36] Massimo: Is there a performance difference between the first series 75100 and the 75200 Pro v2?I know about the overheating problem on the 75100, but what about the rest? (20s4p LG m50lt battery)
[2025-08-21T17:35:33] Smart Repair: In this case a fuse in the + line would not have provided protection.

[2025-08-22T06:07:07] Yamal: The same thing happened to you as a coworker I had, it seems to me
[2025-08-22T06:08:42] Yamal: He bought a Dualtron Eagle, and shortly after he was fined for going on an interurban highway. He felt so bad about it that he took and sold the e-scooter and that's the end of the movie. The good thing is that you have continued with other projects
[2025-08-22T06:10:30] haku: nah im not selling wepoor though. im still deciding the best vesc for it thats affordable.
[2025-08-22T06:11:02] haku: i will just ride it somedays. maybe fall it will be running when it cools down
[2025-08-22T06:12:41] haku: also when i know i can go fast i have no control. always have the urge to hop on the highway

[2025-08-22T06:15:13] LiquorHole .: More
[2025-08-22T06:15:35] haku: maybe red 12fet will make a difference mounted correctly this time
[2025-08-22T06:15:47] LiquorHole .: It aint enough till is enough üíØ
[2025-08-22T06:15:48] Yamal: Don‚Äôt know how ubox work with 220/230A

[2025-08-22T07:07:12] skrtt: Is cheaper to buy those parts (new) than to buy thunder3
[2025-08-22T07:09:03] Yamal: Likewise, until the nami is sold, there is nothing to do, unless there is a stroke of luck
[2025-08-22T07:09:26] Yamal: It only remains to check how things are going
[2025-08-22T07:09:26] skrtt: Victor dgt 2k Thunder 3dgt 4,4k Thunder pieces ‚âà500
[2025-08-22T07:09:45] skrtt: Time will tell
[2025-08-22T07:09:48] Yamal: Thunder DGT 3890
[2025-08-22T07:09:58] Yamal: Inmoblue..
[2025-08-22T07:10:01] skrtt: I saw both in myurbanscoot
[2025-08-22T07:10:42] skrtt: Even the stem on normal victor is better than the new ltd stem
[2025-08-22T07:17:55] LiquorHole .: Would 700a phase current be over the top for 21kw
[2025-08-22T07:18:39] skrtt: 350x2?
[2025-08-22T07:18:55] Yamal: True you can fit some nice stem
[2025-08-22T07:19:16] Yamal: Also old suspension I like more than the new on thunder 3
[2025-08-22T07:21:20] skrtt: No benefits on thunder 3 apart from 2 more screws on the neck
[2025-08-22T07:41:10] LiquorHole .: Yeah
[2025-08-22T07:41:36] skrtt: If your motor can handle i dont think its a problem
[2025-08-22T07:45:44] LiquorHole .: That‚Äôs not the problem ive seen people push the lonnyo motors way harder then what im doing, Im talking about in like torque and acceleration
[2025-08-22T07:46:04] LiquorHole .: Since you already know my scooter isnt anywhere near as small as Everyone here lol
[2025-08-22T07:56:02] LiquorHole .: Ik i can turn TSC on but I wonder if it would just be constant and instant wheel spin
[2025-08-22T07:56:16] LiquorHole .: Or something Fun if i can control it
[2025-08-22T08:00:12] Dualtron Achilleus: Lul what
[2025-08-22T08:37:13] Yamal: I still thinking,, I remember that before installing the motors and the stem it was around 50kg and the truth is that it surprised me a little too
[2025-08-22T08:43:04] Yamal: By the way, what differences do you see between your 90 and 100 h engines ?
[2025-08-22T08:44:48] Yamal: Do 22s7p fit in your long box for Victor? I don't remember if I asked you.
[2025-08-22T08:45:42] Yamal: It wouldn't be bad to have a full RM kit for a future legal project, titled "Catch Me If You Can"
[2025-08-22T08:45:49] Yamal: :)
[2025-08-22T08:46:54] Yamal: Monaco project
[2025-08-22T08:48:26] Yamal: 160km/h on a scooter, wanted! $10,000 reward

[2025-08-22T09:18:21] Yamal: 20s10p Samsung 40t Ubox85250//85240 80h33/2
[2025-08-22T09:18:37] Yamal: 200A battery 300 A phase
[2025-08-22T09:18:41] Yamal: Finish xD
[2025-08-22T09:19:44] Amel Hodzic: daaamn
[2025-08-22T09:23:23] Dualtron Achilleus: 0-100 6 6,5sec that really good!
[2025-08-22T09:24:38] Dualtron Achilleus: Considering you only pushing 300phase and you can go to 350 easy
[2025-08-22T09:29:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Standing up after that crash is insane lol
[2025-08-22T09:31:08] Dualtron Achilleus: That‚Äôs a french guys
[2025-08-22T09:31:48] Dualtron Achilleus: We stole him the weeped in the video in the early of this year
[2025-08-22T10:23:44] IMWurden: guys, can someone suggest me a good vesc controller with 200A battery current? my budget Is 200-250 euro
[2025-08-22T10:25:38] Lieven L.: https://spintend.com/collections/esc-based-on-vesc/products/single-ubox-aluminum-controller-85v-240a-controller-based-on-vesc
[2025-08-22T10:26:03] IMWurden: he had a lot of protection gear. but its still surprising
[2025-08-22T10:26:13] IMWurden: thanks you a lot
[2025-08-22T10:26:19] IMWurden: my makerbase instantly burned
[2025-08-22T10:26:24] IMWurden: i Need a new One
[2025-08-22T10:26:58] Lieven L.: UBOX will do better
[2025-08-22T10:29:57] IMWurden: average Life span of a spintend or ubox? staying in the limits of amps and voltage of the controller unit obv
[2025-08-22T10:31:03] Lieven L.: Should run forever if cooled properly.
[2025-08-22T10:33:52] IMWurden: oh ok, can you send me and equivalent ubox controller unit of the spintend 85240?
[2025-08-22T10:35:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: 21S7P
[2025-08-22T10:36:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: Full RM kit for Nami coming soon with something unexpected
[2025-08-22T10:38:17] Lieven L.: there isn't anything similar compared to price performance. You can try tronic, flipsky or makerbase but Spintend Ubox is the way to go for most people.
[2025-08-22T10:39:06] IMWurden: flipsky and makerbase are the worst for quality control, one unit can last 1 year and other can last less than a day (like mine)
[2025-08-22T10:42:26] Lieven L.: Yeah i know. Some people run 3shul ESCs but they are far from cheap an overkill for small applications
[2025-08-22T10:43:49] Lieven L.: https://3shulmotors.com/product/c350-v4-electric-vehicle-controller/
[2025-08-22T10:44:20] LiquorHole .: Any known problems with the 250a v2 controller
[2025-08-22T10:45:00] IMWurden: that's far too much from my budget

[2025-08-23T01:22:19] Marius: its sad these escs are really too weak for the motors
[2025-08-23T01:22:23] Yamal: 400x400 xD
[2025-08-23T01:22:24] Marius: ideally id want 400a+
[2025-08-23T01:22:27] Marius: per motor
[2025-08-23T01:22:42] Yamal: Problem your wires right
[2025-08-23T01:22:47] Yamal: Motor wires
[2025-08-23T01:22:50] Marius: yeah that too
[2025-08-23T01:22:54] LiquorHole .: Sounds like i can do 400a total or each
[2025-08-23T01:22:56] Marius: but i suppose for short peaks it would be fine
[2025-08-23T01:23:08] Marius: wym
[2025-08-23T01:23:18] Marius: 5.3mm2 i think
[2025-08-23T01:23:20] Marius: 10awg
[2025-08-23T01:23:24] LiquorHole .: Like 400 per motor
[2025-08-23T01:24:01] Marius: would be cool but yeah the 85250 isnt safe to go close to 400 i think
[2025-08-23T01:24:12] LiquorHole .: Cause im doing similar amount of phase current but im trying to learn about how much would be to much
[2025-08-23T01:24:16] Yamal: If you do 400 battery go straight 28kw
[2025-08-23T01:24:18] LiquorHole .: The v2??
[2025-08-23T01:24:29] Marius: both i think
[2025-08-23T01:24:34] Marius: i cant imagine 400a is safe for them
[2025-08-23T01:24:34] LiquorHole .: Damn
[2025-08-23T01:24:52] Marius: rn i just have 300a abs max since its my firs time driving
[2025-08-23T01:25:16] Marius: and front 250a absmax
[2025-08-23T01:25:25] LiquorHole .: Is completely fine? Temps from control and motors
[2025-08-23T01:25:38] Marius: 40c but i dont have thermal paste lol its just testing rn
[2025-08-23T01:25:59] Yamal: You go straight 150kmh
[2025-08-23T01:26:01] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-08-23T01:26:12] LiquorHole .: 40c without thermal paste sounds solid Ish
[2025-08-23T01:26:27] Marius: what temps are fine for esc?
[2025-08-23T01:26:34] Marius: ig 40 is about the max u wanna go?
[2025-08-23T01:26:36] Marius: or 50? idk
[2025-08-23T01:27:07] Yamal: For me less 45
[2025-08-23T01:27:12] LiquorHole .: Id imagine 45c should be the max and only for a short time really
[2025-08-23T01:27:25] Marius: oh damn i really need thermal paste soon then lol
[2025-08-23T01:27:57] LiquorHole .: Motor temps also imo shouldnt be 55c 60C would be my Absolute limit before dialing stuff down
[2025-08-23T01:28:13] Marius: nah im sure they can do way more
[2025-08-23T01:28:21] Marius: at 60c u cant drive for more than 2min
[2025-08-23T01:28:22] LiquorHole .: Could
[2025-08-23T01:28:28] Jason: 100c+
[2025-08-23T01:28:43] Jason: imho 130c is stopping point
[2025-08-23T01:28:47] Marius: i already hit 60 on my first drive
[2025-08-23T01:28:54] Jason: 100c temp limit start 130c stop

[2025-08-23T01:29:48] Jason: its done
[2025-08-23T01:29:49] LiquorHole .: I never understood what the stator is anyway is that just the Covers of the motors or something?
[2025-08-23T01:29:58] Marius: stator is the part that doenst move
[2025-08-23T01:30:00] Jason: the not spinning coil part

[2025-08-23T07:55:53] Yamal: Eggs project :)
[2025-08-23T07:57:38] haku: dam i want to go out on a midnight ride for the first time. so nice out. bit my shit still flat
[2025-08-23T07:58:52] haku: yams question since your a farmer and all. hey do i need a male rooster to get chickens to lay eggs?
[2025-08-23T08:01:49] Yamal: but you found the puncture just came unstuck?
[2025-08-23T08:02:07] haku: no need to change valve stem
[2025-08-23T08:02:13] Yamal: No need
[2025-08-23T08:02:51] haku: you just artificialy inseminate the chickens?
[2025-08-23T08:03:00] Yamal: The hen lays eggs by nature, if you want to get chicks you need a rooster
[2025-08-23T08:03:12] haku: oh i see.
[2025-08-23T08:03:24] Yamal: I'm not a farmer xD
[2025-08-23T08:03:45] haku: i might be able to keep em as pets then. roosters are the noisy ones yea?
[2025-08-23T08:03:57] haku: kw farmer yes
[2025-08-23T08:04:54] Yamal: No
[2025-08-23T08:05:16] Yamal: I just have chicken for get eggs
[2025-08-23T08:05:34] haku: yea. good investment. free egggs
[2025-08-23T08:05:48] haku: lifetime supply
[2025-08-23T08:07:57] haku: organic eggs here cost so much
[2025-08-23T08:08:13] haku: a dozen for $12-15
[2025-08-23T08:08:41] LiquorHole .: Where can i buy that multifunction switch or something like it just incase the dualtron switch pod dont work
[2025-08-23T08:09:24] haku: looks custom
[2025-08-23T08:09:45] haku: maybe ali
[2025-08-23T08:11:38] LiquorHole .: Found something similar but only had 2-3 switches
[2025-08-23T08:26:20] Yamal: Nice picture
[2025-08-23T08:44:26] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: <photos/photo_25535@23-08-2025_08-44-26.jpg>
[2025-08-23T08:44:57] LiquorHole .: You so close to 40kw might as well go all in
[2025-08-23T08:45:58] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Not many days ago we reached 39,700
[2025-08-23T08:46:55] LiquorHole .: Might as well round it up and say you have a 40kw scooter fr
[2025-08-23T08:50:57] Yamal: And when he puts bombadil on the rear engine it will be a beautiful thing to see
[2025-08-23T08:55:19] Yamal: That P45B battery is a treasure to me
[2025-08-23T08:55:20] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: My motorcycle has 58 hp and the scooter has 54 hp.
[2025-08-23T08:56:25] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Whenever you want, we can change the scooter for a few days.
[2025-08-23T08:56:40] LiquorHole .: Make it have 60hp üòè
[2025-08-23T09:01:23] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: when we put the engine to 100h we will see what data we have
[2025-08-23T09:04:39] Yamal: you have to squeeze those 18fet per controller
[2025-08-23T09:05:55] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: One day it will explode, you've seen the temperature it reaches.
[2025-08-23T09:07:57] Yamal: The only thing is that G300 is the dissipation solution, but on the other hand, Ambrosini and other people are using it, and whether some like it more or others less, they are winning races
[2025-08-23T09:08:55] LiquorHole .: Them motors probably won‚Äôt even touch 90C üòè
[2025-08-23T09:11:21] Yamal: Now Vesclabs controllers are the next goal
[2025-08-23T09:13:29] Yamal: Even the vesc labs Due catch my attention
[2025-08-23T09:13:37] Yamal: Vedder controller ü§©
[2025-08-23T09:14:59] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-08-23T09:15:09] Yamal: For Daly e-scooter
[2025-08-23T09:16:30] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: The rear engine reaches a temperature that you can't put your hand on it or you're left with only the bone in your fingers. I use traction control at 6000 rpm. Now I've raised it to 10000 rpm. It seems to heat up a little less.
[2025-08-23T09:17:07] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Fron
[2025-08-23T09:39:29] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: <photos/photo_25538@23-08-2025_09-39-29.jpg>
[2025-08-23T09:39:32] Rose: Hey there Marcelo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-23T10:17:10] LiquorHole .: Your using field weakening or your talking about Erpm
[2025-08-23T10:17:44] LiquorHole .: Idk it was a post i saw.
[2025-08-23T10:24:49] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Rpm
[2025-08-23T10:25:09] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: fw I don't use it, I stopped using it
[2025-08-23T10:25:36] LiquorHole .: Damn
[2025-08-23T10:35:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: You guys must remember that max power shown in this tab is a power never reached, it's like a microsecond peak read by VESC without filtering
[2025-08-23T10:35:46] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah only spike
[2025-08-23T10:35:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because they have great drivers honestly
[2025-08-23T10:36:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: Stormcore redesign by Jeffrey Friesen
[2025-08-23T10:37:00] LiquorHole .: Oh is their any way to fix that or No
[2025-08-23T10:38:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not really
[2025-08-23T10:38:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: We have a filter in our SmartDisplay logs
[2025-08-23T10:38:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've reached 45KW with SmartDisplay and 55KW in vesc tool tabs üòÇ
[2025-08-23T10:39:13] LiquorHole .: Making me want it more and more now üòÇ
[2025-08-23T10:41:21] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: If the power doesn't exist, it wouldn't appear on any screen, don't you think?
[2025-08-23T10:42:12] Yamal: How can we know the real power of our e-scooter?
[2025-08-23T10:42:13] 'lekrsu': https://youtu.be/nPHGasrtigA
[2025-08-23T10:42:31] 'lekrsu': New Vedder video out üëÄ
[2025-08-23T10:43:09] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: When it does not exist, there would be no peaks or constants.
[2025-08-23T10:43:32] Yamal: Time to write
[2025-08-23T10:45:07] Yamal: Infineon tolt mosfet?
[2025-08-23T10:46:37] LiquorHole .: The funny thing is rn im genuinely trying to understand how to make rgb lights work with the controller
[2025-08-23T10:46:45] LiquorHole .: Idk why im finding it hard to understand
[2025-08-23T10:49:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: The power displayed in VESC RT Data should not be taken as a perfectly real value, since it is calculated from battery current and voltage. Battery current itself is derived from phase current and duty cycle, which are highly variable and noisy signals. Because this calculation is performed with virtually no filtering, even a very brief fluctuation‚Äîon the order of a few milliseconds‚Äîcan generate an artificial power spike. This results in values that may look impressive but were never actually sustained by the system. To get an accurate picture of the power truly delivered, these quantities must be smoothed or filtered over a certain duration (tens to hundreds of milliseconds), because only over such timescales do the battery, wiring, and motor really ‚Äúsee‚Äù and absorb the energy.
[2025-08-23T10:49:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: It needs a filtering of 100/300ms at least
[2025-08-23T10:52:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Stormcore was a shit controller full of problems. They redesign it called Vesc Dual, and what they do ? Put toll fets inverted== bad cooling All of that for a dual 6fets for 400‚Ç¨ Seriously, get 2 Spintend 85 150 for like 250$ and you'll have better performance üòÇ
[2025-08-23T10:53:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: That said, you can achieve peaks like this
[2025-08-23T10:53:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_25539@23-08-2025_10-53-35.jpg>
[2025-08-23T10:53:36] 'lekrsu': 400‚Ç¨ excluding taxes, realistic price is 550‚Ç¨
[2025-08-23T10:53:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yep
[2025-08-23T10:54:16] LiquorHole .: Jesus 169¬∞c?
[2025-08-23T10:54:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: Realistic power achieved that day was 45KW with filtering for example
[2025-08-23T10:55:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes sometimes we seek for the limit, this time it was full track circuit at 40¬∞C outside for 35km until battery was empty
[2025-08-23T10:55:41] Yamal: Need filtering xD
[2025-08-23T10:55:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: I have a screenshot somewhere I can't find with 56KW on vesc tab x)
[2025-08-23T10:55:57] Yamal: Maybe my real powa is 20/23kw
[2025-08-23T10:56:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: And realistic was 50KW
[2025-08-23T10:56:03] LiquorHole .: Jesus, lol
[2025-08-23T10:57:18] Yamal: Any VESC display can catch real power
[2025-08-23T10:57:20] Yamal: ?
[2025-08-23T10:57:27] LiquorHole .: Bout where im aiming for, I know my input power would be 22kw but output should be 21.1kw given the motor efficiency
[2025-08-23T10:58:24] 'lekrsu': Peaks can be so far from average
[2025-08-23T10:58:52] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: If I understand what you're saying, I know that the power shown is not constant, but there is some power ü§£
[2025-08-23T10:59:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes true
[2025-08-23T10:59:40] Yamal: rabid pony 130km/h
[2025-08-23T10:59:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also almost all VESC has shunt on low side , not really accurate current reading
[2025-08-23T11:00:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: That's why I prefer to record screen from BMS app
[2025-08-23T11:00:13] Yamal: Need buy display
[2025-08-23T11:02:12] Yamal: https://3shulmotors.com/product/3shul-display/?srsltid=AfmBOorvZrmJ96XqMPZtHurBJkiRC_7-b5znNcDq9fbJBcD0WH3V8w9U
[2025-08-23T11:02:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you have communication with the BMS over can probably you can
[2025-08-23T11:02:35] Yamal: Real power?
[2025-08-23T11:02:52] Yamal: Don‚Äôt have BMS,, need smart display
[2025-08-23T11:03:26] 'lekrsu': Still no bms? )
[2025-08-23T11:03:31] Yamal: No
[2025-08-23T11:03:38] 'lekrsu': Was under the assumption you installed one
[2025-08-23T11:03:39] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: üò©
[2025-08-23T11:03:55] Yamal: The one arrive is broken
[2025-08-23T11:04:10] Yamal: BMS for the legal next project
[2025-08-23T11:04:15] 'lekrsu': Fuses though yeah?
[2025-08-23T11:04:29] Yamal: No fuses sorry
[2025-08-23T11:04:36] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2025-08-23T11:04:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Btw just get a smart bms
[2025-08-23T11:05:23] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Put the BMS yamal
[2025-08-23T11:05:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway the calculated power has less than 10% tolerance I think
[2025-08-23T11:06:10] Yamal: But what can a BMS give you? Information about the amps passing through it, and then you do your calculations?
[2025-08-23T11:06:45] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: then I'll have to make the videos recording the BMS screen to know the real power üòö
[2025-08-23T11:07:27] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: The BMS shows you the battery discharge power in W
[2025-08-23T11:08:23] Yamal: WE WANT REAL POWER
[2025-08-23T11:08:34] Yamal: stop with the fake news xD
[2025-08-23T11:08:59] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: ü§£
[2025-08-23T11:09:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: BMS measure the current from the DC power line , so you are actually seeing the real power. Many VESC measures current from the motor phase to the negative only, and makes calculation from these parameters which are not super accurate, but almost reliable
[2025-08-23T11:09:06] Yamal: Real power coming soon
[2025-08-23T11:09:13] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: <photos/photo_25540@23-08-2025_11-09-13.jpg>
[2025-08-23T11:14:53] 'lekrsu': Ant doesn't have current logging right, just events? Unless screen recorded
[2025-08-23T11:16:19] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Yes, yes, I know, I plan to record the screen.
[2025-08-23T11:21:33] Yamal: Ayo we want to see real power
[2025-08-23T11:21:47] Yamal: kiloWATTS!!!
[2025-08-23T11:22:30] Yamal: With your 500A battery you will reach a good number
[2025-08-23T11:22:53] LiquorHole .: Just make a 23s20p Battery using eve 50Pl cells
[2025-08-23T11:23:05] LiquorHole .: Real power
[2025-08-23T11:36:00] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: My battery is 22s11p p45
[2025-08-23T11:37:57] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Yes, I think we can put a little more than 250 per controller as long as the ESC can handle it. The battery has 495A real without peaks, the BMS 420 to 1040 peak
[2025-08-23T11:39:17] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Yamal As you well know, I like to take things to the limit until sometimes they break ü§£
[2025-08-23T11:40:20] LiquorHole .: God damn
[2025-08-23T11:40:40] LiquorHole .: The bms can almost do the batteries peak constantly
[2025-08-23T11:42:42] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: the battery will never damage the BMS
[2025-08-23T11:43:22] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: <photos/photo_25541@23-08-2025_11-43-22.jpg>
[2025-08-23T11:46:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: You don't need 420 continuos
[2025-08-23T11:46:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: 2-300a continuos is enough
[2025-08-23T11:47:35] LiquorHole .: Is a 170a continuous bms good enough for my 300a battery? Only utilizing 270a
[2025-08-23T11:48:53] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Everything we learn thanks to @PaoloWu @jamessoderstrom@lekrsu @XgunaX @NetworkDir is appreciated, many things would not be possible without you, so thank you all.
[2025-08-23T11:50:38] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: There wasn't much difference in price between the two either.
[2025-08-23T11:50:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: That depends by your application, but on light ev yes , normally it's enough
[2025-08-23T11:50:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: But this one is 16s
[2025-08-23T13:18:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_25542@23-08-2025_13-18-32.jpg>

[2025-08-23T13:24:51] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-08-23T13:39:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: Anyone knows the difference between 1400w old vsett 10 motors and the new 1600w new vsett 10 motors?
[2025-08-23T13:39:43] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-08-23T13:40:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: ?
[2025-08-23T13:41:56] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: a little test
[2025-08-23T13:42:20] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: <video_file>
[2025-08-23T13:44:39] LiquorHole .: Most i saw was 33kw
[2025-08-23T13:44:51] Yamal: Amazing
[2025-08-23T13:44:52] LiquorHole .: Video was running at like 5 frames per second
[2025-08-23T13:45:00] Yamal: And no full charge
[2025-08-23T13:47:00] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I don't think I can make any tea today, but tomorrow morning I will for sure.
[2025-08-23T13:47:16] Yamal: Take your time
[2025-08-23T13:47:29] Yamal: Amazing for see your real 33kw
[2025-08-23T13:47:31] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I go between the cars, that's why I don't accelerate to full speed for a long time.
[2025-08-23T13:47:46] LiquorHole .: Oh
[2025-08-23T13:47:51] Yamal: I think you can do more than 35 real kw
[2025-08-23T13:47:55] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: üòö
[2025-08-23T13:48:10] Yamal: Cooking real watts
[2025-08-23T13:48:21] LiquorHole .: Full charge should realistically be like 37kw
[2025-08-23T13:48:31] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: we will try
[2025-08-23T13:48:54] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: 39+-
[2025-08-23T13:49:00] LiquorHole .: For it also being 50ah it drains so fast üò≠
[2025-08-23T13:49:17] Yamal: We will see the distance between BMS and VESC tool.
[2025-08-23T13:50:04] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: 250Ax2
[2025-08-23T13:54:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's just the capacity calculation algorithm, if you see voltage only dropped 1v
[2025-08-23T13:54:42] LiquorHole .: I see
[2025-08-23T14:07:48] Yamal: Amaizing , just look the BMS
[2025-08-23T14:08:01] Yamal: Can see more than 400A battery
[2025-08-23T14:09:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Max we did in Italy was 450 if I remind
[2025-08-23T14:18:40] LiquorHole .: The difference between a 180mm rotor and a 160mm is still just temps right? No real difference in braking performance?
[2025-08-23T14:56:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: I think, most on market just read the rt data from VESC without applying any filters
[2025-08-23T14:57:39] Yamal: BMS okee too
[2025-08-23T14:57:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: No you didn't understand, there is noise in the readings, and current battery is calculated from phase current, so it leads to incorrect and unprecide readings That's why you need filtering to obtain the real power
[2025-08-23T14:57:50] Yamal: BMS data I mean
[2025-08-23T14:58:41] Yamal: üßê
[2025-08-23T15:00:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: BMS current reading is more accurate
[2025-08-23T15:00:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: BUT because there is always a but üòÇ
[2025-08-23T15:01:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: We've seen some same BMS having a wrong calibration over the current reading
[2025-08-23T15:01:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because of PCB Assembly
[2025-08-23T15:01:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you are able to, you can calibrate by yourself, then you have a good value
[2025-08-23T15:02:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: But to be honest, it's okay to have a difference of 500W at 35+KW
[2025-08-23T15:11:45] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Yes, I understood that, that's why I'll do it with BMS.
[2025-08-23T15:14:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: The only way is getting hall current sensor on the DC line
[2025-08-23T15:30:28] LiquorHole .: Yall heard of hydraulic sensors? I just learned about it

[2025-08-23T18:00:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes that's the best way, but not that easy to do
[2025-08-23T18:01:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: why do they like ugly scooters ? x)
[2025-08-23T18:02:26] Yamal: XD
[2025-08-23T18:02:49] Yamal: Fancy e-racing scooter
[2025-08-23T18:02:53] LiquorHole .: Honestly the weped dont even seem good for the money if speed is what is aimed for. Id take the velity 511r And is 10k less then a sonic s üò≠
[2025-08-23T18:03:31] Yamal: You can do your own custom power and nice e-scooter
[2025-08-23T18:03:49] Yamal: Best components
[2025-08-23T18:03:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: 511R is 15.9K‚Ç¨
[2025-08-23T18:04:19] Yamal: And don‚Äôt have VESC
[2025-08-23T18:04:30] Yamal: Only Momen tricher
[2025-08-23T18:04:34] Yamal: Mount VESC
[2025-08-23T18:04:48] Yamal: And of course Apex
[2025-08-23T18:04:54] LiquorHole .: Just about less then a sonic s still
[2025-08-23T18:05:50] LiquorHole .: The Super big scooters are definitely not my style lol
[2025-08-23T18:12:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: Momen Tricher is big shit, FastRide made a video somewhere telling none that they had were working, and some had chassis issues
[2025-08-23T18:13:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because they are not escooters anymore, they are motorcycle without seats, pointless
[2025-08-23T18:13:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: And RM-Series CS75 üò∂
[2025-08-23T18:13:53] LiquorHole .: Im glad mine is ‚Äúin dimensions‚Äù still small enough to be considered a Regular scooter, Not in weight though
[2025-08-23T18:48:15] Yamal: Cs75?
[2025-08-23T18:48:24] Yamal: What that mean
[2025-08-23T18:49:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: New scooter coming from Rage Mechanics
[2025-08-23T18:49:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Should have been revealed this week but the person doing my communication is on holidays haha
[2025-08-23T19:05:01] haku: wait what about me
[2025-08-23T19:08:57] Yamal: Same person for the 173kmh?
[2025-08-23T19:13:52] puneDir: <video_file>
[2025-08-23T19:13:56] puneDir: Electric audi
[2025-08-23T19:14:04] puneDir: But it has speed limiter (160 kmh)
[2025-08-23T19:14:34] LiquorHole .: Slower than a scooter is ludicrous
[2025-08-23T19:20:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: No I mean the girl making the visuals, advertising, ...
[2025-08-23T19:21:38] haku: kw farmer yams. you still running bypass. dude get proper discharge bms. do not fuck around and find out. with all due respect
[2025-08-23T19:22:30] haku: alu boards yams. they will popcorn yams
[2025-08-23T19:23:16] Noname: Yeah my timer was set a bit long and that shit started cooking
[2025-08-23T19:23:31] Noname: At least a nice fuse
[2025-08-23T19:23:48] haku: fuse is for pussys. get proper discharge bms
[2025-08-23T19:24:09] haku: waste of space fuses
[2025-08-23T19:24:21] Noname: Well in some instances it works. My 3rd battery is only a 60a bms and I push it
[2025-08-23T19:24:42] haku: is there even a 350a fuse?
[2025-08-23T19:28:29] haku: fast girl?
[2025-08-23T19:28:39] haku: <sticker>
[2025-08-23T19:30:16] Noname: Car audio stuff im sure
[2025-08-23T19:31:27] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: You and Yamal have a master'süòö

[2025-08-23T19:45:04] haku: dam 450a
[2025-08-23T19:45:30] haku: 41kw for a second there
[2025-08-23T19:49:32] Yamal: I really don‚Äôt understand what we talk before about ‚Äúreal power‚Äù
[2025-08-23T19:49:54] Yamal: Now BMS lie ?
[2025-08-23T19:50:02] Yamal: VESC toll lie ?
[2025-08-23T19:50:12] Yamal: Smart display only way
[2025-08-23T19:50:39] Yamal: ü¶¶
[2025-08-23T19:54:14] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I'll keep trying. I think we can reach 45kW.
[2025-08-23T19:55:38] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: What I understood before is that it is more precise to measure it in the BMS than in the ESC. In both you get data, but the BMS is more precise. That's what I understood this morning.
[2025-08-23T19:56:50] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: 462 üí£üöÄ
[2025-08-23T20:02:52] haku: only way now is to clamp a voltermeter lol
[2025-08-23T20:03:05] haku: and record with gopro
[2025-08-23T20:03:15] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Jajajajja
[2025-08-23T20:03:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nah bms is good
[2025-08-23T20:04:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway the most important is not the power, it's more important the torque you get
[2025-08-23T20:04:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lower power higher torque is the way , unfortunately lonyyo don't make better motor
[2025-08-23T20:06:14] Yamal: <photos/photo_25544@23-08-2025_20-06-14.jpg>
[2025-08-23T20:11:53] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: üò©
[2025-08-23T20:13:19] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Do you think that changing the motor to 100H will make the controller's fetts heat up less?
[2025-08-23T20:13:23] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: or it has nothing to do with it
[2025-08-23T20:15:13] haku: if i was admin. just saying
[2025-08-23T20:23:58] haku: guys question fsec like flipsky do some units still use vesc software?
[2025-08-23T20:24:15] haku: or all of em is not vesc anymore
[2025-08-23T20:30:21] haku: asking for a friend. not mine
[2025-08-23T20:30:25] Yamal: How
[2025-08-23T20:30:37] Yamal: 22/3///17/4
[2025-08-23T20:31:18] haku: yams this is what a fellow intellectual told me a long time ago.
[2025-08-23T20:31:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Need more efficient engine
[2025-08-23T20:31:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like 127mm one or 147
[2025-08-23T20:32:16] Yamal: Stator
[2025-08-23T20:32:59] Yamal: People say here
[2025-08-23T20:33:25] Yamal: With 22/3 or 17/3 can‚Äôt push many amps
[2025-08-23T20:33:38] Yamal: Because burn the engines
[2025-08-23T20:33:59] Yamal: But
[2025-08-23T20:34:21] Yamal: Normally in the races e- scooter people using 33/2
[2025-08-23T20:34:25] Yamal: And
[2025-08-23T20:34:49] Yamal: What do you think about rage torque ?
[2025-08-23T20:34:54] Yamal: Okee right
[2025-08-23T20:35:09] Yamal: Top speed
[2025-08-23T20:35:20] Yamal: 0-100 4,5?
[2025-08-23T20:35:26] Yamal: Can‚Äôt remember
[2025-08-23T20:35:29] Yamal: But
[2025-08-23T20:35:42] Yamal: ‚úçÔ∏è
[2025-08-23T20:46:17] Dreuzzz: can anyone explain?
[2025-08-23T21:05:00] skrtt: Yes, a 500$ gift card
[2025-08-23T21:05:13] haku: yes i need
[2025-08-23T21:07:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Did you write settings?
[2025-08-23T21:10:36] haku: the 8" ly motor is 127mm stator?
[2025-08-23T21:13:44] 'lekrsu': You need half the amps in 17x4 compared to 33x2, approximately, to generate the same torque, though.
[2025-08-23T21:15:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: 147
[2025-08-23T21:15:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not this what I mean. I'm just saying same top speed, same torque are possible with less power
[2025-08-23T21:16:33] 'lekrsu': Up the voltage and go lower kV ü•∞
[2025-08-23T21:17:00] 'lekrsu': Anyway guys, if your VESC suffers from noise in ADC lines from motor running, and that causes issues, compress the freaking adc settings. Should've done this a year ago.
[2025-08-23T21:17:42] 'lekrsu': 0.83v idle, yet actual non instant range can begin at 1-1.2v. Solved every single issue my 100100 has had. Can use overmodulation now because of that simple change. Wasn't obvious to me, should've been.
[2025-08-23T21:19:51] 'lekrsu': 30+ km ridden with an lisp "profiles" adc based bind, without false triggering. Although, script checks and only counts at 90% activation of adc, among other precautions that cancel the counting. Flawless so far.
[2025-08-23T21:21:15] 'lekrsu': phase noise hehe
[2025-08-23T21:21:31] 'lekrsu': 0.83v is real idle, full spin and watch ADC1 there.
[2025-08-23T21:23:01] Yamal: Only with bigger stator
[2025-08-23T21:23:05] Yamal: ?
[2025-08-23T21:24:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Things like shortest possible cable, better engine cooling, like these . The yes get bigger engine with more copper maybe
[2025-08-23T21:24:55] Yamal: I really want to try Alu lite man
[2025-08-23T21:25:26] 'lekrsu': Really no reason ^^), the Spintend's bigger alternatives are better, 135A phase max.
[2025-08-23T21:25:39] Yamal: Battery ?
[2025-08-23T21:26:01] Yamal: But very small perfect for fit in to many stock scooter
[2025-08-23T21:26:08] Yamal: Only for ride with VESC
[2025-08-23T21:26:11] 'lekrsu': 85240 fits in Ninebot G2 though
[2025-08-23T21:26:14] Yamal: And get better performance
[2025-08-23T21:26:28] 'lekrsu': Maybe if you ride a Xiaomi or a Ninebot F2 where space is an issue
[2025-08-23T21:27:17] 'lekrsu': But yeah they're so small, its insane
[2025-08-23T21:27:22] Dreuzzz: ofc
[2025-08-23T21:27:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: What vesc
[2025-08-23T21:27:51] 'lekrsu': https://spintend.com/collections/esc-based-on-vesc/products/single-ubox-aluminum-controller-100v-100a-based-on-vesc
[2025-08-23T21:28:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don't suggest for big engines
[2025-08-23T21:28:27] 'lekrsu': 22x3 65H wouldn't be doable on the 100100, no torque heh
[2025-08-23T21:28:27] Yamal: For sure , James one
[2025-08-23T21:28:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Doesn't it has filter on ADC?
[2025-08-23T21:28:45] 'lekrsu': Don't think it has
[2025-08-23T21:29:16] Yamal: 60h 22/3 can ?
[2025-08-23T21:29:32] Yamal: Is like Standart for dualtron
[2025-08-23T21:29:43] haku: im putting 12fets on mine hehe
[2025-08-23T21:30:02] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: Personally I had a lot of problems with that, I listened to my friend and connected my chassis to ground and now I have 0 problems, I was very impressed üòÇ
[2025-08-23T21:30:24] 'lekrsu': Throttle range is like this anyway. Removing the 0.83-1.0 range can't even be felt.
[2025-08-23T21:30:42] 'lekrsu': Chassis to ground.. no thanks :D
[2025-08-23T21:30:49] Yamal: There Is possibility only fit VESC and enjoy scooter , only buy controller xD
[2025-08-23T21:31:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Insane lol
[2025-08-23T21:31:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: If some cable drops it's gone
[2025-08-23T21:32:53] haku: why is dual magnets bad for foc again? @PaoloWu
[2025-08-23T21:32:53] haku: <photos/photo_25549@23-08-2025_21-32-53.jpg>
[2025-08-23T21:33:04] 'lekrsu': Stupid to cheap out on the magnets
[2025-08-23T21:33:08] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: <photos/photo_25550@23-08-2025_21-33-08.jpg>
[2025-08-23T21:33:26] haku: agreed but $80 how can you not say no
[2025-08-23T21:33:46] 'lekrsu': I've put a lot of work into preventing a short from GND to chassis, you did it intentionally
[2025-08-23T21:34:25] haku: i doubt ill be twisting any stators with this shit motor
[2025-08-23T21:34:56] haku: phases will burn first hopefully
[2025-08-23T21:35:32] Yamal: ?
[2025-08-23T21:35:46] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: yes and it solved 100% of my problems üòÇ
[2025-08-23T21:36:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: What was you problem?
[2025-08-23T21:37:20] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: My ADC was never stable, I had peaks, and especially when I released my trigger 2/10 it remained accelerated
[2025-08-23T21:38:17] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: in the race before each turn I had to anticipate that üòÇ
[2025-08-23T21:42:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Which controller?
[2025-08-23T21:42:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Didn't had this shit even with flipsky
[2025-08-23T21:45:15] Yamal: And do you have small acceleration peaks from time to time?
[2025-08-23T21:52:13] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: spintend 85v240a
[2025-08-23T21:52:23] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: YESSS
[2025-08-23T21:52:44] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: I had the same problem with the 100v100a

[2025-08-23T22:35:05] haku: train everyday. circuit, physical, mental training yams
[2025-08-23T22:35:47] haku: for 1 day i will be #1 in france and the world
[2025-08-23T22:44:18] Yamal: Me too
[2025-08-23T22:52:11] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: spintend power üòÇ
[2025-08-23T22:54:21] Yamal: I thought it was something of mine, or my own installation, but I see that it happens to more people.
[2025-08-23T22:55:15] Yamal: Still very happy with Ubox, by far it is the most powerful scooter I have ever had
[2025-08-23T22:56:56] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: My friend had these problems on trampas
[2025-08-23T22:57:11] Yamal: and I think that for example 85/240 are undoubtedly controller that give a lot of play due to their size and power
[2025-08-23T22:57:31] Yamal: are you planning to mount x12?
[2025-08-23T22:58:10] Dxniel: Same with me. Ubox 85250 v2 üôÅ
[2025-08-23T22:59:16] Yamal: Really mount v2
[2025-08-23T22:59:21] Yamal: Nice
[2025-08-23T22:59:32] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: the problem is that I have a 20s battery and I would like to have a 22s to mount the x12
[2025-08-23T22:59:42] Yamal: True
[2025-08-23T22:59:57] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: and above all I have to change the motors üòÇ
[2025-08-23T23:00:02] Yamal: Very powerfully controller for 20s is like no need
[2025-08-23T23:03:40] Yamal: I want to see ubox working with 250 A battery :)

[2025-08-23T23:07:48] Yamal: What's cool about the 85/250 are the screw-on lugs, they make installation much easier!
[2025-08-23T23:08:04] Yamal: 20s6p?
[2025-08-23T23:08:28] Dxniel: Yes. Only 50s cells hehe
[2025-08-23T23:08:42] Yamal: Is okey
[2025-08-23T23:08:52] Yamal: Power and autonomy
[2025-08-23T23:09:30] haku: yea the 6fet has retarded mounting style
[2025-08-23T23:09:47] Yamal: Also 85/240
[2025-08-23T23:10:04] Dxniel: Izz ok for my slow ass g30

[2025-08-23T23:11:07] Yamal: Amazing custom
[2025-08-23T23:11:11] haku: nah not slow
[2025-08-23T23:11:17] Yamal: Wolf motors

[2025-08-24T00:16:51] Matthew: I am kind of wondering the same. When ive put field weakening start at 85% I have felt i lost too much torque and 87-88% somehow seems more linear power delivery. I only have experience with lonnyo 65h 22x3 and 17x4 motors with 16s pack
[2025-08-24T02:33:02] JPPL: See you on monday

[2025-08-24T03:51:55] Noname: They had a car show somewhere near the docks I didnt investigate
[2025-08-24T03:52:17] Noname: NY is like 100mi away
[2025-08-24T03:52:45] haku: that restored police car is the show?
[2025-08-24T03:52:48] Noname: I still want to go to upstate before the end of season

[2025-08-24T09:19:09] 'lekrsu': It's not inherently logical to base that duty threshold on your battery current limiting phase current.
[2025-08-24T10:35:39] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah i putting at 85% look a bit late, i see a guys recommanding putting it a 65%
[2025-08-24T10:37:22] Dualtron Achilleus: Field weak‚Ä¶ is about phase amp no battery amps right?
[2025-08-24T10:38:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Phase amps is batt amp when at full duty
[2025-08-24T10:38:15] Roby MacGyver: ü§£
[2025-08-24T10:38:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's additional amp, so your original batt amp + field weakening amp @Dualtron_Achillleus
[2025-08-24T10:38:55] Roby MacGyver: Flipsky is the worst control unit I've ever tried.
[2025-08-24T10:41:19] Roby MacGyver: makerbase 75100 good makerbase 84100 hp very good and all spintend are very very good
[2025-08-24T13:15:53] Yamal: I never change yet
[2025-08-24T13:18:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: I think it's great
[2025-08-24T13:22:29] Marius: that makes a lot of sense to me
[2025-08-24T13:23:01] Marius: cuz on the speedometer thingy i only really see like 15kw but then at the very bottom it random says 20kw max which i never saw
[2025-08-24T13:24:14] Marius: oh i must try that ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2025-08-24T13:26:50] Ev Pro World: Pm for any information

[2025-08-24T13:33:50] Marius: so nice and no cars
[2025-08-24T13:33:52] Marius: at day time
[2025-08-24T13:36:13] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: You have to wait for the traffic light to turn green so the road is clear of cars. That was this morning at 8:30.
[2025-08-24T13:36:47] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Is that controller same as yyk controller?
[2025-08-24T13:39:30] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: (spintend is good? ) Against public evidence
[2025-08-24T13:46:43] Marius: oh makes sense
[2025-08-24T13:46:55] Marius: getting up early to drive is above my paygrade
[2025-08-24T13:57:18] Rob Ver: I fucked my g30
[2025-08-24T13:57:25] Rob Ver: Lisp is not wirking
[2025-08-24T13:57:37] Rob Ver: Now front motor won't cooperate
[2025-08-24T13:59:38] 'lekrsu': Resetting works, the m365 dash script just overrides far too much of your settings
[2025-08-24T13:59:47] 'lekrsu': always backup before doing major changes
[2025-08-24T14:13:12] Roby MacGyver: no good,very very good,However, I'm talking about normal basic 100/150 A control units

[2025-08-24T14:21:08] Pandalgns: Lately we see a lot of burned spintends üôÑüôÑ
[2025-08-24T14:22:50] Pandalgns: However, I put amps into my MKS 84200hp until they get tired and they won't say enough... I burned one but because of a short between the motor phases which diverted current through the chassis and that must have burned the controller but since then they haven't given me a single problem.
[2025-08-24T14:23:29] Pandalgns: Mks 84xxxhp very goodüòÇüòÇ

[2025-08-24T15:45:56] Yamal: interesting //// brother a certified chassis and firewood for the bonfire!
[2025-08-24T16:17:07] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: the higher the speed, the more wind ü§£ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[2025-08-24T16:17:28] Yamal: Vesc concentration! It would be great to ride with the members of this group, but not a 50/60/70 km ride, which is what I usually do on a day's ride with super fast chargers, etc.
[2025-08-24T16:18:07] Yamal: I, by proximity, the closest are Portugal and France
[2025-08-24T16:18:30] Marius: there is no vesc concentration here
[2025-08-24T16:18:33] Marius: germany is divided
[2025-08-24T16:18:44] Marius: the only thing i see here are stock ebikes 25kmh 300w
[2025-08-24T16:28:44] Yamal: For example, in my city, 3 years ago there were just a few of us, not hundreds! xD but enough to have a good time. Before the new laws came in and e-scooters were regulated, to really do long or more or less long routes it is better to have few people, like 3-4-5. The good thing is that when there are a lot of people, some days you can go out some and other days you can go out others. Now my city is in decline in large e-scooters, many sold them scared by the new laws and others simply do not go out... we are the resistance
[2025-08-24T16:35:31] Rose: Hey there Pite, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-24T16:57:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: Why not coming to the final race in France 13th september ? You are fan of racing scooters, you'll see there the top in the world
[2025-08-24T16:59:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: well, laws in spain are very restrictive, we won't ride there anymore
[2025-08-24T16:59:51] Yamal: üí∞üßë‚Äçüßë‚Äçüßí‚Äçüßí
[2025-08-24T17:07:04] Pandalgns: I think that when I finish the modifications my next project will be to homologate it as a moped and register it so I can go on any road outside the city at "45km/h" legally.

[2025-08-25T16:57:07] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: We have very bad luck, something always happens to us üòÜ
[2025-08-25T16:58:34] JPPL: Modding life
[2025-08-25T17:05:36] critical: what speeds could i get with stock
[2025-08-25T17:19:53] 'lekrsu': Same as with SHFW.
[2025-08-25T17:27:05] Kafka Luke: Information about account from stats bot
[2025-08-25T17:27:14] critical: around 40km/h?
[2025-08-25T17:40:19] Kafka Luke: Obv not 3 messages, photo and name recently changed, sim from Cameroon
[2025-08-25T18:15:59] haku: deport!
[2025-08-25T18:20:49] Matthew: Shfw me weighing ~200lbs with field weaking and full charge i hit 51km/h and top speed slowly drops to around 24mph by the time battery is at ~30% remaining. With a 2nd gen g30lp motor.
[2025-08-25T18:21:29] Kafka Luke: Funstat bot
[2025-08-25T18:23:42] critical: that‚Äôs not bad i‚Äôm gonna buy a g30 max soon but how do ik which gen motor it has
[2025-08-25T18:24:21] critical: also how much range would i get with SHFW on stock battery
[2025-08-25T18:29:40] Matthew: I understand it has to do with serial number on the motor... but I think that segway ninebot is up to gen 4 motor now I think. If im not mistaken the scooters with the black esc are the newest generation. I hope others see this message and fill in on the different generations of motors and controllers. But to touch on the vesc aspect the 100/100 has been good for me using a 65h 17x4 lonnyo motor with ~45mph top speed with 50amps field weakening at 87%. 16s 90amps battery and 130phase and 145amps abs max. I am going to up to 20s when I get the money in the future, but for now it runs strong and goes up every hill I need it to in the mountains.
[2025-08-25T18:31:25] Matthew: With the g30lp which is ~10Ah battery max i ever got was 18 miles. The avg range id get is 13 miles. Going under 10mph you get quite a bit of range, go 20mph and up and you will manage around 1 mile per 1Ah capacity.
[2025-08-25T18:33:03] haku: this is a g30 motor on 50-60 phase.
[2025-08-25T18:33:04] haku: 6fets
[2025-08-25T18:33:22] critical: after vesc should i upgrade motor or battery
[2025-08-25T18:33:36] critical: ye that‚Äôs alr then i only need around 8 miles so should be fine
[2025-08-25T18:34:57] critical: that‚Äôs not that accurate tho
[2025-08-25T18:35:06] critical: cuz it‚Äôs a kid on a tiny bike so there‚Äôs less weight i think
[2025-08-25T18:37:41] haku: yea. hes like 35lbs-40 at this time lol
[2025-08-25T18:38:24] haku: now he can ride this perfectly. need a better one
[2025-08-25T18:38:33] Matthew: The motor can take a lot, so I personally would upgrade the battery. Someone torture tested the gen 2 motor and up to 5kw the motor survived well and delta mod configuration dude ran 8.5kw and top speed 63mph on 20s. The motor had statorade and he said the motor gets hot fast haha. But yeah, more voltage and amps to have a more fun ride is what I would do. Factory motor is plenty fine at ~3kw so long as you dont stay full throttle for extended periods of time
[2025-08-25T18:39:08] Matthew: Yeah, 8 miles i wouldnt worry about range so much.
[2025-08-25T18:52:07] critical: idrk where i can get a good battery from cuz most are 48v 20ah for around ¬£300 but that seems too expensive
[2025-08-25T19:01:25] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/_cOEufEkYpo?si=2tR45cO-ZcKmvO4N
[2025-08-25T19:04:16] Matthew: The battery is pretty much the most expensive component needed in scooter builds. If youre in Europe there are some people that build batteries but I dont think you will find one under ¬£300
[2025-08-25T19:08:08] Matthew: There is a company named Amorge and ive been told by some of the battery builders that theyre a legit company to buy good battery packs from. You can give them the dimensions you have to work with and give them the voltage and amps bms you want and they'll make a quote for you or you can tell them specific cells you want also. If youre gonna spend the money id recommend 52v minimum and 60v ideally... 72v gets expensive FAST.

[2025-08-25T19:12:51] haku: 72v is not too bad. depends on cells
[2025-08-25T19:12:55] Matthew: What is the best use for the vesc express???
[2025-08-25T19:15:26] critical: ye honestly i don‚Äôt wanna spend more than ¬£300 on a battery
[2025-08-25T19:15:47] Matthew: This quote i find is inexpensive given the output specs and 20s but its small 18650 cells. Samsung 30q is the cells in that quote, miss type 36q. And then I got a quote for molicel 18650 cells and its twice the price ü§Øüòµ
[2025-08-25T19:17:13] Matthew: Personally I am going to probably buy the 30q pack... but im far away from having the money for a new pack so I still have my eyes and ears open for whats good and good priced.
[2025-08-25T19:17:46] Matthew: Molicel
[2025-08-25T19:17:57] haku: yea really depends on the cells. 35q i have no idea how that performs
[2025-08-25T19:18:48] haku: ask if they can do 50pl with big bms
[2025-08-25T19:20:49] haku: maybe they can source cells cheaper. china to china
[2025-08-25T19:21:16] haku: that will be the death of american battery builders.

[2025-08-25T19:25:39] Yamal: Action camera ?
[2025-08-25T19:26:24] haku: yea. i think they only sell preproduction a- cells to customers. but idk if eve sell to china battery builders. im sure they will a grade cells
[2025-08-25T19:27:37] haku: like gopro or something
[2025-08-25T19:32:34] Yamal: Don‚Äôt understand

[2025-08-26T08:23:07] Yamal: There is no photo of the scooter, no photo of the vesc tool data üò≠
[2025-08-26T08:46:23] Finn: P30 are old
[2025-08-26T09:18:38] Dxniel: Dude what
[2025-08-26T09:21:10] Jason: that looks fucked up
[2025-08-26T09:24:00] Dxniel: Yep yep
[2025-08-26T09:54:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: What is the problem?
[2025-08-26T10:17:06] LiquorHole .: You going to start using The new Hope gr4 rotors in future races?
[2025-08-26T11:19:07] Rose: Hey there Margarita Pascual, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-26T11:49:28] Yamal: Wich scooter is this ,, nice very compact
[2025-08-26T11:50:24] Yamal: ?
[2025-08-26T11:51:22] Dualtron Achilleus: Look like a victor with modified frame
[2025-08-26T13:53:47] LiquorHole .: @Bradhaku ngl i Did so much digging i basically answered my own question i had about your wepoor üò≠ And Honestly thank god too they‚Äôre Pretty helpful answers
[2025-08-26T14:24:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Mmmh ask me later I don't remember, need to open 3D model
[2025-08-26T14:29:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's a Dualtron 2EX with modified frame from RFP Performance
[2025-08-26T14:35:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, I have to test to see
[2025-08-26T14:37:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_25610@26-08-2025_14-37-06.jpg>
[2025-08-26T14:37:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: Some nice SCS clamps
[2025-08-26T14:38:20] LiquorHole .: Yeah theyre smaller and more compact but have 2x18mm piston 2x17mm piston, Its optimized for a 2.3mm rotor though i wanted to use sonken rotors but its too thick probably
[2025-08-26T14:54:28] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Do you have a real CNC lathe?
[2025-08-26T15:00:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: Have to check if 2.8/3.0mm rotors work
[2025-08-26T15:01:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: I have a manual lathe, for production we have various factories specialized for this
[2025-08-26T15:02:01] LiquorHole .: Hopefully they work cause that would be pretty game changing especially for stuff that couldnt fit regular 4 v4 brakes.
[2025-08-26T15:09:12] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I already said it
[2025-08-26T15:10:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't understand
[2025-08-26T15:16:43] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: With a normal lathe you can make axes and a few things, but if you work with a CNC it is normal that you get those finishes.
[2025-08-26T15:17:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Ah yes right
[2025-08-26T15:18:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes actually I have a pretty decent lathe to make some axles, washers or to modify some parts but it's not meant to produce yes

[2025-08-26T16:11:09] Dualtron Achilleus: Crazy
[2025-08-26T16:11:14] Dualtron Achilleus: https://www.chatrobotic.com/product/detail/tronic1000-vesc-motor-controller.html
[2025-08-26T16:11:19] Dualtron Achilleus: On his website
[2025-08-26T16:11:37] Dualtron Achilleus: 400$ 1000A phase 24süò≥üò≥üò≥
[2025-08-26T16:13:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Its fake specs as tronic always claim, it's way less
[2025-08-26T16:19:04] Dualtron Achilleus: The question is How much less lul
[2025-08-26T16:20:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: If spintend 85240 is rated for 400A max , tronic 1000 is about 600 max
[2025-08-26T16:21:02] LiquorHole .: That applies to the 250 as well? Or you dont know
[2025-08-26T16:21:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: This controller is done with old mos technology, it's not comparable with toll package
[2025-08-26T16:21:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: 250 is less powerful than 85150, about half of power (-40% more or less)
[2025-08-26T16:22:42] LiquorHole .: So the 250 from spintend isnt their flagship or something?
[2025-08-26T16:23:18] JPPL: Yes seems the BE the rocking spinted
[2025-08-26T16:24:15] LiquorHole .: That‚Äôs disappointing to hear though lol how the hell the 85250 controller weaker then the 85150 controller üò≠
[2025-08-26T16:24:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ah sorry I misunderstood, I tought you was talking about tronic 250
[2025-08-26T16:24:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then of course spintend 250 is more powerful than spintend 150
[2025-08-26T16:25:19] LiquorHole .: Well that‚Äôs Equally as surprising lol I would of imagined the tronic 250 to be Comparable to the 250/240 from spintend
[2025-08-26T16:26:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: That's why I say their power claim is a scam, their 250a version is much weaker than 150a version of spintend
[2025-08-26T16:27:06] LiquorHole .: Well Now again would the 400a Phase max from the 85240 apply to the 85250 as well or does it have more
[2025-08-26T16:27:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don't know what's the difference between 240 and 250 lol
[2025-08-26T16:28:35] LiquorHole .: Eh ill just make an assumption that they have the same phase amp maximum then
[2025-08-26T16:28:35] JPPL: Maxim no top cover
[2025-08-26T16:39:41] haku: wepoor is a troll name. its when i built it yams here always post videos on weped mini bike. so i decided to call it wepoor
[2025-08-26T16:40:22] LiquorHole .: Ik is just your scooter uses alot of the same stuff as mine
[2025-08-26T16:40:41] haku: its a geofought frame originaly
[2025-08-26T16:41:23] LiquorHole .: Just needed to know what size rotors you were running, but i got more then that lol
[2025-08-26T16:41:48] haku: dude. thats right. i forgot to check
[2025-08-26T16:42:00] haku: its a 3mm rotor
[2025-08-26T16:42:09] LiquorHole .: Now im 100% certain mine can fit mt7s since your ktet 4 pistons are atleast from pictures ive seen the same size or bigger then the mt5
[2025-08-26T16:42:36] haku: oh yea. lots of space
[2025-08-26T16:43:29] LiquorHole .: Just gotta get the money for hope techs now üòÇ wont need to get maguras as a Placeholder
[2025-08-26T16:43:36] LiquorHole .: Only need a couple hundred more dollars
[2025-08-26T16:43:46] LiquorHole .: It should fit no problem
[2025-08-26T16:51:39] haku: let me tell you dude. you dont need the best of the best to enjoy riding. but if that makes you feel safer since brakes is not a joke.
[2025-08-26T16:52:17] haku: only things you need of quality imo are batteries
[2025-08-26T16:52:25] LiquorHole .: Oh no I just wanna have the best of everything possible so i could tell Yeeb yam that my r8 is better
[2025-08-26T16:52:36] haku: haha
[2025-08-26T16:53:33] haku: hopes are more expensive than motors
[2025-08-26T16:54:07] LiquorHole .: Atleast on paper my build should be fine lol, My only inconvenience now is that display from rage probably not fitting and id need like a Handlebar extension or whatever is called
[2025-08-26T16:54:29] LiquorHole .: If its 3 digits is cheap, i like to tell myself that
[2025-08-26T16:55:44] LiquorHole .: Got that same handlebar mount as your wepoor lol
[2025-08-26T16:55:48] haku: of i didnt have a son and a heathen dog thats high maintentance. i prolly wouldve went with good parts too
[2025-08-26T16:57:26] LiquorHole .: Honestly the brakes and the rotors are the only thing that‚Äôll shine out of everything, Not like the spintend controllers and motors aren‚Äôt anything less then great but Not something like the 3shuls or something lol
[2025-08-26T16:57:56] Dualtron Achilleus: Just get a hope for front brake
[2025-08-26T16:58:21] Dualtron Achilleus: Rear dont need that much power to block the wheel so
[2025-08-26T16:58:34] haku: how much are hopes anyways. i dont even know the prices because i know its out of my pricerange
[2025-08-26T16:58:47] Dualtron Achilleus: Its 260‚Ç¨ avg
[2025-08-26T16:58:52] haku: oh wow

[2025-08-26T16:58:53] Dualtron Achilleus: On side

[2025-08-26T17:00:03] LiquorHole .: I have no idea I just know fastride has good stuff they dont ship to US?

[2025-08-26T17:03:32] LiquorHole .: Every time i ask about a shop though they always say go to jokers garage
[2025-08-26T17:04:47] LiquorHole .: Only thing ill go to a shop for though is to do a proper tire balancing or whatever, and probably changing brake fluid since i dont have it myself yet
[2025-08-26T17:05:25] haku: easy DIY bleed brakes
[2025-08-26T17:05:43] haku: all scooter mechanical work can be done DIY.
[2025-08-26T17:05:59] haku: unless you want custom milled stuff
[2025-08-26T17:06:47] LiquorHole .: Yeah i was planning on doing that but ill do that When I can actually 3D model the shit üòÇ
[2025-08-26T17:07:05] haku: just ask questions here bro. lots of helpful folks here
[2025-08-26T17:07:44] Dualtron Achilleus: He is shy

[2025-08-26T17:08:22] haku: hahah
[2025-08-26T17:08:31] LiquorHole .: Helped me with a good portion of stuff i needed confirmed lol, im still surprised you fit 3mm rotors on those brakes though i was having a debate on wether those were A Magura clone or a Hope tech clone that use mineral oil
[2025-08-26T17:09:16] haku: no idea tbh. it just works. i regen most of the time on that vehicle anyways
[2025-08-26T17:09:55] haku: ok need to take my boy to school. talk later boys
[2025-08-26T17:10:04] LiquorHole .: Later üëçüèæ

[2025-08-26T20:54:30] Noname: Also the first to Vaporize pliers
[2025-08-26T20:57:48] Yamal: Some using x12
[2025-08-26T20:57:50] Yamal: Dual
[2025-08-26T20:57:52] Yamal: ?
[2025-08-26T20:58:06] Yamal: The purple Teverun really like
[2025-08-26T20:58:17] Yamal: For me your best one
[2025-08-26T21:05:22] Yamal: The 11x with the long box is also top, but I'm a bit tired of big, heavy e-scooters and want to lose weight. When you take one that weighs 30/40kg, it becomes really fun and playful.
[2025-08-26T21:07:21] Yamal: Everything has its pros and cons. The best thing you can do is have an e-scooter for each thing. It would also be cool to have one for the countryside. In my area there are a lot of cool routes on dirt roads, and here you are free, there is no one who can stop you or fine you
[2025-08-26T21:11:28] Yamal: So, I'm looking forward to starting new projects, and I'm really happy with the Nami. Its 40Ah batteries allow me to move like a motorcycle. I have enough autonomy, but not too much! For my area, a great autonomy would be to be able to do 120/130 kilometers at a good pace. Otherwise, it's great
[2025-08-26T21:15:21] Yamal: 60/70ah perfect
[2025-08-26T21:16:20] haku: kw farmer yams a balls to wallser like you deserve the highest of high discharge batteries
[2025-08-26T21:16:34] Dualtron Achilleus: Haha
[2025-08-26T21:16:44] Dualtron Achilleus: He deserve 700a batt
[2025-08-26T21:16:52] Dualtron Achilleus: No sag
[2025-08-26T21:17:23] Dualtron Achilleus: And 90h that is minimun in 2025
[2025-08-26T21:17:42] haku: oh snap. 2026 100h then
[2025-08-26T21:17:57] haku: or 146mm stators?
[2025-08-26T21:18:34] Dualtron Achilleus: 146mm is big torque smoke every 110mm lonnyo
[2025-08-26T21:19:02] Dualtron Achilleus: One day i will have on
[2025-08-26T21:19:04] Dualtron Achilleus: E
[2025-08-26T21:19:09] Dualtron Achilleus: If you buy me
[2025-08-26T21:19:12] Dualtron Achilleus: ü§£
[2025-08-26T21:19:29] haku: im on 50h üò≠
[2025-08-26T21:20:26] Dualtron Achilleus: 50h on 200mm stator smoke every 110mm lonnyo man
[2025-08-26T21:26:32] Yamal: But you have one now right
[2025-08-26T21:26:45] Yamal: The one you using ,,
[2025-08-26T21:28:00] JPPL: Back home
[2025-08-26T21:28:12] Yamal: I need to learn about motors
[2025-08-26T21:29:50] JPPL: With some 3s booster üòÇ
[2025-08-26T21:29:56] Yamal: From 60h to 100h is 110mm stTor
[2025-08-26T21:30:31] haku: whats the best future proof motors? 120h?
[2025-08-26T21:31:12] haku: isnt there ly 120h?
[2025-08-26T21:32:01] haku: how can i be member of the garden team?
[2025-08-26T21:36:32] Yamal: there really is more room for more P?
[2025-08-26T21:37:17] Yamal: I think that more than 100 h is already a problem for making roundabouts xD
[2025-08-26T21:37:43] haku: i can imagine the boys here mounting it though
[2025-08-26T21:37:55] haku: just because they can hahaha
[2025-08-26T21:38:07] Yamal: 80(single magnet) 90h and 100h really cool
[2025-08-26T21:39:18] Yamal: But Paolo really made me think a lot about the future being bigger engines to use less power and develop more torque.
[2025-08-26T21:40:02] Yamal: In daily use it is difficult to go over 120 km/h, and that is where the torque becomes really fun
[2025-08-26T21:40:27] haku: imo. we will see higher voltage setups on torque motors
[2025-08-26T21:40:53] JPPL: 11p it seems yes, rfp longer deck
[2025-08-26T21:42:35] Yamal: You mount x12 on it or still g300
[2025-08-26T21:43:44] JPPL: X12, later night i put some hands on inside
[2025-08-26T21:44:13] Yamal: Amazing ,,,,,
[2025-08-26T21:44:25] Yamal: So which engines develop more torque 70/75/80/90 or 100?
[2025-08-26T21:45:13] haku: no idea
[2025-08-26T21:45:50] haku: the answer is! 50h 16x4
[2025-08-26T21:46:32] Yamal: 40s 50h 16/4
[2025-08-26T22:03:12] Yamal: we are still waiting for wepoor,, Haku industries
[2025-08-26T22:03:34] haku: fall.
[2025-08-26T22:03:34] Yamal: A great journey awaits you in search of old Tom.
[2025-08-26T22:03:50] haku: too hot atm. to ride in the day
[2025-08-26T22:04:22] Yamal: take advantage of the nights
[2025-08-26T22:04:39] haku: im scared of the dark yams
[2025-08-26T22:05:33] Yamal: I have done many routes at night, and you can feel calm, it's cool.
[2025-08-26T22:29:48] Rose: Hey there Ma√Øck, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-26T22:42:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: Haha I won't tease anything
[2025-08-26T22:42:56] ausias: Heck!!!!
[2025-08-26T22:43:14] ausias: even date???
[2025-08-26T22:43:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nami RS is a lot of mastic on the frame and fiberglass, impossible to disassemble and quite fragile
[2025-08-26T22:44:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: Only for show
[2025-08-26T22:44:46] ausias: got it
[2025-08-26T22:44:55] ausias: thought It was meant for race
[2025-08-26T22:47:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's what they claimed when they made it, but the reality is very different when you see it
[2025-08-26T22:47:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Beginning of october you'll see teasing üò∂
[2025-08-26T22:47:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Or maybe end of September, will depend
[2025-08-26T23:55:47] LiquorHole .: Yeah looking at the clearance i can definitely put hope tech 4 v4 on their and the Gr4s
[2025-08-26T23:57:08] LiquorHole .: Mine doesn‚Äôt wobble I use the same tire and Motor size but mines HM not whatever the fuck that old motor is, They stopped using that and switched to Hm
[2025-08-26T23:57:49] Noname: You can see the tire is lumpy
[2025-08-26T23:58:31] LiquorHole .: Probably the tire not seated right mine dont even vibrate or shake or Anything, atleast before my crash
[2025-08-26T23:58:42] Noname: This is the front tire, way less play
[2025-08-27T00:04:10] haku: not alot of choices for 13"
[2025-08-27T00:04:13] haku: get fucked

[2025-08-27T01:10:40] haku: im am a member and a devout follower of benjamin. unlike you i have never been tempted by farfar demons
[2025-08-27T01:10:56] haku: ty for the link
[2025-08-27T01:18:14] Yamal: Pretty nice
[2025-08-27T01:20:46] Rose: Hey there Ma√Øck, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-27T01:21:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: I think you'll like it
[2025-08-27T01:21:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes ‚ò∫Ô∏è
[2025-08-27T01:22:28] LiquorHole .: The length from the caliber to the Lever is over 1500mm though right?
[2025-08-27T01:22:48] LiquorHole .: Cause ill be buying it September it‚Äôs in my budget now
[2025-08-27T01:23:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: 2m is I remember correctly
[2025-08-27T01:23:47] LiquorHole .: Plenty, Alright thanks üëçüèæ
[2025-08-27T02:12:59] ausias: im super hyped
[2025-08-27T02:36:33] Matthew: Yeah, was just to get a different quote. The problem is I dont know batteries and the dimensions i gave amorge they came back with that. I just told them I want minimum of 120amps battery constant and anymore than that is great. When they gave me that quote I ask about 21700 cells and was asking about eve40p and they told me they won't fit. And since I dont want to get what I have no clue about I just let them roll with that quote. Id rather pay @haku to build me a battery that will fit in the g30p i am building. I have a grinder and can just grind the inside rails off to have the most room possible.
[2025-08-27T05:58:19] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-08-27T05:58:56] Yamal: Only Wednesday,,,
[2025-08-27T05:59:18] Yamal: Let's see if the weekend arrives soon !!!
[2025-08-27T06:00:06] Yamal: It seems perfect for small projects, or to replace any standard scooter controller.
[2025-08-27T06:05:00] haku: this will be a banger for small peak g30 low powered projects
[2025-08-27T06:07:15] Yamal: Nice
[2025-08-27T06:07:24] Yamal: 50A continuos
[2025-08-27T06:07:31] Yamal: 100A dual
[2025-08-27T06:08:19] Yamal: Waiting for the full specifications of that controller
[2025-08-27T06:08:36] Yamal: Is like stock battery of Dualtron
[2025-08-27T06:11:57] Yamal: Vs Alu lite ?
[2025-08-27T06:14:48] haku: smaller and more compact this vedder version
[2025-08-27T06:14:54] haku: seems like
[2025-08-27T06:15:48] haku: maybe when i put peak g30 lil niggas edition on full production. ill use these
[2025-08-27T06:16:14] haku: price is not bad at all
[2025-08-27T06:21:07] Noname: 50a less vs 100/100 open components and 50$ more idk
[2025-08-27T06:27:45] haku: its battery amps dude. read it
[2025-08-27T06:28:02] Noname: Yeah its half
[2025-08-27T06:28:28] haku: oh
[2025-08-27T06:28:38] haku: so 100/100 better then
[2025-08-27T06:28:55] Noname: Bigger by a smidgen but better buy
[2025-08-27T06:29:19] haku: this thing so tiny though. for 1 48v or 36v kids bike it should be plenty
[2025-08-27T06:29:21] Noname: If you need micro size like a penis new one is good
[2025-08-27T06:29:39] Noname: Yeah but why if you dont need tiny
[2025-08-27T06:29:57] Noname: Your battery box is fucking huge anyway
[2025-08-27T06:30:00] haku: peak g30 needs to be tiny for kids
[2025-08-27T06:30:09] haku: yea your right
[2025-08-27T06:30:15] Noname: That 10 grams makes a difference?
[2025-08-27T06:30:24] haku: true dat
[2025-08-27T06:30:50] Noname: Take the 3 quarters out of your pocket and your =
[2025-08-27T06:31:01] haku: broke?
[2025-08-27T06:31:14] haku: is that the answer?
[2025-08-27T06:31:55] Noname: That would be good for an rc car
[2025-08-27T06:32:16] haku: no i bet he still caters to the eskate boys
[2025-08-27T06:32:49] haku: thats where vesc originated anyways
[2025-08-27T06:43:21] Yamal: So Alu lite can push safe 100A battery ?
[2025-08-27T06:44:06] Arnau Martinez Casals: No, 130 phase is safe Max o thinck
[2025-08-27T06:44:28] Arnau Martinez Casals: I never pased 110 phase and 70 bat on 100/100
[2025-08-27T06:45:49] Yamal: <photos/photo_25622@27-08-2025_06-45-49.jpg>
[2025-08-27T06:47:12] Yamal: Today I think I did a better 0-100 acceleration test, but I forgot to record the screen and out of anger I stopped later to do another one with less luck.
[2025-08-27T06:47:32] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-08-27T06:48:23] haku: yep need 100/100 regular 6fet too big for the triangle unless i mount it sideways.
[2025-08-27T06:49:42] haku: becuase the box is 3d printed. not welded. with small ring thingys. Noname look what you made me do!
[2025-08-27T06:50:26] haku: even 100/100 might be too tight since caps sticking out
[2025-08-27T06:51:06] Unknown: there is no too tight for u
[2025-08-27T06:51:20] haku: i dont want to do vesc on nuts on my only boy. the heir to the throne of gondor

[2025-08-27T07:39:05] Yamal: I'm also looking forward to trying these controllers with Inffineon Toll MOSFET at 22s, and if they could do 250 A battery and 400 phase, that would be great.
[2025-08-27T08:00:41] Unknown: 85250?

[2025-08-27T09:44:09] Dualtron Achilleus: How much you get it$$
[2025-08-27T09:44:42] Jason: free
[2025-08-27T09:44:47] Jason: from someone I know
[2025-08-27T12:50:59] Nawfal: hey guys. I was wondering if i can switch between single or dual motor by adding an on/off button to each controller (84100hp and 84200hp). There won‚Äôt be any problem right? Since when a controller is off, the motor will still be running and that could generate a negative current
[2025-08-27T13:26:14] Dualtron Achilleus: On the spinted green module there is single dual mod, idk if it work on flipshit
[2025-08-27T15:29:43] Yamal: <video_file>

[2025-08-27T16:21:34] Yamal: Something just came to my mind now, no joke, currently there are no BMS for continuous 770A, right?
[2025-08-27T16:31:23] 'lekrsu': Probably not in the size & price you want it. Still need to fuse it and use a charge-only board at least.

[2025-08-27T19:31:12] Yamal: Hey
[2025-08-27T19:31:24] Yamal: We talking about battery not A phase
[2025-08-27T19:31:40] Yamal: Power battery
[2025-08-27T19:31:48] Yamal: Control A phase xD
[2025-08-27T19:32:35] Yamal: but if it pushes 400/450 A, let it not be for a few seconds, let it be all the time
[2025-08-27T19:32:44] Yamal: M√†ma battery
[2025-08-27T19:32:46] Yamal: Hehe
[2025-08-27T19:33:27] Dualtron Achilleus: For 450 you need like 200/250 bat only
[2025-08-27T19:34:42] puneDir: Open source it like us :(
[2025-08-27T19:35:24] puneDir: Nice to see our code is still getting used :)
[2025-08-27T19:40:29] Yamal: Per controller your mean right ?

[2025-08-27T21:31:01] Yamal: table-sized heatsink ^^
[2025-08-27T21:33:28] AG.racing: Hi everyone, what is the best solution between just soldering with tin or crimping with a piece of 0.2mm copper folded back on itself to make 0.8mm for example and crimping it with pliers for motor phase wiring?
[2025-08-27T21:35:12] Unknown: I know right
[2025-08-27T21:35:22] Unknown: Seems crazy to me
[2025-08-27T21:37:14] Marius: just get this
[2025-08-27T21:38:58] Yamal: ?
[2025-08-27T21:40:40] Marius: cooling fan

[2025-08-27T22:28:29] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah per
[2025-08-27T22:28:42] Dualtron Achilleus: Far for 770a continus xd
[2025-08-27T22:29:08] Yamal: No really
[2025-08-27T22:29:14] Yamal: You say 250
[2025-08-27T22:29:18] Dualtron Achilleus: More like 500peak
[2025-08-27T22:29:20] Yamal: So 500
[2025-08-27T22:29:24] Yamal: Total
[2025-08-27T22:29:27] Dualtron Achilleus: And you want 770a continus lul
[2025-08-27T22:29:46] Yamal: Continus
[2025-08-27T22:30:35] Yamal: 550 A continuous limit ant BMS xD

[2025-08-27T23:10:30] RicharDON: anyone selling x2 motor 11‚Äù?
[2025-08-27T23:53:58] Matthew: I am using 16s 90amps battery and 130amps phase with 145amps abs.
[2025-08-27T23:59:00] JPPL: About AntBms, there is a V2 app that seems to BE to add new boards support, not My case.
[2025-08-27T23:59:00] JPPL: https://www.amorge.com/bluetooth-apps
[2025-08-27T23:59:39] JPPL: The download v1 and v2 links are switched
[2025-08-28T00:06:54] Matthew: But I have really good cooling. I dont know what others are getting.
[2025-08-28T00:14:07] Yamal: 16 s ?p
[2025-08-28T00:14:13] Yamal: Wich cell
[2025-08-28T00:16:07] Matthew: Its a generic 16s7p 31.5Ah pack from Yume scooters. 90 amps continuous
[2025-08-28T00:17:13] Matthew: To be clear, this is what I am using
[2025-08-28T00:17:45] Yamal: I thought you were using 86/250
[2025-08-28T00:17:49] Yamal: Pretty
[2025-08-28T00:17:52] Yamal: Nice
[2025-08-28T00:18:25] Yamal: Power you get?
[2025-08-28T00:18:27] Matthew: I have am 85250 controller. I am not using it on my g30lp though because I am running rear suspension
[2025-08-28T00:19:30] Matthew: Highest I hit with Ortega original observer 59xx watts and with mxlemming i am getting 52xx watts
[2025-08-28T00:20:16] Yamal: 5900wwts
[2025-08-28T00:20:42] Yamal: Same lekrsu
[2025-08-28T00:20:51] Matthew: I was running no rear suspension with 85250. 17x4 at 220phase and definitely can not chill as backflip with 100% throttle is wild haha.
[2025-08-28T00:22:17] Matthew: This is with Ortega observer
[2025-08-28T00:22:49] Matthew: I have raised field weakening to 50amps @87% from 40amps. And top speed is 45mph.
[2025-08-28T00:23:50] Yamal: The good thing about Vesc is that if you have a good feel with the accelerator, it is the most progressive electronics there is
[2025-08-28T00:24:01] Yamal: Alu lite right
[2025-08-28T00:24:38] Matthew: Yes
[2025-08-28T00:25:08] Matthew: I love the parameters we can change to suit our minds and setups
[2025-08-28T00:25:53] Matthew: 85250 will be resurrecting my yume y11+ when I get a job and lonnyo 70h.
[2025-08-28T00:26:30] Yamal: I need prepare my g2 with 17/4 too
[2025-08-28T00:26:47] Matthew: Also ambient temps for that log was around 35¬∞c
[2025-08-28T00:26:49] Yamal: You really have the engines ?
[2025-08-28T00:27:14] Matthew: I will be buying the 70h. Rn I have 65h 17x4 and 22x3
[2025-08-28T00:27:24] Matthew: I also have 2 vsett motors
[2025-08-28T00:27:55] Matthew: I will be putting 22x3 on my g30p build thats getting speedforks and stuff.
[2025-08-28T00:28:31] Matthew: Gonna get a 2nd 65h 22x3 for the g30p even though ive talked a ton of shit about dual motor
[2025-08-28T00:29:35] Matthew: I fried 2 of the factory yume y11 motors trying to run high power single motor. So its just gonna sit until 70h is in my hands
[2025-08-28T00:31:02] Matthew: This is my current status
[2025-08-28T00:31:27] Matthew: <photos/photo_25633@28-08-2025_00-31-27.jpg>
[2025-08-28T00:33:13] Yamal: White one look like dual motor ?
[2025-08-28T00:33:32] Yamal: Also have Xiaomi ?
[2025-08-28T00:37:04] Matthew: Yes and no. The front has the vsett motor but im just using it as a rim. G30lp is using 65h 17x4 and just has the vsett motor for a rim. I need to find a rim that will fit in front. The grey/white one is g30lp. Left to the pic is g30p thats just waiting for money to be thrown at it. I have jrev rear fender. I already have hydraulic brakes kit and 160mm rotors. I need a front rim for it too otherwise I have another vsett motor I am using as just a rim, but this ring cracked on me so I need to buy one of them rings too.
[2025-08-28T00:37:26] Matthew: <photos/photo_25634@28-08-2025_00-37-26.jpg>
[2025-08-28T00:37:53] Matthew: I have g30p, g30lp, and yume y11+
[2025-08-28T00:45:51] haku: i see amel is a fellow engineer
[2025-08-28T00:46:06] Marius: yes 100%
[2025-08-28T00:47:50] haku: this how i use to mount mine on a 2mm alumium behind the battery. peak engineering
[2025-08-28T00:49:05] Yamal: Rim better than engine
[2025-08-28T00:49:40] Yamal: an idle engine offers resistance
[2025-08-28T00:50:45] Yamal: Wepoor !!!
[2025-08-28T00:51:20] haku: those vescs will be on the v3 yams. wepoor still deciding on whats best and affordable
[2025-08-28T00:52:26] Yamal: Mount 70h too on v3
[2025-08-28T00:53:29] haku: no idea. maybe in the future ill test it lol
[2025-08-28T00:55:18] haku: it will fit a peak g30 frame with a skinny rim
[2025-08-28T00:58:30] Matthew: Yeah, and a bunch more weight. I am gonna change the front tire to a street 11" , rn it has 11" offroad tire and its tracking on the road sucks. I had a mantis nice spoked rim but I couldnt get it to go together and got tired of busting open my knuckles so I threw that rim away. Seen @Bradhaku had a rim the other day asking about the axle length... thats something I want.
[2025-08-28T01:04:09] haku: wich rim?
[2025-08-28T01:43:30] LiquorHole .: How much phase amps you were pushing
[2025-08-28T01:43:50] haku: 250bat 300phase
[2025-08-28T01:44:34] LiquorHole .: Nice
[2025-08-28T01:44:58] LiquorHole .: Im still trying to decide how much phase i need for mine
[2025-08-28T01:45:40] LiquorHole .: I was planning on using 600-800 phase amps cause of the weight but i don‚Äôt know how crazy that is so ill see when the time comes lol
[2025-08-28T01:46:14] haku: 800for both motors should be doable
[2025-08-28T01:46:31] haku: just watch temps
[2025-08-28T01:46:41] LiquorHole .: No the Controllers thats what im worried about lol
[2025-08-28T01:46:42] haku: depends on vesc too
[2025-08-28T01:46:51] LiquorHole .: Spintend 85250 v2
[2025-08-28T01:47:08] haku: no. i dont think so
[2025-08-28T01:47:12] LiquorHole .: Im going to use their Heatsinks they also have fans built into it but still
[2025-08-28T01:47:27] haku: dont buy the fans haha
[2025-08-28T01:47:41] haku: amy will oversell you shit
[2025-08-28T01:47:57] LiquorHole .: Their worse then just using the regular heatsink? Or just overpriced or something
[2025-08-28T01:47:58] haku: fuses fans heatsinks
[2025-08-28T01:48:16] haku: mount on the frame if theres space
[2025-08-28T01:48:30] haku: or make heatsinks like the racing boys
[2025-08-28T01:49:14] LiquorHole .: Theirs enough space i think
[2025-08-28T01:49:33] haku: spent too much on big titty amy. she got me
[2025-08-28T01:50:22] haku: but i respect the hustle. good buissness lady
[2025-08-28T01:50:34] LiquorHole .: üòÇ
[2025-08-28T01:51:00] LiquorHole .: <photos/photo_25635@28-08-2025_01-51-00.jpg>
[2025-08-28T01:51:17] LiquorHole .: Was gonna buy those cause my frame Also has airflow for the controllers
[2025-08-28T01:51:29] haku: no idea. if that will work tbh
[2025-08-28T01:52:16] LiquorHole .: It better work
[2025-08-28T01:52:39] LiquorHole .: If not then I just have a heatsink
[2025-08-28T01:53:18] haku: heatsinks are meant to have airflow from outside. if inside the deck not good from what ive read
[2025-08-28T01:53:59] LiquorHole .: My frame is Good then
[2025-08-28T01:54:07] LiquorHole .: It got airflow and exhaust lol
[2025-08-28T01:54:08] LiquorHole .: Ram air
[2025-08-28T01:54:41] haku: cold air intake. im not pro at vesc tbh.
[2025-08-28T01:55:04] LiquorHole .: Air is air it will have to do üòÇ
[2025-08-28T01:57:22] Matthew: You will have positive results.
[2025-08-28T01:59:17] Matthew: I thought it was you that had a rim and you were asking about what size axle is needed... maybe im dreaming.
[2025-08-28T02:04:46] haku: maybe we are both dreaming haha
[2025-08-28T02:09:19] Noname: Bike was refunded. Says if I still recieve to dispose of it lol. Yeah ok
[2025-08-28T02:11:34] haku: hahahahha
[2025-08-28T02:11:45] Noname: Fans dont work mounted against a wall lol
[2025-08-28T02:11:47] haku: i wish it was real too
[2025-08-28T02:12:31] Noname: The bike?
[2025-08-28T02:12:49] haku: yea
[2025-08-28T02:12:58] haku: not a scam
[2025-08-28T02:13:23] Noname: Well I got my money anyway
[2025-08-28T02:13:38] haku: good!
[2025-08-28T02:14:05] haku: now use that money to buy peak g30 frame
[2025-08-28T02:14:22] Noname: Well Ill see in 2 days if it hits my account anyway
[2025-08-28T02:14:27] Noname: No
[2025-08-28T02:23:16] LiquorHole .: Wasn‚Äôt planning on doing that Was Gonna Put the controllers on the walls of the controller box and put the heatsink in the airway of the Box so it can suck it into the heatsink
[2025-08-28T02:25:15] Noname: I meant the fans being against the heatsink.
[2025-08-28T02:25:27] Noname: Idk how thats supposed to work
[2025-08-28T02:25:59] Noname: Fans aren't efficient flat against something
[2025-08-28T02:38:09] haku: tell that to my pc case.
[2025-08-28T02:38:52] Noname: Hakus PC case fans dont generally work efficiently against a wall
[2025-08-28T02:38:59] haku: stupid pc case design
[2025-08-28T02:39:19] Noname: So they dont work well?
[2025-08-28T02:39:28] haku: nope. useless
[2025-08-28T02:39:42] Noname: No they make noise
[2025-08-28T02:44:02] LiquorHole .: Both>
[2025-08-28T03:00:15] Matthew: Very true.
[2025-08-28T03:56:04] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_25637@28-08-2025_03-56-04.jpg>

[2025-08-28T05:13:54] Yamal: Power Nami
[2025-08-28T05:19:13] Yamal: Tomorrow Friday !!!!!!!!! Finally üòÑ
[2025-08-28T05:25:47] Franchesco Carofano: Yamal vibrates a lot forward, I'm going to have to do king fixed suspension forward.
[2025-08-28T05:28:56] Yamal: ?
[2025-08-28T05:29:25] Yamal: aluminum plate?
[2025-08-28T05:30:00] Yamal: How are the new engines? You're almost on the moon.
[2025-08-28T05:30:04] Yamal: üòÅ
[2025-08-28T05:32:04] Yamal: But I think if it vibrates excessively it needs to be checked. You have the standard opening and axle, and that shouldn't be happening to you...
[2025-08-28T05:34:11] Yamal: I think SHAOTAO is getting out of hand with too many modified Namis
[2025-08-28T05:34:57] Yamal: I am forced to visit the factory with a stopover in Sweden
[2025-08-28T05:35:19] Yamal: vesclabs in the suitcase

[2025-08-28T07:03:26] haku: how many cycles you have on that
[2025-08-28T07:03:32] Yamal: I check now the old photo
[2025-08-28T07:03:41] Yamal: How you check that
[2025-08-28T07:04:11] haku: no idea tbh. im sure your at 500 if you charge everyday
[2025-08-28T07:05:00] Yamal: But one cycle is 0-100 right
[2025-08-28T07:05:10] haku: yea
[2025-08-28T07:05:20] Yamal: Not 80 to 100 for example
[2025-08-28T07:05:30] haku: 20% to full or 80% is what i consider a cycle
[2025-08-28T07:05:53] Yamal: So I don‚Äôt have too many
[2025-08-28T07:05:59] Yamal: Only for the long routes
[2025-08-28T07:06:04] haku: gotcha
[2025-08-28T07:06:17] haku: anyaways. good stuff as always.

[2025-08-28T10:32:57] Dualtron Achilleus: Do you think this metal frame can handle a 30kw peak qs or sotion motor? If i put aditional metal on arm for torque
[2025-08-28T10:44:07] sombre_enfant: Hollow ?
[2025-08-28T10:52:41] Yamal: !!!

[2025-08-28T12:20:48] Yamal: Very nice
[2025-08-28T12:20:59] Yamal: Also look no really big ..
[2025-08-28T12:36:21] Noname: Be funny if it still shows up though
[2025-08-28T13:19:46] Marius: daaamn
[2025-08-28T13:19:52] Marius: what are the specs for this??
[2025-08-28T13:26:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: 1200a peak , 500a batt
[2025-08-28T13:28:41] Marius: fit in g30? ü§£ü§£
[2025-08-28T13:30:24] AG.racing: @SibClimb For the phase connectors inside the motor, is it best to solder with tin or crimp with copper or a combination of the two?
[2025-08-28T13:53:04] Amel Hodzic: boi. it was a good idea
[2025-08-28T13:53:20] Marius: 100% peak engineering
[2025-08-28T13:53:42] Marius: but actually impressive i could never fit that in mine
[2025-08-28T13:54:01] Amel Hodzic: only 1P difference tho
[2025-08-28T13:54:29] Marius: yeah idk, my front is all filled up especially now with the xt60 for charging
[2025-08-28T13:54:48] Amel Hodzic: i dont struggle much to fit everything
[2025-08-28T13:55:03] Amel Hodzic: i can push phases etc down the rail hole
[2025-08-28T13:55:31] Marius: i dont either but i def cant fit a fan now
[2025-08-28T13:55:41] Marius: but gonna fit arduino gonna be easy next to bms
[2025-08-28T13:55:56] Amel Hodzic: is it really that tight in there
[2025-08-28T13:56:07] Marius: its tight but not difficult to fit everything
[2025-08-28T13:56:12] Marius: once u know how to do it
[2025-08-28T13:56:45] Marius: <photos/photo_25642@28-08-2025_13-56-45.jpg>
[2025-08-28T13:57:17] Amel Hodzic: you have the jrev spacer?
[2025-08-28T13:57:29] Marius: yeah
[2025-08-28T13:57:38] Marius: its good for the rear cuz theres this exra space for batt cables
[2025-08-28T13:57:40] Amel Hodzic: oh okay
[2025-08-28T13:57:57] Amel Hodzic: nice
[2025-08-28T13:59:01] Marius: but the fit is just awful it doesnt align with the frame at all and ive heard this from all the ppl who use it
[2025-08-28T13:59:06] Marius: patrick spacer is much better
[2025-08-28T13:59:18] Amel Hodzic: whats patrick spacer?
[2025-08-28T13:59:21] Amel Hodzic: is it the same as finns
[2025-08-28T13:59:39] Marius: no its jrev style
[2025-08-28T13:59:42] Marius: but actually fits
[2025-08-28T14:37:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: I do a combination of 2
[2025-08-28T14:39:18] Yamal: Still working ?
[2025-08-28T14:39:32] AG.racing: Oküëçüèª
[2025-08-28T14:39:41] Marius: yes but i wasnt able to ride the past few days due to bad weather
[2025-08-28T14:39:46] Marius: shits not waterproof üòÇ
[2025-08-28T14:40:30] AG.racing: What do you think? It's already very good and I'm going to weld in it
[2025-08-28T14:40:42] Yamal: How the scooter works, power // phase // battery, top speed, acceleration
[2025-08-28T14:40:52] Yamal: Same me,,,
[2025-08-28T14:41:14] Marius: for now max power 21kw 500a phase and 102kmh
[2025-08-28T14:41:26] Yamal: 33/2 engines ?
[2025-08-28T14:41:30] Marius: yeah
[2025-08-28T14:41:43] Marius: i will push it more now that i have light, i can go outside town on bigger roads
[2025-08-28T14:55:06] Yamal: Very cool the amount of powerful G30s there are
[2025-08-28T14:55:59] Yamal: Discreet, light scooter and 130/140kmh I think you could do
[2025-08-28T14:57:46] Marius: 100% but nobody has the balls rn
[2025-08-28T14:58:04] Marius: roger did like 135 and after that nobody did anything üò≠üò≠
[2025-08-28T15:00:08] Unknown: u do
[2025-08-28T15:00:25] Marius: will see on weekend
[2025-08-28T15:00:36] Marius: we go balls to walls
[2025-08-28T15:00:39] Marius: already found 2 sigma roads
[2025-08-28T15:04:12] Yamal: is it stable?
[2025-08-28T15:04:18] Yamal: Nami not
[2025-08-28T15:04:19] Marius: yeah
[2025-08-28T15:04:28] Marius: when theres bumps in the road its bad tho
[2025-08-28T15:04:36] Marius: like with small handlebar u lose control easily, i will get wider one
[2025-08-28T15:04:44] Yamal: Find good road
[2025-08-28T15:04:56] Marius: like when u accelerate and go up a small bump, ur front lifts and u can crash
[2025-08-28T15:05:02] Yamal: 84v lest go
[2025-08-28T15:05:03] Yamal: Hehe
[2025-08-28T15:05:05] Marius: yes will
[2025-08-28T15:05:25] Unknown: front spins like crazy on a small bump too
[2025-08-28T15:06:21] Yamal: Traction control
[2025-08-28T15:06:25] Yamal: 11k
[2025-08-28T15:08:33] Unknown: 11k?
[2025-08-28T15:09:13] Yamal: 11.000 rpm
[2025-08-28T15:09:58] Yamal: Send some photo of your beast man
[2025-08-28T15:10:06] Marius: haha it looks shit
[2025-08-28T15:10:06] Nobrrr: Bruh I have tc set to 3500
[2025-08-28T15:10:13] Marius: havent done anything to it except make it drive
[2025-08-28T15:10:27] Marius: why set tc to anything?
[2025-08-28T15:10:33] Marius: doesnt it just limit to rear rpm anyway, since rear doesnt spin
[2025-08-28T15:11:00] Nobrrr: Should I set higher? @jamaludin_algarnati do you have experience with the TC value? Front tc 3500 I set and rear off
[2025-08-28T15:12:13] Yamal: 11k is very good for me now I‚Äôm 17k for try get good acceleration,, but less better , for no spinning
[2025-08-28T15:12:42] Nobrrr: Without tc it‚Äôs like impossible to drive
[2025-08-28T15:12:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes it looks okay
[2025-08-28T15:13:09] Nobrrr: Do you guys set tc on your rmx for example?
[2025-08-28T15:13:34] Marius: <photos/photo_25644@28-08-2025_15-13-34.jpg>
[2025-08-28T15:13:53] 'lekrsu': How will you weld it? Looks interesting ^^
[2025-08-28T15:15:34] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: just configure it on the local controller
[2025-08-28T15:15:52] Dxniel: Rich üî•‚ù§Ô∏è
[2025-08-28T15:16:56] Marius: 3 of those tires probably cost as much as 1 of yours ü§£
[2025-08-28T15:19:35] Marius: when i turned on tc on front i dont think it did anything
[2025-08-28T15:19:39] Marius: only when i enabled it on both
[2025-08-28T15:21:59] AG.racing: I crimped it with a copper terminal that I cut, yes I will solder tin inside to be sure
[2025-08-28T15:22:04] Rose: Hey there Best, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-28T15:22:11] AG.racing: <photos/photo_25645@28-08-2025_15-22-11.jpg>
[2025-08-28T15:23:58] Marius: so u put windings and 10awg in there and crimp it?
[2025-08-28T15:24:13] AG.racing: Yes Exactly
[2025-08-28T15:24:41] AG.racing: It's nothing great, just crimped, not even welded.
[2025-08-28T15:24:56] AG.racing: but I'm still going to weld for safety
[2025-08-28T15:25:27] AG.racing: <video_file>
[2025-08-28T15:25:43] Marius: wheres the phase
[2025-08-28T15:25:44] Marius: lol
[2025-08-28T15:26:12] AG.racing: This connection is the connection of the 3 phases together in the motor
[2025-08-28T15:26:35] AG.racing: <video_file>
[2025-08-28T15:27:14] Marius: yeah i never understood that
[2025-08-28T15:27:18] AG.racing: What is the best place to put a temperature sensor? The main thing is that it is as close as possible to the inside of the winding, right?
[2025-08-28T15:27:20] Marius: i just took the lose ends and soldered the phases
[2025-08-28T15:27:47] Marius: probably inside winding would be best yeah
[2025-08-28T15:27:51] Marius: i put mine on top of winding
[2025-08-28T15:29:47] Yamal: Pretty cool ! Weight?
[2025-08-28T15:30:14] Marius: lemme check
[2025-08-28T15:33:07] AG.racing: Yes i think üëçüèª
[2025-08-28T15:33:39] Marius: 33kg
[2025-08-28T15:42:16] Unknown: stolen numbers
[2025-08-28T15:42:26] Amel Hodzic: mine was higher
[2025-08-28T15:42:39] Unknown: 5mm stainless steel plate btw
[2025-08-28T15:42:52] Amel Hodzic: i meant weight
[2025-08-28T15:43:10] Unknown: yes bcs u have a 5mm steel plate
[2025-08-28T15:43:13] Unknown: bruh
[2025-08-28T15:43:16] Amel Hodzic: ohh
[2025-08-28T15:43:24] Unknown: i have 3mm alu
[2025-08-28T15:43:25] Amel Hodzic: its alu
[2025-08-28T15:43:28] Amel Hodzic: but yea
[2025-08-28T15:43:31] Unknown: u sure
[2025-08-28T15:43:34] Amel Hodzic: yes
[2025-08-28T15:43:36] Amel Hodzic: finn made it
[2025-08-28T15:43:40] Unknown: kk
[2025-08-28T15:43:46] Unknown: i thought u had steel
[2025-08-28T15:43:51] Amel Hodzic: and its not magnetic at all
[2025-08-28T15:43:55] Amel Hodzic: so it should be alu
[2025-08-28T15:47:52] Marius: nah i just weighed it
[2025-08-28T15:48:02] Marius: üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
[2025-08-28T15:48:28] Marius: are ur escs on the plate
[2025-08-28T15:48:30] Marius: or still chilling inside
[2025-08-28T15:50:18] Amel Hodzic: they are not screwed onto the plate
[2025-08-28T15:50:27] Amel Hodzic: but their chilling
[2025-08-28T15:51:14] Marius: are they pushed against the plate?
[2025-08-28T15:51:20] Marius: they need to be on the plate somehow
[2025-08-28T15:51:20] Amel Hodzic: yes
[2025-08-28T15:51:23] Marius: ok good
[2025-08-28T15:51:32] Amel Hodzic: the battery is pushing them
[2025-08-28T15:51:36] 'lekrsu': Will a short on 3.3v/gnd damage a throttle and brake hall sensor?
[2025-08-28T15:51:53] Marius: ye same
[2025-08-28T15:51:56] Marius: just gota put thermal paste
[2025-08-28T15:52:17] 'lekrsu': An expected 40uF line measures instead 1 ohm
[2025-08-28T15:52:25] Marius: tbh ground clearance is so good kinda wanna get thicker alu
[2025-08-28T15:52:27] Marius: 3mm is pretty bad
[2025-08-28T15:52:39] Marius: or 3mm with heatsink
[2025-08-28T15:53:06] Amel Hodzic: the ground clearence is not my favorite tbh
[2025-08-28T15:57:46] Unknown: mm pushing onto the jst connectors very nice
[2025-08-28T15:58:03] Amel Hodzic: mmm its not actually i have a esc spacer
[2025-08-28T15:58:07] Amel Hodzic: that protects them
[2025-08-28T15:58:08] Unknown: how are ur temps
[2025-08-28T15:58:52] Nobrrr: Same that‚Äôs why I have 25mm now which is way better
[2025-08-28T15:58:57] Marius: shit
[2025-08-28T15:59:03] Marius: but i dont have thermal paste so
[2025-08-28T15:59:13] Marius: the alu plate does pretty much nothing without the paste
[2025-08-28T15:59:15] Amel Hodzic: but that wont fit with my setup tho
[2025-08-28T15:59:19] Marius: heat transfer to the alu is non existent
[2025-08-28T16:00:17] Marius: 25mm def is possible
[2025-08-28T16:00:52] Amel Hodzic: prob but will be really tight
[2025-08-28T16:01:02] Nobrrr: You have 85240 so ig no
[2025-08-28T16:01:15] Amel Hodzic: yea
[2025-08-28T16:02:23] Unknown: define shit
[2025-08-28T16:02:29] Amel Hodzic: brown
[2025-08-28T16:02:32] Amel Hodzic: smells bad
[2025-08-28T16:02:32] Unknown: 60C?
[2025-08-28T16:02:45] Unknown: <sticker>
[2025-08-28T16:03:31] Marius: 54c
[2025-08-28T16:04:12] Marius: itll be way better with paste
[2025-08-28T16:05:01] Unknown: how were u driving? 0-100 a lot?
[2025-08-28T16:05:11] Marius: i guess
[2025-08-28T16:05:17] Marius: but it also wasnt hot outside
[2025-08-28T16:05:23] Marius: so it wouldve been way worse
[2025-08-28T16:11:46] Unknown: thermal paste then
[2025-08-28T16:11:48] Unknown: now
[2025-08-28T16:16:51] Marius: nah
[2025-08-28T16:16:57] Marius: too lazy
[2025-08-28T16:17:59] Marius: weekend balls to walls no thermal paste
[2025-08-28T16:23:00] Amel Hodzic: 120 kmh?
[2025-08-28T16:24:16] Marius: hopefully
[2025-08-28T16:24:19] Marius: we already found good road so
[2025-08-28T16:25:24] Nobrrr: We?
[2025-08-28T16:25:37] Marius: my homies
[2025-08-28T16:25:43] Marius: kugoo owners
[2025-08-28T16:25:57] Marius: ima visit them from friday to sunday we go balls to walls there
[2025-08-28T16:26:44] Unknown: bros got more friends than me
[2025-08-28T16:26:51] Marius: they are from fortnite random duos
[2025-08-28T16:27:38] Rose: Hey there Lennard, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-28T16:40:09] Nobrrr: Really? No friends from school and sports or so?

[2025-08-28T17:16:38] IMWurden: what Is the best for torque at 20s 300A? 22x3, 33x2, 17x4 or other?
[2025-08-28T17:35:54] Hendrik: Is it possible to limit how fast the motor can spool up? So that I can have enough torque to climb steep hills, but don't get crazy acceleration when going on a flat surface?
[2025-08-28T17:41:21] Amel Hodzic: 22x3
[2025-08-28T17:41:41] Amel Hodzic: 17x4 cant do 300A. atleast not 65H
[2025-08-28T17:46:56] Marius: yeah either 22x3 or 17x4

[2025-08-28T19:41:51] haku: and ammend your sins
[2025-08-28T20:14:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think not, if they made the power stage so small probably they removed much ceramics and tvs , which could make the controller more unstable. But upon I don't see the power stage I don't judge

[2025-08-28T20:31:25] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: My 70h rear engine was getting very hot.
[2025-08-28T20:31:43] Dualtron Achilleus: Cuz its so 2023
[2025-08-28T20:31:55] haku: lol
[2025-08-28T20:31:57] Dualtron Achilleus: Now your in 2026 with 100h my man
[2025-08-28T20:32:04] Dualtron Achilleus: Ready for futur

[2025-08-28T20:33:20] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I don't have the engine, nor the BMS that has broken ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2025-08-28T20:34:18] Dualtron Achilleus: Bms broken?
[2025-08-28T20:37:18] haku: your nami not running?
[2025-08-28T20:45:33] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Yes

[2025-08-28T20:47:46] haku: i see
[2025-08-28T20:49:17] haku: also if you have time and wouldnt mind. would you be able to open the 70h. i just want to see windings because i have same motor. see if mine will cook too
[2025-08-28T20:49:41] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: It doesn't control the discharge. I don't risk breaking a controller without managing the discharge. I already ordered a new BMS.
[2025-08-28T20:49:52] haku: agreed
[2025-08-28T20:50:36] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I'm sure it will be very dark when I open it, I'll post photos.
[2025-08-28T20:51:04] haku: i see. thanks bro
[2025-08-28T20:51:40] haku: what was the temps it was reaching?
[2025-08-28T20:53:09] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I didn't know, the controller doesn't detect the rear hall, I looked at the temperature as it was done in the past by putting my hand on the engine but I couldn't hold it for more than 1 second or I would run out of fingertips ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2025-08-28T20:59:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: What was the error
[2025-08-28T21:12:01] Pandalgns: The only one I've seen burnt is my 84200 due to a short in the motor phases that grounded to the chassis, but the ones I see burning a lot are the spintends.... I'll leave it there üòÇüòÇ
[2025-08-28T21:12:48] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I think the discharge fest broke when I cut it off it does nothing, it continues to give voltage, we'll see when I change it
[2025-08-28T21:13:00] Pandalgns: Now the next test will be to test my 84200 to the limit with 22s and 300a of phase or more
[2025-08-28T21:13:39] haku: vesc is good? no phase shorts?
[2025-08-28T21:17:16] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: the controller seems to be fine
[2025-08-28T21:18:00] haku: thats great. cant wait to see this badboy running again
[2025-08-28T21:18:10] haku: now on 100h gadam
[2025-08-28T21:28:41] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Well, not everything is bull ü§£
[2025-08-28T21:40:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: My friend burned one when bms cut
[2025-08-28T21:51:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: Send pm
[2025-08-28T22:07:12] Pandalgns: I once heard about that problem, that if the BMS cut out while riding the scooter, it could burn out. I don't remember if it was with the MKS, the Flipsky or which ones, but I don't understand why that happens.

[2025-08-30T02:25:27] Andi: Hey üñê i have a Problem with my vesc. I have a MB 84100hp and a motor from a ninebot f65. It is a 48v 700w motor. I have done the motor wizzard and all is set up. The wizzard give me 45a motor and 100a battery. But Wenn i go to high with the motor amps i became a crunsh/cogging noise from my motor. Iq target is on and its runs on foc. It is running on mxlemming. Bms is a jbd smart bms with 70a continius. Its a 13s5p battery. Has it something to do with kp and ki ? When i make the wizzard and let all settings as it is from the wizzard then it runs fine but thats to LOW power for me üòÖ Greetings from germany

[2025-08-30T20:40:44] haku: thats fancy
[2025-08-30T20:45:15] Matthew: Ls430
[2025-08-30T21:19:23] Matthew: Its my brothers. He was patient looking for the best example of the model. I forget how many miles were on it when he bought it a bit less than 5yrs ago. He basically got a find like I did when I bought my 1993 sc300 back in '08. ~67k miles on it all documented. Was in a climate controlled aircraft hanger from some rich old dude that passed away and his son was having an estate sale essentially. Was this dudes Sunday church car. I miss the sc300 ü•∫
[2025-08-30T21:19:50] haku: daym. good dealz
[2025-08-30T21:20:12] haku: toyotas last forever
[2025-08-30T21:22:32] Matthew: Yeah, definitely. Since I was making really good money when I bought the car I had every seal, gasket, o-ring, belts, bushings, suspension done. I had to flare the fenders to tuck 295/30-zr 19 in the rear for 10.5" wide rims with 4" lip
[2025-08-30T21:22:49] haku: rememver that VIP jdm trend. i hated it
[2025-08-30T21:23:21] haku: cambered lexus
[2025-08-30T21:23:24] Matthew: Some jdm trends over the years have made me ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§Æ
[2025-08-30T21:23:24] haku: stupid
[2025-08-30T21:24:55] Matthew: Oh, yeah. Me saying tucked was nothing like that trend. I had functional suspension work. Car would scare me it gripped so well that I honestly didnt want to go faster to see when it would slip in the rear. I was using racing summer tires perrelli corsa tires
[2025-08-30T21:25:26] Matthew: But rain was kinda shall I say scary....
[2025-08-30T21:29:03] Matthew: When I bought the car may of 08. '93 sc300
[2025-08-30T21:29:14] Matthew: <photos/photo_25679@30-08-2025_21-29-14.jpg>

[2025-08-30T21:30:15] Matthew: The worse resolution ever. Pic does not do this car justice... but its the only Pic I have of it actually complete.
[2025-08-30T21:30:31] Unknown: may of 08 I was born btw
[2025-08-30T21:30:48] Matthew: Ooofff. Yeah, im 41
[2025-08-30T21:31:38] haku: this is adults talking willydo
[2025-08-30T21:33:57] haku: your generation is sackless willydo
[2025-08-30T21:39:39] Matthew: It sure takes a lot to scare me in a car. That sc300 is peak performance üíØ. Ive never been in a car that handled the turns like that car and ive been in some well tuned suspension cars. I even drove my crx up to 120mph on the dirt roads in Wyoming lol
[2025-08-30T21:40:11] haku: isnt that a 2jz or 1jz
[2025-08-30T21:40:20] Matthew: 2j for usa
[2025-08-30T21:41:46] Matthew: 1j is the cheapest swap to do. Automatic trans has to have modified valve body for more power than stock n/a 2j. The line pressure is too low and it smokes all the bands in a few seconds flat otherwise
[2025-08-30T21:42:56] haku: @Supremeavocado225 will never understand this because his generation supra is a bmw
[2025-08-30T21:43:09] Matthew: Read an article dude did the full swap and everything and figured he can do a test ride through the neighborhood... he didnt get far at all because he gave full throttle lol
[2025-08-30T21:43:34] haku: so sad
[2025-08-30T21:43:48] Matthew: Good
[2025-08-30T21:44:00] Unknown: whats a supra

[2025-09-01T08:03:56] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: <photos/photo_25696@01-09-2025_08-03-56.jpg>
[2025-09-01T08:04:00] haku: tubless split yea
[2025-09-01T08:04:45] haku: 85mph can be done with yamals setup
[2025-09-01T08:05:05] haku: depends on weight too
[2025-09-01T08:05:16] LiquorHole .: 156kg total weight ü§í
[2025-09-01T08:06:28] LiquorHole .: And idek yamals Setup
[2025-09-01T08:06:51] haku: but 13" its very possible
[2025-09-01T08:07:09] haku: yamal 20s 33x2 80h dual 12fet
[2025-09-01T08:07:30] LiquorHole .: Mm thats a slight difference
[2025-09-01T08:07:40] LiquorHole .: 70h to his 80h
[2025-09-01T08:07:51] haku: 70h can
[2025-09-01T08:08:03] haku: but will heat up
[2025-09-01T08:08:17] haku: yours 70h?
[2025-09-01T08:08:28] LiquorHole .: Eh Lonnyo motors are basically indestructible fr
[2025-09-01T08:09:31] haku: yea take higher temps than most brands. but all motors have limits
[2025-09-01T08:10:01] LiquorHole .: Good thing I wont really be pushing it like that
[2025-09-01T08:10:24] haku: at 85mph you will
[2025-09-01T08:11:00] LiquorHole .: Eh once i get 85mph gps OR close to it ill never go that fast onna scooter again lol that would be Story complete
[2025-09-01T08:11:02] haku: my temps at 80 reached 100c
[2025-09-01T08:11:08] LiquorHole .: Oh
[2025-09-01T08:11:38] haku: but ly can handle up to 120
[2025-09-01T08:12:18] LiquorHole .: Yamal pushing 23kw+?
[2025-09-01T08:12:36] haku: hes 30kw club
[2025-09-01T08:13:05] haku: 33kw em i right yams @jamaludin_algarnati
[2025-09-01T08:13:14] LiquorHole .: Damn, with my battery im 5kw short ü§í
[2025-09-01T08:14:06] haku: i have a battery for sale same cells like yams 20s10p 40t
[2025-09-01T08:14:34] haku: never cycled. just tested vesc with it
[2025-09-01T08:15:07] LiquorHole .: Wait
[2025-09-01T08:15:31] LiquorHole .: If i get a second battery and put it in parallel with my main it should increase My discharge?
[2025-09-01T08:16:22] haku: yes. but mixing pouch and cylindrical might not be a good idea
[2025-09-01T08:16:41] LiquorHole .: *prismatic*
[2025-09-01T08:16:48] LiquorHole .: but same same
[2025-09-01T08:16:52] haku: its pouch
[2025-09-01T08:17:01] haku: prismatic is in a case
[2025-09-01T08:17:02] LiquorHole .: Not in Mine
[2025-09-01T08:17:11] LiquorHole .: Ik Is the case cells
[2025-09-01T08:17:32] LiquorHole .: Pouch dont make 100ah not that i know of, if they do then is not at 3.7v
[2025-09-01T08:17:50] LiquorHole .: But if they do im making a battery out of that
[2025-09-01T08:18:59] haku: the thing about these pouches they dont last long specially when always balls to walls. they baloon
[2025-09-01T08:19:18] haku: but good discharge though
[2025-09-01T08:19:28] LiquorHole .: Very good indeed üòÇ
[2025-09-01T08:19:49] LiquorHole .: Alright ill go for that then, a Inferior version of Yamals build
[2025-09-01T08:19:55] haku: what is peak discharge on your bms
[2025-09-01T08:20:21] LiquorHole .: On the stock bms Is 120a but the Cells themselves are 1C constant 3C peak
[2025-09-01T08:20:30] LiquorHole .: Am getting a 230a constant bms
[2025-09-01T08:21:51] haku: see if this fits your deck
[2025-09-01T08:21:51] haku: <photos/photo_25698@01-09-2025_08-21-51.jpg>

[2025-09-01T08:21:53] haku: <photos/photo_25701@01-09-2025_08-21-53.jpg>
[2025-09-01T08:22:08] LiquorHole .: That definitely fits my deck Lol
[2025-09-01T08:22:20] haku: i will put more fishpaper and rewrap it.
[2025-09-01T08:22:42] LiquorHole .: Dont know why but i like looking at this
[2025-09-01T08:23:34] haku: i was going to use this. i like my personal batteries with see thru wrap to showcase
[2025-09-01T08:23:51] haku: .2 copper
[2025-09-01T08:24:26] LiquorHole .: Scooter meet lol still find that a little humorous, They happen alot the in nyc
[2025-09-01T08:24:51] LiquorHole .: Is just that is a bit too slow paste for me
[2025-09-01T08:27:06] haku: this only 450 peak for a few seconds though. but 350 no problem
[2025-09-01T08:28:16] LiquorHole .: I was Honestly thinking about using cylinder cells Too But I just made my mind up and said id Use them if my battery gives up
[2025-09-01T08:28:26] LiquorHole .: 20s20p 50PL cell battery
[2025-09-01T08:29:02] haku: thats amazing range. but thats emoto discharge
[2025-09-01T08:29:35] LiquorHole .: Exactly üëçüèæ I could be in the 40kw club with that battery üòÇ would just need to modify the hell out of my frame
[2025-09-01T08:30:42] LiquorHole .: Either make New Swing arms or Put a unholy amount of spacers and just throw 100h motors in the rear, then Redesign the entire front end for the same thing or close to it
[2025-09-01T08:42:58] Yamal: 28kw
[2025-09-01T08:43:30] Yamal: Everything that happens after that would be power peaks.
[2025-09-01T08:44:02] Yamal: <photos/photo_25702@01-09-2025_08-44-02.jpg>
[2025-09-01T08:45:34] Yamal: I demonstrated with a log file that the controllers actually demand 200A per controller and their phase is 300A,,, but my battery is 40T since I live in a constant power peak, a life, or a cell on the edge or whatever you want to call it.
[2025-09-01T08:46:23] Yamal: In short, very happy with the e-scooter :)
[2025-09-01T09:19:28] Yamal: Looking forward to starting new projects like Infinity Vesc, but I won't be able to until the Nami is sold, and I've promised myself I won't lower the price at all. Everything is very expensive and there's a lot of investment in it, and if we reach 27 together and have to drive illegally, so be it! We'll dance that dance together
[2025-09-01T09:29:30] Thierry: I got same issue since last upgrade
[2025-09-01T09:30:10] Thierry: Still work with previous version, including initial 6.06
[2025-09-01T09:31:42] LiquorHole .: So 3kw less
[2025-09-01T09:31:49] LiquorHole .: Still a Inferior yamal build üò≠
[2025-09-01T09:35:10] Yamal: I normally see 30kW on the Vesc Tool with a full battery, in "aggressive" driving.
[2025-09-01T09:35:43] LiquorHole .: Probably spikes right?
[2025-09-01T09:38:53] Yamal: For sure
[2025-09-01T09:39:34] LiquorHole .: Hope i get those üòè can be a False member of the 30kw club fr üò≠
[2025-09-01T09:42:17] Yamal: 50kw club
[2025-09-01T09:42:34] LiquorHole .: One day
[2025-09-01T09:43:57] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-09-01T10:06:39] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: No they are not
[2025-09-01T10:13:49] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Indestructible my ass
[2025-09-01T10:14:01] LiquorHole .: Test that
[2025-09-01T10:14:26] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Wait
[2025-09-01T10:15:23] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: <video_file>

[2025-09-01T10:15:46] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: .
[2025-09-01T10:16:04] LiquorHole .: I meant your gluteus maximus ‚öñÔ∏è
[2025-09-01T10:16:22] LiquorHole .: so much torque the magnets twisted or whatever he said
[2025-09-01T10:17:09] LiquorHole .: Probably bad luck? ü§í
[2025-09-01T10:18:44] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: @DRAGON_PEET
[2025-09-01T10:18:56] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Bad luck twice???
[2025-09-01T10:19:10] LiquorHole .: Double trouble
[2025-09-01T10:19:52] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: New stator or just shit design???
[2025-09-01T10:20:20] LiquorHole .: Bikers fault?
[2025-09-01T10:20:41] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Daul magnet design fault
[2025-09-01T10:21:12] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Id like to admit it's my fault that means it's fixable by getting new stator
[2025-09-01T10:22:27] LiquorHole .: Better than what I got now anyway lol if i used these hm motors for my build id probably be able to make medium rare steak with pasta üòÇ
[2025-09-01T10:24:57] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I got it to 140 once (or130 If I remember)
[2025-09-01T10:26:00] LiquorHole .: Ima keep this in mind when I ride during the winter. Hands cold? Burn them on your motors üëçüèæ
[2025-09-01T10:26:07] IMWurden: im asking that, since i don't know much about Electric motor, im asking i should request for a custom motor. In already asking for 70mm lenght magnet, 22x3. Is there anything more i Need to specify?
[2025-09-01T10:33:01] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: U have 80h or 70?
[2025-09-01T10:33:13] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Also is yours dual magnet or one long ?
[2025-09-01T10:33:14] LiquorHole .: 70
[2025-09-01T10:33:20] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Better
[2025-09-01T10:33:47] LiquorHole .: Never opened to see and probably never will cause im getting rages motors
[2025-09-01T10:34:02] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Because 99% it's their shitty design no wonder it's not like that anymore
[2025-09-01T10:34:18] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I know that motor i have one too it's one magnet
[2025-09-01T10:35:07] LiquorHole .: Can only fit 70h anyway if I could fit larger id go straight to 90h üòÇ
[2025-09-01T10:35:42] LiquorHole .: Id have to do alot to my frame for that and the only real benefit id consider is the heat
[2025-09-01T10:37:16] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I should've gone with 90h too
[2025-09-01T10:37:55] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: On that note @SibClimb you ever used the split magnets 80h ?
[2025-09-01T10:38:04] LiquorHole .: 100h just sounds better though üòè would need like a 230mm dropout or something?
[2025-09-01T10:38:27] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Can't find locally and headache to import to me
[2025-09-01T10:57:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, split or one long magnet has nothing to do with twisted stators, it's only because of bad assembly from LY
[2025-09-01T11:16:14] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So new stator won't fix it ?
[2025-09-01T12:17:58] Arnau Martinez Casals: I was using it, no hw limit 6.06 with m365 dash lisp. I updated from vesctool too with no issues. (PC)
[2025-09-01T12:51:18] Arnau Martinez Casals: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdVU3UYA
[2025-09-01T13:05:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: They are working on a new axle to reduce this problem
[2025-09-01T13:05:56] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So probably better to wait for it
[2025-09-01T13:06:06] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And hope it fits the same motor
[2025-09-01T15:00:30] Yamal: Cant se the video man ,, don‚Äôt have tik Tok !!!!!!!
[2025-09-01T15:00:31] Yamal: !!!
[2025-09-01T15:03:24] Dualtron Achilleus: <video_file>
[2025-09-01T15:07:05] Yamal: Wouh
[2025-09-01T15:16:06] Arnau Martinez Casals: You missed the like ü§îü´∂
[2025-09-01T18:29:45] haku: you can fit 155mm axle you can request a 80h with that axle
[2025-09-01T18:30:34] haku: yams do you know the width of that rim is it 65 or 70?
[2025-09-01T18:31:48] haku: funny i know scooter stuff but my frame is a bike hahaha
[2025-09-01T18:32:23] LiquorHole .: Really?
[2025-09-01T18:32:28] LiquorHole .: What about 90h
[2025-09-01T18:32:32] Yamal: 65 mm Haku industries
[2025-09-01T18:32:39] haku: no
[2025-09-01T18:32:42] LiquorHole .: And where could I request that
[2025-09-01T18:32:49] haku: ask LY
[2025-09-01T18:33:10] haku: rage i think carries it too
[2025-09-01T18:33:30] Yamal: rage on the crest with the rims
[2025-09-01T18:33:56] LiquorHole .: Might consider it then
[2025-09-01T18:33:59] LiquorHole .: Kv on 33*2 80h motors
[2025-09-01T18:34:37] Matthew: I deleted 6.06 and went back with 6.05 and will soon find out if it pairs. If it does, what do I do to update firmware and vesc tool to be able to use it?
[2025-09-01T18:35:04] Yamal: 34,8kv
[2025-09-01T18:35:46] LiquorHole .: Thats Not bad Not bad at all, more torque then 70h, better On heat and stuff
[2025-09-01T18:35:55] haku: kw farmer yams is the first ive seen with 155 axle 80h
[2025-09-01T18:36:15] Matthew: Also does someone have the file for no hw limits for 100/100 with 6.06? Someone else gave me the file for 100/100 on 6.05. I have bad memory and don't know what to do.
[2025-09-01T18:36:31] haku: james too
[2025-09-01T18:36:31] LiquorHole .: Yk where he bought from? LY or rage or somewhere else
[2025-09-01T18:36:41] haku: no idea
[2025-09-01T18:37:11] Yamal: James comes from another planet
[2025-09-01T18:37:24] LiquorHole .: Glorp norp
[2025-09-01T18:38:37] haku: hes ai
[2025-09-01T18:40:08] haku: @Dualtron_Achillleus your 90h what axle or fork opening bro?
[2025-09-01T18:40:57] Matthew: Thats a lot more fancy than my system, but hes using same components for the liquid cooling haha
[2025-09-01T18:42:28] haku: this chat is insane. minimim 80h balls to walls
[2025-09-01T18:43:05] haku: when will we see 100h hotdogs
[2025-09-01T18:43:32] Thierry: New upgrade is out on play store
[2025-09-01T18:45:29] Matthew: 155mm opening?
[2025-09-01T18:45:38] LiquorHole .: Yeah
[2025-09-01T18:46:29] Matthew: What can you expect from a 22x3 winding from 80h?
[2025-09-01T18:46:35] Matthew: Kv
[2025-09-01T18:47:01] LiquorHole .: 33x2 but 22x3 idk like 22-24kv?
[2025-09-01T18:47:33] haku: i dont know KV and what that means. but i know balls to walls science. that is balls to walls
[2025-09-01T18:47:51] LiquorHole .: Kv=rpm
[2025-09-01T18:47:57] LiquorHole .: Basically I think
[2025-09-01T18:48:29] Matthew: Im just looking for a 60mph motor on 16s with the most torque that will fit yume y11 single rwd
[2025-09-01T18:48:55] Matthew: Yes, per volt free spin rpm
[2025-09-01T18:49:15] haku: 17x4 for single. 22x3 will require amps
[2025-09-01T18:49:30] haku: but i doubt 60mph
[2025-09-01T18:49:45] haku: maybe ask james
[2025-09-01T18:50:17] Matthew: If 22x3 would hit 55-60mph, it would be what I want. If 17x4 will hit 55mph id be tickled silly happy
[2025-09-01T18:50:40] haku: it might with fw
[2025-09-01T18:50:58] haku: i dont fuck witg fw
[2025-09-01T18:51:31] Matthew: 65h 22x3 with 60amps field weaking hits ~55mph with my fat ass. 90amps battery 270amps phase
[2025-09-01T18:51:38] LiquorHole .: I mean to me it‚Äôs simple
[2025-09-01T18:51:56] Matthew: Id rather find the motor that hits the speed i want without field weakening
[2025-09-01T18:52:06] LiquorHole .: Just get a 33x2 motor and push like 140a battery
[2025-09-01T18:52:26] haku: Noname why dont you contribute to this all american conversation
[2025-09-01T18:52:32] Matthew: Ok. I have 85250 and 16s14p 180amps battery
[2025-09-01T18:52:50] haku: single 33x2 is bad dude.
[2025-09-01T18:53:02] haku: horrible acceleration
[2025-09-01T18:53:27] LiquorHole .: Put it on 8 inch tires
[2025-09-01T18:54:07] Matthew: I almost did that with 65h 22x3 lol
[2025-09-01T18:54:34] Unknown: g30 doesnt fit 11"
[2025-09-01T18:54:49] haku: you dont really not a fan of dual motor eh?
[2025-09-01T18:55:16] LiquorHole .: Would be a hell of alot easier with 2 motors lol
[2025-09-01T18:55:28] Unknown: bigger battery extra controller extra motor less space
[2025-09-01T18:55:31] Unknown: i can see why
[2025-09-01T18:55:41] haku: true
[2025-09-01T18:55:52] Matthew: Correct.... except I have decided I will go dual motor on the g30p build I will get finished when I have a job, its getting all the jrev stuff
[2025-09-01T18:56:00] haku: no school today willydo?
[2025-09-01T18:56:08] Unknown: already back sir anus

[2025-09-02T07:09:04] Thierry: Last weekend they released on play store 6.06.3 which broke the Bluetooth connexion. Yesterday evening they released a new update 6.06.4 that fix Bluetooth bug.
[2025-09-02T10:22:38] Yamal: Why 60h front engine
[2025-09-02T10:35:44] JPPL: Maybe BEcause: Lighter, more traction, weight distribution between scooter
[2025-09-02T10:52:37] Nobrrr: Yes it applies
[2025-09-02T10:53:09] Nobrrr: I just set fwk current to 40A rear and 30A front
[2025-09-02T10:54:10] Yamal: I mean why not 70h/75h,,?
[2025-09-02T11:02:08] 'lekrsu': Is the XHS80 and SH60 matched by kV?
[2025-09-02T11:07:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Exactly
[2025-09-02T11:08:16] LiquorHole .: You could make the 80h motor fit 155mm axles/forks? Haku said yall ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù could do that
[2025-09-02T11:08:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: They are not
[2025-09-02T11:08:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes it does actually, that's what we use
[2025-09-02T11:09:05] 'lekrsu': Front is higher? TC on?
[2025-09-02T11:09:12] LiquorHole .: Oh, that just makes things better for my build than
[2025-09-02T11:09:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: Front is lower Always TC ON on our escooters
[2025-09-02T11:10:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's why, back in 2019 we first brought VESC to escooters, because I was convinced about Traction Control, then VESC is much more than that now
[2025-09-02T11:11:24] 'lekrsu': Alright, but it can spin up to that rpm (the 140km/h marketed) at your voltage?
[2025-09-02T11:12:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes, using a little bit of field weakening
[2025-09-02T11:12:35] Yamal: Vesc is like the surfer who travels with his board in his Volkswagen Transporter in search of the best wave
[2025-09-02T11:12:41] 'lekrsu': Great, seems you've put some thought behind the combination ^^)
[2025-09-02T11:13:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: We use racing as laboratory to test many many things
[2025-09-02T11:15:41] Yamal: https://youtu.be/AgZ_qZd6GNY?si=NqipTK8SFZc2CYV0

[2025-09-03T16:33:20] Nobrrr: @AYO744 You got 100H motors right? But now you‚Äôre way slower because it has lower kv or do you go higher in voltage too
[2025-09-03T16:40:10] 'lekrsu': Home tomato best :)
[2025-09-03T16:40:49] haku: thats a tomato?

[2025-09-03T16:41:08] haku: i see
[2025-09-03T16:41:43] haku: organic vs gmo tomato looks so different
[2025-09-03T17:16:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: New cheap 12fet vesc will be coming very soon
[2025-09-03T17:23:34] Jason: mmm
[2025-09-03T17:24:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: ??

[2025-09-03T17:27:25] Jason: lol
[2025-09-03T17:27:48] Jason: I don't think it's gonna work soon
[2025-09-03T17:27:55] Jason: need osiloscope first
[2025-09-03T17:27:59] Jason: or switch gate driving
[2025-09-03T17:28:07] Jason: or sm shit
[2025-09-03T17:29:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: You don't need the oscilloscope if the motor doesn't even spin
[2025-09-03T17:29:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's hardware fault
[2025-09-03T17:29:55] Jason: it kinda does the detection
[2025-09-03T17:29:57] Jason: lol
[2025-09-03T17:30:13] Jason: everything is fine in theory
[2025-09-03T17:30:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oscilloscope is needed when it works but not well haha
[2025-09-03T17:30:20] Jason: ah lol
[2025-09-03T17:30:28] Yamal: cooking steaks ^^
[2025-09-03T17:30:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: We used it to fix the hsp MOSFET
[2025-09-03T17:30:54] Jason: I will find a way soon hehe
[2025-09-03T17:31:13] Jason: need to replace stm first caz I accidentally shorted one of io to 12v
[2025-09-03T17:31:16] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-09-03T17:32:09] Jason: caz last time I did esc making it did work first try
[2025-09-03T17:32:14] Jason: this time, somehow not
[2025-09-03T17:32:20] Jason: prob gate drivers are funky
[2025-09-03T17:32:35] Jason: gonna piggyback mp2 gate stage to mine and see
[2025-09-03T17:32:59] Jason: damn you L6491
[2025-09-03T17:33:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Very much, at least 3 controller will released by the end of year: 12 fet tolt 350A (by end of month) 24 fet toll 1000A (within October) 3 fet 30s 750a (by end of year)
[2025-09-03T17:33:25] Jason: no 40s?
[2025-09-03T17:33:38] Jason: big ass escs
[2025-09-03T17:33:41] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-09-03T17:33:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: 3 fet will be so small for the power that will offer
[2025-09-03T17:34:08] Jason: 3 fet?
[2025-09-03T17:34:16] Jason: interesting
[2025-09-03T17:34:35] Jason: is it internally 6 fets or literally 3 fets
[2025-09-03T17:35:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: 40s is too complex to do, it's not worth the effort . Very high resistance MOSFET
[2025-09-03T17:35:26] Jason: mm
[2025-09-03T17:35:40] Jason: I might go shitty layout with 30s
[2025-09-03T17:35:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: I guess can't work with literally 3 mos ahah
[2025-09-03T17:36:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's just reverse psychology marketing
[2025-09-03T17:36:05] Jason: but I rly don't wanna make shit layout pack aaaaaa
[2025-09-03T17:36:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Everyone do race to see who have more fet
[2025-09-03T17:36:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: I do the contrary then xd
[2025-09-03T17:36:18] Jason: 30s4p pack fitting in g30 is gonna have shit ass lahout
[2025-09-03T17:36:30] Jason: 40s3p however, very easy
[2025-09-03T17:37:07] Jason: that's quite much the one out of 2 reason going 40s
[2025-09-03T17:37:08] Yamal: How you call the Esc
[2025-09-03T17:37:16] Jason: one, easy pack two, im the first
[2025-09-03T17:37:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: We have established the company, the brand name will be Waves Technology
[2025-09-03T17:38:04] Jason: oo
[2025-09-03T17:38:14] Jason: sine waves technology hehe
[2025-09-03T17:38:22] Jason: no square wave there
[2025-09-03T17:38:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: That includes a series of new products such as spot welder, motor controller, BMS etc
[2025-09-03T17:38:48] Yamal: XD
[2025-09-03T17:38:50] Jason: 30s bms?
[2025-09-03T17:38:57] Jason: vesc compatibel also

[2025-09-03T17:39:55] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-09-03T17:40:03] Yamal: Pretty nice project
[2025-09-03T17:40:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Some are developed locally , some are designed in Italy
[2025-09-03T17:40:10] Jason: I'll test the design I test produced then in the meantime
[2025-09-03T17:40:12] Yamal: Good luck
[2025-09-03T17:40:25] Jason: make 30s1p pack testbench hook up bms kaboom

[2025-09-03T17:40:40] ‡ºí xUnkn0wn‚Ñ¢ ‡ºí: What specs?
[2025-09-03T17:40:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: That's what I did to test the controller on bench haha
[2025-09-03T17:41:00] Jason: hehe
[2025-09-03T17:41:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: My power supply max 150v 40a
[2025-09-03T17:41:13] Jason: damn
[2025-09-03T17:41:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: But 30s1p 50pl 120a
[2025-09-03T17:41:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: <sticker>
[2025-09-03T17:41:21] Jason: mine was 140v 26a
[2025-09-03T17:41:31] Jason: I wanted to raise the voltage to 180v
[2025-09-03T17:41:36] Jason: and see if anything blows
[2025-09-03T17:41:48] Jason: i need series adapter
[2025-09-03T17:42:09] Jason: didn't blow up at 140v at least
[2025-09-03T17:42:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: 200a continuos, 350a phase
[2025-09-03T17:42:17] Jason: sweet
[2025-09-03T17:43:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: But it's a big surprise that when I established the company, Benjamin launched vesclabs in the same day
[2025-09-03T17:43:47] Jason: <photos/photo_25745@03-09-2025_17-43-47.jpg>

[2025-09-03T17:47:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why looks so empty
[2025-09-03T17:47:11] Jason: I just went with 100x100 pcb
[2025-09-03T17:47:12] Jason: xd
[2025-09-03T17:47:18] Jason: that's why it soo empty
[2025-09-03T17:47:31] Jason: big size, still 2 bucks

[2025-09-03T18:11:41] Marius: jason hurry up before paolo makes jesc obsolete
[2025-09-03T18:11:54] Jason: it will be obsolete someday
[2025-09-03T18:12:02] Jason: ykno
[2025-09-03T18:12:11] Jason: I just gotta get it to run and test after that

[2025-09-03T18:13:23] haku: is this the same 18fet you posted?
[2025-09-03T18:13:49] haku: guys is 70 for a used mt5 a good price. with levers
[2025-09-03T18:20:25] haku: sorry i dont read i just look at photos. 12fet my bad
[2025-09-03T18:23:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, 18fet is flipsky level cheap. This one is mid - high level quality
[2025-09-03T18:26:58] haku: cheap is good. aslong as reliable
[2025-09-03T18:27:23] haku: cheap is my cup of tea
[2025-09-03T19:09:45] Jason: @PaoloWu do you know smth bout silky controller?
[2025-09-03T19:09:47] Jason: <photos/photo_25746@03-09-2025_19-09-47.jpg>
[2025-09-03T19:10:06] Jason: or smth
[2025-09-03T19:10:16] Jason: that goes in weped shii
[2025-09-03T19:10:57] LiquorHole .: Yeah
[2025-09-03T19:12:18] Marius: here u can get new for 40
[2025-09-03T19:12:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Isn't this average china square wave?
[2025-09-03T19:12:57] Jason: looks like yeah
[2025-09-03T19:18:11] haku: where. dont gatekeep
[2025-09-03T19:20:40] Marius: its gone, but they appear every once in a while on bike discount
[2025-09-03T19:22:09] haku: eu only maybe
[2025-09-03T21:30:21] Matthew: Whats the main use for vesc express?

[2025-09-03T22:07:35] haku: made in USA
[2025-09-03T22:43:20] haku: why me why does this keep happening. every week flat tire. karma is bitch. im sorry talking too much shit. please uncurse me.
[2025-09-03T22:48:44] LiquorHole .: 160 a pair new over here üòï
[2025-09-03T23:03:06] Rose: Hey there Guijean, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-03T23:07:46] haku: thats a good deal. i got mt5e 100 ea. i thought that was a deal
[2025-09-03T23:08:03] haku: where from?
[2025-09-04T00:01:07] Noname: Literally just plugged my truck tire
[2025-09-04T00:44:02] LiquorHole .: Amazon
[2025-09-04T01:06:37] haku: we are both cursed looks like
[2025-09-04T01:11:37] Noname: Oh no that screw was in there for a week
[2025-09-04T01:12:34] haku: i cant get these cranks out of this bike. fucking idiot put red loctite on pedals
[2025-09-04T01:12:45] haku: i mean peak g30
[2025-09-04T01:14:37] Noname: Use that 700¬∞ heat gun dingus
[2025-09-04T01:15:50] haku: would that work?
[2025-09-04T01:16:10] haku: that enough heat
[2025-09-04T02:08:58] haku: shit i dont think this tire will last a week.
[2025-09-04T02:09:11] haku: but i have 4 pairs on the way
[2025-09-04T02:09:41] haku: 4pairs china slicks = 1 pair pmt slicks
[2025-09-04T02:14:45] Jason: blowtorch em
[2025-09-04T02:14:51] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-09-04T02:15:41] haku: got it off. heatgun and lube does the job
[2025-09-04T02:15:49] Jason: no lube
[2025-09-04T02:15:52] Jason: it will burn off
[2025-09-04T02:15:59] haku: also brute super stregnth
[2025-09-04T02:16:02] Jason: just good heat and hammer
[2025-09-04T02:16:03] Jason: done
[2025-09-04T02:16:14] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-09-04T02:17:27] Noname: <photos/photo_25749@04-09-2025_02-17-27.jpg>
[2025-09-04T02:17:51] haku: this v3 will need 3 steering dampers
[2025-09-04T02:18:59] Jason: lmao
[2025-09-04T02:22:29] Noname: Ok everybody pray my refunded ebike shows up tomorrow üòÜ
[2025-09-04T02:23:33] haku: i hope you get freebie.
[2025-09-04T02:23:47] haku: but ill be hating
[2025-09-04T02:26:26] Noname: Stop teasing me with price drops alerts dammit
[2025-09-04T02:26:46] Noname: Wonder how many KW would fit?
[2025-09-04T02:26:54] haku: at that price just get it
[2025-09-04T02:27:15] haku: frame alone is worth the restoration
[2025-09-04T02:28:11] haku: you know what i hate the most. people that get better deals than me. also people that can mount tubeless with no tools
[2025-09-04T02:28:51] Noname: I will use my 10" motor amd make mcycle version of this
[2025-09-04T02:30:44] Noname: Are you even the real Haku? Why should I listen to you? Prove yourself with this captcha quiz
[2025-09-04T02:33:55] Matthew: I bought 1 for use of Bluetooth. The usb-c did not work on it but i was satisfied with Bluetooth though I did let trampa know that it was not working. They configured another one and verified it was good before shipping and they told me to keep the original I got.... so I have a good extra vesc express.
[2025-09-04T02:34:33] Noname: <photos/photo_25753@04-09-2025_02-34-33.jpg>
[2025-09-04T02:34:58] Matthew: I have only been basic with the vesc stuff.
[2025-09-04T02:42:48] haku: thats an imposter

[2025-09-04T02:52:48] haku: for the love of jason mamoa i cant mount a tire today wtf
[2025-09-04T02:56:07] haku: i need tubeless split. fuck this
[2025-09-04T03:05:30] Noname: Damn sissy boy
[2025-09-04T03:19:00] haku: yea green frame way smaller. the wildcat frame i want to see.
[2025-09-04T03:27:53] Noname: Its 1 Asian smaller hum.
[2025-09-04T04:44:55] haku: giant fuck you right here.
[2025-09-04T04:50:01] haku: i paid $4 in air too because i cant get china slicks to bead. i ripped the sidewall with my shear stregnth so i had to go home and mount old touvt
[2025-09-04T04:54:58] Jason: pray to buddah and pump your muscles
[2025-09-04T04:55:07] Jason: oh shit
[2025-09-04T05:02:54] Noname: Dumbass
[2025-09-04T05:10:40] haku: that will not bead i promise you that
[2025-09-04T05:10:43] haku: i have one
[2025-09-04T05:11:27] haku: need a chungus compressor
[2025-09-04T11:46:42] Rose: Hey there dimas, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-04T13:12:43] Yamal: I just saw Haku from the future
[2025-09-04T13:13:01] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/qsEU5fX7hFg?si=OjDUGL8XoFYCh7dJ
[2025-09-04T13:37:34] S1m 0n: What u mean with "everything turned Off ... I turned it Off and On again". Did everything turned Off on the hill, or did he just stop driving? not driven ‚Üí Check Vesc Logs Turned Off ‚Üí Check BMS logs
[2025-09-04T14:15:35] Roby MacGyver: off I mean the voltmeter was at zero the wheel was stuck I stopped I turned the ignition key to the off position then to the on position and now everything works perfectly if it was the BMS it went into protection without turning anything off
[2025-09-04T17:03:40] Patrick: 3-axis CNC rotor for a 115x70mm stator with a 125mm dropout, with a fully removable 150x40mm tubeless split rim. What yall think?
[2025-09-04T17:05:12] Marius: siiiigmaaa
[2025-09-04T17:08:32] Patrick: Will 3D print one if everything works good Will finish drawings and make a request at PCBway aswell as order 115x70mm LY stator
[2025-09-04T17:09:33] Patrick: Airgap is currently 1 mm if LY stator tolerances allows will go down to 0.5 mm.
[2025-09-04T17:09:56] Patrick: Taking 2.5mm thick magnets then instead of 2mm once
[2025-09-04T17:13:20] Nobrrr: It looks very nice üëçüèº But why don‚Äôt you make the air cooling lines in the other direction?
[2025-09-04T17:13:45] Patrick: Space thats all
[2025-09-04T17:14:05] Nobrrr: But it would be better cooling ?
[2025-09-04T17:14:22] Patrick: Yea had curved once at beginning but space didnt allow it really
[2025-09-04T17:14:38] Marius: ly stators are good?
[2025-09-04T17:14:55] LiquorHole .: Hope so
[2025-09-04T17:15:41] Patrick: On a 10inch rim it probably barely does anything anyway since there is very little clearance/airflow. However, you can slap an 11-inch rim on this thing so on an 11-inch rim it would probably be noticeable
[2025-09-04T17:15:53] Patrick: I hope will order 2x stators and check tolerances
[2025-09-04T17:16:57] Patrick: Rotor quality is terible but my 65H stator was pretty accurate iirc i hope the same for the other once
[2025-09-04T17:17:33] Patrick: My caliper showed exactly 110mm there
[2025-09-04T17:23:10] Nobrrr: I want one lol
[2025-09-04T17:23:17] Nobrrr: 2
[2025-09-04T17:24:56] Patrick: xd yea i make request at pcbway once drawings finished i post file
[2025-09-04T17:25:43] Patrick: Can easly be made on a 3 axis cnx i guess shouldnt be to expensive
[2025-09-04T17:26:44] Nobrrr: Curved n52S/E/U/H magnets?
[2025-09-04T17:26:45] Patrick: Or max 4 axis cnc if you dont have the endmills propper
[2025-09-04T17:27:08] Patrick: No idea yet dont even know how much kV drops
[2025-09-04T17:27:18] Patrick: Looking for like 22kV
[2025-09-04T17:27:37] Nobrrr: Slap 33x2 in there
[2025-09-04T17:27:55] Nobrrr: With high grade magnets like little under 30kV I guess
[2025-09-04T17:27:59] Marius: whaat
[2025-09-04T17:28:03] Marius: for 40s?
[2025-09-04T17:28:38] Patrick: Probably will go with SH magnets because they are a little cheaper, and if Jason's 40s hardware works i get a ESC. It won't push a lot of amps anyway then so shluldnt overheat
[2025-09-04T17:28:45] Nobrrr: 300‚Ç¨ per Motor possible?
[2025-09-04T17:28:54] Nobrrr: Ig it‚Äôs gonna be more
[2025-09-04T17:29:02] Patrick: Magnets probably more expensive then stator?
[2025-09-04T17:29:03] Marius: hows that gonna work
[2025-09-04T17:29:21] Patrick: I have no idea yet where you can get real custom magnets from
[2025-09-04T17:29:33] Patrick: In small amounts
[2025-09-04T17:30:02] Patrick: Wouldn't be surprised if 30x cost like 200‚Ç¨
[2025-09-04T17:30:05] Nobrrr: Low resistance winding Strong magnets Low kv High efficiency Less heat right?
[2025-09-04T17:30:27] Patrick: Yea but only really worth it for higher voltage
[2025-09-04T17:30:39] Marius: low resistance winding = more heat
[2025-09-04T17:30:41] Marius: in the phases
[2025-09-04T17:30:45] Marius: but same heat in stator
[2025-09-04T17:30:48] Marius: i believe
[2025-09-04T17:30:58] Patrick: If jason 40s Hardware works it would be perfect cause you push less amps Overall already
[2025-09-04T17:31:00] Nobrrr: You just need bigger phases that‚Äôs it
[2025-09-04T17:31:19] Patrick: Less looses in phase wires and cause of higher voltage you go lower kV
[2025-09-04T17:31:21] Marius: yes but u can also ut the same phases on lower kv winding, so its stil worse for heat
[2025-09-04T17:31:36] Marius: but really shouldnt matter
[2025-09-04T17:31:52] Patrick: There you just lower kV then first with maxing out magnets
[2025-09-04T17:32:39] Rose: Hey there waak, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-04T17:32:52] Marius: @waak86 u see this boi
[2025-09-04T17:33:00] Marius: this g30 is peak
[2025-09-04T17:33:05] Marius: urs is china motor
[2025-09-04T17:33:44] Patrick: N52 is ~37-40% stronger than N38, iirc Then we have curved magnets inside the motor and a reduced air gap from 1.5 mm to hopefully 0.5 mm and 2.5mm magnets instead of 2mm
[2025-09-04T17:35:00] Patrick: I guess even less then 22kV then with 70H 33x2? Need to test it
[2025-09-04T17:35:55] Patrick: In worst case i need to swap magnets for weaker once
[2025-09-04T17:36:13] Marius: torque gonna be too much for this short frame probably
[2025-09-04T17:37:02] Marius: 115 70h and strong magnets on 10inch is fucking crazy
[2025-09-04T17:37:23] Patrick: Yeah for sure i want to do it for efficiency only. If the motor is too expensive to produce and I ever make a new project, i just take those motors and put an 11inch rim on them.
[2025-09-04T17:37:50] Marius: if i ever make another scoot it would be 11ich
[2025-09-04T17:37:55] Marius: and the 11inch motors arent too bad from what ive heard
[2025-09-04T17:38:05] Marius: better than the 10inch lonnyos i believe
[2025-09-04T17:38:50] Patrick: Maybe but wont buy anything except for stator from LY anymore both rotor i had are terible
[2025-09-04T17:39:39] Patrick: Not using there sandcast would help them already
[2025-09-04T17:39:54] Patrick: + getting someone that can actually spraypaint them
[2025-09-04T17:40:07] Patrick: The once i had looked like a child painted them
[2025-09-04T17:42:33] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: BMS
[2025-09-04T18:07:19] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I have to wait for the lathe operator to make new axles, the ones I made don't work, they are short ü§£ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
[2025-09-04T18:19:26] Matthew: I may download 6.06 today. I was wondering how do you use overmodulation? I have 100/100 which is currently on 6.05. Battery is now going to be 14s for a while and 45amps battery 130phase
[2025-09-04T18:22:21] haku: motors are motors dude
[2025-09-04T18:23:03] haku: ly just makes it with bigger phases
[2025-09-04T18:23:38] haku: i say rock what you have.
[2025-09-04T18:24:42] haku: waak. do not deport him. he is from land of the fast
[2025-09-04T18:24:47] Patrick: Actually price is fine full rotor under 500‚Ç¨
[2025-09-04T18:25:19] Patrick: Should be below 1k‚Ç¨ for 1 motor full
[2025-09-04T18:27:16] Matthew: Near future when I have the money I am wanting a 70h motor and I also wanted to get another 65h 22x3 motor. I was gonna go with lonnyo. Is there an alternative you guys recommend or is lonnyo decent to use?
[2025-09-04T18:28:08] Dualtron Achilleus: For 70h and 65h maybe but less quality
[2025-09-04T18:28:43] Dualtron Achilleus: Bit if you start looking at 75h or more there is only lonnyo for quality
[2025-09-04T18:29:01] Patrick: There is a bosch motor for teverun but its small
[2025-09-04T18:29:21] Patrick: Not Sure about qsmotor probably nothing for scooter size
[2025-09-04T18:31:13] Matthew: I think smallest rim they sell is 10" actual rim size which i suppose would be insane on a standard bmx bicycle.
[2025-09-04T18:32:16] Matthew: Ok cool. I am wanting to get 70h for rwd yume y11 and 65h for g30p. The 65h 17x4 motor on the g30lp is there to stay i do believe.
[2025-09-04T18:35:21] sombre_enfant: 1mm on dia or radius ?
[2025-09-04T18:36:22] sombre_enfant: Actually need 2 op on 4 axis mill with divider or 4 axis lathe
[2025-09-04T18:36:24] Patrick: Radius
[2025-09-04T18:36:28] Patrick: So 2mm diameter
[2025-09-04T18:37:00] Patrick: For rips i guess? Cause they to long for a endmill?
[2025-09-04T18:37:07] sombre_enfant: Thats uge airgaps
[2025-09-04T18:37:10] haku: did you design this? amazing
[2025-09-04T18:37:17] sombre_enfant: Also Expensive af
[2025-09-04T18:37:21] Patrick: Yea i try to go to 0.5mm however LY stator decides
[2025-09-04T18:37:25] Patrick: 250USD
[2025-09-04T18:37:27] sombre_enfant: No because of the fin
[2025-09-04T18:37:34] Patrick: Yes those i mean
[2025-09-04T18:38:03] Patrick: Might actually be able to fit 75-80H since i dont need a hall sensor
[2025-09-04T18:38:05] sombre_enfant: Theres no radius so it need to be with the lower end of an endmill not the flange
[2025-09-04T18:38:05] haku: 80h is minimum in 2025
[2025-09-04T18:38:27] sombre_enfant: When u design think toolpath and machine capability
[2025-09-04T18:39:08] sombre_enfant: It always look good n fancy on 3d but when u need to made it think about the operator headaches pleaseüòÇüòÇ
[2025-09-04T18:39:13] Dualtron Achilleus: ü§£
[2025-09-04T18:39:15] Patrick: Yes, can be maschined and it has three parts to be cheaper and simpler to produce
[2025-09-04T18:39:31] Patrick: Also since you can take off both lids swapping bearings id easier
[2025-09-04T18:39:52] Patrick: Keept the design simple to produce
[2025-09-04T18:40:28] sombre_enfant: The casing for magnet aint that ez to mill
[2025-09-04T18:41:06] Patrick: Middle part can be done on a lathe aswell dont See a problem why there would be any problems
[2025-09-04T18:41:19] sombre_enfant: The less u have to take out the part off the vice or jaw the cheaper it is
[2025-09-04T18:41:27] Patrick: Or they just add a huge fit
[2025-09-04T18:41:54] Patrick: Well this is as simple as you can Design it
[2025-09-04T18:42:20] Patrick: Ofcourse you could take away the fins but those arent a huge deal
[2025-09-04T18:42:38] sombre_enfant: Theres no problem at all everything can be made on 4 axis lathe but its about the time consumption of the fin and keyway
[2025-09-04T18:43:16] Patrick: Yea will run few simulation for the fins
[2025-09-04T18:43:34] Patrick: With 10inch rim they maybe dont even make sense really cause there is very little airflow
[2025-09-04T18:44:45] sombre_enfant: Ah u use cam software ?
[2025-09-04T18:45:16] Patrick: I have acces to it
[2025-09-04T18:45:25] Patrick: Not really used to it though
[2025-09-04T18:45:39] sombre_enfant: I Would do additional 3d propeller like they do in french racing
[2025-09-04T18:45:48] Patrick: Hmm?
[2025-09-04T18:45:54] Patrick: Air intakes?
[2025-09-04T18:46:51] sombre_enfant: Think about how small dia end mill need to be used for the fin also Small dia more time consuming if you dont have 20krpm spindle or live tooling
[2025-09-04T18:47:11] sombre_enfant: Yeah sum shi like that check out insta pic
[2025-09-04T18:47:32] Patrick: I think about it will make 2 quotes then if its not a huge price difference i dont care
[2025-09-04T18:47:54] Patrick: Will probably order them in probably 4 months
[2025-09-04T18:51:01] sombre_enfant: Aight but the air gap to the magnet seems huge to me
[2025-09-04T18:51:53] sombre_enfant: Should get the stator first then do idk 0.3mm tolerence radial But idk what it should be actually...
[2025-09-04T18:54:28] JPPL: Tiny throtle
[2025-09-04T18:56:12] critical: can som1 find me a good soldering kit i can use for vesc on ninebot
[2025-09-04T19:10:05] Patrick: Yea 0.3-0.5mm is a pretty good value will See how low i can go due to tolerances
[2025-09-04T19:10:20] Patrick: LY has 1.5mm airgap thats huge for a electric motor
[2025-09-04T19:10:56] Patrick: I got 3 ideas 1. They dont know any better 2. Rotor tolerance to bad 3. stator tolerances to bad
[2025-09-04T19:11:13] Patrick: There has to be a reason for this huge airgap
[2025-09-04T19:31:55] 'lekrsu': You assign an overmodulation value and that's it.
[2025-09-04T19:42:57] Patrick: Might be able to do 80H i just saw ofcourse no hall sensor board
[2025-09-04T19:43:29] Patrick: I make quick assembly in cad
[2025-09-04T19:44:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: I think that when you will find out the price of CNC machining something like that (properly I mean, with all magnetic issues) it will be complicated
[2025-09-04T19:50:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: 2+3 haha
[2025-09-04T19:53:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: This piece made with CNC would cost 300$ at least, if you have super cheap supplier
[2025-09-04T19:58:37] Patrick: Yea with shipping like 500usd on pcbway its fine tbh just magnet prices i have no idea yet
[2025-09-04T19:59:40] Patrick: Also 80H is a tiny bit too big the brake doesn't fit this way. 75H should work however, 70H is no problem.
[2025-09-04T20:00:53] Patrick: Hope V4 could have worked however want more clearence to the wires
[2025-09-04T20:00:54] haku: dam thats crazy cad work.
[2025-09-04T20:01:20] haku: you put my engineering to shame
[2025-09-04T20:01:47] Patrick: You made the most sexy battery case for peak g30 dont say this
[2025-09-04T20:03:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Retail price is at least 100-130 dollars per set considering 60h
[2025-09-04T20:03:51] Patrick: 75H works
[2025-09-04T20:04:31] Patrick: Do you know a seller that has a few curved 75mm curved magnets?
[2025-09-04T20:04:40] Patrick: I guess custom magnets would be hyper expensive?
[2025-09-04T20:05:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Curved would be like 1000$ hahaha
[2025-09-04T20:05:26] Patrick: xd i go with broke man magnets then
[2025-09-04T20:05:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's not worth the cost for the little bit of advantage you get
[2025-09-04T20:06:47] Patrick: I guess i take regular 30x 75x2.5mm magnets then?
[2025-09-04T20:06:56] Patrick: And should i go with more poles?
[2025-09-04T20:08:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: No because magnet would be too small for those size of motor
[2025-09-04T20:10:02] Patrick: Hmm i just get one produced in winter then and hope it works
[2025-09-04T20:11:52] 'lekrsu': Why is it too small?
[2025-09-04T20:23:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: 30 magnet is the right count for those size of motor, if you put like 40 they would be too small
[2025-09-04T20:24:15] 'lekrsu': Because of the motor width? Lots of smaller motors have 40 poles
[2025-09-04T20:37:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: It must be equilibrated with the stator size and magnet lenght
[2025-09-04T20:40:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: More poles you will get torque point at low rpm while less poles at higher rpm. Yes you technically can put more magnets but I think too low kv with so small magnets

[2025-09-04T23:20:22] Patrick: Thank you but really isnt that hard,the headlight i did was way harder the motor is a pretty small tree when desinging it
[2025-09-04T23:20:24] Noname: It always kinda clogs when it sits. I had to turn the temp up this shit is like wood pulp lol
[2025-09-04T23:20:55] Noname: Good lord take the compliment
[2025-09-04T23:21:01] Patrick: Only annoying part was to figure out how to make the rim removable with this limited space
[2025-09-04T23:22:30] haku: real engineering tools here. no more guessing boys.
[2025-09-04T23:23:15] Patrick: Very nice Tool now you needs this aswell
[2025-09-04T23:23:18] Patrick: <photos/photo_25771@04-09-2025_23-23-18.jpg>
[2025-09-04T23:23:27] Patrick: Best thing ever made
[2025-09-04T23:23:47] haku: for the love of jason mamoa. i cant figure out angles
[2025-09-04T23:36:18] Noname: Use the brain enhancements
[2025-09-04T23:37:44] haku: i am at the moment. enchanted. the only way
[2025-09-04T23:39:30] haku: since we in offtopic whats a good brand sawzall.
[2025-09-04T23:40:00] haku: no need to be battery powered
[2025-09-04T23:40:00] sombre_enfant: Setting that give like 5kph more
[2025-09-04T23:40:09] Noname: Dewalt has some no frills ones
[2025-09-04T23:40:22] Noname: Like 99$
[2025-09-04T23:40:49] haku: gotcha. will that cut aluminum aswell?
[2025-09-04T23:41:10] haku: i need multipurpose
[2025-09-04T23:42:29] haku: i have brand loyalty to milwaukee but since its not battery powered ill do dewalt
[2025-09-04T23:42:58] Noname: Aluminum what?
[2025-09-04T23:43:07] Noname: Sawzall is for demo work
[2025-09-04T23:46:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because none of the magnetic rules are respected in this design You don't happen to design an aluminum circle, put magnets in it and it makes an efficient motor
[2025-09-04T23:48:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: And again, not saying that by being rude
[2025-09-04T23:48:51] haku: oh
[2025-09-04T23:48:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Actually, I would love a 115-70/75 in this size with 6inch rim
[2025-09-04T23:50:42] Patrick: But what to change then? Other escooter motors dont look really different
[2025-09-04T23:54:43] Patrick: It has a 0.5mm airgap between stator & magnets and Overall it isnt that much different to other motors
[2025-09-04T23:55:03] sombre_enfant: Give some hint about whats wrong then, also answer pm
[2025-09-05T00:02:43] Patrick: Yea please otherwise noway to improve it
[2025-09-05T01:21:25] sombre_enfant: Its all about airgaps and tolerance...do the cover have beads so its concentric to the casing and to the axle also ?
[2025-09-05T01:23:48] Patrick: What do you mean exactly with beads?
[2025-09-05T01:24:08] Patrick: <photos/photo_25772@05-09-2025_01-24-08.jpg>
[2025-09-05T01:25:55] Patrick: Ah wait you mean so the fits/bearings in both lids are perfectly aligned?
[2025-09-05T01:26:44] Patrick: Actually dont have it yet 1 sec
[2025-09-05T01:32:01] Patrick: Like this you mean to Center it?
[2025-09-05T01:39:34] Patrick: Both lids are fully centered now
[2025-09-05T02:35:11] Smart Repair: Onboard Express can only be updated via USB, right? üòñ
[2025-09-05T02:37:20] JPPL: No, via can possible
[2025-09-05T02:37:58] JPPL: Need to check
[2025-09-05T02:38:52] Smart Repair: Ah, OK, thanks. Saves me a lot of work. üòÄ
[2025-09-05T03:25:42] haku: this is the best america has to offer okay.
[2025-09-05T07:24:55] Jason: mmm
[2025-09-05T07:25:00] Jason: pls make one without brake adapter
[2025-09-05T07:25:06] Jason: and get like extra 5h or 10h
[2025-09-05T07:27:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: 500$üò≠
[2025-09-05T07:27:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes the where you put bearing
[2025-09-05T07:27:54] Jason: ah shit
[2025-09-05T07:27:55] Jason: lmao
[2025-09-05T07:27:57] Jason: <sticker>

[2025-09-05T11:16:22] Smart Repair: Logs, WiFi Bridge, BT Modul
[2025-09-05T11:37:35] Nobrrr: Can adding a steel shell between Magnets and alu case help for better magnetic flux?
[2025-09-05T11:51:51] Patrick: Valve sits next to one of the screws, one of the reasons it has an offset
[2025-09-05T11:52:49] Patrick: 100H then possible xd

[2025-09-05T12:08:43] Patrick: 10mm steel torque brackets xd
[2025-09-05T12:09:02] Patrick: If the motor works easly destroys g30 frame probably
[2025-09-05T12:39:07] Marius: With steel brackets + brake brackets doubt it
[2025-09-05T13:39:55] Manuel: What
[2025-09-05T13:41:17] Manuel: Never pay with friends and family
[2025-09-05T13:57:12] Neo: Tell paypal someone hacked into your account
[2025-09-05T13:57:16] Neo: They charge back
[2025-09-05T13:57:46] Neo: Thats how scammers screw you over, if they bought something from you with family and friends
[2025-09-05T13:58:08] Neo: But yes kids remember, family and friends is as it says for family and friends, not including strangers
[2025-09-05T14:11:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: I do

[2025-09-05T14:28:11] LiquorHole .: You definitely can
[2025-09-05T14:28:36] LiquorHole .: Ive seen people put whole batteries on that shit üò≠
[2025-09-05T15:05:44] Rose: Hey there Lee, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-05T15:33:26] Smart Repair: X12 over current error fixed ü§™
[2025-09-05T15:33:26] Smart Repair: <photos/photo_25779@05-09-2025_15-33-26.jpg>
[2025-09-05T15:45:21] Smart Repair: Yes, TOLT FETs with 0.5mm pads directly on the solid aluminum frame. I've never gotten above 45¬∞C. I think this design is the future.
[2025-09-05T15:53:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: A cheap alternative of x12?üòú
[2025-09-05T15:56:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not, shunt
[2025-09-05T16:04:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2025-09-05T17:04:27] Marius: oh shit
[2025-09-05T17:04:29] Marius: beast
[2025-09-05T17:04:41] Marius: now topspeed please
[2025-09-05T17:06:23] Marius: explain bro
[2025-09-05T17:06:24] Marius: i wanna learn
[2025-09-05T17:07:19] Matthew: How do you log or whats required? Ive never done any logs other that what max/avg rt/d results.
[2025-09-05T17:13:03] Smart Repair: You need vesc Express + SD card. Then you can activate the automatic logging function.
[2025-09-05T17:16:13] Smart Repair: How much current is planned for 12V? X12 only has 5V 150mA üòñ
[2025-09-05T17:17:11] Smart Repair: is planned for tomorrow. I'll also go a bit higher with the current üòÑ
[2025-09-05T17:17:32] Marius: whats the kv?
[2025-09-05T17:17:34] Marius: of the motors
[2025-09-05T17:18:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why? You need it for external light?
[2025-09-05T17:19:32] Roby MacGyver: Can anyone tell me where I can buy an aluminum fan for this G4 motor? Thanks.
[2025-09-05T17:22:08] Reekoz: Anybody knows a good high rpm lonnyo 13‚Äù motor (could be h90) which will fit the swing arms of my 7260r?
[2025-09-05T17:24:52] Smart Repair: rear LY 11" 29KV, front stock gt1 motor, kv I don't know.
[2025-09-05T17:25:16] Marius: hmm pretty low, how fast do you think you can go?
[2025-09-05T17:25:19] Marius: ig lots of fw required?
[2025-09-05T17:29:05] Matthew: People always gotta talk trash but not give a reason or solution.
[2025-09-05T17:30:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's not a trash talk, I say this to help him not waste money
[2025-09-05T17:30:58] Smart Repair: Among other things, yes. 5V 150mA is simply far too low. I even have to power the Express via a step-down. Is there any data yet on the x12 alternative? Is it also 120V compatible?
[2025-09-05T17:31:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: I won't help any one designing their own motor as it is precious knowledge
[2025-09-05T17:31:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: Most I can do is telling him he's wrong, so he doesn't loose his money paying 500USD for a rotor
[2025-09-05T17:32:01] Marius: maybe u just say so he doesnt rival your business üòÜ
[2025-09-05T17:32:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: 100v max, better mos
[2025-09-05T17:32:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: I could also have not tell anything and wait for him to loose his money
[2025-09-05T17:32:27] Smart Repair: I recently reached 118kmh without fw. with overmodulation and without fw I get about 140kmh in the air when battery is full
[2025-09-05T17:32:47] Marius: 118 with overmod?
[2025-09-05T17:33:15] Marius: but thats just crazy with 29kv
[2025-09-05T17:33:24] Marius: must be really good settings and crazy batt with no vdrop
[2025-09-05T17:33:49] Marius: i have 44kv and do 118 too üò≠üò≠üò≠
[2025-09-05T17:33:54] Smart Repair: hmm... why not the 120V Fets with 331A?
[2025-09-05T17:34:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: not really hahaha What market is there for an expensive motor honestly ? I referenced our RM-X motor because I'm preventing a weird regulation maybe incoming for next year races asking that only market available motors are allowed, but I'm not going to sell 50pcs of this haha
[2025-09-05T17:34:09] Smart Repair: how many volts?
[2025-09-05T17:34:30] Marius: 20s
[2025-09-05T17:34:35] Marius: but right u have higher voltage i remember
[2025-09-05T17:35:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: There's more 100v users, 100v mos are better. I want to make it cheap and accessible
[2025-09-05T17:35:25] Marius: how are you preventing this regulation? can you clarify
[2025-09-05T17:35:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: By referencing my motor as an available motor on the market
[2025-09-05T17:35:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: in 2025 hahaha
[2025-09-05T17:36:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: https://rage-mechanics.com/moteurs-trottinette-electrique/1633-moteur-rm290.html
[2025-09-05T17:36:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: What if someone buy rmx then reverse engineer your motor üò≥
[2025-09-05T17:36:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: this person would have given me 22800‚Ç¨, that's okay x)
[2025-09-05T17:37:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: and history in electric scooter has proven that, people buying this type of escooter are not the one seeking for reverse engineering or anything like that
[2025-09-05T17:38:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: And, they can reverse engineer it, not a problem, they will still miss a lot of things, a motor isn't only about a piece of aluminium, a few steel sheets and windings together to be efficient
[2025-09-05T17:38:13] Marius: oh ok. but ig its win/win because u also make money
[2025-09-05T17:38:26] Marius: damn sigma
[2025-09-05T17:38:48] Marius: may i ask how many ppl actually buy this ?
[2025-09-05T17:38:50] Marius: or is it secret
[2025-09-05T17:38:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but I don't expect to sell more than 10pcs of this motor I have few person interested, but that's it
[2025-09-05T17:39:04] Marius: the whole scooter i mean
[2025-09-05T17:39:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: Very very few x)
[2025-09-05T17:39:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: and, we are not doing any marketing around it (yet)
[2025-09-05T17:39:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think major of people are going to buy Ducati Panigale with 25k haha
[2025-09-05T17:41:53] Matthew: 100h with 125mm dropout opening?? ü§Ø
[2025-09-05T17:43:37] Marius: oh dont get me excited now
[2025-09-05T17:43:51] Marius: but i wont be customer unfortunately, beyond my paygrade. however i will cheer you on
[2025-09-05T17:44:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: RM-X is more like a flagship
[2025-09-05T17:45:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: other scooters are coming, with better prices
[2025-09-05T17:45:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: https://rage-mechanics.com/rm-series/1632-rm-series-cs75.html
[2025-09-05T17:45:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: This has much more affordable price
[2025-09-05T17:47:27] Marius: yes finally good scooters
[2025-09-05T17:47:32] Marius: the commercial scooters suck ass xd
[2025-09-05T17:47:45] Marius: stupid expensive and zero power
[2025-09-05T17:48:54] Smart Repair: Luckily, MOSFETs can be desoldered üòÄ Do you already know when the ESC will be released?
[2025-09-05T17:50:12] Matthew: Instead of giving him a guide on whats wrong so he can improve you just say its wrong. That doesn't help anything. Unless Patrick is racing you or planning to take over motor market... I honestly dont know what he intends to so with the motors overall but just being the outsider in a group thats supposed to help each other doesn't make sense
[2025-09-05T17:51:05] Marius: makes sense to me because he is a business man
[2025-09-05T17:53:37] Matthew: Like I said though, unless Patrick is looking to go as a motor manufacturing company and build scooters that are in direct competition with him, I just see it as Patrick wanting to learn and maybe help the members of this group. But as I said I am unclear of everything and just having an outsiders look in a help group.
[2025-09-05T17:54:42] Marius: would you tell your insights that you spent stupid time and money in engineering to random people?
[2025-09-05T17:54:48] Marius: if ur a business, doesnt really make sense to do that
[2025-09-05T17:55:32] Patrick: Just want a motor for myself, not like the files wouldn't be public as well. I highly doubt there is anyone here that could even produce it in a quantity that drops the price so much that people would even buy it.
[2025-09-05T17:57:03] Patrick: A hint would be enough when looking at other escooter motors i dont See any mistake on mine
[2025-09-05T17:57:58] haku: manuel i see your here. the balls to walls group. yes there use to be a sale in ali for huameng motors. only for US 60h 22x3
[2025-09-05T17:58:01] Patrick: Dont know why it would run worse then a LY 65H even though it has thicker magnets,bigger stator, smaller gap between stator & magnets and better tolerances
[2025-09-05T17:58:38] Patrick: To my understanding it is improved already
[2025-09-05T17:58:51] Manuel: Noway
[2025-09-05T17:59:07] Manuel: The magnets mustard be made from aluminium
[2025-09-05T17:59:09] Matthew: Thats more my point. Its a help group and youre sharing and accepting input on how to improve. If you intended to create a booming motor company and competitive racing scooters it would make sense in my eyes. I mean, look up Steve Morris racing engines. Dude shows and shares all of his knowledge for inspiration for new people into the industry.
[2025-09-05T17:59:31] Marius: maybe u need mustard between stator and rotor
[2025-09-05T17:59:36] Marius: secret strats
[2025-09-05T17:59:40] haku: tbh dude. the europeans are very very polite. if this is what they call "rude" talk. its not haha
[2025-09-05T17:59:57] Marius: i mean patrick does have company relating to these parts, u never know
[2025-09-05T18:00:07] Marius: and info can spread easily. to me it makes sense really
[2025-09-05T18:00:15] Marius: good morning dad
[2025-09-05T18:00:21] Patrick: Thicker magnets = stronger Smaller airgap = improved magnetic coupling
[2025-09-05T18:00:35] haku: <sticker>
[2025-09-05T18:00:52] Matthew: What what i mean. Like hey watch these clearances. Or look into this spot and address issues with it. He doesn't need to give you the most minute details he keeps for his competitive edge... but again I am just an outsider giving my opinion for a help group
[2025-09-05T18:01:29] Patrick: If he says its worse then 110/65 only a small hint would be enough
[2025-09-05T18:01:36] Marius: he doesnt wanna tell thats it
[2025-09-05T18:01:38] Marius: fuck around and find out
[2025-09-05T18:01:53] Patrick: With thicker magnets, better tolerances & smaller airgap where is there a reason it should be worse
[2025-09-05T18:01:58] Patrick: All thinks should improve it
[2025-09-05T18:02:37] Marius: cmon
[2025-09-05T18:02:38] Marius: what did i do?
[2025-09-05T18:03:23] haku: rumor has it you blew your vesc?
[2025-09-05T18:03:36] Marius: no lol
[2025-09-05T18:03:39] Marius: but it was pure luck
[2025-09-05T18:03:45] haku: okay good
[2025-09-05T18:03:52] Marius: the phase insulation was done and if it happened during drive vesc fuck 100%
[2025-09-05T18:03:58] Marius: but happened while i turned the motor by hand
[2025-09-05T18:04:00] Manuel: Those who knkw
[2025-09-05T18:04:02] Manuel: Know
[2025-09-05T18:04:05] Marius: so when i turned on the vesc it kaboomed
[2025-09-05T18:05:05] Marius: these things u just need to learn with experience
[2025-09-05T18:05:17] Marius: like now i know and wont ever let it happen again
[2025-09-05T18:08:06] Matthew: Thank you
[2025-09-05T18:09:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: We help as much as we can but next time I won't help, just read and say nothing :)
[2025-09-05T18:09:46] Matthew: For overmodulation on 100/100 ubox for lonnyo 65h 17x4, what would be a good value to set with 14s 45amps battery?
[2025-09-05T18:10:42] Matthew: I got you. I do apologize for not being aware you have a company that builds scooters and motors for racing.
[2025-09-05T18:11:09] haku: is there rivalry between germany and france? hmm
[2025-09-05T18:11:27] Matthew: Dunno? I stepped into the middle of stuff.
[2025-09-05T18:11:41] Marius: no xd
[2025-09-05T18:11:56] Marius: i dont think theres a big scooter company in germany
[2025-09-05T18:12:00] Marius: no racing scene anyhow
[2025-09-05T18:12:22] haku: old wounds never heal ive heard
[2025-09-05T18:12:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's the main thing, don't forget that we have some guys on this industry that doesn't understand how motors or controllers works, but they read things and they make money out of it I've learned the hard way to not share this type of things, because it spreads really really fast
[2025-09-05T18:12:55] Marius: what happened?
[2025-09-05T18:13:38] Matthew: Yeah, Jan was mentioning china will rip off anything they can.
[2025-09-05T18:14:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: yeah, China, or not so far, some spanish guys, some french guys, ... üòè They are everywhere with no knowledge, seeking for any information they can use to improve their things and call it innovation after that :p
[2025-09-05T18:16:41] Marius: how did u get the knowledge? just lots of trial and error i assume?
[2025-09-05T18:16:46] Marius: lots of money spent on bad design
[2025-09-05T18:18:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes a lot of researches, time and trials, projects, ...
[2025-09-05T18:22:24] Marius: yes kinda destroys the competetive aspect of racing, because u cant innovate
[2025-09-05T18:23:58] Marius: if they want competition between riders they should make weight categories as well
[2025-09-05T18:24:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Only for motors It comes from some that are unhappy to be very bad at preparations
[2025-09-05T18:24:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: They also proposed to move up LIGHT category from 38 to 40Kg because they didn't manage to make a 38Kg scooter
[2025-09-05T18:24:51] Marius: or is that a thing?
[2025-09-05T18:24:57] Marius: what categories are there in escooter racing?
[2025-09-05T18:25:01] Marius: i only know of the 2 scooter weight limits
[2025-09-05T18:25:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, that's mainly because I gave up my implication at making the regulations I wrote half or 2/3 of the regulations for 2023 and 2024, but some things happened with people in charge of all of this, so I told them to do everything by themselves
[2025-09-05T18:26:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: So now, you have the dumb people giving their opinion, which is quite funny
[2025-09-05T18:27:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's it yes Because you can't monitor max power So there is scooter weight (that defines your maximum power because you can't push 150KW in a 65Kg escooter) and you have maximum voltage, because you can monitor it
[2025-09-05T18:27:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's true
[2025-09-05T18:27:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: But, there is no one keen to make the rules and not being a part of the championship, so it is like this
[2025-09-05T18:28:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: The other people are afraid of my innovation in terms of power, but they shouldn't because we are unable to win a race this year in big category üòÇ
[2025-09-05T18:29:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you knew the guy in charge of all of this, you would understand why it's not possible x)
[2025-09-05T18:29:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Still 35KW
[2025-09-05T18:29:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm not sure
[2025-09-05T18:30:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nobody defined where is measured power
[2025-09-05T18:30:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: Is it at the battery, at the controller, at the wheels ?
[2025-09-05T18:30:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: If it's at the wheels, I can bet we are the only ones close to that x)
[2025-09-05T18:31:07] 'lekrsu': Should be a weight limit, and another rule of it being purely electric. The rest is nonsense.
[2025-09-05T18:31:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's why I fought for no categories based on power, because it's too easy to cheat
[2025-09-05T18:32:24] 'lekrsu': Some scooter riders even do it without knowing, random shunt swaps my beloved
[2025-09-05T18:32:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: By the way, when you look at all officials electric races such as emotogp or formula e, they all the same manufacturing company for the vehicles, because it's the only way to be sure teams don't cheat when going on the benchtest
[2025-09-05T18:32:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes üòÇ
[2025-09-05T18:33:01] haku: would it be possible to post the rules here. like the official stuff
[2025-09-05T18:33:28] LiquorHole .: The hotdogs can definitely handle that with efficiency
[2025-09-05T18:33:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: Or another idea would be to put a module provided by organization, between controllers and battery that monitors the whole power during the race, accessible only by Marshalls
[2025-09-05T18:33:37] 'lekrsu': Is letting the air of the tire out before the weigh in allowed? )
[2025-09-05T18:33:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes exactly hahaha
[2025-09-05T18:34:11] haku: as a future podium first place finisher. i need to see the rules
[2025-09-05T18:34:32] haku: ive been training race athlete
[2025-09-05T18:34:36] 'lekrsu': You'll win the 15kg category :D
[2025-09-05T18:35:04] LiquorHole .: Gonna be racing drones üò≠
[2025-09-05T18:35:05] 'lekrsu': Here you come on a Peak G30¬≥ at 100 km/h
[2025-09-05T18:35:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: <files/RTS Vitesse - 17 juin 2024.pdf>
[2025-09-05T18:35:40] haku: thanks
[2025-09-05T18:35:51] Manuel: Haku my flend
[2025-09-05T18:35:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: go to page 10
[2025-09-05T18:36:08] haku: so no elbows and kicking other racers i see
[2025-09-05T18:36:11] JPPL: 10amps each
[2025-09-05T18:36:36] LiquorHole .: Aw man i wanted to Do a flying Kick in the middle of the race
[2025-09-05T18:36:44] LiquorHole .: How would that even work on a scooter üò≠
[2025-09-05T18:38:10] 'lekrsu': That explains why your racing scooter's handlebar looks the way it does
[2025-09-05T18:38:10] JPPL: @SmartRepair_NRW done firmware compiled with Higher max amps?
[2025-09-05T18:38:23] Marius: i was planning on shorting the throttle cables with pliers, that way the competition would be sent to the moon
[2025-09-05T18:38:31] Marius: i dont see that in the rules anywhere, might try
[2025-09-05T18:38:37] Marius: do i need french citizenship?
[2025-09-05T18:39:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: no, anyone can compete in France
[2025-09-05T18:40:06] Smart Repair: A 17x4 with 14s won't be a rocket. There's not much to gain from it. I wouldn't give more than 10A of fw. I personally don't have any experience with overmodulation.
[2025-09-05T18:40:28] 'lekrsu': You need to bring pain de chocolat to the judges before the race
[2025-09-05T18:40:51] Marius: i will bring baguette to impress them
[2025-09-05T18:41:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Don't forget omelette
[2025-09-05T18:41:25] haku: cheating is part of the game dude. in the highest level of competition. its whatever it takes. just dont get caught
[2025-09-05T18:41:31] Smart Repair: yes, abs max from 600 to 750.
[2025-09-05T18:41:50] Marius: most of the rules are just to prevent u from competing
[2025-09-05T18:42:02] Marius: they know u would obliterate the competition
[2025-09-05T18:42:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: but what phase current did you put to need 750A abs max ?
[2025-09-05T18:44:10] Smart Repair: 500
[2025-09-05T18:44:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's not normal, you shouldn't need an abs max that high
[2025-09-05T18:44:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm using 500A phase amps with 600A abs max
[2025-09-05T18:45:05] Marius: in 22x3?
[2025-09-05T18:45:06] Marius: crazy
[2025-09-05T18:45:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: You need to fine tune your motor if you get abs max errors
[2025-09-05T18:45:07] IMWurden: which esc?
[2025-09-05T18:45:09] Marius: or do u have new motor?
[2025-09-05T18:45:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: C500 (not available on market)
[2025-09-05T18:45:33] IMWurden: oh ok
[2025-09-05T18:45:43] haku: oh no drug testing on the rules. good good
[2025-09-05T18:47:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: sadly they never did any drug test
[2025-09-05T18:48:25] haku: enhanced racing athletes. haha
[2025-09-05T18:49:50] haku: a lil bump is another 5kw
[2025-09-05T18:50:45] Marius: haku with all his prescriptions wouldnt even need the scooter
[2025-09-05T18:51:12] Marius: he just brings in some xiaomi with china slicks, the wheels cant even turn. as soon as the race starts he gets off the scooter and starts running
[2025-09-05T18:51:13] Marius: balls to walls
[2025-09-05T18:55:37] haku: the real balls to wallsers are here. please dont hype me. the 100h hotdog motors and vesc museum and the kw farmers are here
[2025-09-05T18:58:22] haku: not to mention the OGs.
[2025-09-05T19:09:09] JPPL: Me too, didnt test it as i already did with fw. But seems to even help more higher speeds
[2025-09-05T19:24:18] Rose: Hey there Maki, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-05T20:16:59] Smart Repair: The problem is the x12 with current transformers instead of shunts. Many people have this problem with the controller. But I'd appreciate any advice. It's very difficult to find someone who knows about fine-tuning.
[2025-09-05T20:18:42] Smart Repair: What throttle curve and ramp time are you using? Depending on the settings, you can quickly reach high current peaks.
[2025-09-05T20:25:25] Nobrrr: How can i learn to fine tune all the Vesc settings? I am not very experienced in this and wanna learn it
[2025-09-05T20:26:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: This shouldn't be a problem but benefitüò¢
[2025-09-05T20:28:58] Smart Repair: Unfortunately, this isn't the case in practice. Too little current flows for motor detection, and the sensors measure incorrect values.
[2025-09-05T20:29:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Time to take mine thenüòÅ
[2025-09-05T20:30:49] Smart Repair: My motor has a winding resistance of 38 ohms. X12 detection shows 13 ohms.
[2025-09-05T20:31:05] Marius: how did u measure the resistance?
[2025-09-05T20:31:31] Smart Repair: 4 wire voltage drop measurement
[2025-09-05T20:33:09] Smart Repair: From 1A-20A linear, the same result = 38ohm. Therefore, it should be very precise.
[2025-09-05T20:36:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you measure it manually you have to do /2 because you are measuring two phase resistance
[2025-09-05T20:40:34] Smart Repair: ah, right... I didn't think of that üëç
[2025-09-05T20:42:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway I think the hall offset are wrong, I just noticed from your screenshot that is almost impossible to get 45kw with 100kmh top speed. Use a good amperometer and calibrate the offset
[2025-09-05T20:47:02] Smart Repair: I've already invested so much time into it. Currently, it's running flawlessly. Someday, when I feel like it again, I'll redo everything. Before that, though, I'll measure the engine more thoroughly manually.
[2025-09-05T20:47:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: But you won't resolve nothing, as the problem is from current sensor
[2025-09-05T20:56:12] haku: boys im thinking of shaving my head. my hair too thick to fit a proper helmet. would that look degrade my sex apeal and intellect? or will it add more?
[2025-09-05T20:57:06] haku: right now im considered a 9 in asian standards
[2025-09-05T21:00:08] Smart Repair: I'll take a look at it tomorrow and report back.
[2025-09-05T22:14:24] Noname: Out of a 40 scale?
[2025-09-05T22:15:48] AG.racing: Its you ???
[2025-09-05T22:16:43] IMWurden: Guys, what do the winding type numbers like 17x4 or 22x3 stand for? What does 22 correspond to? What does 3 correspond to?
[2025-09-05T22:21:55] 'lekrsu': Parallel x Turns
[2025-09-05T22:45:34] Smart Repair: Same motor 1. detection with ubox (measured resistance 19,6Ohm matches my manual measurement 100%) 2. detection with X12 X12 is a catastrophe
[2025-09-05T22:45:34] Smart Repair: <photos/photo_25783@05-09-2025_22-45-34.jpg>
[2025-09-05T22:45:39] LiquorHole .: Go bald
[2025-09-05T22:45:49] LiquorHole .: Become the asian Thor from god of war
[2025-09-05T22:57:01] Marius: oh you will be like the stone
[2025-09-05T22:57:09] Marius: women will throw themselves at you, or men, whatever ur into these days
[2025-09-05T23:24:34] Matthew: 22x3 is 22 wires in parallel turned 3x
[2025-09-05T23:32:23] Smart Repair: Maybe there's something wrong with the x12 or 70h. I just did a test on the table with the identical motor and the x12 beta. The detection works with it.
[2025-09-05T23:39:58] ausias: in Spain yes, just to 1 driver
[2025-09-05T23:40:47] LiquorHole .: Is their a weight limit for riders or a midget that weighs 60lbs Could compete as well
[2025-09-05T23:41:26] Marius: think no limit xdd
[2025-09-05T23:41:34] Marius: i think thats why rage uses like girl riders too
[2025-09-05T23:42:42] JPPL: 6.06 ?
[2025-09-05T23:42:45] LiquorHole .: Balls to the walls?
[2025-09-05T23:42:51] LiquorHole .: Think that still applies
[2025-09-05T23:45:00] Marius: who knows these days
[2025-09-05T23:45:14] LiquorHole .: Body to the pavement it is
[2025-09-05T23:45:16] Matthew: Nascar enters conversation.
[2025-09-05T23:45:39] LiquorHole .: Someday we‚Äôll have scooter nascar
[2025-09-05T23:45:44] LiquorHole .: Nasscoot?
[2025-09-05T23:45:56] LiquorHole .: What would that be called
[2025-09-05T23:56:17] Matthew: Ideas
[2025-09-05T23:58:35] Matthew: Sorry, I have been really into Asian fighting movies
[2025-09-06T00:16:30] Smart Repair: Yes
[2025-09-06T00:16:44] Nobrrr: Can you look dm real quick please
[2025-09-06T00:27:03] Smart Repair: I already told you that I cannot help you with this.
[2025-09-06T00:58:18] Oreo huzky: Does anyone have a jrev g30 floorplate it‚Äôs urgend will pay good money for it
[2025-09-06T00:58:35] Oreo huzky: Needs to be shipped asap
[2025-09-06T00:59:13] Marius: @Supremeavocado225
[2025-09-06T00:59:15] Marius: make some money boi
[2025-09-06T00:59:19] Patrick: If you dont find one Text this Patrick cnc guy in G30 chat he can probably make one quick
[2025-09-06T01:33:07] haku: good idea
[2025-09-06T01:42:05] Nobrrr: You suddenly have no contact at all anymore? You asked everyone so that we can get our money back but nothing happened
[2025-09-06T01:42:32] haku: what are you working on thats worth good money if you dont mind me asking
[2025-09-06T01:42:59] Marius: he has g30
[2025-09-06T01:43:01] Marius: multiple i think
[2025-09-06T01:43:28] haku: ooh i see. we used to be laotie bros. looks like he turned too
[2025-09-06T01:44:13] Marius: sure seems that way
[2025-09-06T01:44:17] Marius: 30s and 20s g30 apparently
[2025-09-06T01:44:18] haku: but best believe peak g30 is one of a kind
[2025-09-06T01:44:30] Marius: i see u are featured in the 400page scooter pdf
[2025-09-06T01:44:34] Marius: a lot

[2025-09-06T01:53:14] Oreo huzky: Ah looks fine enough
[2025-09-06T01:53:31] Marius: however it is only 3mm. so only temporary solution imo
[2025-09-06T01:53:51] Marius: the plate is 25euro with shipping, so if u need something fast thast the way to go
[2025-09-06T01:56:21] Marius: <photos/photo_25790@06-09-2025_01-56-21.jpg>
[2025-09-06T01:57:26] Oreo huzky: Already ordered
[2025-09-06T01:58:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: You need to learn about PID
[2025-09-06T01:58:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can look at vedder's videos to understand the basics
[2025-09-06T01:59:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes it's not possible, especially with that little phase amps
[2025-09-06T08:37:53] Nobrrr: For what do you use all the pid control stuff in Vesc?
[2025-09-06T08:44:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: For fine tuning the engine so it doesn't clog or make noise
[2025-09-06T09:17:00] Nobrrr: Do you guys have any recommendations for a hot air station for repairing logic boards and other pcbs like this?
[2025-09-06T09:33:07] Smart Repair: Again, I have nothing to do with this. You didn't pay the money to me. Contact the recipient.
[2025-09-06T09:40:34] sombre_enfant: Yeah on the casing there should be a groove matching the cover lids so it center no only by the screw
[2025-09-06T09:44:40] Nobrrr: Alright but do you know where i could get the contact?
[2025-09-06T09:51:41] Smart Repair: No, I've already told you that I won't simply share Jerome's wife's contact information. That's not appropriate. Contact the bank where you transferred the money.
[2025-09-06T10:03:41] Smart Repair: Is there good documentation?
[2025-09-06T12:19:14] Smart Repair: Is anyone using 6.06 with Express logging? Everything worked fine with 6.05. With 6.06, logging is in a loop. Every 3 seconds, logging starts and immediately stops again.

[2025-09-06T12:30:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, there was only Ninebotextreme, and it was last year
[2025-09-06T12:31:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Look at Vedder's videos for the basics
[2025-09-06T12:35:06] 'lekrsu': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyHBveryLeE
[2025-09-06T12:52:48] Nobrrr: Vedder is the god
[2025-09-06T13:36:29] Mattia: Hello everyone, can you recommend 11 inch 70/75h engines that fit in the chassis of the kaboo king gt?
[2025-09-06T14:13:35] Reekoz: Hello everyone, can you recommend 13 inch 70/75h engines that fit in the chassis of the teverun supreme 7260r?
[2025-09-06T14:39:41] Nobrrr: @NewTurtle7815
[2025-09-06T14:41:45] LiquorHole .: Pretty sure the 7260r can fit a 90h motor since the stock 60h motor in size atleast is the same size as the 90h
[2025-09-06T15:22:58] Reekoz: Do you know maybe where I can get its dimensions? I cannot find the original motor on lonnyo‚Äôs website, but for the other motors on the web there is a sketch with the exact dimensions
[2025-09-06T15:23:24] LiquorHole .: 90h is 171mm
[2025-09-06T15:23:41] LiquorHole .: <photos/photo_25792@06-09-2025_15-23-41.jpg>
[2025-09-06T15:24:06] Reekoz: <photos/photo_25793@06-09-2025_15-24-06.jpg>
[2025-09-06T15:24:20] Reekoz: Thats the 90h
[2025-09-06T15:24:25] LiquorHole .: Yup
[2025-09-06T15:24:43] Reekoz: But I need to compare it to the original 60h
[2025-09-06T15:24:49] Reekoz: Which is what im looking for
[2025-09-06T15:25:00] LiquorHole .: The original 60h Is just a modified 90h üò≠
[2025-09-06T15:25:15] Reekoz: Oh good to know
[2025-09-06T15:25:34] LiquorHole .: Cause at first i thought the 7260r used the 90h until i saw the specs written on the motor since the two Look IDENTICAL
[2025-09-06T15:28:16] Reekoz: Wonder how this motor will perform compared to original, i‚Äôm afraid I must replace the motors cause the originals has this bad jolet connector and thin wires, I‚Äôm pretty sure if i‚Äôm gonna push like 90 or 100 Amp a motor they‚Äôre gonna heat up
[2025-09-06T15:31:02] LiquorHole .: It will have less kv then the 60h (i think) but wont heat up nearly as fast and probably give more torque so Less Top end speed but More torque and wont heat up fast
[2025-09-06T15:31:43] LiquorHole .: Honestly if your just doing 100a per motor get New stock ones cause that‚Äôs Nothing at all the stock ones are still lonnyo motors so they can go up to like 100-120¬∞C still
[2025-09-06T17:04:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_25794@06-09-2025_17-04-26.jpg>

[2025-09-06T18:54:11] Noname: Doing a hotdog ride to 4 places
[2025-09-06T18:54:26] haku: nice. what you get
[2025-09-06T18:54:26] Noname: Motor is cooking today lol hit 86¬∞c
[2025-09-06T18:54:35] haku: not bad
[2025-09-06T18:54:52] LiquorHole .: I have absolutely no idea, yisuntrek sent them to me for free to test them out for them
[2025-09-06T18:55:03] haku: free is good
[2025-09-06T18:55:22] haku: open it and check for us
[2025-09-06T18:55:25] haku: please
[2025-09-06T18:55:40] LiquorHole .: All i know is that theyre 60h and apparently have more acceleration then My current HM motors which is 22x3
[2025-09-06T18:55:53] haku: you have 70h yea
[2025-09-06T18:56:02] LiquorHole .: Yea
[2025-09-06T18:56:06] haku: maybe 60h 16x4
[2025-09-06T18:56:11] haku: they sent you
[2025-09-06T18:56:22] LiquorHole .: Probably cause it said it will have less top end speed also
[2025-09-06T18:56:44] LiquorHole .: Lemme show the email they sent like 2-3 months ago
[2025-09-06T18:56:51] haku: free is free. im happy for you but hating like a true hater
[2025-09-06T18:56:56] LiquorHole .: <photos/photo_25798@06-09-2025_18-56-56.jpg>
[2025-09-06T18:57:43] haku: did you have to pay shippimg
[2025-09-06T18:57:46] LiquorHole .: Free is free yes But they arent Ballsy enough
[2025-09-06T18:57:49] LiquorHole .: No
[2025-09-06T18:57:53] LiquorHole .: Completely free
[2025-09-06T18:58:55] LiquorHole .: They seem interesting and since it‚Äôs coming before i get my scooter fixed ill have time to think about if I actually wanna put them on instead of the Hm motors since theirs Nothing wrong with them
[2025-09-06T19:01:14] LiquorHole .: But as far as What they are idk, they look like the motors from the Extreme bull K6
[2025-09-06T19:01:35] haku: 16x4 is nice. i enjoy the torque and no need for big amps
[2025-09-06T19:01:48] haku: 7"
[2025-09-06T19:02:13] LiquorHole .: Yeah they look exactly the same but that means Little really lol
[2025-09-06T19:02:29] haku: agreed
[2025-09-06T19:02:51] Oreo huzky: Bruh does anyone have experience with glitter giving error E01 I‚Äôve cleaned the tips and still not working
[2025-09-06T19:03:13] haku: open and measure stator. amd stuff. im nerdy when it comes to this

[2025-09-06T19:43:31] Oreo huzky: And also Ling long didn‚Äôt screw the welding pins together properly
[2025-09-06T19:45:12] haku: ling kong is like glitter?

[2025-09-06T19:45:42] Oreo huzky: Ling Long because eh Chinese
[2025-09-06T19:47:44] Oreo huzky: Has more power too after cleaning before was 3,6kA at setting 16 now it is 4,4kA
[2025-09-06T19:51:14] Oreo huzky: That welds okay for pure copper?
[2025-09-06T19:52:08] Oreo huzky: I can hold whole battery weight on the weld spots before it tears the copper
[2025-09-06T19:53:57] haku: nice! what size copper?
[2025-09-06T19:54:22] haku: 811h can do .15 reliably
[2025-09-06T19:54:28] haku: .2 or more no
[2025-09-06T19:55:00] 'lekrsu': That means it's welded, so yeah
[2025-09-06T19:56:06] Oreo huzky: 0.1
[2025-09-06T19:59:45] Oreo huzky: Why it was soo clean üò≠
[2025-09-06T20:01:00] Oreo huzky: Why does that happen?
[2025-09-06T20:01:09] haku: too much power
[2025-09-06T20:01:15] haku: do .15
[2025-09-06T20:01:25] Oreo huzky: Only have .1
[2025-09-06T20:01:42] Oreo huzky: Already have it set to 10 and it goes to 99
[2025-09-06T20:01:45] haku: lower power
[2025-09-06T20:02:08] Oreo huzky: Set it to 6 now
[2025-09-06T20:02:15] Marius: why not sandwich?
[2025-09-06T20:02:27] haku: what welder is it exactly?
[2025-09-06T20:03:09] 'lekrsu': Could be an air gap as well
[2025-09-06T20:03:13] haku: also do a rip test
[2025-09-06T20:03:20] Oreo huzky: Glitter 811A
[2025-09-06T20:03:35] Oreo huzky: Pushed like 4kg on it
[2025-09-06T20:03:49] Oreo huzky: Did it tears the strip

[2025-09-06T20:07:31] Oreo huzky: Hm?
[2025-09-06T20:07:38] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2025-09-06T20:07:50] Oreo huzky: Ye but it‚Äôs strong enough with just copper
[2025-09-06T20:12:24] JPPL: Wait
[2025-09-06T20:12:55] JPPL: There is good thermal pad yes
[2025-09-06T20:13:18] JPPL: You must take of cables plug
[2025-09-06T20:13:26] JPPL: Then capacitator module
[2025-09-06T20:13:51] Noname: Yeah its ok to charge here were with the band lol
[2025-09-06T20:14:06] JPPL: Cable plug is a first
[2025-09-06T20:15:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Resistance spot welder not good for direct copper welding
[2025-09-06T20:16:20] JPPL: Thats why strips or other methods are used
[2025-09-06T20:17:29] sombre_enfant: The reason why my shi wont go 120kph and be overheating

[2025-09-06T20:23:10] JPPL: Less pain to the cells
[2025-09-06T20:24:46] haku: how thick copper can it do? nice
[2025-09-06T20:43:18] haku: <video_file>
[2025-09-06T21:02:24] Dualtron Achilleus: No cable plug doesnt bloc

[2025-09-06T21:02:47] Dualtron Achilleus: Bwt mosfets and case

[2025-09-06T22:33:36] Yamal: I'm so happy to see the king testing his own electronics. This is just getting started, so hold on tight ^^

[2025-09-06T22:44:25] Yamal: What is an electronic festival or something, or a race?
[2025-09-06T22:45:04] Yamal: are you still using Ubox?

[2025-09-06T22:47:37] Marius: xddd
[2025-09-06T22:47:38] Marius: what
[2025-09-06T22:47:42] Marius: no
[2025-09-06T22:47:44] Nobrrr: Are you serious?
[2025-09-06T22:48:02] critical: is it too wide
[2025-09-06T22:48:05] Marius: yes
[2025-09-06T22:48:13] Nobrrr: No def not
[2025-09-06T22:48:17] Nobrrr: Fits easy
[2025-09-06T22:48:18] critical: how would i mod the deck to fit it
[2025-09-06T22:51:08] Marius: u would have to make the deck wider
[2025-09-06T22:51:16] LiquorHole .: Whats the exact size of your Xhs80 motor, would i need to make a custom order for it to fit the 155mm axle or no
[2025-09-06T22:51:27] Marius: remove the walls, weld a wider deck, and weld the walls further apart
[2025-09-06T22:51:32] Marius: stupid effort and probably not smart thing to do
[2025-09-06T22:51:44] LiquorHole .: Needa know so I can see if i got clearance for the rotors and Hope techs
[2025-09-06T22:51:49] Marius: for this effort just make a battery suitable for g30
[2025-09-06T22:56:43] critical: cba doing that
[2025-09-06T22:56:47] critical: alr
[2025-09-06T22:56:56] Marius: yes it would be stupid to do that
[2025-09-06T22:57:01] Marius: because the point of g30 is to be small frame
[2025-09-06T22:57:06] critical: ye
[2025-09-06T22:57:08] Marius: why would u turn it into a wide frame
[2025-09-06T22:57:10] Marius: it doesnt make any sense
[2025-09-06T22:57:21] critical: so without mods to the frame can it get a 60v battery
[2025-09-06T22:57:32] Marius: max with cellholder is 120 cells
[2025-09-06T22:57:43] critical: alr lemme check
[2025-09-06T22:57:50] critical: some cells are different sizes asw tho ?
[2025-09-06T22:57:53] Marius: so 20s6p (72v), or 30s4p (108v) etc.
[2025-09-06T22:57:56] critical: in height
[2025-09-06T22:57:58] Marius: 21700 cells
[2025-09-06T22:58:15] Marius: and if u do 120 cells u have no space anymore, so bms and escs go at the bottom in a spacer
[2025-09-06T22:58:34] critical: <photos/photo_25808@06-09-2025_22-58-34.jpg>
[2025-09-06T22:58:37] critical: this good ?
[2025-09-06T22:58:49] Marius: no
[2025-09-06T22:58:51] Marius: get 50pl
[2025-09-06T22:59:10] Marius: if u want high power at least
[2025-09-06T22:59:24] critical: <photos/photo_25809@06-09-2025_22-59-24.jpg>
[2025-09-06T22:59:25] Marius: u will cook the 50s lifetime if u draw much power, they are high capacity cells not intended for high amps
[2025-09-06T22:59:54] critical: the voltage is 3.6 for this so does that mean the max is 36 or can it be more
[2025-09-06T23:11:22] Marius: nominal voltage 3.6
[2025-09-06T23:11:30] Marius: so with 10 in series its 36v
[2025-09-06T23:11:35] Marius: full charge 42v
[2025-09-06T23:11:40] Marius: 4.2v per cell full charged
[2025-09-06T23:45:14] Noname: That one is an 85/240. Its fine under the seat just drove it home in a torrential downpour in the truck
[2025-09-06T23:48:48] Noname: Yeah not available yet.
[2025-09-06T23:49:06] Noname: Im mad that honda cb125 sold
[2025-09-06T23:59:01] critical: so if i had 80 cells what would that be
[2025-09-06T23:59:14] Marius: depends how many u put in series
[2025-09-06T23:59:17] Marius: and how many in parallel
[2025-09-06T23:59:24] Marius: for example 80cells u could do 20s4p
[2025-09-06T23:59:28] critical: how many would i need for 60v
[2025-09-06T23:59:29] Marius: then u have 72v nominal
[2025-09-06T23:59:45] Marius: 16s so u need 16 cells times the amount u want in parallel
[2025-09-07T00:05:02] Noname: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1BYYXcvkG3/
[2025-09-07T00:06:17] Nobrrr: Is there a official Vesc tg group? Not for only scooter
[2025-09-07T00:08:20] Nobrrr: Okay so I need to ask here although it‚Äôs about mid drive motors
[2025-09-07T00:10:37] Nobrrr: Which high power Mid drive motors are there that are high quality and high power. I am looking for a qs 138 motors size but since I heard that they aren‚Äôt that nice quality I am searching for a better one that‚Äôs fitting for a converted dirt bike
[2025-09-07T00:10:47] Marius: mtpa isnt useful on hub?
[2025-09-07T00:11:31] Nobrrr: #general@VescHelpGroup
[2025-09-07T00:12:10] Marius: hmm i think zuna uses it and roger also put it on mine, but idk
[2025-09-07T00:12:23] Marius: yeah he said it can give huge spikes
[2025-09-07T00:14:14] Rose: Hey there Bruno Schmid, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-07T00:14:15] critical: how many do i need in parallel
[2025-09-07T00:14:26] critical: what‚Äôs the difference. etween parallel and series
[2025-09-07T00:21:19] Nobrrr: I just found something very interesting
[2025-09-07T00:21:34] Marius: series adds voltage
[2025-09-07T00:21:37] Nobrrr: There are already QS Hairpin Motors available
[2025-09-07T00:21:42] Marius: parallel adds current / capacity
[2025-09-07T00:21:52] Nobrrr: With N46UH magnets
[2025-09-07T00:22:00] Nobrrr: Imma look into that
[2025-09-07T00:22:01] Marius: for example in g30 120 cells max. u could do 20s6p
[2025-09-07T00:22:16] Marius: so if one cell has 3.6v and 4ah, u would have 72v nominal and 24ah
[2025-09-07T00:22:26] critical: ohh so 20 series would be 72v?
[2025-09-07T00:28:10] Unknown: yess
[2025-09-07T00:28:41] Unknown: 20 cells in series is 20 x 3.6V Parrallel adds the Ah
[2025-09-07T00:30:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: It was a association forum, and our motoclub were there so they asked me a scooter to be there
[2025-09-07T00:31:17] critical: oh alr i understand
[2025-09-07T00:31:39] critical: so these are 5aH each so i need 5 in in parallel for 25aH?
[2025-09-07T00:40:38] critical: alr tysm
[2025-09-07T00:40:50] critical: do u think for a first time it‚Äôs gonna be alr to make the battery myself ?
[2025-09-07T00:43:44] Marius: sure
[2025-09-07T00:43:53] critical: wait i got 1 last question
[2025-09-07T00:43:54] Marius: just research so u dont build bomb
[2025-09-07T00:44:06] critical: so if i want a 54v 25ah battery
[2025-09-07T00:44:14] critical: i need 15 cells in parallel and 5 in series
[2025-09-07T00:44:18] critical: in total 75 cells ?
[2025-09-07T00:44:36] Marius: other way around
[2025-09-07T00:44:49] critical: 15 in series and 5 in parallel
[2025-09-07T00:44:53] critical: and 75 total ?
[2025-09-07T00:45:22] Marius: and 54v is 14s yes
[2025-09-07T00:45:30] critical: alr
[2025-09-07T00:45:31] Marius: oh
[2025-09-07T00:45:34] Marius: ye 15s ur right
[2025-09-07T00:45:40] critical: ok
[2025-09-07T00:45:41] Marius: but just use the s dont use voltage its dumb
[2025-09-07T00:45:47] Marius: like say 15s dont say 54v
[2025-09-07T00:45:49] Marius: voltage changes
[2025-09-07T00:45:55] critical: alr that‚Äôs fine then
[2025-09-07T00:46:03] critical: <photos/photo_25810@07-09-2025_00-46-03.jpg>
[2025-09-07T00:46:06] critical: and this is fine ?
[2025-09-07T00:46:12] 'lekrsu': You know more than the majority just by that ^^)
[2025-09-07T00:46:38] critical: u making me happy ü§≠üòÇ
[2025-09-07T00:46:57] 'lekrsu': You don't need 50PL cells unless it's very high discharge use, they are very new and fancy cells though, costs more for it
[2025-09-07T00:47:20] critical: they are like ¬£3 each which is a good price i think
[2025-09-07T00:47:58] 'lekrsu': There's 5Ah cells with ~15-25A discharge, normally with the name "50E", bunch of brands make their version, 1.5-2‚Ç¨ range nowadays
[2025-09-07T00:48:10] Marius: they are cheap lol
[2025-09-07T00:48:14] Marius: no other 5ah cell really
[2025-09-07T00:48:19] Marius: oh yeah
[2025-09-07T00:48:27] Marius: forogt about those
[2025-09-07T00:48:31] critical: alr lemme see if i can find a uk supplier or if this company delivers to the uk
[2025-09-07T00:48:36] critical: should i check the 50e ones asw ?
[2025-09-07T00:49:10] 'lekrsu': Yeah, Eve 50E is a great cell. Slightly better than Samsung 50E.
[2025-09-07T00:49:13] critical: <photos/photo_25811@07-09-2025_00-49-13.jpg>
[2025-09-07T00:49:38] critical: <photos/photo_25812@07-09-2025_00-49-38.jpg>
[2025-09-07T00:49:40] critical: these ?
[2025-09-07T00:49:43] critical: they so cheap
[2025-09-07T00:50:21] 'lekrsu': 2.75 pounds isn't cheap for that
[2025-09-07T00:50:31] critical: really ?
[2025-09-07T00:50:37] 'lekrsu': Cell prices are a rollercoaster though xD
[2025-09-07T00:50:46] critical: for a 54v 25aH battery it would cost about ¬£150
[2025-09-07T00:51:04] critical: i was gonna buy a pre made 48v 15aH for ¬£300 the other day lol
[2025-09-07T00:51:06] Dualtron Achilleus: Someone selling large dualtron cartage?
[2025-09-07T00:51:33] critical: if i was to buy at this price it would still be fine right ?
[2025-09-07T00:51:44] 'lekrsu': Then JBD BMS is 50‚Ç¨, spacers, the welding material (nickel, copper, etc), spacers, fishpaper, kapton, heatshrink. Adds up.
[2025-09-07T00:51:53] 'lekrsu': And you need to buy a cell spotwelder.
[2025-09-07T00:52:08] critical: how much would all that stuff be
[2025-09-07T00:52:50] 'lekrsu': 50‚Ç¨ BMS + 25-50‚Ç¨ rest + 50-200‚Ç¨ spotweld
[2025-09-07T00:52:55] Marius: and welder
[2025-09-07T00:53:03] 'lekrsu': Read maybe
[2025-09-07T00:53:08] critical: i need a spot weld and welder ?
[2025-09-07T00:53:19] Marius: i can only read one message at a time my boi
[2025-09-07T00:53:51] critical: so for this stuff it would be around 200 total if i spend 100 on a spot weld
[2025-09-07T00:53:56] 'lekrsu': Yeah, unfortunately soldering cells is not an option as that causes cell degradation
[2025-09-07T00:54:35] 'lekrsu': Doesn't financially make sense for a single battery build, but the skill you gain and the tools bought, can be used again and again.
[2025-09-07T00:55:02] critical: tbh i‚Äôm only gonna do it once i doubt id do it again unless its for other people
[2025-09-07T00:55:16] critical: i‚Äôm gonna see if there‚Äôs shops that do it for me
[2025-09-07T00:55:26] 'lekrsu': Thought I'd do it once for myself, but here we are, doing it multiple times for myself xD
[2025-09-07T00:55:26] Marius: u can ask james
[2025-09-07T00:55:32] Marius: but shipping is expensive probalby to uk but idk
[2025-09-07T00:55:40] Marius: but expensive anyway with battery
[2025-09-07T00:55:48] critical: i buy the stuff he builds and ships it ?
[2025-09-07T00:56:11] Marius: u pay him
[2025-09-07T00:56:13] Marius: he does everything
[2025-09-07T00:56:16] critical: i doubt ima have another scooter
[2025-09-07T01:19:07] Noname: Thank you Very much @Bradhaku. Idk why the death threat but ok
[2025-09-07T01:19:25] LiquorHole .: ^

[2025-09-07T10:47:49] S1m 0n: No matter what frequency or volume? I'm trying to recreate Kim Possible's SMS ringtone üòÖ and higher frequencies, which sound closer to the original, need a higher volume to be heard.
[2025-09-07T10:50:55] S1m 0n: Or maybe the Nintendo beep from the Gameboys. I'm not sure yet... what will be closer to the original
[2025-09-07T11:42:54] Rose: Hey there D.‚ÄãEv¬°|l, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-07T11:50:27] Mattia: Can anyone recommend 11 inch 70/75h engines that fit in the chassis of the kaboo king gt?
[2025-09-07T12:12:42] Yamal: LY engines ?

[2025-09-07T12:36:54] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: Unfortunately the center distance is different, and the Kaabo motors are very powerful, so there's no point in changing them.
[2025-09-07T12:41:32] Yamal: And the latest version of the engines looked cool, with the rim that could be removed, like the Thunder

[2025-09-07T16:27:49] critical: i got a question
[2025-09-07T16:28:01] critical: if i want the 54v 25aH battery do i need to buy connectors
[2025-09-07T16:28:16] critical: and should i get vesc or use stock controller and motor
[2025-09-07T16:35:51] 'lekrsu': No idea what you have.
[2025-09-07T16:39:35] Youssef Ben Amor: Do you know a supplier who sells batteries for electric scooters?
[2025-09-07T19:18:11] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: I currently have a similar configuration with 310a phase and 200a battery, it works well
[2025-09-07T19:19:02] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: and unfortunately you won't find a way to put a bigger engine in the front you have to redo the fork yokes
[2025-09-07T19:19:54] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: At the rear it is possible, I have several friends who have done it but the front is too expensive for little performance
[2025-09-07T19:28:56] Yamal: 130 ah I think it was
[2025-09-07T19:30:23] LiquorHole .: I would say what do people need all that energy for but I could ask myself the same question üò≠

[2025-09-07T20:06:45] 'lekrsu': Swap one resistor and that's solved before it happens
[2025-09-07T20:06:52] Noname: Idk its been working for years now
[2025-09-07T20:07:01] LiquorHole .: If it was pouch cells id be apart of the 30kw club soon ü§í
[2025-09-07T20:07:10] 'lekrsu': Equivalent of giving 5V to your Spintend ADC1 port. Works until it just doesn't.
[2025-09-07T20:07:18] Noname: G30 is 48v stock?
[2025-09-07T20:07:20] Noname: I forget
[2025-09-07T20:07:32] Mattia: Wich cells
[2025-09-07T20:08:02] 'lekrsu': No, 36V/10S. Anything above 46.2V by the 130K resistor in line to ADC (measuring battery voltage) is >3.3v
[2025-09-07T20:08:06] LiquorHole .: Prismatic Cells From CATL the Box looking cells
[2025-09-07T20:08:18] haku: they copied me yams. no originality
[2025-09-07T20:09:04] haku: my peak g30v3 will put them to shame em i right Noname
[2025-09-07T20:09:07] 'lekrsu': Works until it doesn't. There's no argument, just is.
[2025-09-07T20:09:17] Mattia: Its lifepo?
[2025-09-07T20:09:17] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2025-09-07T20:09:31] LiquorHole .: Nmc or ncm
[2025-09-07T20:09:34] LiquorHole .: Either one
[2025-09-07T20:09:36] Noname: I didnt know back 3 yrs ago and its still working
[2025-09-07T20:10:05] 'lekrsu': Repair shops love that mentality, yearly esc swap xD
[2025-09-07T20:10:07] LiquorHole .: Still not sure which of the two it is or if theirs a difference in the first place
[2025-09-07T20:11:17] Noname: 39 months and still going
[2025-09-07T20:11:24] 'lekrsu': Until it doesn't
[2025-09-07T20:11:37] Noname: Whatever I'll upgrade it when asked
[2025-09-07T20:31:28] Yamal: Really cool man , how they fold

[2025-09-07T20:38:11] Yamal: That's the first division, bro. They always wear the best
[2025-09-07T20:38:36] Marius: what motors does weped use?
[2025-09-07T20:38:39] haku: mine is smaller
[2025-09-07T20:38:52] haku: and lighter. bulletproof up to 45acp
[2025-09-07T20:39:07] haku: em i right Noname
[2025-09-07T20:39:58] Noname: Yes but not because you sent me repair parts. That did not sway my vote.
[2025-09-07T20:40:04] Yamal: Don‚Äôt know if weped ones, or 70/75 h
[2025-09-07T20:40:14] Noname: Idk what we talking about?
[2025-09-07T20:40:34] Yamal: Diferent vehicles I think both cool
[2025-09-07T20:40:38] haku: no. that was a gift from the heart. im trully a loving individual. i do not buy love
[2025-09-07T20:41:38] haku: a caring person. a true gift to society and the vesc comminity
[2025-09-07T20:42:19] Noname: Oh the weped no not a fan
[2025-09-07T20:42:36] haku: yea they copied peak g30. unreal
[2025-09-07T20:42:52] Noname: Crazy how close it resembles it
[2025-09-07T20:43:04] LiquorHole .: Wait that weped is racing too?
[2025-09-07T20:43:52] haku: well weped will compete with haku industries. in america we support our own. get fucked china
[2025-09-07T20:44:06] Yamal: I've always liked weped, and it's not a new brand ^^
[2025-09-07T20:44:31] LiquorHole .: Weped is like the harley of scooters in my eyes
[2025-09-07T20:44:38] Yamal: Weped Korea / Dualtron Korea old
[2025-09-07T20:44:47] Noname: Well I had fun on the c80 yesterday might as well keep it. New rear motor or 2wd mabey?
[2025-09-07T20:45:10] haku: find. away to mount 70h qs
[2025-09-07T20:45:25] haku: dont let it rot
[2025-09-07T20:45:33] Noname: It doesnt make sense its more motor than available power
[2025-09-07T20:45:42] haku: true
[2025-09-07T20:45:53] haku: everything has to pair
[2025-09-07T20:46:50] Noname: Honestly did fine yesterday but it gets hot quick and pushing throttle past 3-4kw makes no improvement in speed
[2025-09-07T20:47:55] Noname: The forks are alum. But hollow where the bolt goes through. I could remove forks slide motor in and reassemble. Add a torque plate
[2025-09-07T20:48:18] haku: dont dual on a moped. haha
[2025-09-07T20:48:24] LiquorHole .: Per motor?
[2025-09-07T20:48:24] Noname: Why
[2025-09-07T20:48:38] Noname: Like 1kw in front would be fine
[2025-09-07T20:48:41] haku: idk tbh
[2025-09-07T20:49:08] haku: i will just get jelly of the moped department
[2025-09-07T20:49:16] Noname: It takes tha abuse of the disk brake stopping 300lbs itll be fine
[2025-09-07T20:49:33] Noname: <photos/photo_24696@13-07-2025_23-09-25.jpg>
[2025-09-07T20:52:39] Noname: Actually the weight might help. It has very sensitive steering. Feels twitchy to a noob but its just darty af
[2025-09-07T20:56:54] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: yes
[2025-09-07T20:56:59] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: yes
[2025-09-07T20:58:48] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: unfortunately the rear engine didn't like it too much last time, with the heatwave in France + the race and I never put a temperature sensor I think the magnets took a hit, I lost more than half the power
[2025-09-07T21:00:07] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: but for several months it has been working well like this but with fairly high temperatures, the addition of a temperature sensor is necessary and extends the lifespan
[2025-09-07T21:11:27] haku: guys remember when you see these peak g30 clones coming in the market. remember who did it first
[2025-09-07T21:11:43] haku: like i said. future of mobility

[2025-09-07T22:12:01] Kafka Luke: use Telegraph client for telegram to see ID
[2025-09-07T22:12:18] Kafka Luke: and check them in free bots like funstat
[2025-09-07T22:12:29] haku: pro

[2025-09-07T22:14:27] haku: help @jamessoderstrom the feds
[2025-09-07T22:14:49] haku: how you do this
[2025-09-07T22:15:38] Kafka Luke: if they have no username to check in bot, use Telegraph client and thats all, you see ID and check them like that in free bots called funstat
[2025-09-07T22:16:24] haku: so that means im a legit person not bot? is that right?
[2025-09-07T22:16:55] Kafka Luke: most likely, bot see only public shit

[2025-09-08T03:23:16] Rose: Hey there Maki, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-08T03:24:03] Maki Verem: Hi everyone! How can I program a VESC with an ADC adapter so that my LED strip flashes yellow on the corresponding side (left or right) when using the turn signals, s o that the LED strip also works as an indicator? What kind of LED strip or what additional components do I need to make this work? Thank you guys for the answer
[2025-09-08T05:33:21] Yamal: But no there are like small Fardriver right ,,?
[2025-09-08T05:33:50] LiquorHole .: Small is probably still bigger than an average Esc
[2025-09-08T05:38:29] Yamal: I also noticed in Vedder's last video that I imagined the Max120 to be more compact or smaller.
[2025-09-08T05:39:10] Yamal: It doesn't seem like an option for small projects
[2025-09-08T06:13:41] Noname: The adc blinks the lights as is
[2025-09-08T06:14:23] Noname: Yeah its like 30a and still big
[2025-09-08T06:16:44] Noname: I just found this on AliExpress: $49.00 | 48V-72V 35A Electric Scooter Motorcycle Programmable FOC Controller Support Bluetooth https://a.aliexpress.com/_mthSF5F
[2025-09-08T06:17:20] Noname: VESC Minim - VESC Labs https://www.vesclabs.com/product/vl-minim-100v/
[2025-09-08T06:17:49] Noname: Then theres this thing thats smaller than the fardriver plug and more powerful but 3x the cost
[2025-09-08T06:18:33] Noname: No its for me and the emoped life
[2025-09-08T06:20:29] Yamal: Why
[2025-09-08T06:20:52] Noname: Because
[2025-09-08T06:26:47] Yamal: Good option for emoped/e-bike/e-moto
[2025-09-08T06:26:55] Yamal: Powerful VESC
[2025-09-08T06:45:50] Yamal: I see nowüëç, small one , phase oke 180A but current battery 35 ? ‚Ä¶..
[2025-09-08T06:53:14] Yamal: The dream for my g2 ^^
[2025-09-08T06:54:06] Noname: Very small 100/100 better deal
[2025-09-08T10:23:19] cihan: Does anyone know if Kaabo wolf warrior x has stem problems or some other reliability problems when riding?
[2025-09-08T10:25:08] ausias: pretty solid frame i would say
[2025-09-08T10:27:39] Yamal: O never ride, but i want xD
[2025-09-08T10:35:56] cihan: Thanks. I found one at 7500km and for 750 USD. Should I go for it? What do you think? I need a faster scooter and I ride 4 seasons a year so IPX rating matters for me.
[2025-09-08T10:36:54] ausias: quite expensive imo (ive just bought a chassis to resell in 500eur)
[2025-09-08T10:37:18] ausias: but its not bad if It is in good conditions
[2025-09-08T10:39:00] cihan: Seller claims so but I've not seen it. I have concerns about the battery since it has no name cells and I have no chance to check cell voltages without opening deck. I'm afraid about dead cells. It'll cost me a lot if I build another battery for it.
[2025-09-08T10:39:19] ausias: so
[2025-09-08T10:39:34] ausias: its a full wolf for 750 you mean
[2025-09-08T10:39:54] ausias: worth it
[2025-09-08T10:42:00] cihan: Yes, not just the chassis. Full scooter in working order and with only one problem, seller tells front led doesn't work and that's the only problem.
[2025-09-08T10:42:21] ausias: thats is not a problem

[2025-09-08T10:42:51] cihan: I also thought so if not working light is not an indicator of another bigger problem.
[2025-09-08T10:43:00] ausias: put 2 of this and Will be crazy
[2025-09-08T10:43:20] cihan: Yes, I also consider adding a stronger light for night since I also ride often at night too.
[2025-09-08T10:43:40] ausias: this ones are so good
[2025-09-08T10:45:15] cihan: I'll check them if I buy the scooter. Some people mention stem problems about Kaabo scooters on reddit. Stem has dismantled itself while riding as one of them claims. I check screws time to time and already screw with torque wrench. So I think it's not a problems if the tubes don't break while riding.
[2025-09-08T10:51:46] Yamal: 175 kmh on it

[2025-09-08T18:55:41] haku: why is every american yt modder using fardrivers.
[2025-09-08T18:55:47] haku: that needs to change
[2025-09-08T18:56:27] haku: for bigger vehicles it makes sense. but some people use it for small vehicles too
[2025-09-08T18:56:46] 'lekrsu': Lack of brain activity
[2025-09-08T18:57:15] haku: mosfets up the wazoo though.
[2025-09-08T18:57:57] haku: the only turn off for fardrivers for me is the cables harness
[2025-09-08T19:00:41] haku: you guys are very lucky just saying. i couldve been a sabvoton boy if it wasnt for james. prolly admin in the sabvoton groups too

[2025-09-08T19:08:03] 'lekrsu': watching ebikeguy move around the battery during building like it's in a spacer, shoveling it around
[2025-09-08T19:08:14] 'lekrsu': but of course no spacers
[2025-09-08T19:13:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because is cheaper and more reliable
[2025-09-08T19:16:42] haku: thats true
[2025-09-08T19:16:49] haku: cheaper
[2025-09-08T19:18:25] haku: i like watching his builds tbh. jank but not clean though
[2025-09-08T19:19:19] haku: also his son no helmet while on a 50mph bike is scary. good dad but saftey should be priority
[2025-09-08T19:20:45] Yamal: Famous man there make batteries?
[2025-09-08T19:21:10] haku: for me personally i dont care about my safety. but family members should be #1
[2025-09-08T19:21:28] haku: yea. 100mph hardtail mtb

[2025-09-08T20:46:30] Marius: nice nice
[2025-09-08T20:49:58] Matthew: Do we need to use Spintend adc v3 adapter to get the spin dial throttle to work properly for both throttle and regen brake?
[2025-09-08T21:03:28] haku: certified balls to walls. gps draggy gps footage and vesctool
[2025-09-08T21:04:12] Dualtron Achilleus: What is your max @Bradhaku
[2025-09-08T21:04:23] haku: 80mph üò≠
[2025-09-08T21:04:28] Marius: do they use vesc?

[2025-09-08T21:07:15] Marius: here its more common but in g30 chat only pussies and vesc tool can be seen
[2025-09-08T21:07:26] haku: yea feds was waiting for me. they new my spot
[2025-09-08T21:10:41] haku: the thing about wepoor its easier to balls to walls you can tuck so less wind pushing. seated
[2025-09-08T21:11:38] Dualtron Achilleus: Dude big balls
[2025-09-08T21:12:06] haku: nono. kw farmer yams surpassed me. we use to be on the same level
[2025-09-08T22:38:31] AG.racing: Hi everyone, on the Lonnyo motors, do I have to keep exactly the length of each phase from the factory or can I cut one shorter than the other? Because I think that at the factory they put exactly the same length for each phase but depending on the layout inside there is not the same length outside between each phase
[2025-09-08T23:21:01] LiquorHole .: The wepoor is the Easiest balls to the walls Lol
[2025-09-08T23:21:18] LiquorHole .: Your already low, sitting down, Can probably do a motorcycle tuck
[2025-09-08T23:24:35] haku: yep. very stable too
[2025-09-08T23:25:21] LiquorHole .: Also, I don‚Äôt think our frames could fit them 80h motors from rage atleast not without modifying the yokes and shit
[2025-09-08T23:25:24] LiquorHole .: Sad
[2025-09-08T23:36:46] haku: it might
[2025-09-08T23:37:37] ausias: does the 85240 supports 22s?
[2025-09-08T23:40:04] 'lekrsu': 20s
[2025-09-08T23:43:55] ausias: and could i modify It for 22s?
[2025-09-08T23:49:48] Dualtron Achilleus: Mine is HY mofset and worked at 21s
[2025-09-08T23:50:45] sombre_enfant: Sure you can but idk what component beside mos
[2025-09-08T23:52:54] Matthew: SEX!!
[2025-09-08T23:53:24] LiquorHole .: Idk maybe without the rotors, they havent gave an exact measurement of the motor
[2025-09-08T23:53:38] LiquorHole .: And thats assuming our frames are actually 155mm to begin with lol
[2025-09-08T23:54:35] Matthew: I vote this color
[2025-09-08T23:55:36] Matthew: Yamaha blue is another favorite
[2025-09-08T23:55:50] LiquorHole .: Alpina green
[2025-09-08T23:58:19] Matthew: @Bradhaku what is required to use the spintend spin dial throttle?

[2025-09-09T00:06:15] Matthew: For wiring you always want to keep cables all the same. Its same for wiring sound systems in cars or home audio. Also when possible for current carrying lines is to keep cables short as possible.
[2025-09-09T00:10:09] Dualtron Achilleus: i love hotdogs
[2025-09-09T00:10:33] Matthew: Single or double magnets for their rotor?

[2025-09-09T03:31:23] haku: sorry just saw this. the hotdog motors distracted me. you can wire it directly to vesc or nowadays i think they come with a jst directly into the new adc3 adapter

[2025-09-09T10:33:13] AG.racing: Ok
[2025-09-09T10:33:36] AG.racing: from what i read arcs are bad for the internal electronics of the controller
[2025-09-09T10:34:29] Marius: I thought its just the caps charging or something ü§£

[2025-09-09T20:16:07] Matthew: This is what dude is using from spintend
[2025-09-09T20:16:11] Matthew: No worries. Thank you.
[2025-09-09T20:28:07] Marius: why 2 buttons?
[2025-09-09T20:29:52] Matthew: Thats what neither of us know. I told him get it with a power button because that will be nice and thats what came in the mail
[2025-09-09T20:30:21] LiquorHole .: That second one is probably programmable for whatever you assign it too
[2025-09-09T20:30:23] LiquorHole .: Thats my guess
[2025-09-09T20:31:55] Matthew: I see. I was reading and their literature is kinda really vague with some stuff. Was seeing something among the many descriptions is it can possibly be used as cruise control. He was curious if he can do single to dual motor function with that button.
[2025-09-09T20:32:12] LiquorHole .: Probably could
[2025-09-09T20:32:56] Matthew: He is using 2 85150 controllers. Getting everything installed and stuff. Completely new full build
[2025-09-09T20:33:48] LiquorHole .: Idk when ill even be able to start My build üòÇ i was gonna buy all the parts and just start the day Or the month after

[2025-09-09T20:35:34] Matthew: He got hit by a car early this year and has been having reconstructive surgeries and stuff. Hes healed and ready to build. While he was recovering he collected parts. And he knows how it goes always needing random things here and there. He may pop up on vesc help later.
[2025-09-09T20:36:05] Matthew: Hes using dual vsett motors
[2025-09-09T20:36:23] LiquorHole .: Literally sounds like my exact situation, minus the surgery and stuff. Hope he doesn‚Äôt go through that again
[2025-09-09T20:38:19] Matthew: Yeah, hes in NYC so hes likely way more cautious now.
[2025-09-09T20:38:37] LiquorHole .: And hes close, East coast disasters
[2025-09-09T20:38:37] Matthew: I dont know who's at fault**

[2025-09-10T04:27:36] haku: i see. needs to be calibrated if spimtend did not
[2025-09-10T04:28:21] haku: i wire mine using adc2. old version
[2025-09-10T04:28:26] Matthew: Interesting. Yeah, I am clueless. I read it can be used as throttle only but for regen I guess you need the adapter??
[2025-09-10T04:28:34] Matthew: Oh
[2025-09-10T04:28:43] haku: its easy
[2025-09-10T04:29:11] haku: nowadays i think throttle jst comes ready wired for adcv3

[2025-09-10T04:32:19] haku: the left button is my power switch
[2025-09-10T04:48:21] Matthew: Nice. I was seeing i guess there is a button on the side as well or I may be wrong

[2025-09-11T07:20:02] Yamal: .
[2025-09-11T07:21:14] Finn: Do you own them?
[2025-09-11T07:21:15] Yamal: Now that a competitor in France has them, I hope they have a smart display so they can share real power data with us
[2025-09-11T07:21:35] Yamal: X)
[2025-09-11T07:22:45] Yamal: the roll of those x12, that you have to make the Playmobil house yourself, but it's worth it !!!!!!!!!! and how the purple and blue board looks !!!!!!!

[2025-09-11T07:55:00] S1m 0n: Go to the xiaoDash Germany group. There he hangs out with his friends
[2025-09-11T07:56:26] haku: maybe bad design phase cables should be facing up

[2025-09-11T09:06:23] Yamal: The issue is to leave the direction free of slack
[2025-09-11T09:06:43] Marius: Wdym
[2025-09-11T09:07:16] Yamal: that does not oscillate at high speeds
[2025-09-11T09:09:15] Marius: Like speed wobble?

[2025-09-11T11:06:30] Dualtron Achilleus: Vesc profile?
[2025-09-11T11:06:57] Dualtron Achilleus: Its like a remote but with phone xd
[2025-09-11T11:23:37] Finn: Yeah they are more compact then x12
[2025-09-11T11:24:05] Finn: Non pro would be enough anyways
[2025-09-11T11:24:29] Finn: 325$ for non pro, compared to x12 with 300$
[2025-09-11T11:24:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: 6 fet vs 12 fet
[2025-09-11T11:25:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: At 150v MOSFET heat up very much , it heat up more than 3 times than spintend fet
[2025-09-11T11:25:54] Finn: Yeah true
[2025-09-11T11:26:07] Finn: Compact 6fet vesc with 30s support whenüò≠
[2025-09-11T11:26:26] Finn: I guess i need to try and make my own
[2025-09-11T11:29:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Tronic is almost the smallest possible design lol
[2025-09-11T11:30:12] Finn: Those wires are thick and not bendable all as i can see
[2025-09-11T11:30:20] Marius: Whats Problem with x12 other than Detection?
[2025-09-11T11:30:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Hall sensor if not paired correctly is bad for current measuring
[2025-09-11T11:30:51] Finn: It got detection problems?? üò≠üò≠
[2025-09-11T11:31:06] sombre_enfant: Do anybody think 22km is feasable with 24ah 20s
[2025-09-11T11:31:28] Marius: But ig theres really no Alternative
[2025-09-11T11:31:31] Marius: In that size
[2025-09-11T11:31:54] Marius: What??
[2025-09-11T11:32:08] Marius: 22km range? Xd
[2025-09-11T11:32:14] sombre_enfant: Yeah
[2025-09-11T11:32:32] Marius: Depends how u drive
[2025-09-11T11:32:50] sombre_enfant: Idk just to comute to work
[2025-09-11T11:32:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cl350 but the cap is tall
[2025-09-11T11:32:55] Marius: If u drive 100% full throttle no
[2025-09-11T11:33:00] Marius: Anything Else yes
[2025-09-11T11:33:07] Marius: Yeah
[2025-09-11T11:33:12] Marius: Easy
[2025-09-11T11:33:52] sombre_enfant: Not tryna take 1hr tho 35min max
[2025-09-11T11:34:13] sombre_enfant: C500üòÄ
[2025-09-11T11:34:55] Marius: I have 20s 24ah and consume usually 1000wh
[2025-09-11T11:34:59] Marius: In 20km
[2025-09-11T11:35:27] Marius: U can consume more or less
[2025-09-11T11:35:39] Marius: Highly depends on how u ride
[2025-09-11T11:35:49] Marius: Vehicle and driver weight etc
[2025-09-11T11:35:58] Marius: But for commuting its more than fine
[2025-09-11T11:38:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: He need 30s+
[2025-09-11T11:38:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Enough to do 100km on my mopedüò≠
[2025-09-11T11:39:36] Marius: No way for me
[2025-09-11T11:39:50] Marius: Cant get below 20wh/km i think
[2025-09-11T11:40:02] Marius: But never tested
[2025-09-11T11:45:28] Dualtron Achilleus: What is bettrer
[2025-09-11T11:45:36] Dualtron Achilleus: Low kv motor or hight kv
[2025-09-11T11:45:41] Dualtron Achilleus: For low consumption
[2025-09-11T11:45:52] Marius: Low kv
[2025-09-11T11:45:58] Dualtron Achilleus: More voltagr also better for long range no?
[2025-09-11T11:46:38] Marius: Less amps less phase losses
[2025-09-11T11:46:40] Dualtron Achilleus: Why
[2025-09-11T11:48:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's like the bike gear, try to go 20kmh with the last gear and try to go same speed with medium gear
[2025-09-11T11:49:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: But in reality they are all same, only efficiency point changes, high kv more efficiency at high speed, low kv more efficient at low speed
[2025-09-11T11:49:25] Marius: On higher speed more efficient with high kv
[2025-09-11T11:51:00] Dualtron Achilleus: Okay i see tks
[2025-09-11T11:52:03] Dualtron Achilleus: And another question
[2025-09-11T11:52:10] Dualtron Achilleus: Why stark varg is 80hp
[2025-09-11T11:52:18] Dualtron Achilleus: But go only 140km/h
[2025-09-11T11:52:23] Dualtron Achilleus: Very low kv motor?
[2025-09-11T11:52:29] Dualtron Achilleus: Its 100s dude
[2025-09-11T11:53:07] ausias: shipping included?
[2025-09-11T11:53:10] Marius: Maybe limited due to temp
[2025-09-11T11:53:17] Marius: Not 80hp continuous
[2025-09-11T11:53:40] Marius: But idk xd
[2025-09-11T11:54:28] Dualtron Achilleus: Even if peak you can fet lot more lul
[2025-09-11T11:54:52] Dualtron Achilleus: Is only 4P and 12awg so nothing get out i guess
[2025-09-11T11:55:14] Marius: The Motor i mean
[2025-09-11T11:55:30] Marius: I think its the bottleneck on emotos
[2025-09-11T11:55:35] Marius: But just a guess
[2025-09-11T11:56:07] Dualtron Achilleus: Nohhubmotor also are bad for top speed
[2025-09-11T11:56:22] Marius: Yes lol
[2025-09-11T11:56:30] Dualtron Achilleus: Hubmotor less torque but more top speed in general
[2025-09-11T11:56:40] Marius: They both worse than combustion
[2025-09-11T11:56:46] Marius: Because cooling
[2025-09-11T11:57:36] Marius: Otherwise whats stopping u from pushing stupid Power for long time like on Gas bikes
[2025-09-11T11:58:42] Dualtron Achilleus: There is eletrique motorcycle that goes up to 300km/h
[2025-09-11T11:59:36] Dualtron Achilleus: But yeah hard to beat combustion atm
[2025-09-11T11:59:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Electric good only for the torque
[2025-09-11T12:00:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: And no turbo lag xd
[2025-09-11T12:00:13] JPPL: Link for the box? And 1cm aluminium plate under box
[2025-09-11T12:00:16] Marius: I think its just cooling issue what Else would it be
[2025-09-11T12:00:28] Marius: I mean in cars electric is already very close
[2025-09-11T12:00:38] Marius: More space for cooling etc
[2025-09-11T12:00:57] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah on small body hard to have descend cooling maybe
[2025-09-11T12:01:17] JPPL: This are good, never tested build quality perfect, but dual cooling, up and down needed as MOSFETs go both direction
[2025-09-11T12:02:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: That's bad damn... That mean the top side MOSFET will be hotter
[2025-09-11T12:03:12] Dualtron Achilleus: In 10years when batterie will have *10 energy density than today it will be crazy
[2025-09-11T12:03:27] JPPL: If no cooling yes, but case already have 1cm aluminium
[2025-09-11T12:03:46] JPPL: And amazing MOSFETs, but yes need both cooling
[2025-09-11T12:04:03] Marius: Cell technology is crazy
[2025-09-11T12:04:06] JPPL: Therea some pictureas Somewhere
[2025-09-11T12:04:14] Marius: How fast it develops
[2025-09-11T12:04:54] JPPL: the photos are from one of this group

[2025-09-11T12:05:19] Dualtron Achilleus: Yes i read post that now some electrical car have 1000km/range
[2025-09-11T12:05:22] JPPL: Pro version
[2025-09-11T12:05:30] Dualtron Achilleus: But not about 1500kg of cells
[2025-09-11T12:05:50] JPPL: Badass soldering!!
[2025-09-11T12:06:37] JPPL: 24s
[2025-09-11T12:07:10] Finn: Yeah looks absolutely trash
[2025-09-11T12:08:01] Finn: Design looks cool tho
[2025-09-11T12:08:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: One side will touch frame, another side is no touching nothing...
[2025-09-11T12:09:00] JPPL: <photos/photo_25876@11-09-2025_12-09-00.jpg>
[2025-09-11T12:13:33] Finn: In Germany yes
[2025-09-11T12:16:16] ausias: And how much Will It be to Spain, could you check?
[2025-09-11T12:17:13] Marius: Crazy
[2025-09-11T12:17:43] Marius: Maybe with 6ah cells i will make New batt
[2025-09-11T12:17:58] Dualtron Achilleus: Whitch one
[2025-09-11T12:17:58] Marius: 50%+ more range than my current 40pl xdd
[2025-09-11T12:18:08] Marius: Wdym
[2025-09-11T12:18:36] Marius: Im saying when there are 6ah high Power cells
[2025-09-11T12:18:54] Dualtron Achilleus: There is 5,8ah atm
[2025-09-11T12:20:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Actually exist 6500mah lol
[2025-09-11T12:20:49] Marius: I mean for non billionaires
[2025-09-11T12:21:06] Marius: Like 60pl they will surely make
[2025-09-11T12:21:25] Marius: M58t? No Power
[2025-09-11T12:21:36] NetworkDir: Yeah very shitty
[2025-09-11T13:00:57] S1m 0n: Why Aluminium and not Copper ?
[2025-09-11T13:02:34] Marius: What??
[2025-09-11T13:36:46] S1m 0n: Why is aluminum always used for cooling and not copper? Copper has twice the WmK. I know copper is more expensive... I would expect the highest quality materials for more expensive products... except the cooling effect isn't that much better than in theory.
[2025-09-11T13:37:48] Marius: Oh didnt know that
[2025-09-11T13:40:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Weight twice , cost twice , and exposed to the air is easy to be corroded
[2025-09-11T13:41:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: You don't need copper for those type of applications
[2025-09-11T13:43:50] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah slow discharge
[2025-09-11T13:44:09] Dualtron Achilleus: @NewTurtle7815 what scooter you have
[2025-09-11T13:44:16] Marius: G30
[2025-09-11T13:45:25] Dualtron Achilleus: Good
[2025-09-11T14:15:33] Rose: Hey there Gra≈ºyna Gorska, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-11T14:18:44] sombre_enfant: Aight guy i burned the vesc did 20km out of the 22km
[2025-09-11T14:19:32] sombre_enfant: If someone good at repair could help out
[2025-09-11T14:21:58] Marius: What vesc
[2025-09-11T14:22:44] sombre_enfant: 85150
[2025-09-11T14:24:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: What did you burn
[2025-09-11T14:24:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: MOSFET?
[2025-09-11T14:24:18] Marius: How much amps
[2025-09-11T14:24:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: I guess he burned because field weakening, and not changed MOSFET
[2025-09-11T14:29:01] sombre_enfant: Yep
[2025-09-11T14:29:23] sombre_enfant: Wasnt active when it burned i was at 70kph max
[2025-09-11T14:29:27] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: <photos/photo_25877@11-09-2025_14-29-27.jpg>
[2025-09-11T14:30:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Doesn't mate, if you have mtpa or field weakening and you are at 20s it's guaranteed burning
[2025-09-11T14:30:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: At least you burnt it on road, I burnt on freewheel XD
[2025-09-11T14:31:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: People must thank me that I save them so much time and money üòÇ
[2025-09-11T14:32:01] 'lekrsu': Now imagine going 22S on the same hardware like some do
[2025-09-11T14:32:11] 'lekrsu': Already above max rating, at idle
[2025-09-11T14:33:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: I saw they change MOSFET on 22s setup
[2025-09-11T14:33:35] 'lekrsu': I've seen most aren't, then complains it burns
[2025-09-11T14:33:42] sombre_enfant: Wym
[2025-09-11T14:34:01] sombre_enfant: Then what mod should be done ?
[2025-09-11T14:34:04] 'lekrsu': Was MTPA or FWK enabled?
[2025-09-11T14:34:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: I told 100 times here to don't turn on field weakening or mtpa with spintend at 20s
[2025-09-11T14:34:25] sombre_enfant: No mtpa only fw 45A
[2025-09-11T14:34:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: They don't tell you that
[2025-09-11T14:34:44] sombre_enfant: Its because off battery low volt cut im pretty sure
[2025-09-11T14:35:01] 'lekrsu': It's the very high amount of fw at 45A that did it. Combine it with an OCP (or any other protection) and your controller is dead.
[2025-09-11T14:35:29] sombre_enfant: Amy repaired me one two year ago
[2025-09-11T14:35:30] 'lekrsu': You need to have undervoltage protection engage on VESC side before BMS
[2025-09-11T14:37:42] sombre_enfant: Yeah it was set like that
[2025-09-11T14:38:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yeah so it's fw
[2025-09-11T14:46:08] sombre_enfant: Easy to diagnose and repair or i send to amy
[2025-09-11T14:47:15] sombre_enfant: If someone sell 12fet 70mm height 35mm widht whatever the lenght
[2025-09-11T14:47:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mosfes are easy to change
[2025-09-11T14:47:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: How much amps did you set
[2025-09-11T14:48:29] Crazy scoots: So what‚Äôs the max Amps 85150 do?
[2025-09-11T14:48:35] sombre_enfant: 105 front 120 rear
[2025-09-11T14:48:59] sombre_enfant: Overmodulation 1.05
[2025-09-11T14:49:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Rofl
[2025-09-11T14:49:20] sombre_enfant: 175 phase rear 150A front
[2025-09-11T14:49:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Over modulation + fw on 20s spintendüò≠
[2025-09-11T14:49:24] sombre_enfant: Hehe
[2025-09-11T14:49:29] Crazy scoots: I‚Äôm running 160A on rear with 20A fw with 100A battery And front at 150A with 50A battery and 20A fw
[2025-09-11T14:49:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's suicide
[2025-09-11T14:49:40] Crazy scoots: This is with 16s
[2025-09-11T14:50:42] sombre_enfant: Man fuck them vesc
[2025-09-11T14:51:15] Dualtron Achilleus: Dude i runned 330 phase with fwk and mpta at 87v
[2025-09-11T14:51:25] NetworkDir: I used too much and freewheel but not burned mostly luck or bad setup or very high kV motor and fwk ?
[2025-09-11T14:51:26] Dualtron Achilleus: I am the chosen oneü§£
[2025-09-11T14:51:26] sombre_enfant: U cant ride unbothered thats crazy
[2025-09-11T14:52:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: High kv engines fucks more yes but it's also about luck
[2025-09-11T14:52:17] Dualtron Achilleus: I forgot i have HY mosfets
[2025-09-11T14:52:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Explained xd
[2025-09-11T14:52:32] NetworkDir: Hmm on 16x4 seems fine but still need careful yes
[2025-09-11T14:52:32] sombre_enfant: Gimme link of part and tool i need to do the repair then bo more fw
[2025-09-11T14:52:46] Dualtron Achilleus: Just need to adk to spinted to have them free
[2025-09-11T14:52:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: 20s?
[2025-09-11T14:53:08] NetworkDir: Yes
[2025-09-11T14:53:21] NetworkDir: i used for like 2 years
[2025-09-11T14:53:33] NetworkDir: 20-30A fwk
[2025-09-11T14:53:40] NetworkDir: 160A phase 60A batt
[2025-09-11T14:53:47] NetworkDir: 6.05 version
[2025-09-11T14:54:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Buy better mosfet
[2025-09-11T14:54:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Order hsbl009n10t
[2025-09-11T14:57:06] sombre_enfant: Orderable for regular like me
[2025-09-11T14:57:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, lcsc.com
[2025-09-11T14:57:46] sombre_enfant: Hotplate and paste ? Or hot air enough...F i think my gun is dead on my station
[2025-09-11T14:57:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Otherwise I have some here in Italy
[2025-09-11T14:58:04] NetworkDir: Gun maybe needed
[2025-09-11T14:58:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Hotplate is better , but both are needed
[2025-09-11T15:00:59] sombre_enfant: Okay nothing else should be cooked beside fet??

[2025-09-11T18:37:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway they don't loose nothing if they share the file
[2025-09-11T18:38:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: They are the manufacturer and nobody will produce over them

[2025-09-11T19:50:35] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Tomorrow I will measure it with a caliper from the arm to the right tire and izauierds
[2025-09-11T19:52:03] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: But I can't connect my battery, it doesn't have a case and the person who has it, I've been waiting for 7 days, a bit informal hahaha

[2025-09-11T20:36:54] Marius: üò≠üò≠
[2025-09-11T20:44:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you got skill to reverse engineering the PCB , making the firmware is just a 30 minutes game ...
[2025-09-11T20:44:34] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: He is the most informal person I have ever met
[2025-09-11T20:44:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Only pinout should be matched, even people like me could do it haha
[2025-09-11T20:45:04] Marius: what??
[2025-09-11T20:45:25] Yamal: Nice
[2025-09-11T20:46:04] Yamal: I still don't know what it is or how it is mounted, but it looks nice xD
[2025-09-11T20:46:07] Yamal: ^^‚Äô

[2025-09-11T21:32:11] Finn: Would be 10‚Ç¨+ so 220‚Ç¨
[2025-09-11T21:37:01] Nobrrr: Sadly the vescs are potted
[2025-09-11T21:37:09] Finn: Would do 210‚Ç¨ inluding shipping
[2025-09-11T21:38:18] Yamal: Whut
[2025-09-11T21:38:28] haku: probably difficult to swap to tomkas fets?
[2025-09-11T21:38:37] Yamal: you moved permanently
[2025-09-11T21:46:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2025-09-11T21:46:15] haku: me?
[2025-09-11T21:46:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: What do you mean ?
[2025-09-11T21:50:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: I use it at 200A phase amps, 21S battery, regen, and field weakening, and no burn, I think people should first start to look at their assemblies
[2025-09-11T21:51:18] Marius: wdym assemblies?
[2025-09-11T21:53:26] haku: now 6 fet needs to be mounted this way. patapims engineering never stops.
[2025-09-11T21:53:39] Noname: Its more weather proof and cant have solder balls flying around
[2025-09-11T21:53:45] haku: this all needs to run by october
[2025-09-11T21:54:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: The whole electric assembly of the scooter
[2025-09-11T21:55:22] Marius: what mistake as example would make controller burn ?
[2025-09-11T21:55:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: I see too many people burning things, but when I get a chance to look inside, it's a lot from some small mistakes
[2025-09-11T21:58:55] james: To avoid burning
[2025-09-11T22:00:26] james: When really close to hardware limits you need to have stable observer, very little overshoot etc
[2025-09-11T22:04:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: Also, loose bullets, wires not perfectly connected, little bit scratched and touching frame, ...
[2025-09-11T22:04:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: So many things can happen bad, everything must be done well
[2025-09-11T22:04:51] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: the arms
[2025-09-11T22:07:19] james: Absolutely. Installation issues are common fault
[2025-09-11T22:07:46] AG.racing: Hi everyone, what vesc setting should I use so that the lonnyo 11" temperature probe reading is correct?
[2025-09-11T22:08:36] james: It depends what sensor your have. Ask the seller what they put in
[2025-09-11T22:09:21] AG.racing: Ntc 3950b 10k
[2025-09-11T22:09:25] AG.racing: .
[2025-09-11T22:10:30] AG.racing: vesc tool shows me 59¬∞ while the engine is at rest at 25¬∞~
[2025-09-11T22:11:05] james: And you set this in vesc tool also?
[2025-09-11T22:11:38] AG.racing: <photos/photo_25888@11-09-2025_22-11-38.jpg>
[2025-09-11T22:12:14] james: What version vesc fw are you using?
[2025-09-11T22:12:57] james: This looks like ancient firmware
[2025-09-11T22:14:00] AG.racing: the application is vesc tool 6.05 but the firmware is 5.03
[2025-09-11T22:14:38] AG.racing: because I have to do the programming of my controllers with the seller later so I prefer not to change the version before having seen with him
[2025-09-11T22:15:38] AG.racing: I just wanted to know why it was showing 59¬∞ when it is 25¬∞
[2025-09-11T22:15:50] AG.racing: I will see with the seller tomorrow
[2025-09-11T22:16:24] james: It's probably not the problem, but I'd first update the vescs. 5.03 is very very old by now
[2025-09-11T22:17:04] 'lekrsu': 3+ years outdated
[2025-09-11T22:17:09] AG.racing: Yes, I know, I'll check with the seller so as not to make a mistake. I have to do the complete programming via video with him.
[2025-09-11T22:17:40] haku: you know whats weather proof? steel box üòú
[2025-09-11T22:19:44] haku: guys i was riding to wendies last night and a guy on a gas dirtbike approached me. he small talk me and ask me where i usually ride. that dude is definetly a fed
[2025-09-11T22:20:09] james: Nice try fbi
[2025-09-11T22:20:16] haku: i will not disclose the location of the trap house
[2025-09-11T22:22:02] haku: he asked me how fast peak g30 go. i said legal speed limit
[2025-09-11T22:22:11] haku: you cant fool me agent
[2025-09-11T22:23:05] james: Coppers been interviewing me the last few days after my neighbor got shot to death
[2025-09-11T22:23:17] james: I don't dare to go out on scooter this week, coppers will be all over me
[2025-09-11T22:27:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, it's Rage Mechanics arms
[2025-09-11T22:28:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: 59¬∞ for a NTC10K, typical wiring issue, or no sensor at all
[2025-09-11T22:29:44] AG.racing: normally I have sensors in the motors and I will soon have everything wired so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2025-09-11T22:30:53] james: You can measure resistance manually on your sensor wire and gnd, it should say 10kOhm at around 25C
[2025-09-11T22:31:26] Marius: scratching frame?
[2025-09-11T22:31:39] Marius: like exposed wires touching the frame?
[2025-09-11T22:38:23] AG.racing: and yes it is a wiring error @SibClimb
[2025-09-11T22:38:47] AG.racing: The 6 pin connector I bought does not have the same color in the same place as the original Lonnyo connectors.
[2025-09-11T22:42:15] haku: dam. crazy
[2025-09-11T23:09:48] james: <photos/photo_25889@11-09-2025_23-09-48.jpg>
[2025-09-11T23:17:57] Marius: damn
[2025-09-11T23:18:03] Marius: they drive brainrot cars in sweden too
[2025-09-11T23:20:18] james: Coppers are not spared from brain rot. Their brains have degraded severely
[2025-09-11T23:20:42] Marius: good for us
[2025-09-11T23:24:48] haku: taped up. crime scene. very common in here
[2025-09-11T23:57:32] haku: what the heck. https://youtube.com/shorts/lBcb-GBjIXc?si=g3y76N2Swvm3GxQV
[2025-09-12T00:06:35] Noname: Thought you lives in the mountains amd made hot cocoa for a living
[2025-09-12T00:08:00] Noname: They most definitely are not
[2025-09-12T00:08:54] haku: better than printed battery box.
[2025-09-12T00:09:29] 'lekrsu': Rather sealed box than potted PCB
[2025-09-12T00:09:44] haku: even if i can peak engineer one i dont trust to hold weight on a heavy pack
[2025-09-12T00:09:47] james: Sorry to disappoint
[2025-09-12T00:09:59] 'lekrsu': But if it never fails it doesn't matter, hopefully Vedder ESC is something else ^^
[2025-09-12T00:10:27] james: That's like asking for ppl to never mess up wiring üòÅ
[2025-09-12T00:10:44] haku: vesc pope benjamins design himself
[2025-09-12T00:10:48] james: Ppl more often than not mess up wiring, shorting stuff üòÅ
[2025-09-12T00:10:54] 'lekrsu': Been a while since I shorted something
[2025-09-12T00:11:09] 'lekrsu': Flawless wiring streak
[2025-09-12T00:11:16] james: If vesc labs manged to make the escs idiot proof. I'm impressed
[2025-09-12T00:11:28] haku: yes. that wiring harness will be mindboggling for a true brainrots
[2025-09-12T00:11:32] 'lekrsu': Just don't sell to idiots, the price tag helps
[2025-09-12T00:11:42] james: Actually very true üòÅ
[2025-09-12T00:12:15] james: The higher the price, the less stupid things ppl do to the electronics I've concluded
[2025-09-12T00:12:29] haku: lmao. very true
[2025-09-12T00:13:08] JPPL: Vesc pronto with photo on vesclabs

[2025-09-12T00:44:03] LiquorHole .: Anyone know of a Place that Can Like fabricate custom Parts for scooters?
[2025-09-12T00:51:09] JPPL: Maybe ONLY on entrance? For waterproff
[2025-09-12T00:51:38] JPPL: But not Over phase maybe to fast acesso on solder points
[2025-09-12T00:59:24] Yamal: Very nice for g2 xD
[2025-09-12T00:59:42] Yamal: Now everything is for g2 ! No other way
[2025-09-12T01:02:53] Yamal: I'm sorry about what happened in your neighborhood. Be safe! You can step out of the way for a while until things calm down. Or go to the countryside with your G2, to some little house in the mountains, and hike with a Molicel and eat good food
[2025-09-12T01:03:58] Yamal: I like it, it looks more aggressive heh
[2025-09-12T01:04:17] Yamal: tr√®s agressif

[2025-09-12T01:12:43] LiquorHole .: Swing arms, Necks,yokes
[2025-09-12T01:12:56] LiquorHole .: Wanna Get bigger motors
[2025-09-12T01:13:07] haku: no idea. thats all custom home engineering stuff
[2025-09-12T01:13:22] LiquorHole .: ‚òπÔ∏è
[2025-09-12T01:13:30] Yamal: @skrt15 where are you .?
[2025-09-12T01:13:35] haku: you need longer bolts to fit motors in rear i think
[2025-09-12T01:13:38] Yamal: you haven't fallen in love?
[2025-09-12T01:13:52] haku: front will be very expensive
[2025-09-12T01:14:02] haku: milled to the gills
[2025-09-12T01:14:17] Yamal: beware of the she-wolves
[2025-09-12T01:14:35] LiquorHole .: The rear is kinda easy i was probably just going to do spacers or whatever, But the front is a different story a VERY different story üò≠
[2025-09-12T01:15:02] haku: yes. you dont need hotdogs in front anyways
[2025-09-12T01:15:45] LiquorHole .: I don‚Äôt need hotdogs at all üò≠ but Having them would be a pretty big flex
[2025-09-12T01:15:55] haku: true haha
[2025-09-12T01:15:57] William the Second Educk: Someone got a good brand vesc?
[2025-09-12T01:16:07] William the Second Educk: Shipping to Netherlands
[2025-09-12T01:16:11] haku: dual hotdogs is flex indeed
[2025-09-12T01:16:18] LiquorHole .: Only want to comfortably fit them 80h motors
[2025-09-12T01:16:38] LiquorHole .: Or 90h depending on The Kv
[2025-09-12T01:17:35] Yamal: single magnet don't make the same mistake I did, we don't want to see any more stator tornadoes
[2025-09-12T01:17:53] haku: never happened to you though
[2025-09-12T01:18:28] Yamal: but there would be a possibility
[2025-09-12T01:18:32] LiquorHole .: I like to chop that up as a 1 and a million Thing that Could happen
[2025-09-12T01:19:03] haku: i doubt it
[2025-09-12T01:19:24] Yamal: I mean , must know your magnet is 80mm not 40+40
[2025-09-12T01:19:29] Yamal: Paolo know
[2025-09-12T01:20:02] haku: im just defending my 30+30 $80 motors okay
[2025-09-12T01:20:16] Noname: Local hooligans
[2025-09-12T01:20:30] haku: phases will cook first before that even happens
[2025-09-12T01:21:04] Yamal: Well, don't forget to add salt and pepper
[2025-09-12T01:22:03] haku: im seeing alot of those tuitto kuugo bikes

[2025-09-12T06:30:34] haku: put these motors on wepoor and sell
[2025-09-12T06:30:42] haku: or not

[2025-09-12T19:24:06] james: They usually do that to me also
[2025-09-12T19:24:18] james: They sometimes wrap my packages in fed tape
[2025-09-12T19:24:29] james: Intimidation tactics
[2025-09-12T19:24:40] haku: indeed.
[2025-09-12T19:25:30] james: All my packages from Roger except one have all been held extensively by customs lol

[2025-09-12T19:28:41] james: Probably this why it comes without problems

[2025-09-12T20:46:35] james: Will we be seeing peak cad engeneering today?
[2025-09-12T20:47:06] haku: maybe. need to design mount for 6fet.
[2025-09-12T20:47:26] haku: angles are different. peak trigonometry
[2025-09-12T20:48:20] haku: i forgot 100/100 doesnt have 12v rail. so ill use the 85/150
[2025-09-12T20:48:38] 'lekrsu': Yeah, kinda sucks ngl
[2025-09-12T20:48:44] 'lekrsu': Limits you
[2025-09-12T20:49:08] 'lekrsu': Won't buy more 100100
[2025-09-12T20:49:21] haku: i would if i dont need lights
[2025-09-12T20:49:34] haku: small form factor is nice
[2025-09-12T20:49:49] Marius: not worth it
[2025-09-12T20:49:53] Marius: almost same price as 85150
[2025-09-12T20:49:58] Marius: and 85150 is almost same price as 85250
[2025-09-12T20:50:00] Marius: so allways get 85250
[2025-09-12T20:50:12] haku: compact design is good man. if your limited on space
[2025-09-12T20:50:47] haku: even the smaller 12 fet is apealing to me
[2025-09-12T20:50:58] haku: now im building very compact shit
[2025-09-12T20:51:36] Marius: after your boys peak g30 is done
[2025-09-12T20:51:38] Marius: u need to fix wepoor
[2025-09-12T20:51:41] haku: does that have a 12v rail. the 85/240?
[2025-09-12T20:52:10] haku: easy fix like i said. but police proof not
[2025-09-12T20:52:34] haku: but we outlaws yea!
[2025-09-12T20:52:41] Marius: exactly
[2025-09-12T20:52:43] Marius: balls to walls
[2025-09-12T20:54:01] haku: sometimes i think if i mount powerstage directly to heatsink and skip the case that would save more space
[2025-09-12T20:54:08] haku: but i cannot weather proof
[2025-09-12T20:55:12] haku: alot of engineering shit going on right now boys
[2025-09-12T20:55:31] Marius: more fed activity means ur doing something right
[2025-09-12T20:56:12] haku: so much engineering my workouts sometimes are 2nd priority
[2025-09-12T20:57:04] haku: back to watching videos on intellectual stuff
[2025-09-12T20:58:01] haku: code and shit. patapim techologies will go public soon
[2025-09-12T20:58:05] haku: like palantir
[2025-09-12T20:58:47] haku: remember buy shares. okay. it will moon

[2025-09-12T21:02:16] haku: someone sponsor me a go pro. 12+ is necessarry but beggars cant be chosers
[2025-09-12T21:03:14] haku: or i can film on a legit camera and gimbal. high production videos. not worthy of brainrot and shill videos
[2025-09-12T21:03:18] james: Weak mans curls üò¢
[2025-09-12T21:03:43] haku: curls dont need to be heavy.
[2025-09-12T21:03:50] haku: form over weight
[2025-09-12T21:03:55] Marius: how much?
[2025-09-12T21:04:08] haku: if you hitting the muscle your doing it right
[2025-09-12T21:04:14] james: 20kg+whatever handle weighs, probably 2kg or so

[2025-09-12T21:04:53] Marius: thats pretty good i think
[2025-09-12T21:05:00] james: Not lbs
[2025-09-12T21:05:03] haku: thats six pack territory
[2025-09-12T21:05:06] Unknown: swap the 2 digits
[2025-09-12T21:05:10] Unknown: <sticker>
[2025-09-12T21:05:10] 'lekrsu': normal unit
[2025-09-12T21:05:15] 'lekrsu': not unbased unit
[2025-09-12T21:05:22] haku: oh thats right
[2025-09-12T21:05:28] james: It's not üòÅ
[2025-09-12T21:05:34] james: If I was tall it would be
[2025-09-12T21:05:44] Marius: the only question remains can u curl your scooter with one arm
[2025-09-12T21:05:52] Unknown: how tall is the sigma himself
[2025-09-12T21:05:54] Marius: only peak engineers like haku can do it
[2025-09-12T21:06:01] james: My navee gt3 I can
[2025-09-12T21:06:07] james: It weighs about 20kg
[2025-09-12T21:06:12] Marius: what about the g2 üòÅ
[2025-09-12T21:06:17] james: Never
[2025-09-12T21:06:20] haku: legend has it james and vedder workout together. rows all day. look at vedders back its huge
[2025-09-12T21:06:35] Marius: youll only get stronger from here, no worries
[2025-09-12T21:07:02] james: I'm getting weaker. Shedding body fat atm
[2025-09-12T21:07:17] Unknown: and getting shredded
[2025-09-12T21:07:19] Unknown: very good
[2025-09-12T21:07:23] Marius: i lost 10kg but same strength still
[2025-09-12T21:07:25] Marius: somehow
[2025-09-12T21:07:34] haku: thats good. its hard to maintain stregnth while on a cut
[2025-09-12T21:07:57] Marius: i think a lot of it was just fat tbh, must be the reason
[2025-09-12T21:08:12] Marius: looking back at it
[2025-09-12T21:08:40] james: Weight is pretty proportional to strength. Both muscle and fat
[2025-09-12T21:08:41] haku: doing it natty is difficult boys
[2025-09-12T21:08:57] Marius: now at 60 i think my bf is decent, would need to add muscle but too lazy to track calories and shit
[2025-09-12T21:08:57] james: Mass moves mass
[2025-09-12T21:09:18] Marius: yes but i have pretty much the same strength now even tho 10kg lighter
[2025-09-12T21:10:02] haku: strongest men are have bellies. i wonder why
[2025-09-12T21:10:04] james: I think it's only possible to maintain strength well when one is either on the juice, or pretty weak to begin with
[2025-09-12T21:10:06] Marius: i feel better too now. i think im not made to be fat to any degree
[2025-09-12T21:10:14] james: Nobody is
[2025-09-12T21:10:19] james: Keep the fat away
[2025-09-12T21:10:27] Marius: i mean theres fat and theres fat fat
[2025-09-12T21:10:41] james: Keep both away üòÅ
[2025-09-12T21:10:49] Marius: yeah
[2025-09-12T21:10:52] haku: gadam dude. that shot through me
[2025-09-12T21:11:37] haku: american fat is normal okay
[2025-09-12T21:11:39] Marius: how much u bench james?
[2025-09-12T21:12:13] james: Idk, I've never tried to max out. I usually bench my body weight or so 10-15reps for 3 sets
[2025-09-12T21:12:19] james: But I prefer dumbell press
[2025-09-12T21:12:43] james: There I do 30kg for each arm. We don't have any bigger dumbells üò¢
[2025-09-12T21:12:58] Marius: well at least its an empty gym
[2025-09-12T21:13:01] Marius: that goes a long way
[2025-09-12T21:13:17] james: Heaviest we got. Haku would be disappointed with this gym
[2025-09-12T21:13:59] haku: form more important if you want definition
[2025-09-12T21:14:35] james: Yeah. Ppl tell me the eccentric and stretch are most important part of a rep
[2025-09-12T21:14:51] james: Idk if accurate or not
[2025-09-12T21:15:26] haku: alot of angles too with excercises.
[2025-09-12T21:15:48] james: Usually the ppl giving advice are heavy juicers and less intellectualists
[2025-09-12T21:16:17] 'lekrsu': Go for the "coffee until shakes" diet
[2025-09-12T21:16:30] 'lekrsu': you'll forget to eat until the afternoon
[2025-09-12T21:16:39] james: I've not had coffee for 1 month. Feels good üòÅ
[2025-09-12T21:16:48] 'lekrsu': Cad broke my back days ago, healed now üòÅ
[2025-09-12T21:16:59] 'lekrsu': don't hyper focus
[2025-09-12T21:17:02] james: Caffeine I find a horrible substance. Heavily addictive for little benefit
[2025-09-12T21:17:05] 'lekrsu': Impossible
[2025-09-12T21:17:26] 'lekrsu': Haven't not drunken 0.5l minimum for years
[2025-09-12T21:17:56] james: üòÅ
[2025-09-12T21:17:56] 'lekrsu': Can't function without
[2025-09-12T21:18:10] james: This is the biggest issue
[2025-09-12T21:18:17] james: Life collapses without it
[2025-09-12T21:18:25] 'lekrsu': But the feeling is nice
[2025-09-12T21:18:35] 'lekrsu': except two days ago the filter failed
[2025-09-12T21:18:40] 'lekrsu': had to filter twice, pain
[2025-09-12T21:18:49] Marius: ive never had coffee
[2025-09-12T21:18:54] Marius: <sticker>
[2025-09-12T21:19:33] james: I much prefer the intellectual pills Haku gets
[2025-09-12T21:22:59] 'lekrsu': Haven't tried
[2025-09-12T21:23:16] 'lekrsu': Unbased
[2025-09-12T21:50:57] Noname: <animation>

[2025-09-12T22:34:38] Marius: assemble it in there
[2025-09-12T22:34:59] Finn: <photos/photo_25914@12-09-2025_22-34-59.jpg>
[2025-09-12T22:35:03] Finn: So much wasted space

[2025-09-12T22:37:45] Noname: Thats not how 8p fits though
[2025-09-12T22:40:34] Marius: g3
[2025-09-12T22:43:40] Nobrrr: Wait 3shul cc1000 can do 40S? No regen
[2025-09-12T22:48:18] Finn: How else would it fit in a layout this wide
[2025-09-12T22:48:30] Finn: Holy shit is this easy to service
[2025-09-12T22:50:29] Noname: Put another row in. I think you have it spread out a bit
[2025-09-12T22:53:05] Finn: I need 30s3p(15s6p) this is what fits 30s4p(15s8p) doesnt fit
[2025-09-12T23:02:13] haku: that is too close. patapim technologies.
[2025-09-12T23:02:28] haku: bad design

[2025-09-12T23:39:18] Nobrrr: But it‚Äôs more unclean if you have a hole Looks and feels better is welded and sanded down flat again
[2025-09-12T23:39:30] Finn: You will not notice it
[2025-09-12T23:39:48] Nobrrr: As long as you have those silicon mat it doesn‚Äôt matter though yeah
[2025-09-12T23:40:02] Nobrrr: It would only be for cleanness
[2025-09-12T23:40:14] Finn: Noone will see it from the outsideüòÅ
[2025-09-12T23:40:34] Finn: Next step is spacer design and hopefully getting the scematics of new 30s
[2025-09-12T23:40:59] Nobrrr: Yeah but a hole like this would make me so angry
[2025-09-12T23:41:03] Nobrrr: Idk why
[2025-09-12T23:41:37] Finn: There are 3 now
[2025-09-12T23:41:44] Finn: <photos/photo_25921@12-09-2025_23-41-44.jpg>
[2025-09-12T23:42:44] Nobrrr: With stock motor it‚Äôs gonna be so clean I love it
[2025-09-12T23:44:49] Finn: The spacer doesnt even need to be that high
[2025-09-12T23:45:03] Finn: But im still looking for bms
[2025-09-12T23:45:16] Noname: Use jb weld. Welding that would suck prob make a hole unless you hold a backer of steel against it
[2025-09-12T23:45:39] Finn: Never used that
[2025-09-12T23:46:16] Noname: Its just 2 part putty that hardens
[2025-09-12T23:46:44] Finn: Ah but it doesnt make sense when theres a holeüòÇ
[2025-09-12T23:49:36] haku: boys 10 screws just to clamp this box might be too much. but we learn today.
[2025-09-12T23:49:37] haku: <photos/photo_25923@12-09-2025_23-49-37.jpg>
[2025-09-13T00:03:11] Noname: Is this the cf?

[2025-09-13T00:04:06] haku: whatever that is
[2025-09-13T00:05:29] haku: ill test print though
[2025-09-13T00:06:07] Noname: Annealing is heating it after.
[2025-09-13T00:06:12] haku: oh
[2025-09-13T00:06:24] haku: you need that machine aparently

[2025-09-13T00:08:01] Noname: For drying? Just set bed temp and let it sit in bambu
[2025-09-13T00:08:03] haku: im not a complete dumbass. i do research

[2025-09-13T00:45:15] haku: alot yes
[2025-09-13T00:45:17] Noname: It'll snap and get clogged shits like dry spaghetti
[2025-09-13T00:45:37] haku: nice. ill look for one
[2025-09-13T00:45:55] haku: it will look better like that
[2025-09-13T00:46:06] Noname: Uh search panel mount qs8
[2025-09-13T01:19:33] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: depends on the cell model

[2025-09-13T02:44:38] Yamal: I need work some hours ..
[2025-09-13T03:16:18] Yamal: XD
[2025-09-13T03:16:56] haku: woah lazer
[2025-09-13T03:25:03] Noname: Damn wood cutting is slow af
[2025-09-13T03:27:49] haku: it just got real boys. this is the competition. https://youtube.com/shorts/t2An-OI_1-A?si=6xvwUzEKhVddDqpQ
[2025-09-13T03:29:27] haku: noname get to welding
[2025-09-13T03:33:58] JPPL: Makerbase üòÇ
[2025-09-13T03:34:15] JPPL: Jetfleet also 30s

[2025-09-13T03:37:56] JPPL: And funginniers Thor400 32s
[2025-09-13T03:59:51] haku: design flaw once more. these heatsink gonna scratch my beautiful feet. i can feel it.
[2025-09-13T04:00:04] haku: would thick alumum be enough?
[2025-09-13T04:01:11] haku: how i chamfer the edges on this heatsink
[2025-09-13T04:27:52] james: Bakerbase have 30s version? üòÅ
[2025-09-13T04:28:37] james: I know their 100300hp use 150V components, except for ina241, so it cannot do more than 24s üòÖ
[2025-09-13T04:31:49] Noname: Grinder File Rub against concrete Sander Yell at it
[2025-09-13T04:43:22] haku: maybe this too thick anyways but the fins will really cool it
[2025-09-13T04:44:55] haku: the dream would be flat aluminum with a lazer etching. "better than yours! better than yours!"
[2025-09-13T04:45:32] haku: but whatever will work for now
[2025-09-13T04:46:45] haku: why delete you fuck
[2025-09-13T04:48:01] haku: i saw it too late
[2025-09-13T04:51:36] Noname: Acid etch you ass
[2025-09-13T04:51:47] Noname: But not the same really so I delete
[2025-09-13T04:59:41] haku: uncurse me you fuck.
[2025-09-13T05:06:14] Yamal: Very rare
[2025-09-13T05:07:25] Yamal: those tires are very tough
[2025-09-13T05:08:34] haku: everytime i ride flat tire seems like
[2025-09-13T05:08:39] Yamal: Extreme torque destroys your tires, I would consider activating traction control
[2025-09-13T05:08:40] haku: once a week
[2025-09-13T05:08:42] Yamal: XD
[2025-09-13T05:09:12] Yamal: Haku industry out of control
[2025-09-13T05:11:01] Yamal: It's happened to me with these tires, and they are so hard that you can return home with a flat tire.
[2025-09-13T05:14:50] haku: this is just temporary. i have china slick. just 1 arrived. i wanted to milk how long i can use this
[2025-09-13T05:15:50] Yamal: you never disappointüî•

[2025-09-13T05:32:15] haku: im a "elderly person"
[2025-09-13T05:33:24] Yamal: you need a good woman to take care of you
[2025-09-13T05:34:07] haku: no need yams. they will compromise the operation
[2025-09-13T05:36:18] Yamal: You need Leti

[2025-09-13T05:37:39] Yamal: Really ?
[2025-09-13T05:37:44] Yamal: I never listen
[2025-09-13T05:37:46] Yamal: Why
[2025-09-13T05:37:48] haku: yes i think
[2025-09-13T05:37:51] haku: no idea
[2025-09-13T05:38:00] haku: i stoped watching after 4
[2025-09-13T05:41:15] haku: Noname you know what would be cool for peak g30? reinforced torque arms. i wish i had access to a lazer that can cut steel..
[2025-09-13T05:42:03] haku: i wish i had friends that cared for my safety
[2025-09-13T05:42:11] haku: but i have non
[2025-09-13T05:42:44] Yamal: Never die
[2025-09-13T05:43:01] haku: too many close calls yams.
[2025-09-13T05:48:24] Noname: I wish I had a boss that wasn't a cheap asshole that gets mad when you use company stuff. Forcing you to put your ass on the line to make things dissappear out the back door for people on the internet
[2025-09-13T05:49:01] haku: true. i respect that.
[2025-09-13T05:49:53] haku: unvelievable these internet people.
[2025-09-13T05:50:04] haku: no shame
[2025-09-13T06:08:07] haku: btw. the clamps for the steel box will clear.
[2025-09-13T06:08:20] haku: lots of room
[2025-09-13T07:55:36] Rose: Hey there Mr, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-13T08:59:45] Finn: Sadly they wont tell me the price. But i got measurements
[2025-09-13T09:06:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: You know what that mean when price don't get revealed haha
[2025-09-13T09:07:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway if its only 6 mos don't buy it , it's not worth really
[2025-09-13T09:08:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: But as I see caps are standing , so probably it's 12 fet
[2025-09-13T12:15:36] Finn: They took 85240 and modified it
[2025-09-13T12:17:26] Finn: Make a channel
[2025-09-13T12:17:59] Finn: Like a U Above the Heatsink so air can only enter on the front and leave at the back
[2025-09-13T12:28:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cheap x12 in progress üòÅüòÅ

[2025-09-13T12:46:03] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: yes only in the rear
[2025-09-13T12:47:59] Marius: did u drive it already?
[2025-09-13T12:48:01] Marius: how is it
[2025-09-13T12:56:09] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Yesterday I had some problems with the detection. Now everything seems to be OK. When I can, I will do the configuration, but later I will look at it to see if everything is OK.
[2025-09-13T12:57:28] Marius: ok nice
[2025-09-13T12:57:38] Marius: drive it and report back to us üî•

[2025-09-13T13:22:04] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: This was like this in 0.01, I don't remember it being done wrong on my part.
[2025-09-13T13:23:15] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Did you assemble the board from scratch?
[2025-09-13T13:24:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2025-09-13T13:24:36] Marius: üò±üò±
[2025-09-13T13:28:16] JPPL: 0.01 it is for Faster response always
[2025-09-13T13:28:38] JPPL: Is what i use
[2025-09-13T13:31:54] Dualtron Achilleus: Are we agree that a few survolting a motor just make its run faster
[2025-09-13T14:42:49] Oreo huzky: Nooo my child

[2025-09-13T15:02:24] Oreo huzky: Found the new kukirin bike https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdgRJWmV/
[2025-09-13T15:25:47] james: It's 12mos (I'm fairly sure)
[2025-09-13T15:27:36] james: But less amps than 85240
[2025-09-13T15:29:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normal with 150v
[2025-09-13T15:34:29] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: It's impossible to accelerate fully, the front wheel lifts off the ground like a motorcycle. This 100h engine has an impressive torque. I didn't expect it to be like this.
[2025-09-13T15:37:07] james: Yeah

[2025-09-13T16:21:21] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I'm making some supports. When I have them, I'll convert them to 3D. I'll send you 2 for you, Yamal.
[2025-09-13T16:34:55] LiquorHole .: You gonna get fz shocks?
[2025-09-13T16:35:15] LiquorHole .: They‚Äôre better then KKE apparently
[2025-09-13T16:46:35] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I have tried two models, each one broke the oil or split the rod. In the end, the KKE ones are the best for me. I haven't broken them, but if we press the spring too hard, the shock absorber breaks because there is no margin.

[2025-09-13T17:26:34] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: We'll know soon, I'm just doing some small tests now.
[2025-09-13T17:28:01] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: If I deactivate the TC, I have to be very careful or I would be driving with the front wheel in the air all the time, it's dangerous ü§£ü§£ü§£

[2025-09-13T18:14:19] Finn: Any plan to do higher voltages?
[2025-09-13T18:14:50] Finn: Looked into SIC Fets, good for high power usecases
[2025-09-13T18:18:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but it won't be in compact size
[2025-09-13T18:20:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Have something here butü§ê
[2025-09-13T18:20:58] Finn: Damnn what are the specs?
[2025-09-13T18:21:05] Finn: 2500A?
[2025-09-13T18:22:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Have to see if it's worth making it, I don't know how 30s market is
[2025-09-13T18:38:57] haku: where are the 18fet boards
[2025-09-13T18:42:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not good
[2025-09-13T18:42:40] Finn: Stark varg replacement when
[2025-09-13T18:44:48] haku: i might get flat alu
[2025-09-13T18:46:19] haku: 20mm fins will make it too wide
[2025-09-13T18:49:33] Yamal: You look comfortable and relaxed! Take advantage and do some national tourism! What are the laws there for e-scooters?
[2025-09-13T18:52:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: That they can't go on roadüòÇ
[2025-09-13T18:53:17] Yamal: What
[2025-09-13T18:53:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Unfortunately
[2025-09-13T18:53:31] Yamal: Only bike line
[2025-09-13T18:53:40] Yamal: Sad man
[2025-09-13T18:53:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Illegal too
[2025-09-13T18:53:51] Yamal: Wouh
[2025-09-13T18:53:58] Yamal: I understand but okee

[2025-09-13T23:37:17] JPPL: Duty
[2025-09-13T23:37:26] JPPL: 95 is limiting

[2025-09-13T23:49:42] Dualtron Achilleus: setting 98 99 is safe?
[2025-09-14T00:04:34] JPPL: Normally own firmware have its limits, 95 is ok, i use 98 and no problems
[2025-09-14T00:15:53] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Duty I didn't touch it, I left it on default but the 100h pushes like a Yamaha R1 FW. If we have something activated, we want to know what the maximum is. James is helping me. Without it, it wouldn't be possible.
[2025-09-14T00:17:29] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: It's almost impossible not to activate it, otherwise the front wheel would last me 4 days üòò

[2025-09-14T00:40:47] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I can only say that we have set the FW to 100% ü§£ü§£to compensate for the speed of the front engine. Tomorrow I will do the tests.

[2025-09-14T12:45:48] AG.racing: because I would prefer to be in a recent version to have lots of options that I don't have in 5.03

[2025-09-14T17:30:10] JPPL: G300 at 22s is normally not recommended, 21s max. Ut is ok proper configurated, and failure sensitive. I remember makerx support tould Till 600a, but at 20s. Also if you want to reach even Higher speed you can lower battery input, like less than 150 is enough to keep pushing, i dont know about 100h motor if it needs more power to keep that "crazy" speed, back in time i reached 151 with 110/120a each ctrl

[2025-09-14T22:17:36] haku: good for you!
[2025-09-14T23:08:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I'm not even updating my VESC because of that at this point. But this time I'm sure it's some kind of VESC issue, probably nothing I can fix from the script side specifically besides removing functionality until it works.
[2025-09-14T23:09:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Also it seems to work for most people because besides Finn I haven't had any reports since the stable came out. The issue that was during beta for most people seemed to have disappeared because it was different than the one Finn has now.
[2025-09-14T23:10:46] Finn: Hm im on 6.06 stableüòû

[2025-09-15T07:30:56] Jason: what's in the ring?
[2025-09-15T07:43:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ferrite
[2025-09-15T07:44:08] Jason: and hall sensor?
[2025-09-15T07:44:17] Jason: is the ferrite cut or solid
[2025-09-15T07:44:22] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-09-15T07:44:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Hall sensor is on the pcb
[2025-09-15T07:44:47] Jason: mm
[2025-09-15T07:44:55] Jason: I wonder if I can recreate that
[2025-09-15T07:45:00] Jason: less pcb space
[2025-09-15T07:46:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Make the board working first, matching hall sensors is even harder XD
[2025-09-15T07:46:43] Jason: yeah gonna redo the gate drivers
[2025-09-15T07:46:47] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-09-15T07:46:57] Jason: 0 idea why it doesnt work, it gets all necessary signals

[2025-09-15T07:47:16] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-09-15T07:47:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Probably the gate driving circuit is not done correctly
[2025-09-15T07:48:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because even if you use the cheapest driver in the world it would spin anyway haha
[2025-09-15T08:28:29] Jason: yeah 100%

[2025-09-16T18:55:58] ausias: thx for info
[2025-09-16T18:57:28] ausias: Cheap good and reliable under 500‚Ç¨ the pair of vesc what would be the recomendation
[2025-09-16T18:57:44] ausias: for 22s*
[2025-09-16T20:16:58] AG.racing: Hi everyone, what settings are you using here? I'm on 21s, what are your settings?
[2025-09-16T20:19:01] AG.racing: <photos/photo_25996@16-09-2025_20-19-01.jpg>
[2025-09-16T20:23:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: It should cut before BMS
[2025-09-16T20:26:08] AG.racing: yes it must cut before the bms but with a setting at cutoff 63v in 21s it makes 3.0v per cell so when I accelerate there is a significant voltage drop it is not likely to cut when accelerating?
[2025-09-16T20:27:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Theres two cutoff, one is power decreasing and another is the real cut off
[2025-09-16T20:27:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway yes, if you hit the real cut off , it will cut the power, of course it won't block the engine haha
[2025-09-16T20:28:20] AG.racing: This means that if I have 68v left for example and I have a drop of 5v when accelerating it will cut out even though I still have 68v...
[2025-09-16T20:29:10] AG.racing: I can lower the settings much lower so as not to cut out and I always monitor my voltage so no risk right?
[2025-09-16T20:29:36] AG.racing: You just have to be very careful that the BMS doesn't cut out beforehand, is that it?
[2025-09-16T20:29:38] AG.racing: .
[2025-09-16T20:33:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2025-09-16T20:34:06] AG.racing: If the BMS cuts out before the controller burns out, is that it?
[2025-09-16T20:34:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: There's high probability, not going to happen always
[2025-09-16T20:46:02] AG.racing: Ok
[2025-09-16T20:46:30] AG.racing: if the controller cuts off because of low battery so the cutoff end also burns?

[2025-09-16T20:49:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: The vesc cutoff is not power cut off, it just cut the output to the motor but not the input, so is everything okay
[2025-09-16T20:50:46] AG.racing: ok so if it cuts because of the cut off end no risk for the components only for me if I fall is that it? üòÖ
[2025-09-16T20:53:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: No haha the vesc cut off is like you releasing the throttle, nothing else

[2025-09-17T02:39:56] LiquorHole .: Since our frames Cant fit that 80h motor sadly so just gotta deal with the 70h
[2025-09-17T02:40:09] LiquorHole .: I wonder if they could make the 75h Fit though
[2025-09-17T02:40:14] LiquorHole .: Probably same case
[2025-09-17T02:40:17] haku: perfectly fine. 70h more than enough
[2025-09-17T02:40:50] LiquorHole .: Yeah just wont have that torque though, atleast in theory
[2025-09-17T02:41:02] haku: but people here will call 70h vintage tech unfortunately
[2025-09-17T02:41:17] haku: they are on 80h and hotdogs
[2025-09-17T02:41:28] LiquorHole .: Soon theyll be on Footlongs
[2025-09-17T02:42:46] haku: but 70h on a tiny peak g30 size frame will be nasty imo.
[2025-09-17T02:43:02] LiquorHole .: That shit might Do a backflip
[2025-09-17T02:43:09] LiquorHole .: Isnt the total weight like 50lbs?

[2025-09-17T02:54:06] LiquorHole .: Tuning looks easy
[2025-09-17T02:54:51] haku: nono. thats the hardest imo. building it is easy. but tuning is a different ballgame

[2025-09-17T16:37:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ah yes , the current reading is fucked, that explains the bad motor detection and unmatched stats
[2025-09-17T16:37:15] Marius: ah ok
[2025-09-17T16:37:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: They use hall for current reading which is more complicated, and is bad set by factory

[2025-09-17T16:57:50] LiquorHole .: It would just be Better to make a new frame anyway cause i wanna use 80h motors, Can just make a Massive Controller compartment on the stem, Like the Hooga daytona that thing looks pretty big
[2025-09-17T17:12:53] Noname: I would definitely inspect your package üì¶ before shipping too

[2025-09-17T22:25:06] LiquorHole .: Also Could you make the 75h motor the same size as the 70h OR relatively similar? Or it would only be the same size as the 80h

[2025-09-17T22:38:41] Matthew: Is that compartment completely full?
[2025-09-17T22:44:17] haku: yea 10s4p 18650 pack
[2025-09-17T22:45:01] haku: 10" 45h. no idea the winding hopefully not 33x2
[2025-09-17T23:56:31] Jason: shit

[2025-09-18T03:45:27] William Tremblay: Hi guys, i'm running a two spintend alu lite setup for my two motors and i'm almost done just at the last part I believe where I need to calibrate everything, my only issue now (while following the spintend tutorials with adc adapter v3) is that i'm using a step down converter to power the 12v for the adc, and my problem is that this stepdown converter is always powered by battery so I think if I plug it into the adc adapter there is no way of turning off the controllers (meaning there is also no way of turning it on all at the same time to do the throttle calibration) am i correct in assuming there is no way to turn them off? and if so is there a way to make it work? has anyone worked with a similar setup before and has any insights? Do I even need the 12v? Thank you guys for any answers.
[2025-09-18T04:02:49] JPPL: 12v is needed for lights horns etc. , adc module Will power up ONLY via Controller. So even with 12v plugin it Will Turn off via 5v main cable
[2025-09-18T04:03:48] JPPL: It Will BE on ONLY when connected main Controller is on
[2025-09-18T04:08:04] William Tremblay: Thank you so much for the help! but it looks like mine is always on? I will send a video in 30 minutes when i'm done with my chores. Maybe im not explaining it correctly
[2025-09-18T04:30:17] William Tremblay: Here's the video.
[2025-09-18T04:30:36] William Tremblay: We can see that both motor controllers are not plugged into the battery but it still lights up when i give the adc the 12v power
[2025-09-18T06:55:59] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati relay a message to weped from haku industries. tell them to stick to standing scooters. peak g30 power to weight will destroy these wepeds. https://youtu.be/QOdDW-IBOp0?si=lliaraV7w9rB-G18
[2025-09-18T06:56:26] haku: also tell em i did it first
[2025-09-18T06:57:29] haku: project praying mantis. stay tuned boys
[2025-09-18T06:59:55] Yamal: If there's one thing your e-bikes have to envy the Peak G30, it's the electronics.
[2025-09-18T07:00:01] Yamal: Vesc electr√≥nica
[2025-09-18T07:00:04] Yamal: XD
[2025-09-18T07:00:23] haku: tell these china copycats. please yamal
[2025-09-18T07:00:48] Yamal: Otherwise, their designs are cool.
[2025-09-18T07:01:10] Yamal: don't come to me with nonsense
[2025-09-18T07:01:15] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-09-18T07:01:18] haku: this was my idea. small compact seated on scooter motors. thiers is still big
[2025-09-18T07:01:39] haku: yamal. i never nonsense
[2025-09-18T07:03:00] haku: my designs are superior. bullet proof up to 9mm
[2025-09-18T07:03:05] Yamal: It's the same as if I found a baby stroller in the trash and put a motor, a battery and a controller in it and called it Himalaya Peak
[2025-09-18T07:03:09] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-09-18T07:03:53] haku: yamal what are you talking about. peak g30 is superior. everyone knows this. weped is a copycat china clone
[2025-09-18T07:04:13] haku: this is my idea since day 1 yamal
[2025-09-18T07:04:59] haku: they cannot compete with haku industries. they will lose
[2025-09-18T07:06:52] haku: only 60v yamal. how about 30s yamal. its possible now
[2025-09-18T07:22:38] Yamal: Do it, it would be something very original
[2025-09-18T07:25:33] haku: yamal as an innovator i will. i shall gather up resources for top secret project praying mantis

[2025-09-18T09:13:15] Rose: Hey there K, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-18T11:17:09] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Do you know what winding and stator the Dualtron Victor motors have?
[2025-09-18T11:37:11] Dualtron Achilleus: It‚Äôs so small but ikd
[2025-09-18T11:37:25] Dualtron Achilleus: Even with stock controlor motor get hot
[2025-09-18T12:47:05] JPPL: When you order that board? Plugs different
[2025-09-18T12:47:56] JPPL: Thats not spintend board?
[2025-09-18T13:27:27] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: üöÄ
[2025-09-18T13:30:16] William Tremblay: Yes that's the spintend Adc Adapter v3
[2025-09-18T13:30:45] William Tremblay: what do you mean plug different?
[2025-09-18T13:36:16] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: A friend asked me but I'm the same as you, they are very small and get very hot. I think the magnet is 45 but the winding is not ü§£ü§£
[2025-09-18T15:11:44] William Tremblay: am I supposed to wire similar to this? Cause I wired the step down directly to the battery
[2025-09-18T15:11:51] William Tremblay: <photos/photo_26018@18-09-2025_15-11-51.jpg>
[2025-09-18T17:23:31] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Fron
[2025-09-18T17:24:21] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Rear
[2025-09-18T17:56:03] Mattia: Its fine
[2025-09-18T17:56:47] Mattia: I always connected it directly to the battery
[2025-09-18T17:57:05] Mattia: But it always stays on
[2025-09-18T17:57:40] Mattia: If you want to disconnect the power at stepdown, you need to connect an on/off switch between the battery and the stepdow
[2025-09-18T17:58:47] Mattia: Free wheel 220kmh?
[2025-09-18T18:03:24] William Tremblay: Okay, but is it normal that when I only plug in the 12v, everything lights up. And when you say always stays on that means the whole circuit would always be on? That I assume would drain the battery during the day when I go to work no?
[2025-09-18T18:39:57] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/m8yBsf6tcX8?si=xAq1tgWCXK3VMwbC

[2025-09-18T19:48:05] JPPL: Not limited erpm?
[2025-09-18T20:22:33] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I don't think so, I'm not sure
[2025-09-18T20:40:43] JPPL: FW was off or on on air test?
[2025-09-18T20:41:31] Marius: guys is there cable tie for inside the motor?
[2025-09-18T20:41:33] Marius: or will it melt?
[2025-09-18T20:41:39] Marius: or is there a special cable tie that u can get
[2025-09-18T20:48:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is standard
[2025-09-18T20:48:41] Marius: wdym?
[2025-09-18T20:49:03] Marius: u can use standard tie??
[2025-09-18T20:51:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: They put standard tie
[2025-09-18T20:52:44] Marius: hmm i thought because plastic it will melt?
[2025-09-18T20:53:00] Marius: if that works why tf did i bother with this rope and shit
[2025-09-18T21:07:46] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: It wasn't a test in the air, it was because the wheel lifted off the ground.

[2025-09-18T21:55:27] Marius: james can u confirm this?
[2025-09-18T21:55:29] Marius: cable tie in motor?
[2025-09-18T21:55:31] Marius: good idea?
[2025-09-18T21:55:47] Manuel: Remove reflector
[2025-09-18T21:56:07] james: If you use decent quality nylon cable tie. I believe it will be fine
[2025-09-18T21:56:30] haku: hey hey! this is my house! not here
[2025-09-18T21:56:53] Nobrrr: I wouldn‚Äôt Cotton is safer
[2025-09-18T21:56:58] ausias: i cant because DGT jajajajaj
[2025-09-18T21:57:02] Manuel: I need to switch.
[2025-09-18T21:57:07] Manuel: This is our house now.
[2025-09-18T21:57:15] Manuel: Take it or leave it, am i clear?
[2025-09-18T21:57:16] Marius: i suppose i will try with the rope first
[2025-09-18T21:57:27] haku: no. sorry dude. only room for 1
[2025-09-18T21:57:33] Marius: but put it around the entire stator middle thingy
[2025-09-18T21:57:45] Marius: so u can really have the windings tightly pulled inside
[2025-09-18T21:58:24] james: Do both then
[2025-09-18T21:59:16] Marius: idk which kind of cable ties these are tbh
[2025-09-18T21:59:25] haku: i am only allowed here because of balls to walls over 120kmh cerification. where is yours
[2025-09-18T21:59:29] Marius: but ig ill use both sure
[2025-09-18T22:00:44] Manuel: What did you say, my boy?
[2025-09-18T22:00:56] Manuel: 47kmph is faster

[2025-09-18T22:25:29] haku: yep
[2025-09-18T22:26:12] haku: lot of weak points on laotie style frames
[2025-09-18T22:28:48] Matthew: I thought this style was one of the most robust in scooter world
[2025-09-18T22:29:06] Matthew: The fork type i mean
[2025-09-18T22:29:24] Matthew: Which is broke in half üò≠
[2025-09-18T22:30:16] haku: its a hit and miss
[2025-09-18T22:31:03] haku: and ive seen alot more misses that gets posted
[2025-09-18T22:31:20] haku: mine never had any problems.
[2025-09-18T22:32:14] haku: hey is chromoly steel easy to get welded
[2025-09-18T22:32:22] haku: <photos/photo_26027@18-09-2025_22-32-22.jpg>

[2025-09-18T22:40:00] Manuel: Im an inventor
[2025-09-18T22:40:12] Manuel: Without me yall wouldnt know brainrot.
[2025-09-18T22:40:45] Manuel: Whats are good fets for 85159
[2025-09-18T22:40:48] Manuel: 85150
[2025-09-18T22:40:49] Manuel: Cheap
[2025-09-18T22:41:07] haku: like i said. there is intellectual rots and there is brain rots
[2025-09-18T22:41:26] haku: big difference
[2025-09-18T22:41:52] Mattia: Anyone sells engines similar to leonnyo 70/75h?
[2025-09-18T22:45:42] Matthew: Yeah, for an experienced tig welder that's a combo welder or pipe welder. Outdoors/indoors structural that's load bearing stick and mig is fine... but say for a roll cage or motorcycle/car chassis tig all the way.
[2025-09-18T22:46:25] haku: here is an example of intelectual rots.
[2025-09-18T22:46:25] haku: <photos/photo_26029@18-09-2025_22-46-25.jpg>
[2025-09-18T22:46:36] haku: and herea an example of brainrots
[2025-09-18T22:46:38] Matthew: With that being said, the perfect filler rod to use is controversial
[2025-09-18T22:46:42] haku: <sticker>
[2025-09-18T22:47:32] haku: i see. why is chromoly used in bmx bikes. is it durability?
[2025-09-18T22:47:48] Matthew: Strength to weight
[2025-09-18T22:47:54] haku: gotcha
[2025-09-18T22:48:37] haku: i know nothing of metals. doing research
[2025-09-18T22:48:52] Matthew: Mild steel for vaguely same strength as cromoly has to be thicker or/also larger diameter. Nhra has specs
[2025-09-18T22:49:40] Matthew: I know a few guys that know metallurgy better than me. They're welding inspectors.
[2025-09-18T22:49:55] Matthew: I have always wanted to take metallurgy courses
[2025-09-18T22:50:28] haku: bmx bikes handle alot of stress on skateparks. i trust that metal
[2025-09-18T22:50:43] haku: whatever it is they use
[2025-09-18T22:51:31] Matthew: Thats what that mountain bike i have is made of. Scott basically says if you somehow bend the frame they replace free, lifetime
[2025-09-18T22:51:51] haku: true same with mtb
[2025-09-18T22:52:42] haku: bmx always just gives me that daym factor. you feel me. maybe hood mentality
[2025-09-18T22:53:16] haku: or nostalgia
[2025-09-18T22:53:29] Matthew: Yeah, saved countless lives in vehicle wrecks. I've even read Honda built cars with roll cage and get sandwiched between 2 suv and only reason they lived is because of a full cage
[2025-09-18T22:53:57] Matthew: I feel you ü§ò
[2025-09-18T22:53:58] haku: rollcage necessary if balls to walls car
[2025-09-18T22:54:44] haku: recaro and 5pt seatbelt no need. but cage yes
[2025-09-18T22:55:01] Matthew: Scca or similar, their roll cage specs are insanely strict. They expect cars to run into you and you running into a wall
[2025-09-18T22:56:16] Matthew: Daily drive use normal seat belt, parking at the track and swapping tires Friday night harness
[2025-09-18T22:56:22] Matthew: Ideally
[2025-09-18T22:56:59] haku: yes ofcourse. but 5pt seatbelt and super tight seats for daily is a pain
[2025-09-18T22:57:01] Matthew: A very nice racing seat meant for "touring" would be dreamy
[2025-09-18T22:57:59] Matthew: Older type r, evo... isn't BMW m series equipped with recaro?

[2025-09-19T02:45:09] LiquorHole .: I found a simple solution
[2025-09-19T02:45:14] LiquorHole .: The lazy way out
[2025-09-19T02:45:31] LiquorHole .: Just have the factory that made my scooter Just custom make me a frame üòè
[2025-09-19T02:45:38] haku: its a rabbit hole. no way out

[2025-09-19T02:46:02] haku: yea thats possible. ballin but possible
[2025-09-19T02:46:27] LiquorHole .: Worse case scenario it will cost the same as the regular frame with fast shipping but downside is i have to wait 30 days
[2025-09-19T02:46:30] LiquorHole .: Or longer
[2025-09-19T02:46:42] LiquorHole .: But that saves me so much time and effort
[2025-09-19T02:46:44] haku: 30 days is fast
[2025-09-19T02:46:52] LiquorHole .: 10 days is faster

[2025-09-19T09:53:51] 'lekrsu': which is convenient
[2025-09-19T10:31:31] Yamal: Custom wolf engines
[2025-09-19T10:31:36] Yamal: Or just stock
[2025-09-19T10:41:44] Unknown: idk and its also just on the side of where the phases are so it cant be for holding the windings right?
[2025-09-19T10:42:37] Marius: no idea

[2025-09-19T23:50:26] Lukas: Hey, I have a ‚Äûproblem‚Äú with my Ninebot G2 Vesc Build. So my scooter is really slow until like 25-30kmh anyone knows how to fix that?

[2025-09-19T23:51:22] haku: build a peak g30 ill provide files. dont be a puss
[2025-09-19T23:55:54] haku: i already did research and development on these frames. all the angles measurements. just print and mount. or weld
[2025-09-19T23:58:36] ausias: no idea
[2025-09-19T23:58:54] ausias: the one that gave me the store guy
[2025-09-19T23:59:10] ausias: i said, very strong like Haku

[2025-09-20T00:23:35] LiquorHole .: Cant even do the sketch i want
[2025-09-20T01:15:29] haku: designing and getting precise welded adapters on this be a difficult task.
[2025-09-20T01:22:30] ausias: It was painted poorly by the previous owner, he gave it a few coats of automotive paint over the original paint, he only sanded it a little so it would adhere well, when I removed layers of paint it seemed as thick as vinyl
[2025-09-20T01:45:26] haku: 65 wide rims is nescessary if i will mount a lonnyo on these frames

[2025-09-20T05:18:36] LiquorHole .: Is it a noticeable amount bigger then spintend controllers?
[2025-09-20T05:23:24] Giuseppe Ferra: Does anyone sell a spinted in Germany?
[2025-09-20T05:23:47] Giuseppe Ferra: Or Italy?

[2025-09-20T10:36:23] Yamal: @SibClimb You have to offer your new creation to this type of people who know what quality/power and elegance are... :),, every time I see the yellow Alien-type scooter they sent him... we want to see real vehicles xD
[2025-09-20T10:36:37] Yamal: I mean the 140 kmh scooter
[2025-09-20T10:38:27] Yamal: And I'm sorry to say that even though I know everyone makes a living however they can and such, it's a bit sad the channel where the 173km/h scooter came to light, too many tests on Chinese scooters, it gets boring and tedious, but that's just my opinion
[2025-09-20T10:41:52] Dualtron Achilleus: Thailandez gym time boys
[2025-09-20T10:42:16] Yamal: Enjoy man !
[2025-09-20T10:43:39] Yamal: Thai food is incredibly good, especially for those who like spicy food and fresh flavors.
[2025-09-20T10:53:32] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah very spicy
[2025-09-20T10:53:43] Dualtron Achilleus: Out eat for 3‚Ç¨ its insame

[2025-09-20T11:30:55] Dualtron Achilleus: I think is sponsored so he had to rewiews all chinese scooter
[2025-09-20T11:32:22] Dualtron Achilleus: You cant based a youtube channel on high end scooter, two hard to post weekly
[2025-09-20T11:33:15] Dualtron Achilleus: But you right watching reviews of chinese every time isnt interesting
[2025-09-20T11:48:42] Yamal: There are some youtubers who usually use big e-scooters and call them "hyper" which I don't give a damn what they call them nowadays, but they really still don't know what's going on around here, xD
[2025-09-20T11:50:25] Yamal: People who are used to doing speed tests and other races with other e-scooters, we are in the future in that regard, and of course it's better not to talk about circuits with e-scooters because we know perfectly well where the cradle really is.

[2025-09-20T17:50:56] LiquorHole .: which is that the 85240/250v2?

[2025-09-21T00:43:32] Eren: Do u know the problem
[2025-09-21T00:43:54] Eren: Maybe undervoltage
[2025-09-21T00:44:01] Eren: Low battery or smth
[2025-09-21T00:44:11] LiquorHole .: 3shul>spintend? Or the mosfets are still better on spinted
[2025-09-21T00:44:29] 'lekrsu': So worth it
[2025-09-21T00:45:06] Eren: Nice but do u know the problem ?
[2025-09-21T00:47:36] 'lekrsu': Open it all up regardless
[2025-09-21T00:50:42] Eren: I am tryna see
[2025-09-21T02:07:19] LiquorHole .: ^
[2025-09-21T04:09:52] Dualtron Achilleus: 3shull more powerfull and relliable
[2025-09-21T04:10:02] Dualtron Achilleus: But spinted half the price
[2025-09-21T04:14:35] LiquorHole .: Noted, Buying some 3shuls üòÇ
[2025-09-21T05:57:24] Dualtron Achilleus: 496km/h road legal car from BYD,1200v 2200kwüò≥
[2025-09-21T05:58:14] LiquorHole .: It sounds loud üëÅÔ∏è
[2025-09-21T05:58:15] Dualtron Achilleus: Why i am stuck at 88v volt dudeü•πüò≠
[2025-09-21T05:59:06] Dualtron Achilleus: Full electrick
[2025-09-21T06:08:02] Matthew: Crazy
[2025-09-21T06:08:26] Matthew: I figured Bugatti couldn't be beat üòÆ
[2025-09-21T06:09:21] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah crazy new world record
[2025-09-21T06:22:02] LiquorHole .: Honestly just some slight modifications and the chiron probably would be faster
[2025-09-21T06:22:14] LiquorHole .: Doubt theyd do that now though since theyre moving on from the chiron
[2025-09-21T06:22:39] LiquorHole .: Koenigsegg Absolute never did the top speed run yet so it wont last Super long
[2025-09-21T06:40:52] Yamal: the beast is coming!
[2025-09-21T06:46:49] LiquorHole .: Also I just have no idea what my cells can actually do, keep getting different answers for the same question
[2025-09-21T06:47:23] LiquorHole .: Ima just Get the money for a new battery then push the stock battery see where it‚Äôs limits are
[2025-09-21T06:47:37] LiquorHole .: Cause this is pretty ridiculous
[2025-09-21T06:49:41] Yamal: 3A Per cell ?
[2025-09-21T06:49:58] LiquorHole .: 500a per cell
[2025-09-21T06:50:14] LiquorHole .: Apparently
[2025-09-21T06:50:29] LiquorHole .: Or whatever, got told it was 300a per cell last time
[2025-09-21T06:51:18] Yamal: but I don't understand what values you're referring to
[2025-09-21T06:51:40] LiquorHole .: Wdym
[2025-09-21T06:51:57] Yamal: Name of cell ?
[2025-09-21T06:52:09] LiquorHole .: CATL
[2025-09-21T06:52:16] LiquorHole .: Prismatic cell
[2025-09-21T06:52:22] haku: temp sensor okay. these pouches baloon when pushed
[2025-09-21T06:53:00] LiquorHole .: Not pouch if it was i wouldnt even be asking how much discharge it can do id just go straight to 360 and be in the 30kw club
[2025-09-21T06:53:18] LiquorHole .: Is them rectangle cells
[2025-09-21T06:53:25] haku: if you open it itsba bunch of pouches compressed into 20s
[2025-09-21T06:53:32] LiquorHole .: I keep deleting the photo every time i need to show it
[2025-09-21T06:54:49] LiquorHole .: Its not, theirs no 100ah Pouch cell and if it was my pack wouldnt be 20s it be more cause it would be using lp4 pouch cells. All I WANNA do though is see if it can just do 30kw or not, even for like 3 seconds üòÇ
[2025-09-21T06:55:32] LiquorHole .: So once i start the build I‚Äôll just do my own testing because asking wont ever get me a 1 solid answer
[2025-09-21T06:56:21] LiquorHole .: Only after i Get the money for a new battery cause i dont wanna wait 2-3 months to get the money order it and wait for it to arrive and shit and id be out of a scooter for a while again, done with that
[2025-09-21T06:57:33] LiquorHole .: Since i went from getting all my parts from spintend to going with my original plan and just Buying everything on Rage, motors controllers brakes all of that
[2025-09-21T06:58:31] haku: very cool man. cant wait! progress photos. we need more american builders thats into scoots
[2025-09-21T06:58:57] haku: i identify more as a scooter guy than bike guy.
[2025-09-21T07:00:11] LiquorHole .: Im just chasing the Adrenaline üòÇ I‚Äôve always been into cars but other stuff got my interest in the meanwhile
[2025-09-21T07:00:35] haku: because i know for a fact if i get into bigger bikes the fardriver demons will wisper
[2025-09-21T07:00:55] haku: micro builds. best use for vesc imo
[2025-09-21T07:01:35] LiquorHole .: Or üëÄ put a Qs motor on the wepoor make it into a dragster
[2025-09-21T07:01:42] LiquorHole .: Go balls deep
[2025-09-21T07:01:47] haku: lol
[2025-09-21T07:01:58] haku: wepoor on hold atm.

[2025-09-21T07:02:43] LiquorHole .: Always said that those frames were super modifiable
[2025-09-21T07:03:07] haku: it is. very good frames. heavy but built really good.
[2025-09-21T07:04:09] haku: its prolly a good cruiser frame. for "long" rides
[2025-09-21T07:04:31] haku: im not talking interstate like Noname but enough for my city
[2025-09-21T07:04:55] LiquorHole .: Probably comfy enough, It takes me HOURS to get to 50% of my battery and the only reason i can go so far is cause im not thinking of how uncomfortable i am
[2025-09-21T07:05:12] LiquorHole .: Plus i dont know where im at Outside my own city so I just stick to it
[2025-09-21T07:05:54] haku: im not of a badluck believer but 3 blown vesc and a ticket on the highway means something
[2025-09-21T07:06:05] Noname: I like to run away on the weekends
[2025-09-21T07:06:19] LiquorHole .: Getting a ticket on a scooter for speeding is My goal
[2025-09-21T07:06:24] LiquorHole .: Not a good goal but a Goal
[2025-09-21T07:06:26] LiquorHole .: üòÇ
[2025-09-21T07:06:43] LiquorHole .: Only would do that if im with someone who can keep up
[2025-09-21T07:06:57] Noname: You know you made it when a cop gives you a certificate
[2025-09-21T07:06:57] LiquorHole .: Never will go on the Highway/parkway/turnpike by myself
[2025-09-21T07:07:30] LiquorHole .: Gotta find them Sport bike guys or Built ebike guys they can keep up üòÇ
[2025-09-21T07:07:34] haku: cops are cool. it was a ranger that got me
[2025-09-21T07:07:56] haku: bored assholes
[2025-09-21T07:07:57] Noname: If your friends ask if you want to take the faster route home say no
[2025-09-21T07:10:08] LiquorHole .: Every route is the faster route if your fast enough
[2025-09-21T07:10:11] LiquorHole .: Words of wisdom
[2025-09-21T07:13:35] Noname: When you end up on a highway at night in the city you'll rethink this
[2025-09-21T07:13:41] LiquorHole .: When your breaking the law ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù none of them is cool until they are
[2025-09-21T07:14:07] LiquorHole .: Whenever that happens, definitely wont be on no scooter though üëÅÔ∏è
[2025-09-21T07:14:26] LiquorHole .: Most likely would be my future car or Bike
[2025-09-21T07:16:21] Noname: You should try. Definitely wonder wtf an I doing with my life when you do
[2025-09-21T07:21:04] LiquorHole .: Maybe if im with someone who can keep up

[2025-09-21T07:39:59] Noname: Like those vespa cars they just add tires
[2025-09-21T07:42:26] Noname: <photos/photo_26054@21-09-2025_07-42-26.jpg>
[2025-09-21T07:53:16] LiquorHole .: A dually scooter

[2025-09-21T08:05:27] Noname: <photos/photo_26055@21-09-2025_08-05-27.jpg>
[2025-09-21T08:05:43] Noname: Try Google instead of waking me up at 2am
[2025-09-21T08:08:11] haku: oh snap my bad
[2025-09-21T10:31:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: Good luck and remember : BE PATIENT
[2025-09-21T11:17:53] Marius: crazy
[2025-09-21T11:29:12] sombre_enfant: New tech dropped
[2025-09-21T11:42:38] Dualtron Achilleus: Buy and try custom widing
[2025-09-21T12:00:51] Neo: This doesnt work? Or does it?
[2025-09-21T12:02:05] Dualtron Achilleus: Dude this guys is smart thats what i wanted to do but didnt know to
[2025-09-21T12:02:10] Dualtron Achilleus: To set up vesc easy
[2025-09-21T12:02:44] Neo: I think the lack of air drag can cause some false feedback
[2025-09-21T12:05:31] 'lekrsu': Seems to work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8zzNZV8AlU
[2025-09-21T12:05:51] Neo: Gotta admit, I never checked how hot my stove actually gets
[2025-09-21T12:06:15] 'lekrsu': Put your hand on it
[2025-09-21T12:06:16] Neo: Gotta test it out
[2025-09-21T12:06:29] Neo: Smells like chicken
[2025-09-21T12:07:53] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah in any caze i guess it isnt simulating real acceleration
[2025-09-21T12:08:30] Neo: I think it has some drag and I think you can add resistance, but it propably becomes useless above running speeds
[2025-09-21T12:09:45] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah if resistance to low
[2025-09-21T12:16:43] Neo: Barely enough, need stronger stove üòÇ
[2025-09-21T12:39:38] Eren: Is it bc of low battery ?
[2025-09-21T12:39:55] Eren: <video_file>
[2025-09-21T12:40:48] Eren: Sometimes it acc√©l√©r√¢tes but stops when i stop the other scooter

[2025-09-21T15:37:03] Marius: what was ur topspeed with 100h?
[2025-09-21T15:45:49] Nobrrr: @SibClimb Do you have experience with overmodulation on 22x3 motors? Which values are recommended? And what are you all using in Foc Advanced? I have v0v7 interpolation, all sensor combined, bemf decoupling, Ortega original
[2025-09-21T15:58:10] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: 150 app Vesc
[2025-09-21T15:58:24] Marius: u should do gps test üî•

[2025-09-21T15:59:18] Marius: 150 soon
[2025-09-21T16:10:19] JPPL: Its good
[2025-09-21T16:10:33] JPPL: Start with 1.05 and check
[2025-09-21T16:11:04] JPPL: But no much advantages seems, so you reach your top speed frequently?
[2025-09-21T16:13:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Over modulation is not like field weakening, you have benefit at all speed
[2025-09-21T16:14:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: He's using 100a field weakening , not much range
[2025-09-21T16:14:51] Marius: ofc
[2025-09-21T16:16:02] Nobrrr: On both motors or on one ?
[2025-09-21T16:17:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: 100 each
[2025-09-21T16:17:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think

[2025-09-21T17:01:46] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: it's weird
[2025-09-21T17:01:58] Dualtron Achilleus: Does fwk make loose torque?
[2025-09-21T17:19:43] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I have to be very careful when accelerating otherwise the front wheel always lifts up as if it were a motorcycle.
[2025-09-21T17:21:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes if you consider same amps
[2025-09-21T17:30:14] Dualtron Achilleus: Welcome to big magnet club bro

[2025-09-21T20:25:38] Marius: or is it front?
[2025-09-21T20:29:25] Reekoz: What motor are you running in the front? I‚Äôm thinking about using a 90H in the rear and an 80H up front for a balance of speed and torque, what‚Äôs your opinion?
[2025-09-21T20:29:53] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: It becomes dangerous due to the torque we have on the rear engine at 120 km/h the front wheel tries to lift off the ground
[2025-09-21T20:31:03] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I have 70h front 100h rear speed if you want more than 150 km/h
[2025-09-21T20:41:05] Reekoz: But isn‚Äôt the 100h has too much torque? Is it controllable at high speeds? I mean 90H is already >80Nm which is ludicrously strong. A build with dual 80H and 38kv at 3000rpm could get you to >150kmh, and still has enough torque am I right?
[2025-09-21T20:45:10] JPPL: Torque/speed at limit, can mantain
[2025-09-21T20:46:56] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: If 100h has a lot of torque, what is better than 80 and 90?
[2025-09-21T20:51:48] Reekoz: There isn‚Äôt a single ‚Äúbetter‚Äù, 80H/90H/100H are tradeoffs. For a speed-focused scooter that still feels composed, most riders end up with 90H rear + 80H front or even dual 80H. A 100H rear can work, but it‚Äôs heavier and not automatically ‚Äúbetter‚Äù unless you‚Äôre chasing brutal launches or long, hot climbs.
[2025-09-21T20:52:20] Reekoz: With a 38 KV winding, the torque constant is ~0.25 Nm/A. So at 300 A phase you‚Äôre already around 75‚Äì80 Nm per motor on an 80H. That‚Äôs plenty.
[2025-09-21T21:09:12] Marius: sounds fun üòÅ
[2025-09-21T21:10:28] Marius: would love to experience something like that
[2025-09-21T21:46:50] Yamal: Wich frame
[2025-09-21T21:53:27] Yamal: https://youtu.be/kPspwcCsbQQ?si=s65Bcks8rfvARwtA
[2025-09-21T22:14:45] Rose: Hey there Oscar, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-21T22:19:32] LiquorHole .: Thats with 33x2 right?
[2025-09-21T22:32:13] Reekoz: Mine? 7260r
[2025-09-21T22:35:22] Reekoz: 33√ó2 means 33 turns per tooth, 2 wires in parallel
[2025-09-21T22:36:55] JPPL: What you felt?
[2025-09-21T22:38:27] haku: like i said minimim 80h 11" here
[2025-09-21T22:42:00] LiquorHole .: Not gonna lie, im not knowledgeable enough to know if that answered my question üò≠
[2025-09-21T22:42:25] Reekoz: If you want to better understand it, fewer turns means higher KV or more rpm/volt, less torque per amp, and more turns means lower KV which yields less rpm/volt, more torque per amp, thats the rule of thumb
[2025-09-21T22:43:21] LiquorHole .: Good to know
[2025-09-21T22:46:55] Yamal: I have been lucky enough to try all three windings - 17/4///22/3///33/2 but in different drum and electronic configurations
[2025-09-21T22:47:33] Yamal: 17/4- stock Nami 22/3 - Rion motor 33/2 - old 65h and the one using now 80h
[2025-09-21T22:47:48] haku: whats the best
[2025-09-21T22:48:09] haku: minimum 80h isnt that right yams
[2025-09-21T22:48:38] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-09-21T22:48:50] Yamal: All nice
[2025-09-21T22:53:26] haku: why wish death upon me brother?
[2025-09-21T22:54:58] Yamal: the name game, yams the same xD
[2025-09-21T22:55:56] haku: we both came up from the streets of vesc chat. 2 street kids now men. its sad it had to end this way
[2025-09-21T22:56:55] haku: https://youtu.be/5D3crqpClPY?si=8XYL4g4Ak8KrK1-j
[2025-09-21T22:58:50] Yamal: Just kidding, but you know we have a name
[2025-09-21T23:01:06] haku: dead man walking is my nickname?
[2025-09-21T23:01:17] haku: peak g30 80h?
[2025-09-21T23:07:40] Yamal: Your dead is a Spanish expression that doesn't mention your name. Call it whatever you want, Haku. It's great. Yamal is enough for me
[2025-09-21T23:08:11] Nobrrr: No
[2025-09-21T23:10:59] LiquorHole .: So far Ive only KNOW that i ridden on 22x3 but the fucking scooter is so heavy and such little power it felt like it was 33x2 üòÇ
[2025-09-21T23:15:31] haku: but yamal aka kw farmer yams sounds more badass
[2025-09-21T23:17:14] haku: you have ascended above me yamal. i will respect your wishes
[2025-09-21T23:18:57] haku: the nami boys all need nicknames. you feel me. the red rfp nami is the slayer of punani, yamal the kw farmer amd ayo the martian
[2025-09-21T23:26:05] Yamal: yamal is enough xD
[2025-09-21T23:26:28] haku: its respect. in the gangsta world. a nickname is a sign of respect
[2025-09-21T23:26:44] haku: that means you earned it
[2025-09-21T23:26:48] Marius: isnt it 33 wires in parallel
[2025-09-21T23:27:11] 'lekrsu': It is.
[2025-09-21T23:27:21] Marius: yes this
[2025-09-21T23:27:25] 'lekrsu': If you ask an LLM it says the reverse.
[2025-09-21T23:27:37] 'lekrsu': :)
[2025-09-21T23:27:51] Marius: no it all affects kv xd

[2025-09-22T01:08:24] Manuel: Peak g30 uses 100h
[2025-09-22T01:08:31] Manuel: Or else no peak
[2025-09-22T01:08:59] Manuel: Lost me at steel
[2025-09-22T01:09:01] Manuel: <sticker>
[2025-09-22T01:10:41] haku: sure. send me one. ill make it fit
[2025-09-22T01:10:59] haku: 70 and 80h will fit for sure
[2025-09-22T01:12:09] haku: with a 65 rim that would be perfect setup tbh
[2025-09-22T01:12:59] haku: even bmx parts from china can go cheap to wtf why expensive
[2025-09-22T01:19:03] LiquorHole .: That shit better be made out of a dying star
[2025-09-22T01:19:23] LiquorHole .: Cost more than the 85250v2 controller from spintend üòÇ
[2025-09-22T01:24:14] Manuel: Ok send your bank info i will send
[2025-09-22T03:58:33] LiquorHole .: @SibClimb with your 80h motor The size is 155mm so id need a 160mm opening to fit it or larger correct? For the rotor and brake clearance and stuff
[2025-09-22T06:58:30] Nobrrr: Other way around
[2025-09-22T07:32:19] Dualtron Achilleus: Those are so cheap to make a good powerfull batery!!!
[2025-09-22T08:11:24] Finn: Bak with same specs even cheaper
[2025-09-22T08:11:59] Dualtron Achilleus: Wich bak
[2025-09-22T08:12:38] Dualtron Achilleus: O ya cgp
[2025-09-22T08:17:09] Finn: https://www.nkon.nl/de/bak-n21700cgp-4000mah-40a.html
[2025-09-22T08:38:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes it is easily controllable, one of my pilots went from RM-X (2025 motor) to 100H and he finds it lack of torque now that he's used to our motor. Don't worry, 100H has torque but not that impressive yet.
[2025-09-22T08:42:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, stop using chatGPT, I see you were talking of torque constant before, but that comes from chatGPT and what it says is wrong ;) 38KV gives you ~~53nm at 300A phase from VESC ;)
[2025-09-22T08:43:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: 33x2 means 33 wires in parallel and 2 turns, the exact opposite
[2025-09-22T08:44:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Something like this, don't remember exactly, I should open my 3D models
[2025-09-22T09:09:36] Dualtron Achilleus: What kv of this
[2025-09-22T09:57:15] Marius: doesnt it depend on not just kv? like u could have 2 motors with same kv but completely different torque
[2025-09-22T10:24:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: No
[2025-09-22T10:27:28] Marius: so 30h and 60h for example have same torque per amp if they have the same kv?
[2025-09-22T10:27:35] Marius: then the difference is max torque ig?
[2025-09-22T11:20:15] james: Too many people using chatgpt üòÅüòÅ
[2025-09-22T11:26:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but I can instantly recognize people using it and asking questions to it, waiting for the knowledge, because chatGPT is full of errors when it comes to motors
[2025-09-22T11:26:59] Marius: its full of errors for everything. because theres no way for it to tell whats true and whats not
[2025-09-22T11:27:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, difference will be the winding, so max current That means at same current same torque, but one will be able to pull 200A and the other 400A for the same heating, so twice the torque in the end (summarized)
[2025-09-22T11:27:34] Marius: oh thats really interesting
[2025-09-22T11:27:45] james: Yeah absolutely. Chatgpt is pretty useless when it comes to technical stuff. 50% of what it says is bullshit üòÅ
[2025-09-22T11:30:58] Marius: so what makes some motors better than others? just max current they can take without overheating?
[2025-09-22T11:31:06] Marius: like diff quality motors
[2025-09-22T11:38:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's more about how you ask questions to it It is a tool to be used knowing what you do
[2025-09-22T11:39:31] Marius: bros talking in riddles üò≠üò≠
[2025-09-22T12:01:27] Marius: dont brainrot this chat manuel, this is serious
[2025-09-22T12:01:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, that means you can't ask a question and take the answer as it comes
[2025-09-22T12:03:08] Marius: yeah i realized that. thats why i just ask ppl here
[2025-09-22T12:39:38] Dualtron Achilleus: Axial vs radial motor, inrunner vs outrunner
[2025-09-22T12:54:10] james: Correct
[2025-09-22T13:24:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Many many MANYYYYYYYY parameters haha
[2025-09-22T13:28:59] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: There is the difference in configuring
[2025-09-22T13:35:01] Marius: too intellectual for me
[2025-09-22T14:22:01] Nobrrr: Maybe I will just go to university and study electronics and motor technology and return as intellectual

[2025-09-22T15:13:31] Marius: uni but i quit
[2025-09-22T15:13:49] Marius: then 9-5 for scooter
[2025-09-22T15:23:48] Nobrrr: And now?
[2025-09-22T15:23:55] Nobrrr: 9-5?
[2025-09-22T15:24:17] Marius: nine to five job
[2025-09-22T15:24:35] Marius: unemployed final boss
[2025-09-22T17:05:37] haku: alot of intellectual talk here. i like it
[2025-09-22T17:10:59] LiquorHole .: Guess im the DLC Update of unemployment

[2025-09-24T14:32:51] LiquorHole .: The 7260r tire is 7 inches
[2025-09-24T14:33:02] LiquorHole .: The width isnt the problem is the fact that is not 7 inches
[2025-09-24T14:33:26] LiquorHole .: I like the other tire more then that rounded one Cause you can fit bigger rotors on those
[2025-09-24T14:33:47] LiquorHole .: Unlike this one that cant fit a 180mm rotor

[2025-09-24T20:04:50] Noname: Good lord NO those are death machines
[2025-09-24T20:29:01] Matthew: Can you guys help me make sense of what my current values should be for dual motor. When I program on slave vesc 85250 ubox 300amps phase as I have normally ran single motor and then I go to rt/d it shows 600amps. Lower to 150 it displays 300amps. And basically same on the 100/100 ubox i program 130amps phase and rt/d shows 260amps. Only dual motor experience i have with vesc was 85150 with 2 vsett motors and I just programmed the one 85150 and it just doubled the value total between the 2 vesc. Now I am try to set lower amps on 100/100 and keep the high phase amps on 85250 ubox. Hope that makes sense

[2025-09-24T20:44:30] Matthew: So.... I didnt expect acceleration to be so drastically different since I'm using same battery capacity and voltage
[2025-09-24T20:44:48] Matthew: It, almost scared me
[2025-09-24T20:48:23] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: It is multiplied when the two Vesc are connected by cam
[2025-09-24T21:12:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: it's not a escooter, motorcycle without seat
[2025-09-24T21:14:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: performance is very average when you look at the size of the thing honestly Thailand guys go 280+Kmh with seated scooters, one motor only
[2025-09-24T21:19:18] Marius: couldnt u do the same on standing scooters and just duck down

[2025-09-24T21:43:45] haku: what would be minimum size for scooter rim to be considered a scooter. 6.5, 7? 11" tire max?
[2025-09-24T21:44:12] JPPL: Standing 2 wheel
[2025-09-24T21:44:30] haku: so dual qs268 still a scooter
[2025-09-24T21:44:44] JPPL: If the guy is tall üòÇ
[2025-09-24T21:44:56] JPPL: Imagine One big onewheel
[2025-09-24T21:44:59] JPPL: Still onewheel
[2025-09-24T21:45:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: in my opinion, stand scooter as we know is 6.5" (or 7") rim and 11" tyres
[2025-09-24T21:45:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: The whole point is to categorize when it comes to performance
[2025-09-24T21:45:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: like we did in french championship
[2025-09-24T21:45:55] haku: this is whaf i consider scooter motors aswell above that is moto teritory imo
[2025-09-24T21:49:38] haku: but build what ever boys! creativity knows no bounds. you feel me.
[2025-09-24T21:50:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes completely
[2025-09-24T21:50:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: But don't compare something impossible to compare
[2025-09-24T21:50:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Many people compares our RM-X performance to those motorcycle non seated things
[2025-09-24T21:51:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: But what they forget is that we operate in a restricted field, if we want to use bigger wheels, it's not 198Kmh that we will achieve x)
[2025-09-24T21:51:12] JPPL: Still impressive crazy bastards
[2025-09-24T21:52:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes it's nice
[2025-09-24T21:53:06] JPPL: Keep rocking! ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2025-09-24T22:04:38] Matthew: Ok, but when I went for a ride the combined amps is pretty much to what I am wanting.. when I went with 65amps for 100/100 it was weak and I also had lowered 300phase to 150phase and acceleration is less than I had single motor.
[2025-09-24T22:05:40] Matthew: I want 100/100 to have 50amps battery and 130phase 140abs. And on 85250 I want 300amps phase 400abs and 140amps battery.

[2025-09-24T22:11:24] Matthew: I was at Walgreens one time and I seen what seemed to be a long board skateboard. I go walk around front of him to be nosey and dude had a killer esk8 with like 12kw and I asked him how it is riding them. He looks like he's skateboarded his whole life and he says I've had it up to 47mph. I just said youre nutz man
[2025-09-24T22:21:42] Nobrrr: minh khanhs videos are crazy
[2025-09-24T22:23:12] james: Then set that up exactly as you wrote
[2025-09-24T22:23:56] james: You set up one motor at a time (if you don't use multi setup button, but please don't use that)

[2025-09-24T22:58:22] IMWurden: fra perch√© hai tre ammortizzatori di sterzo?
[2025-09-25T00:41:06] Matthew: I programmed each vesc from CAN selection When I did setup wizard I selected generic-large outrunner. The wizard did detection and showed individual motor for rotation. I did individual backups for configurations for update of 6.06fw then restored since rear motor is exactly the same 85250 and never got disconnected. I verified everything on there(85250) is good. 100/100 shows the front motor and I put the parameters in want. Then go to rt/d and the numbers are double. Is there something I missed?
[2025-09-25T00:54:44] Matthew: Made a little video because I have issues trying to explain
[2025-09-25T01:02:37] Matthew: Am I actually getting a demand for 600amps phase?
[2025-09-25T01:03:59] Rose: Hey there Accelerate, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-25T01:12:00] james: Rt data will show phase amps combined from both motors, including some overshoot
[2025-09-25T01:17:56] haku: ok career opportunity. racing athlete and engineer is out. i will now strive to be a paid shill. makes me wonder what if this scooter is vesc. https://youtu.be/LjqvJVfJiZs?si=swuKKSe_stPXUHsf
[2025-09-25T01:28:52] Matthew: Ok. Am i safe to run it how it is from that video?
[2025-09-25T01:38:42] haku: nvm its kelly looks like
[2025-09-25T02:03:36] james: Yeah settings do look pretty sane mostly if battery handles those amps. But for front motor, disable slow abs overcurrent and set abs max current limit to 165 or so, it's too close to motor amps limit right now
[2025-09-25T02:37:47] Rose: Hey there waak, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-09-25T03:14:35] Matthew: I was wondering while riding for dual motor would you combine magnet size between the 2 and figure that would be the torque you get with say 115h motor.
[2025-09-25T03:14:54] Matthew: Because 65h and 50h dual is insane
[2025-09-25T03:15:19] Matthew: I still have yet to even hit 15kw output.
[2025-09-25T03:15:49] Matthew: How do you 25kw+ peeps keep the front end down?
[2025-09-25T03:16:30] Matthew: 12.2kw is now my new pb.

[2025-09-25T04:11:53] Jason: cant find a big ass motor on there

Which one would you recommend in terms of reliability, performance, and ease of setup? Any real-world experience with either would be super helpful.

[2025-09-25T10:09:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you want reliability none of the two, you must spend more. At least you should get spintend for reliability, makerbase and flipsky are for no long term use
[2025-09-25T11:42:07] james: Ft85 isn't even compatible with vesc tool. It use flipsky special firmware
[2025-09-25T11:47:39] Patrick: Flipsky firmware not just vesc copy worse?
[2025-09-25T11:47:55] Patrick: Or how they manage to make one
[2025-09-25T11:53:44] james: Yeah they just cloned vesc of course and made it incompatible with vesc tool
[2025-09-25T11:54:07] james: They have absolutely not made their own firmware from scratch

[2025-09-25T14:22:11] cihan: At last I've bought a new scooter, I bought Kaabo wolf warrior x. Does anyone know if stock BMS on it is problematic? It doesn't have a software to check voltage of individual cell groups. So should I open deck and remove battery to check cell voltages after a while? I'll use it with stock controller and battery for now.

[2025-09-25T17:13:38] Dualtron Achilleus: Argue
[2025-09-25T17:19:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes you have more leverage. but bigger it is, more it flexes. If material is not good and hardened enough, the disc will always make contact with brake pads and generate heat
[2025-09-25T17:25:59] LiquorHole .: 160mm supremacy
[2025-09-25T17:26:16] LiquorHole .: I saw these on aliexpress for 30 dollars
[2025-09-25T17:26:42] LiquorHole .: Honestly i dont even think Theyd get hot enough to perform better then a regular rotor
[2025-09-25T17:35:39] Matthew: I am a newer guy to building these things kinda so some things are just little things I remember but also the combination of the motors. Because 65h 17x4 was pretty good with ~5200 watts and from start couldnt go full throttle so that was a lot of fun for me.

[2025-09-25T19:16:12] haku: i see. i have no idea in these branded stuff tbh
[2025-09-25T19:28:08] LiquorHole .: Their the cheapest cause they sell them in a pack basically, Both brakes included every type of pads and braided hose all pre installed already
[2025-09-25T19:29:05] LiquorHole .: For like 457 euros

[2025-09-25T23:54:21] Matthew: 100/100 max i am aware of is 130amps phase. Demanding more than that you risk burning it up. Factory 85150 phase up to 220amps, and unless you modify the 85150 I would feel a little risky pushing past 200amps phase because for some room to overshoot... others can correct me. Someone was selling modified 85150 and I think something like 300amps phase was their max.

[2025-09-26T13:24:35] cihan: Bigger disc has higher stopping power, if you don't control brake lever well and brake too hard, bigger disc has higher chance to cause skidding.
[2025-09-26T13:25:06] cihan: Segway gt1 and gt2 has 140mm disc probably for the same reason.
[2025-09-26T13:41:11] Dualtron Achilleus: Someone use this? Good?
[2025-09-26T14:12:06] LiquorHole .: I was going to use the 160mm 2.7mm rotor only cause i dont wanna Have spare tires for no reason since they wont fit 180mm

[2025-09-27T00:21:48] Felix: Drive a different scooter
[2025-09-27T00:38:51] cihan: New wolf warrior x has stiff steering. They have strangely over tightened the middle screw on the fork stem connection and also applied loctite on it. Probably the bearings also don't have enough grease. I've started missing ninebot quality from very beginning. :(
[2025-09-27T00:56:26] Dualtron Achilleus: Dude shiit
[2025-09-27T00:56:39] Dualtron Achilleus: Are they all like this

[2025-09-27T04:30:18] Matthew: How do I make sense of these logs? 11.8kw is on the 85250 controller and 12.5kw is on 100/100. Both same ride nothing has been reset.
[2025-09-27T04:46:21] haku: dam this is cheap for a full size ebike.
[2025-09-27T04:46:50] haku: frame is yuck
[2025-09-27T04:48:17] haku: tarrifs these nuts. everything china got cheaper.
[2025-09-27T04:54:33] Noname: Scam
[2025-09-27T04:55:13] haku: no they cannot. paypal and ali pay will not allow it.
[2025-09-27T04:55:21] haku: <photos/photo_26126@27-09-2025_04-55-21.jpg>
[2025-09-27T04:55:41] Noname: Link you fuck
[2025-09-27T04:56:39] haku: no fucking way haha. might be scams
[2025-09-27T04:56:56] haku: I just found this on AliExpress: $362.16 | Electric Bike for Adults 2000W 48V 45Ah , 35 MPH Dual Motor Dual Battery Ebike, 20 Fat Tire Full Suspension, Up to 173Miles https://a.aliexpress.com/_mLKki8h
[2025-09-27T04:59:09] haku: yea its a scam. look at the actual photo on the discription lol
[2025-09-27T04:59:14] haku: catfish
[2025-09-27T04:59:46] haku: I just found this on AliExpress: $391.14 | 2025 Electric Dirt Bike 72V 13000w Powerful Mid Drive Electric Bike E DirtBike 40AH Light Bee X Ebike Electric Motorcycle https://a.aliexpress.com/_mPVVpe1
[2025-09-27T05:03:04] Matthew: High carbon cast
[2025-09-27T05:07:56] Matthew: All depending on the car. Carbon ceramic is cream of the crop. I used slotted brembo rotors and hawk racing brake pads. Brakes had to get warmed up to grip better but they could take a beating. Route home I would occasionally take was all twisty and stuff and no cars on the road so I'd drive it hard. Get home and park and in evening you see the rotors glowing orange hehe üòàüòà I warped the rotors kinda quick.
[2025-09-27T05:07:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: Let me search
[2025-09-27T05:08:20] haku: Noname buy this local shipping. you get a tuttio in the mail.
[2025-09-27T05:08:58] haku: willwood the same tech yea
[2025-09-27T05:11:44] Matthew: I worked at Trask Performance for a little bit and the Asian working there had a fully built and modified 2t scooter. 3rd gear power wheelie lol
[2025-09-27T05:14:37] Matthew: I built a nice one back in 2021. Fuckin thieves. Cruised 45mph max speed and 35mph normal cruising speed. Was nice to just throw gas into the tank. I was using 66/80cc 2 stroke kit and modified it myself. Probably around 6hp since the bike and myself together weighed like 400lbs.
[2025-09-27T05:17:55] Matthew: Yasir
[2025-09-27T05:19:46] Matthew: Its is still definitely worth spending the money if you drive the vehicles hard. Stock pads on one civic I had 1 fast stop from 90mph and was instantly having HORRIBLE brake fade. So you definitely get what you pay for. Also higher performance pads shouldn't burst into flames lol
[2025-09-27T05:20:56] haku: ofcourse. stopping power has to match power
[2025-09-27T05:20:56] Matthew: Dude driving a centrifugal supercharged z28 camaro of early 2000 did a hard stop from a bit above 150mph and turned into the school parking lot and both his front pads were on fire lol
[2025-09-27T06:47:47] LiquorHole .: Maybe they were cold
[2025-09-27T09:37:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you push braking power on those disc they end up like this
[2025-09-27T09:57:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've explained already that vesc RT data are not reliable
[2025-09-27T09:57:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because they use unfiltered values, with noise
[2025-09-27T09:58:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: Basically, real power values are a lot less than what's displayed here
[2025-09-27T09:58:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: And you always notice a difference between front and rear because they don't use the same peaks at same moment
[2025-09-27T11:43:02] Patrick: Sold
[2025-09-27T12:10:56] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: If I remember anything from the application that you gave Paolo and you, that connects me to the BMS
[2025-09-27T17:04:56] Matthew: I dont think they were because he was doing donuts and also raced a modified Chevy diesel 4x4 truck. Regular brake pads don't handle that kind of heat and how fast he slowed down. We were going to school in Laramie, wy at Wyotech and he was from a more well off family. Was kinda wild seeing what these teenagers have. One guy brought 6 of his cars and rented out like half of storage spaces.
[2025-09-27T17:05:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Hi guys, the Jan design disc will be also produced at 3mm version. If anyone interested please get in touch with me before 1 October thank you .
[2025-09-27T17:15:20] Maki Verem: Hello guys, i want to buy 84v hub motor front and back, which is better? Speed+speed, torque+torque, or back torque and front speed?
[2025-09-27T17:25:57] LiquorHole .: So seeing the power through the bms would be more accurate?
[2025-09-27T17:27:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2025-09-27T17:56:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2025-09-27T18:16:31] haku: hey bud what grade steel is it?
[2025-09-27T18:18:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: 420c 45hrc
[2025-09-27T18:18:47] haku: gotcha thanks
[2025-09-27T18:19:01] haku: would this be produced in 180 aswell?
[2025-09-27T18:19:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: No
[2025-09-27T18:20:00] haku: it will be more expensive than my frame.but i support work by the boys for the boys
[2025-09-27T18:48:34] haku: back and front always has to match imo. also really depends on your battery specs and vesc. or what you personaly like. speed motors need amps
[2025-09-27T20:17:00] Maki Verem: I will have 200a discharge battery
[2025-09-27T20:21:06] Maki Verem: I want better acceleration so i have to pick torque motor
[2025-09-27T20:21:49] Marius: 3mm doenst fit with magura does it
[2025-09-27T20:21:53] Marius: or why isnt the previous one 3mm
[2025-09-27T20:22:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: It doesn't, only for hope .
[2025-09-27T20:37:34] haku: dual torque motor on 200 amps will just do burnouts on front. but yea its up to you. thats what i use aswell
[2025-09-27T20:37:52] haku: you can always traction control
[2025-09-27T20:37:59] LiquorHole .: Traction control and pray
[2025-09-27T20:38:29] haku: how big of a motor you getting
[2025-09-27T20:38:57] LiquorHole .: Since your 84v the payoff from using Torque winding motors are pretty good, Same top end speed as a 72v on 33x2 But way more acceleration
[2025-09-27T20:42:17] Maki Verem: Yea im always turn on traction control
[2025-09-27T20:42:48] Maki Verem: https://lonnyomotor.com/product/11-inch-high-power-scooter-motor-5000w-150km-h-60v-120v/
[2025-09-27T20:42:51] Maki Verem: This
[2025-09-27T20:43:12] LiquorHole .: Only 70h?
[2025-09-27T20:43:24] LiquorHole .: Frame cant fit bigger?
[2025-09-27T20:43:47] LiquorHole .: If your opening is like 160mm or more it can fit 80h from rage
[2025-09-27T20:45:40] Maki Verem: Can you send me a link for 80h?
[2025-09-27T20:46:23] LiquorHole .: https://rage-mechanics.com/moteurs-trottinette-electrique/1510-moteur-xht75.html
[2025-09-27T20:48:22] Maki Verem: too expensive sadly

[2025-09-27T23:39:35] Noname: When nature takes it back
[2025-09-27T23:40:40] Noname: This is why its a dead end. I tried to cross it got to deep and had to u turn in the water but kept my feet dry lol

[2025-09-28T02:01:24] LiquorHole .: Worse case is Ill be riding on something i don‚Äôt really like until I get the New frame, best case i wont need a new frame until Yishun finishes that Custom frame with the 160mm dropout and I could start the project
[2025-09-28T02:03:57] LiquorHole .: Also Gotta figure out why my shit not charging cause the chargers are fine

[2025-09-28T07:30:01] LiquorHole .: 50kw club
[2025-09-28T07:31:10] Maki Verem: Where can i get hub motor that can handle 50kw?
[2025-09-28T07:31:21] Maki Verem: 11"
[2025-09-28T07:31:44] LiquorHole .: The hotdog motor, 100h
[2025-09-28T07:32:09] Maki Verem: Hotdog motor what?
[2025-09-28T07:32:40] LiquorHole .: Just a nickname for the 100h motor
[2025-09-28T07:33:41] Maki Verem: below 50kw i will be banned?
[2025-09-28T07:33:45] Maki Verem: üòÇ
[2025-09-28T07:34:03] LiquorHole .: Yes 2026 60kw will be the minimum ü§í
[2025-09-28T07:36:15] Maki Verem: I understand bossü´°
[2025-09-28T07:54:28] Maki Verem: What controller for 50kw? Kelly?
[2025-09-28T07:57:28] LiquorHole .: Probably a modified tronic x12 controller or whatever controller the rm-x uses if it‚Äôs even available to the public
[2025-09-28T07:57:47] LiquorHole .: 23s at 525a bat
[2025-09-28T08:00:10] Maki Verem: Liqued cooling omagad
[2025-09-28T08:00:33] LiquorHole .: And different mosfets probably
[2025-09-28T08:00:47] LiquorHole .: Simpleton stuff
[2025-09-28T08:01:18] Maki Verem: Thanks sir, im new to this high performance stuffs
[2025-09-28T08:01:53] Maki Verem: I was running a 12kw 72v scooter before with dual ubox vesc
[2025-09-28T08:36:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol no
[2025-09-28T08:36:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: X12 can't do that much
[2025-09-28T08:37:03] LiquorHole .: Damn
[2025-09-28T08:42:29] Maki Verem: What can do?
[2025-09-28T08:50:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: it should be rated for 10kw continuosly
[2025-09-28T10:57:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: Place me one for test
[2025-09-28T16:12:18] Pandalgns: <animation>
[2025-09-28T16:12:18] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2025-09-28T16:12:49] Pandalgns: 8mm disc spacers with a flowered center to hold the disc securely
[2025-09-28T16:41:04] Matthew: What controllers do you intend to use? I am using standard type winding and dual motor 65h if you wanted that kind of power. Push like 9kw per motor will be quite fast and 20s will get you up around 70mph. I am running 65h 22x3 rear and 50h 16x4 front motor
[2025-09-28T16:43:01] Matthew: I am only on 16s 180amps battery. 50amps battery front with 130amps phase and rear is 330amps phase. And I have ramp time .6 rear and .8 front.
[2025-09-28T17:10:22] Matthew: I see. Thank you. üôÇ my only experience until now was dual 85150 and I didn't do anything fancy. I just ran the double parameters and called it good and never even looked at the second controller rt/d. I recently had someone telling me they were running 18kw off of 16s 70amps battery and I didn't know how to explain since the values were different.
[2025-09-28T17:12:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: Are you really going to put this 3D printed spacer ?
[2025-09-28T17:14:58] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: don't worry about the temperature, everything will merge üòÇ
[2025-09-28T17:41:46] Pandalgns: Before ordering it to be machined, it would be good to test to see if the measurements and the design fit well, right?
[2025-09-28T18:19:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: I was afraid that you use it 3D printed üòÇ
[2025-09-28T18:20:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you want my opinion, the "flower" is useless, will make your part more expansive, and if, for any reason, you change your brake disc to something different, your part becomes a waste of money
[2025-09-28T18:24:01] Pandalgns: I appreciate your opinion but it is a piece that I will machine for my scooters, taking into account that the discs that I use on both the large and the small one come with that same pattern and I am happy with them.
[2025-09-28T18:27:00] Pandalgns: In any case, they are specifically only for one of them, for the small one, which due to the engine, tire and brake configuration that I am putting on it, I need to separate the discs.
[2025-09-28T18:28:14] 'lekrsu': Yeah also thought you were gonna use them printed for a moment
[2025-09-28T18:32:43] Pandalgns: It's for my girlfriend's scooter... I don't want to kill her right now üòÇüòÇ
[2025-09-28T18:46:46] haku: print it in peek fillament
[2025-09-28T18:58:58] Pandalgns: Buy me a roll of filamentüòÇüòÇ from 300 to 500 euros a roll
[2025-09-28T18:59:31] haku: i would like some too for the sake of science haha
[2025-09-28T18:59:33] LiquorHole .: Question rq, Could i swap like the fork Things at the bottom? Idk what theyre called

[2025-09-28T19:02:34] LiquorHole .: That doesn‚Äôt answer my question üò≠
[2025-09-28T19:12:44] haku: i think the laotie forks you might.
[2025-09-28T19:13:50] LiquorHole .: Link
[2025-09-28T19:14:29] Pandalgns: Yes you can, I have a T107 Pro and I put some Laotie ones on it, "same scooter" and then I bought other generic ones for that type of shock absorbers, they normally have a screw at the bottom although there are other models that are screwed directly into the shock absorber rod.
[2025-09-28T19:21:14] haku: its the suspension on our scooters. same on laotie and my wepoor
[2025-09-28T19:22:00] haku: just different dropouts
[2025-09-28T19:31:14] Pandalgns: You have to look at the bottom first to see what kind of grip it has.
[2025-09-28T19:37:15] Pandalgns: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 32,66‚Ç¨ | LANGFEITE T8 Scooter suspensi√≥n delantera horquilla piezas de scooter el√©ctrico original nueva horquilla de suspensi√≥n https://a.aliexpress.com/_EvKjGUW
[2025-09-28T19:37:24] Pandalgns: These are the last ones I bought
[2025-09-28T19:39:28] LiquorHole .: So the internal part has to be 30mm?
[2025-09-28T19:40:50] Pandalgns: Measure the bar you have from the shock absorber but I think they are standard on these shock absorbers
[2025-09-28T20:04:12] LiquorHole .: @SibClimb you guys aren‚Äôt shipping brakes right now? It only gives the option to pick up in store

[2025-09-28T20:35:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: But I don't have any hope brakes in stock anymore for now
[2025-09-28T20:35:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: Got a stolen package of Hope so not going to order soon soon üòÇ
[2025-09-28T20:35:48] LiquorHole .: So Not October?
[2025-09-28T21:43:05] haku: have this part milled f you can. ive seen hese cast chinesium crack

[2025-09-28T22:15:50] haku: dam since ive been watching milled and lathed stuff. i want all my parts for future projects custom. designed by yours trully haku industries worldwide
[2025-09-28T22:16:10] LiquorHole .: Is Lordgun.com a good place to be buying brakes from? They‚Äôre pretty cheap
[2025-09-28T22:28:04] haku: boys who will make a vesc powered mill or lathe. portable and battery powered. designed for small jobs
[2025-09-28T22:28:50] haku: who will be the engineer to tackle this obstacle?
[2025-09-28T22:30:09] haku: 30s lathe who will be the chosen one?
[2025-09-28T22:33:28] haku: i guess nobody has great ideas? but me? unreal
[2025-09-28T22:42:03] beh.....bz.....: It would be interesting üòé
[2025-09-28T22:49:21] haku: is it nescessarry nope! but cool yes!

[2025-09-28T23:50:46] Noname: You dont see to many Plymouth Prowlers around anymore
[2025-09-28T23:51:16] LiquorHole .: Looks like the perfect burnout car
[2025-09-28T23:51:53] Noname: I dont think grandpa approves of that lol
[2025-09-28T23:52:37] LiquorHole .: Youll never know, he might be a Veteran balls to the walls enthusiast
[2025-09-28T23:54:13] Noname: Im sitting next to him he ain't got no fight left lol

[2025-09-29T01:14:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Field weakening or mtpa?
[2025-09-29T01:15:05] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: But the reason is quite simple... I know how to go off-roading... on slicks... and a lot of things got inside the controller, and as luck would have it, I only siliconed one of the two...
[2025-09-29T01:15:50] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: I just didn't respect... üòÇüòÇ it's 100% my fault

[2025-09-29T16:51:33] Martin Kaktits: Is the ferrofluid from supermagnete.de legit? I know cheap Ali FF doesnt tolerate high temps.
[2025-09-29T17:33:37] Manuel: Withoyt fwj
[2025-09-29T17:33:40] Manuel: Fwk
[2025-09-29T17:34:26] Amel Hodzic: ur gonna use it for a hub motor?
[2025-09-29T17:35:06] Martin Kaktits: yeye for motor, ofc.
[2025-09-29T17:35:13] Amel Hodzic: why not just get statorade?
[2025-09-29T17:35:28] Martin Kaktits: Availability/ price in Europe ?
[2025-09-29T17:35:47] Martin Kaktits: The german stuff seems to be ok, but i wanted to check in with u guys
[2025-09-29T17:36:07] Amel Hodzic: you can get this. https://nexun.pl/en/products/statorade-10ml-motor-cooling-system-ferrofluid-775.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo6ON9T8l_ks7Y5aR4Q8tyRgslD21mSeC2B9oGtY9Eh5Wp8MlHb
[2025-09-29T17:36:09] Amel Hodzic: its expensive
[2025-09-29T17:36:15] Amel Hodzic: but it should work
[2025-09-29T17:36:40] Martin Kaktits: yes exactly. The german stuff is cheaper :)
[2025-09-29T17:37:07] Amel Hodzic: is the german stuff just ferrofluid or is it statorade
[2025-09-29T17:37:43] Amel Hodzic: and statorade is made for this purpose and it has cooling particles in it also
[2025-09-29T17:40:10] Martin Kaktits: <photos/photo_26140@29-09-2025_17-40-10.jpg>
[2025-09-29T17:41:07] Martin Kaktits: what no it doesnt? The FF is the cooling substance. Statorade just made sure it doesnt burn at low-ish temps and such
[2025-09-29T17:41:27] Martin Kaktits: üßê
[2025-09-29T17:44:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ferrofluid Is a registered mark made in Japan and have many variant, but they are not made for electric motor. Statorade is a product made by a partnership from Grin and Ferrofluid, specially made for electric motors
[2025-09-29T17:48:51] Martin Kaktits: I know statorade is THE stuff, but noone here used the supermagnete.de stuff?
[2025-09-29T21:59:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: Using ferrofluid is globally a bad idea
[2025-09-29T22:40:50] Mirono escooters: Since when
[2025-09-29T23:19:37] haku: i dont believe on it aswell. even though its an american product
[2025-09-29T23:52:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: Transferring heat to the magnets leads you to unglued magnets and/or demagnetized magnets
[2025-09-29T23:59:19] Marius: what winding temp do u think it safe for ly motor?
[2025-09-29T23:59:28] Marius: without ferrofluid
[2025-09-30T00:58:39] Matthew: I have a limited amount of manual lathe and mill experience.
[2025-09-30T01:08:21] Matthew: I use statorade and its perfect for me. My 65h 22x3 would overheat on me cruising 35mph. Statorade made it to where it got to a stable temp of 50-65¬∞c and I can cruise it forever, and could get up and cruise a few miles straight of 45mph and motor slowly raises to 100¬∞c but I can just slow down back to 35mph and within a minute motor temps drop to 80¬∞c.
[2025-09-30T01:09:10] Matthew: Dual motor i have not had any such issues of motor overheating.
[2025-09-30T01:39:06] Matthew: I ran into a dude on the trail riding one in Phoenix. Way lower to the ground than I thought they would be from pics

[2025-09-30T08:17:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: LY motors use N38H Max temp is 100¬∞C that means every time you get to 100¬∞C, your ferrofluid transfers heat to the magnets and it's close to their limits
[2025-09-30T08:17:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: 130¬∞C is okay

[2025-09-30T18:07:19] Dualtron Achilleus: 160v reaaly?!?üòÖ
[2025-09-30T18:21:03] haku: white smoke! new pope! i like
[2025-09-30T18:37:51] Matthew: I was told the magnets are 120¬∞c
[2025-09-30T18:38:42] Dualtron Achilleus: Are you going 160v also haku
[2025-09-30T18:39:46] Matthew: I had to use statorade otherwise I'd have to stop every 10 minutes to let the motor cool down.
[2025-09-30T18:44:09] Matthew: If youre using dual motor and not going really fast all the time i wouldn't think they should get too hot. Just hooking up my front motor has made overheating my motors ALMOST impossible. I think now with dual motor hottest the 65h 22x3 rear motor has got up to was ~60¬∞c and I am using 140amps battery and 330amps phase. Front is vsett motor and only 50amps battery and 130phase so power drops off fast up front.
[2025-09-30T18:44:52] Matthew: Did you have similar results? Or have you not used ferro fluid?
[2025-09-30T18:46:11] LiquorHole .: I hate single motor and I usually go 40-50mph more then 30-20, and once i start my build those 40-50 may turn to 45-60 depending on the road and traffic
[2025-09-30T18:47:01] LiquorHole .: Gotta deal with 70h motors since a custom frame would cost to damn much
[2025-09-30T18:47:54] LiquorHole .: Was going to run 300a Battery and 600-700a phase Peak for like maybe 20s
[2025-09-30T18:48:46] LiquorHole .: 100a bat and about 300-400a phase constant
[2025-09-30T18:49:14] LiquorHole .: 220lb scooter plus 126lbs rider
[2025-09-30T18:49:16] LiquorHole .: Heavy load
[2025-09-30T18:52:34] LiquorHole .: Im honestly expecting temps to be around 75-90c cause when i ride i go for a Unreasonable long time
[2025-09-30T18:53:10] LiquorHole .: About 3-8 hours of riding down to 50% or 35%
[2025-09-30T18:53:30] Matthew: Yeah, I was talking a bunch of shit about dual motor mainly because almost every bad wreck I've had was almost caused solely because of dual motor and the front motor trying to throw me into the ground. My dual motor experience started with yume y11+. Then I did a dual vsett motor on the max and again almost crashed a few times. I burned a vesc and decided to buy 65h 22x3. Then I was disappointed but mainly in myself that I didn't ask what a good configuration of lonnyo motors were. So statorade made the purchase work for me though dual is definitely ideal for that motor. Now dual motor again because going up the mountain from 6,000' elevation to 11,000 and the single motor just gets hotter and hotter and having to cruise really controlled and slow makes a ride longer than it should be to cover the same ground. I just hooked the second motor up Tues a week ago. Been working. Today I am heading up that mountain and really looking forward to faster cruising speeds
[2025-09-30T18:53:31] haku: no 30s maybe
[2025-09-30T18:54:23] haku: depends on budget cuts
[2025-09-30T18:54:46] Matthew: Damn! Yeah, your scooter puts some work in ü§Ø

[2025-10-01T19:02:03] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: we want the nami pieces
[2025-10-01T19:41:58] JPPL: Seven 18 yes .bin file and working firmware, seven 30, asking for .bin now and Will test it later if its working ok
[2025-10-01T19:42:08] JPPL: On The table
[2025-10-01T20:24:38] Matthew: Yeah, I had 16s 90 battery and ~6kw. I now have 180battery 330phase front and 130phase front and I think 12.6kw has been the highest reading I've had. 18s setup i had 110battery most I seen was 10.3kw. I didn't know how to explain to him that his max he sees is combined max when he kept telling me I was wrong.
[2025-10-01T20:51:09] Pandalgns: Guys, has anyone updated to version 6.06? Is it working for you? I have a friend who is having serious problems with two controllers and two motors, and we don't know where they're coming from or what's wrong... And he's doing the same thing with both controllers, testing on both motors. It seems strange to us that both have failed at the same time and both motors have the same problem, but he even changed from 6.06 to 6.05 and the problem persists.
[2025-10-01T20:57:25] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2025-10-01T20:59:00] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: resets factory settings
[2025-10-01T21:00:30] Pandalgns: This is what I'm telling you, doing motor recognition (1000w at 52v) it makes strange noises like the squeal of a train braking and it moves jerkily, apart from doing that, there comes a time when the recognition "ends" and motor statistics appear like... Phase amps 20.... Motor resistance 727 milliohms.... Inductance 10879.... And things like that
[2025-10-01T21:00:56] Pandalgns: We reset to factory when we started the recognition
[2025-10-01T21:01:48] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: put version 6.05 again
[2025-10-01T21:01:52] Pandalgns: The thing is that with the MKS84100, the front motor does that, and the rear motor does that, but we connect the 84200 and it does exactly the same thing on both motors, same problem, just like that, out of nowhere, because they felt like it.
[2025-10-01T21:02:12] Pandalgns: We put 6.05 on the 84200 and it still does the same thing
[2025-10-01T21:02:27] Pandalgns: We don't understand anything
[2025-10-01T21:02:52] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: sometimes it fails do it again
[2025-10-01T21:03:09] Pandalgns: We tried to do the reconnaissance like 5 times
[2025-10-01T21:03:12] Pandalgns: Y siempre lo mismo
[2025-10-01T21:03:48] Pandalgns: We even tried disconnecting halls, connecting them, disconnecting the screen that we bought, one of those three-button Flypsky types, and nothing works.
[2025-10-01T21:08:11] haku: me and my boy ready to roll up on them them bitches. you feel me dawgz.
[2025-10-01T21:08:24] haku: just need welded brakes. and and done deal
[2025-10-01T21:16:10] james: Hardware problems. Either dead esc or dead motor. Probably esc
[2025-10-01T21:19:09] Pandalgns: Both ESCs at the same time with the same problem? He used the scooter a week ago and it worked, and now it suddenly died.
[2025-10-01T21:19:49] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: the problem may be due to the cam
[2025-10-01T21:20:18] Maki Verem: I can buy some where big scooters without battery? Or just the frame
[2025-10-01T21:20:30] james: Do a full reset and run setup, without doing anything before doing setup
[2025-10-01T21:20:44] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Try to do what I told you, if it doesn't work, you know what James
[2025-10-01T21:20:45] Pandalgns: It is giving us the problem with them not joining by can
[2025-10-01T21:21:10] Pandalgns: What do you mean by hard reset??
[2025-10-01T21:21:11] james: This behavior we typically see when we are missing one of the three phases during detection
[2025-10-01T21:21:15] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I told him so üòã
[2025-10-01T21:21:33] james: Flash firmware is easiest way
[2025-10-01T21:21:38] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_26161@01-10-2025_21-21-38.jpg>
[2025-10-01T21:21:57] Pandalgns: We flashed the firmware like 5 times already
[2025-10-01T21:22:11] james: And it does this directly after flashing firmware?
[2025-10-01T21:22:48] james: And you sure you used the correct firmware to flash? If yes, then hardware issue. Check connections, check motor. If both are ok likely escs are damaged
[2025-10-01T21:22:52] Maki Verem: I dont want to spend 3 or 4k just to throw out the battery and the motors
[2025-10-01T21:23:18] Pandalgns: We just installed the original firmware 6.05, which is limited, and we just performed the recognition and it gives us those values.
[2025-10-01T21:23:56] james: try another motor
[2025-10-01T21:24:24] haku: alibaba. the world is your oyster
[2025-10-01T21:25:16] james: Too bad they won't comply with the license :(
[2025-10-01T21:25:26] Pandalgns: Ok give me a second we are trying something
[2025-10-01T21:25:58] Noname: Your a good dad but an annoying fuck elsewhere
[2025-10-01T21:35:13] haku: fuck off im good all around. a contributing human to society
[2025-10-01T21:36:25] haku: in the internet this is possible. IRL nono.
[2025-10-01T21:37:32] Pandalgns: Is there any kind of manual test that can be done to determine if the ESCs are burned out? Like measuring continuity between the negative and phases and things like that.
[2025-10-01T21:39:56] Pandalgns: After all the attempts, we did the last reconnaissance with the hall sensors disconnected and it was the photo I sent before, reconnected the hall sensors and now it has started working again out of nowhere... We don't understand anything.
[2025-10-01T21:40:08] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_26162@01-10-2025_21-40-08.jpg>
[2025-10-01T21:40:35] Maki Verem: Thanks i will take a look
[2025-10-01T21:41:37] james: Hall sensors shouldn't affect detection at all
[2025-10-01T21:41:55] Pandalgns: I know, that's why I don't understand anything
[2025-10-01T21:42:07] james: Check your phase cables, maybe one is damaged, shorting or something like that
[2025-10-01T21:42:22] james: Or slightly disconnected from somewhere
[2025-10-01T21:43:58] Pandalgns: He told me that no cable was in bad condition, what you can see of the cable outside the engine... We are now going to try the 84100 to download the firmware to 6.05 also from GitHub files from vedder directly
[2025-10-01T21:45:12] Pandalgns: Wish me luck
[2025-10-01T22:31:13] Crazy scoots: 85/150 -16s
[2025-10-01T23:13:21] ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ±: I have a friend who has 3 of them, both of them actually exploded and their capacitors went up in smoke.
[2025-10-01T23:20:35] IMWurden: guys, my steering damper before "activating" has a dead zone like this, is It normal?
[2025-10-01T23:31:56] JPPL: Seven 18?
[2025-10-01T23:32:26] JPPL: Tell me more details please, setup, how he setup it. Exploded while running?
[2025-10-02T02:18:45] Matthew: Have to use some high quality dampers to get rid of the deadzone. I have spent money on 3 different dampers and they're all junk before a month of riding is up. Returned for money back
[2025-10-02T02:19:40] Matthew: Theres many different brands. I just posted really quick a good brand
[2025-10-02T02:27:10] LiquorHole .: Till the sun explodes no sentient being is catching me spend 500 dollars on a damper
[2025-10-02T02:43:31] james: Swedish damper üëç
[2025-10-02T03:16:55] Arnau Martinez Casals: <photos/photo_26165@02-10-2025_03-16-55.jpg>
[2025-10-02T03:19:14] haku: get 4 cheapy dampers. it equals one of these
[2025-10-02T03:19:28] haku: like china slicks and pmt slicks
[2025-10-02T03:19:51] Arnau Martinez Casals: 11.8kw too far from 18
[2025-10-02T03:35:25] Nacho: Do you have a link for the android auto screen?
[2025-10-02T04:03:16] LiquorHole .: My prayers will stabilize me
[2025-10-02T04:17:40] Matthew: Can offset the 4... no more dead zoneü§£
[2025-10-02T04:18:32] Matthew: I finally installed speedforks on my g30lp... just got back from a ride. Yup... wish I did this way before now
[2025-10-02T04:19:46] Matthew: I spent like $90 on one and after the first week performance went downhill so fast. To me the deadzone slop was more dangerous than not having a damper.
[2025-10-02T04:23:34] haku: its all mental and spiritual
[2025-10-02T04:25:16] haku: ive never used a damper. so idk what quality feels on these
[2025-10-02T07:02:18] Matthew: The adjustability was great on the 3 I bought. And they all worked well for a week or less. I have never had one of these $250+ dampers. I have a cheap damper on my yume that seems to kinda do the job but again, its trash. I don't have much scooter experience though. I've only had 4. 2 are g30x. 1 yume. 1 Amazon special.
[2025-10-02T07:04:19] Matthew: G30lp monorim factory forks with a wide handlebar was better than trying to get a cheap damper to work. And now I tried speedforks this evening with my same wide handlebar and its a completely different ride. Definitely no damper needed at all.
[2025-10-02T07:25:32] haku: nice

[2025-10-05T19:58:21] Rose: Hey there arin, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-10-05T20:18:45] arin: hey, have anyone had issue with vesc not detecting second vesc over canbus? im using 2x MKSESC 84100hp
[2025-10-05T20:28:05] Pandalgns: It has happened to me
[2025-10-05T20:28:33] arin: how to resolve that issue üôè
[2025-10-05T20:29:26] Pandalgns: Did you connect the battery to one of the two controllers with the CAN bus cable connected between them when the XT connector sparked?
[2025-10-05T20:31:12] arin: no, i always connect vescs first and then power on the bms
[2025-10-05T20:31:28] arin: although, vescs were connected together when one exploded
[2025-10-05T20:31:38] arin: i hope its not fried up can transceiver tho..
[2025-10-05T20:31:53] Pandalgns: What???üò≥
[2025-10-05T20:32:59] arin: well
[2025-10-05T20:32:59] arin: <photos/photo_26170@05-10-2025_20-32-59.jpg>
[2025-10-05T20:32:59] arin: <photos/photo_26171@05-10-2025_20-32-59.jpg>
[2025-10-05T20:32:59] arin: <photos/photo_26172@05-10-2025_20-32-59.jpg>
[2025-10-05T20:33:17] arin: it exploded during motor calibration, no clue why
[2025-10-05T20:33:34] arin: now new one arrived and they arent discovering each other over canbus
[2025-10-05T20:35:37] Dimos: Is it makerbase?
[2025-10-05T20:35:42] Pandalgns: What the hell happened there?? üòÇüòÇ Barbecue
[2025-10-05T20:36:30] Pandalgns: Yes, they are the 84100hp, I have the same ones and they work perfectly, 0 problems.
[2025-10-05T20:36:57] Pandalgns: I have burned one and another 84200hp but due to my mistakes
[2025-10-05T20:37:13] Pandalgns: But I don't understand that thing about exploding in recognition.
[2025-10-05T20:37:27] arin: they explode a lot
[2025-10-05T20:37:35] arin: my friend has 3 fried up
[2025-10-05T20:37:46] Pandalgns: The CAN bus connection security system may have burned out.
[2025-10-05T20:37:58] arin: although completely not visible explosion.
[2025-10-05T20:38:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mks vibes
[2025-10-05T20:38:16] arin: just shorted out b+ with b- , 3 out of 6 fets shorted up
[2025-10-05T20:38:22] arin: yes thats what happened
[2025-10-05T20:38:26] arin: i just verified voltages
[2025-10-05T20:38:41] arin: the one that was connected when explosion occured has 0v differential
[2025-10-05T20:38:52] arin: new one has 1.27V differential between CANH and CANL üò≠
[2025-10-05T20:39:55] Pandalgns: Man... Let's see, if you set fire to a car's gas tank... It catches fire... These are things you shouldn't do üòÇüòÇüòÇ For safety reasons I try not to make those kinds of short circuits.
[2025-10-05T20:40:06] Pandalgns: That's the problem
[2025-10-05T20:40:21] Pandalgns: If you remove a resistor that is the security system, it works again.
[2025-10-05T20:40:48] arin: but i mean, for him they exploded after connecting the calibration "beep" and boom
[2025-10-05T20:41:03] Pandalgns: Although you are left without a security system and next time you directly burn the port and the can communication system
[2025-10-05T20:41:26] Pandalgns: ü§îü§î
[2025-10-05T20:41:36] Pandalgns: Rare but not impossible
[2025-10-05T20:41:38] arin: well, wont change much im not going to repair them anyway
[2025-10-05T20:42:13] Pandalgns: For the price they have, don't bother opening them, they are more work than they are worth.
[2025-10-05T20:42:28] arin: is there any schematic or board view?
[2025-10-05T20:42:46] Pandalgns: I removed that resistance from two of mine.
[2025-10-05T20:43:02] Pandalgns: Let me see if I can find the photo that I changed from my mobile phone and I lost some
[2025-10-05T20:43:10] arin: okay
[2025-10-05T20:47:11] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_26173@05-10-2025_20-47-11.jpg>
[2025-10-05T20:47:25] Pandalgns: If I'm not mistaken, it's the component that goes there in the middle.
[2025-10-05T20:48:16] Pandalgns: Anyway, before doing anything, try to find more information since I don't remember 100%.
[2025-10-05T20:59:40] arin: well i cant find it online anyway, lemme just remove that

[2025-10-05T22:10:54] Reekoz: Can you answer in private got a quick question before ordering
[2025-10-05T22:11:41] William Tremblay: Hey y'all, I know this sounds counterintuitive but is there any way to have a slow acceleration from the vesc settings wise?
[2025-10-05T22:12:32] Marius: less phase amps?
[2025-10-05T22:13:54] William Tremblay: I did that but I feel as if it's still rlly fast, did I just not lower it enough? Maybe I was more looking for some kind of acceleration curve somewhere if there is one? If not all good and thank you for the help
[2025-10-05T22:13:59] LiquorHole .: Not scared is because i dont wanna Think i have enough money and comes time to order and dont have enough money
[2025-10-05T22:17:35] arin: have you tried traction control?
[2025-10-05T22:17:57] Marius: lower it more? xd
[2025-10-05T22:18:04] William Tremblay: No? I didn't know that was an option? Where can I find that?
[2025-10-05T22:18:15] William Tremblay: LOL okay I will ty
[2025-10-05T22:19:00] arin: APP CFG -> ADC (or PPM) -> General -> Traction Control
[2025-10-05T22:19:16] LiquorHole .: If i sell my first scooter I could buy it from Lordgun right now
[2025-10-05T22:19:30] Noname: Dammit my stator died and putting out 10.8v so I found a work around for now 50ah battery lol.
[2025-10-05T22:19:52] William Tremblay: awesome tysm
[2025-10-05T22:20:20] arin: also you can play a bit with "Positive Ramping Time" in the same category as above
[2025-10-05T22:20:46] William Tremblay: How does it work?
[2025-10-05T22:21:10] Marius: its a delay from when you press throttle to when you get the full torque
[2025-10-05T22:22:07] William Tremblay: Gotchu gotchu awesome thank you guys so much!!
[2025-10-05T22:39:42] haku: wich stator?

[2025-10-06T16:05:23] Marius: no because nothing is touching it
[2025-10-06T16:05:30] Marius: if 2 touched then would be bad ig
[2025-10-06T16:05:49] Marius: its normal that it scratches somewhere when ur working on it
[2025-10-06T16:06:02] waak: yeah but i didn‚Äôt touch it
[2025-10-06T16:06:13] waak: motor been just laying for three weeks
[2025-10-06T16:06:21] Marius: then ly did it
[2025-10-06T16:06:51] Marius: ig u could put new one
[2025-10-06T16:07:43] waak: isn‚Äôt the enamel just here to protect from high temps ?
[2025-10-06T16:08:03] waak: as i think it shouldn‚Äôt change as it‚Äôs all just one wire right ?
[2025-10-06T16:08:04] Dualtron Achilleus: Protect from shortcut no

[2025-10-06T16:13:39] waak: yeah and from all other pictures i saw nobody has scratched winding and i just realised it now
[2025-10-06T16:16:03] Marius: i do
[2025-10-06T16:16:15] Marius: how would it do that
[2025-10-06T16:16:24] waak: we really are the black sheep you got tiny ass cables and i got raped cables
[2025-10-06T16:16:34] Marius: i think actually
[2025-10-06T16:16:51] Marius: i just cut them shorter or smth when i first did the motor so they would fit down there
[2025-10-06T16:17:08] Marius: i didnt know how much u can pull and twist on them until it fits, so i just cut them, was stupid
[2025-10-06T16:17:33] Marius: so yeah keep them as long as possible obviously
[2025-10-06T16:17:43] Marius: im smarter now
[2025-10-06T16:20:32] waak: we evolve
[2025-10-06T16:20:45] Marius: i evolved today
[2025-10-06T16:20:50] Marius: i think the gym is part of the matrix lowkey
[2025-10-06T16:20:53] Marius: so much money wasted on gas
[2025-10-06T16:20:59] Marius: i think ill stop going tbh

[2025-10-06T16:55:19] IMWurden: motor + rims price?
[2025-10-06T17:02:07] Pandalgns: I used it on occasion with the winding, just like @waak86 and also to cover the solder joints on some hall sensor boards and it works perfectly.
[2025-10-06T17:04:21] Dualtron Achilleus: 400‚Ç¨ negociable
[2025-10-06T17:13:25] Happy Giraffe: The max version maybe
[2025-10-06T17:14:12] haku: but 4040 pro and max is big difference in spindle power yea

[2025-10-06T18:35:08] LiquorHole .: Cable brakes
[2025-10-06T18:35:11] haku: right side mounting. get fucked
[2025-10-06T18:36:05] LiquorHole .: Rich man brakes are 6P brakes üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è no benefits just pure flex
[2025-10-06T18:40:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: I just hope you don't get 500$ brakes then use 10$ brake disc
[2025-10-06T18:43:17] haku: a real machinist will engineer his own calipers. just saying
[2025-10-06T18:43:32] haku: 5 piston
[2025-10-06T18:43:52] LiquorHole .: A real machinist will Build it in a cave
[2025-10-06T18:43:58] LiquorHole .: With a box of scraps
[2025-10-06T18:44:02] haku: 31 magnet stator. just saying
[2025-10-06T18:44:41] Edi Tion: Oh is the best for brake
[2025-10-06T18:45:17] haku: what?
[2025-10-06T18:45:53] haku: 4 piston on a 140 rotor on a peak g30 no good?
[2025-10-06T18:46:11] haku: 36v
[2025-10-06T18:50:01] Nobrrr: It‚Äôs somehow frightening

[2025-10-06T19:04:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: There's 6 piston actually
[2025-10-06T19:05:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don't think so üòÇ
[2025-10-06T19:05:23] LiquorHole .: Definitely not the best
[2025-10-06T19:05:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: What will you use?
[2025-10-06T19:05:36] LiquorHole .: Hope vented rotors are up there
[2025-10-06T19:05:44] LiquorHole .: If they werent so damn Big
[2025-10-06T19:06:13] haku: i know lol
[2025-10-06T19:06:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's not really good due to lack of thickness, easy to get bent
[2025-10-06T19:06:37] LiquorHole .: Not those
[2025-10-06T19:06:40] LiquorHole .: The 3.3mm rotors
[2025-10-06T19:07:26] haku: theres even dual 4 piston adapters wtf
[2025-10-06T19:07:40] LiquorHole .: <photos/photo_26182@06-10-2025_19-07-40.jpg>
[2025-10-06T19:07:54] LiquorHole .: These are literally the definition of Balls
[2025-10-06T19:08:10] LiquorHole .: But theyre just so big, not the most practical for racing
[2025-10-06T19:08:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: I know perfectly which one you mean
[2025-10-06T19:08:36] LiquorHole .: How they to thin?
[2025-10-06T19:08:54] haku: me? the tanke china brakes. my sons will fit magura flush
[2025-10-06T19:09:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: The middle is void
[2025-10-06T19:09:13] LiquorHole .: Oh
[2025-10-06T19:09:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vented disc on these thickness is just marketing
[2025-10-06T19:10:02] LiquorHole .: Your not gonna like what im about to tell you then
[2025-10-06T19:10:28] LiquorHole .: But itll have to be done
[2025-10-06T19:10:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nah however it's better than cheap china 10$ disc
[2025-10-06T19:10:49] LiquorHole .: Im stuck using the rotors i got in a crash with
[2025-10-06T19:11:11] LiquorHole .: The rear rotor is fine, The front Im not sure at All
[2025-10-06T19:11:47] LiquorHole .: Cause my 2 options right now is get rotors or forks and ill Much rather ride with shitty rotors then to not ride at all üò≠
[2025-10-06T19:12:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: You could just get cheaper brakes then a average brake discüòÇ
[2025-10-06T19:12:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: No sense super expensive caliper but cheap disc
[2025-10-06T21:41:06] Rose: Hey there M|R, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-10-06T23:47:47] Matthew: When having the slave vesc show telemetry is that rt/d a combination of both vesc displayed for amps and watts?
[2025-10-06T23:48:23] Marius: rt data shows combined watts and current
[2025-10-06T23:48:33] Marius: temp and speed are of the vesc u selected
[2025-10-06T23:48:53] Matthew: Awesome! For a minute there i was thinking I'm using way more power than it should if it wasnt split
[2025-10-07T02:50:37] luffydnoob: Guys I need help with flipsky ft85bd scooter doesn't go past 65kmh with 80a battery and 60a each motor phase sensorless also kick start is quite low compared to my brother scooter what could be the issue
[2025-10-07T02:50:37] luffydnoob: <photos/photo_26185@07-10-2025_02-50-37.jpg>
[2025-10-07T02:51:48] luffydnoob: Battery is made with n√≠quel cooper Sandwich
[2025-10-07T02:53:38] luffydnoob: 17s 7p battery configuration
[2025-10-07T04:44:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Low phase current
[2025-10-07T04:45:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway no one of us know how to use the ft85bd since it's a modified and closed version of vesc
[2025-10-07T07:28:34] luffydnoob: How much should I put then ?
[2025-10-07T07:37:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Around 150
[2025-10-07T07:38:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normally you set phase the double of the battery current
[2025-10-07T07:40:37] Marius: why
[2025-10-07T07:56:11] arin: cuz why not
[2025-10-07T07:56:36] arin: why do you limit phase current when you can set it to max and just limit battery current
[2025-10-07T07:58:40] Marius: why limit batt current that much
[2025-10-07T08:08:22] luffydnoob: Battery current is set to 100a and won't let me go past
[2025-10-07T08:08:57] luffydnoob: Motor phases is now set to 150 won't let me go past that neither
[2025-10-07T08:09:22] Patrick: Limited fw?
[2025-10-07T08:09:58] luffydnoob: What is that and how do I set it free ?
[2025-10-07T08:10:18] Patrick: Go to vedder firmware achive and search it
[2025-10-07T08:10:40] Patrick: But wouldnt trust a flipshit
[2025-10-07T08:14:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: I said normally, almost everyone does phase double of battery.
[2025-10-07T10:25:21] james: Impossible. It's not a vesc
[2025-10-07T10:30:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's still an vesc they just made it impossible to access haha
[2025-10-07T10:31:52] james: Yeah, they stole vesc code and ported it to some shitty clone mcu
[2025-10-07T10:32:10] james: Idk why they did it even. I can't imagine many people wanting to buy the crap üòÅ
[2025-10-07T11:25:34] Dualtron Achilleus: Someone selling velder?
[2025-10-07T11:29:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Idk if @TherealLizardDoggo sold his one
[2025-10-07T11:34:52] Finn: Still up for sale
[2025-10-07T12:32:29] luffydnoob: yassine

[2025-10-07T16:29:43] Happy Giraffe: Its a trim router and not a spindle Pro is ok but Max is more sturdy
[2025-10-07T16:47:26] arin: actually, isnt that normal speed for 17s battery?
[2025-10-07T16:47:31] haku: yea i notice they said it uses a rebranded makita router not a spindle. still doing research on these
[2025-10-07T16:48:29] arin: on 20s (120A phase, 200A abs, 80A battery) i had 95% duty (max) while going 81km/h
[2025-10-07T16:48:45] haku: is there a cnc milling telegram?
[2025-10-07T16:49:00] haku: <video_file>
[2025-10-07T16:49:12] haku: cut with a jigsaw. not good
[2025-10-07T17:18:44] Happy Giraffe: Next time just use hand saw and file to finishüòÅ
[2025-10-07T17:20:23] Noname: Next time look at the line when cutting
[2025-10-07T17:41:08] puneDir: I can help to fix
[2025-10-07T17:41:20] arin: its fixed already
[2025-10-07T17:42:28] arin: protection circuit burned out and locked up CAN, simple desoldering of that element fixed the issue
[2025-10-07T17:43:09] 'lekrsu': I mean it looks really good for a first try
[2025-10-07T17:44:14] puneDir: Yes that was what i will say
[2025-10-07T17:44:19] puneDir: üòÉ
[2025-10-07T17:44:29] puneDir: I did that like 10 times with my setup

[2025-10-07T18:09:44] Noname: Why tf does everyone need a personal radio these days? I could never listen to radio again and be perfectly insane as always
[2025-10-07T18:14:22] LiquorHole .: The radio is Utter ass
[2025-10-07T18:14:32] LiquorHole .: They been playing the SAME damn songs for a decade
[2025-10-07T18:14:47] Noname: 3 radios in my shop now, gonna snap
[2025-10-07T18:15:00] Noname: All the same music just different stations
[2025-10-07T18:15:42] Noname: Like 1 guy has to carry it with him wherever he goes lol
[2025-10-07T18:18:47] haku: not up to my standards unfortunately. it has to be redone
[2025-10-07T18:22:01] haku: i only deal in prescision engineering. flush fit everything
[2025-10-07T18:22:39] haku: put some earphones you fool
[2025-10-07T18:27:23] Noname: Hell no
[2025-10-07T18:31:29] Rose: Hey there Drix3e, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-10-07T20:16:06] Matthew: These fit g30 with ulip 10x3-6 tire the front brake cable though is too short even for factory g30lp steering stem. Shortening the front stem a bit would work. With speedforks the caliper clears the tires. But i have only been using the front brake since last week and resin pads it comes with are not up to the task for one disc and overheats getting fade from 50mph fast stop. Just place an order for sintered metal pads. They will arrive tomorrow and I will update. I am currently just using the cable/caliper setup that is longer meant for the rear rn.
[2025-10-07T21:20:40] Nobrrr: The one and only valid fardriver

[2025-10-07T22:43:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Sadly not alu pcb
[2025-10-07T22:44:05] Marius: does it fit in g30?
[2025-10-07T22:47:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: What is ulip 10x3, share licture
[2025-10-07T22:51:59] Maki Verem: Fardriver/votol or vesc? Which is better?
[2025-10-07T22:53:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Super high power fardriver
[2025-10-07T22:54:43] Maki Verem: Super high like above 20kw?
[2025-10-07T22:55:04] Maki Verem: I want max torque from 1rpm
[2025-10-07T22:56:38] Nobrrr: What else? But it‚Äôs bldc control right?
[2025-10-07T22:58:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: As it support field weakening, it's foc for sure. They just got a more reliable observer, less efficient but no tracking lost
[2025-10-07T22:58:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: 20kw still baby power üòÅ
[2025-10-07T23:12:52] Nobrrr: Do you know whats the usual power of those huge hub motors like this
[2025-10-07T23:12:53] Nobrrr: <video_file>
[2025-10-07T23:13:16] Nobrrr: The peak power these setups can output for a few seconds
[2025-10-07T23:24:37] Dualtron Achilleus: 90h 12‚Äô‚Äô motor is rates for 25kw nominal
[2025-10-07T23:24:47] Dualtron Achilleus: Its 75kw peak more or less

[2025-10-08T08:24:22] Maki Verem: https://spintend.com/collections/hubmotors/products/11-4000w-hubotor-for-diy-onewheel-diy-escooter Is this good for high torque, 84v setup?
[2025-10-08T08:35:14] Maki Verem: i dont want a hub motor 300$ above
[2025-10-08T08:37:54] Roby MacGyver: yes of course
[2025-10-08T09:08:49] Dualtron Achilleus: Small awg

[2025-10-08T15:54:14] Marius: in g30
[2025-10-08T17:13:36] K 63: Which one fits for g2
[2025-10-08T19:49:45] arin: doesnt matter what u buy
[2025-10-08T19:49:48] arin: they all explode the same way.
[2025-10-08T19:51:06] arin: mks 84100hp, mks 75100 v2 , spintend ubox 85V 100A around 15 failed units within 3 people
[2025-10-08T19:58:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: There's clearly a problem with you, like using over their claimed specs
[2025-10-08T20:05:29] Z: Will upgrading the teverun 7260r 60h motor to a 90h be a good upgrade on stock hardware?
[2025-10-08T20:06:38] james: No
[2025-10-08T20:07:09] Z: Even if it‚Äôs higher torque windings instead of 33x2?
[2025-10-08T20:07:21] james: It might not even work for what I know
[2025-10-08T20:07:31] james: Stock esc could be tuned to stock motor only
[2025-10-08T20:07:54] Z: Well I do see Lonnyo motor being used
[2025-10-08T20:07:57] james: Throw out the stock controllers at the same time instead
[2025-10-08T20:08:22] james: 60H ‚â† 90H
[2025-10-08T20:08:30] james: What factory produced them doesn't matter
[2025-10-08T20:08:38] Z: Oh okay
[2025-10-08T20:08:42] james: It might work, it might not work at all, depends on the esc
[2025-10-08T20:09:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Would be a better upgrade if you swap to vesc instead of changing the motors
[2025-10-08T20:09:51] Z: I do have another question. I do want to upgrade to Vesc but wanted to still use the frame LEDs for braking and such. How can that be programmed for Vesc?
[2025-10-08T20:10:53] james: Depends on how teverun made the lights circuitry. Some have all connected to the esc, others have separate module so everything works perfectly without esc
[2025-10-08T20:11:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Make an external circuit that control lights, and connect brake light only to vesc
[2025-10-08T20:11:20] Z: It does use a module for lights
[2025-10-08T20:11:35] 'lekrsu': Hey noi
[2025-10-08T20:13:02] arin: check if its connected directly to the esc or is standalone
[2025-10-08T20:14:14] Z: I understand this way. But wanting the traditional way of all lights turning red with brake lights
[2025-10-08T20:14:32] Z: Hey üëã
[2025-10-08T20:15:15] Z: LEDs connect to ivcu. The ivcu module then connects to controller
[2025-10-08T20:22:42] Matthew: This design and size. Disregard the healing gel

[2025-10-08T20:37:03] Marius: or did they change that
[2025-10-08T20:37:08] LiquorHole .: No idea
[2025-10-08T20:37:27] Marius: like u need to remove the whole cover on the top, and it makes it easy for air to get in so u need to bleed regularly
[2025-10-08T20:46:21] arin: they arent worth 90usd
[2025-10-08T20:47:14] arin: in poland my friend paid 50$ for a pair of them
[2025-10-08T20:47:17] arin: also from aliexpress
