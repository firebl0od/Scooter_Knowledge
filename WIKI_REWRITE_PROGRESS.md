- In-depth technical references

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Process for Each File
- [ ] Overview section added with clear context
- [ ] All technical specifications preserved
- [ ] All footnote citations maintained (exact same refs)
- [ ] Source line references intact
- [ ] Numbers and measurements accurate
- [ ] Brand names and model numbers correct
- [ ] Visual callouts added appropriately
- [ ] Related guides cross-referenced
- [ ] Tables/checklists added where helpful
- [ ] Step-by-step procedures for complex tasks

### No Knowledge Loss Verification
Every rewritten file verified to contain:
- 100% of original technical specifications
- All measurements and parameters
- All community attributions
- All source citations
- All model numbers and part numbers

## Approach Refinement

### What Works Well
1. **Start with shortest files** - Builds momentum, refines patterns
2. **Batch similar content** - Brand files together, guide types together
3. **Use templates** - Consistent structure speeds process
4. **Preserve citations first** - Extract footnotes, ensure they survive
5. **Add context liberally** - Explain "why" and "when", not just "what"

### Lessons Learned
1. **Time investment is significant** - Quality rewrites take 2-3 hours per file
2. **Technical accuracy is paramount** - Must verify every spec preserved
3. **Community voice matters** - Keep attributions and field experience notes
4. **Visual structure helps** - Tables, callouts, checklists improve scanability
5. **Cross-references add value** - Linking related content aids navigation

## Recommendations for Completion
