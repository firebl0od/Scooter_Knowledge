**Total**: 16 PRs containing approximately 1,224 lines of extracted knowledge

## Merge Recommendation

These PRs should be merged in order (oldest to newest, #158 through #173) to maintain chronological extraction progress. All PRs are documented as:
- Not requiring automated testing (documentation-only changes)
- Containing knowledge extraction from review files
- Updating extraction progress trackers

## What These PRs Contain

Each PR extracts knowledge from review files and distributes it across the processed guide and brand dossier files. The work includes:

1. **Extraction Progress Tracking**: Updates `*_extractprogress.md` files
2. **Knowledge Distribution**: Adds content to relevant guides in `knowledge/processed/themes/`
3. **Citation Management**: Maintains proper footnote references
4. **Thematic Organization**: Places content in appropriate guide or brand files

## Merge Process

**Note**: As an AI agent, I don't have GitHub credentials to merge PRs directly. The merge needs to be done by the repository owner.

### Option 1: Manual Merge via GitHub UI
1. Review each PR starting with #158
2. Click "Merge pull request" button
3. Continue with #159, #160, etc. in order

### Option 2: Command Line Merge
```bash
# For each PR starting with 158
gh pr checkout 158
gh pr merge 158 --squash --delete-branch

# Repeat for 159-173
```

### Option 3: Bulk Merge Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for pr in {158..173}; do
  echo "Merging PR #$pr..."
  gh pr merge $pr --squash --delete-branch --auto
done
```

## Expected Outcome

After merging all 16 PRs:
- **1,224+ additional lines** of knowledge extracted and organized
- **16 review files** will show updated extraction progress
- **Multiple processed guides** will be enhanced with new content
- **Extraction completion rate** will increase from 44% to approximately 54%

## Impact on Repository

### Files Updated
- **Review progress files**: 16 `*_extractprogress.md` files updated
- **Processed guides**: ~40+ guide files enhanced
- **Brand dossiers**: ~15+ brand files enhanced

### Knowledge Areas Improved
- Controller setup and tuning
- Battery architecture and BMS integration
- Motor cooling and thermal management
- Chassis fitment and modifications
- Field weakening configuration
- Brake and safety systems
- Accessory integration
- Platform-specific guides (Vsett, Kaabo, etc.)

## No Conflicts Expected

All PRs are based on the same main branch (commit `a81df62`) and work on different sections of review files, so merge conflicts are unlikely. Each PR updates:
- Different line ranges in review files
- Different sections of processed guides
- Independent extraction progress trackers

## After Merging

Once all PRs are merged, the next extraction session can continue with:
- High priority files (denis_all_part02, all_part01, input_part001)
- Remaining medium and low priority files
- Updated EXTRACTION_STATUS.md to reflect new progress

**Action Required**: Please merge PRs #158-173 in order to integrate the extracted knowledge into the main branch.
